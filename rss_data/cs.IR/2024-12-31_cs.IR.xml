      <title>Invariant debiasing learning for recommendation via biased imputation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous debiasing studies utilize unbiased data to make supervision of model training. They suffer from the high trial risks and experimental costs to obtain unbiased data. Recent research attempts to use invariant learning to detach the invariant preference of users for unbiased recommendations in an unsupervised way. However, it faces the drawbacks of low model accuracy and unstable prediction performance due to the losing cooperation with variant preference. In this paper, we experimentally demonstrate that invariant learning causes information loss by directly discarding the variant information, which reduces the generalization ability and results in the degradation of model performance in unbiased recommendations. Based on this consideration, we propose a novel lightweight knowledge distillation framework (KDDebias) to automatically learn the unbiased preference of users from both invariant and variant information. Specifically, the variant information is imputed to the invariant user preference in the distance-aware knowledge distillation process. Extensive experiments on three public datasets, i.e., Yahoo!R3, Coat, and MIND, show that with the biased imputation from the variant preference of users, our proposed method achieves significant improvements with less than 50% learning parameters compared to the SOTA unsupervised debiasing model in recommender systems.

      <title>A Contrastive Pretrain Model with Prompt Tuning for Multi-center Medication Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medication recommendation is one of the most critical health-related applications, which has attracted extensive research interest recently. Most existing works focus on a single hospital with abundant medical data. However, many small hospitals only have a few records, which hinders applying existing medication recommendation works to the real world. Thus, we seek to explore a more practical setting, i.e., multi-center medication recommendation. In this setting, most hospitals have few records, but the total number of records is large. Though small hospitals may benefit from total affluent records, it is also faced with the challenge that the data distributions between various hospitals are much different. In this work, we introduce a novel conTrastive prEtrain Model with Prompt Tuning (TEMPT) for multi-center medication recommendation, which includes two stages of pretraining and finetuning. We first design two self-supervised tasks for the pretraining stage to learn general medical knowledge. They are mask prediction and contrastive tasks, which extract the intra- and inter-relationships of input diagnosis and procedures. Furthermore, we devise a novel prompt tuning method to capture the specific information of each hospital rather than adopting the common finetuning. On the one hand, the proposed prompt tuning can better learn the heterogeneity of each hospital to fit various distributions. On the other hand, it can also relieve the catastrophic forgetting problem of finetuning. To validate the proposed model, we conduct extensive experiments on the public eICU, a multi-center medical dataset. The experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of our model. The implementation code is available to ease the reproducibility https://github.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/TEMPT.</description>

      <title>Topic-Aware Knowledge Graph with Large Language Models for Interoperability in Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of knowledge graphs in recommender systems has become one of the common approaches to addressing data sparsity and cold start problems. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new possibilities for processing side and context information within knowledge graphs. However, consistent integration across various systems remains challenging due to the need for domain expert intervention and differences in system characteristics. To address these issues, we propose a consistent approach that extracts both general and specific topics from both side and context information using LLMs. First, general topics are iteratively extracted and updated from side information. Then, specific topics are extracted using context information. Finally, to address synonymous topics generated during the specific topic extraction process, a refining algorithm processes and resolves these issues effectively. This approach allows general topics to capture broad knowledge across diverse item characteristics, while specific topics emphasize detailed attributes, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the semantic features of items and the preferences of users. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in recommendation performance across diverse knowledge graphs.</description>

      <title>Introducing Semantic Capability in LinkedIn's Content Search Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past, most search queries issued to a search engine were short and simple. A keyword based search engine was able to answer such queries quite well. However, members are now developing the habit of issuing long and complex natural language queries. Answering such queries requires evolution of a search engine to have semantic capability. In this paper we present the design of LinkedIn's new content search engine with semantic capability, and its impact on metrics.</description>

      <title>AmalREC: A Dataset for Relation Extraction and Classification Leveraging Amalgamation of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing datasets for relation classification and extraction often exhibit limitations such as restricted relation types and domain-specific biases. This work presents a generic framework to generate well-structured sentences from given tuples with the help of Large Language Models (LLMs). This study has focused on the following major questions: (i) how to generate sentences from relation tuples, (ii) how to compare and rank them, (iii) can we combine strengths of individual methods and amalgamate them to generate an even bette quality of sentences, and (iv) how to evaluate the final dataset? For the first question, we employ a multifaceted 5-stage pipeline approach, leveraging LLMs in conjunction with template-guided generation. We introduce Sentence Evaluation Index(SEI) that prioritizes factors like grammatical correctness, fluency, human-aligned sentiment, accuracy, and complexity to answer the first part of the second question. To answer the second part of the second question, this work introduces a SEI-Ranker module that leverages SEI to select top candidate generations. The top sentences are then strategically amalgamated to produce the final, high-quality sentence. Finally, we evaluate our dataset on LLM-based and SOTA baselines for relation classification. The proposed dataset features 255 relation types, with 15K sentences in the test set and around 150k in the train set organized in, significantly enhancing relational diversity and complexity. This work not only presents a new comprehensive benchmark dataset for RE/RC task, but also compare different LLMs for generation of quality sentences from relational tuples.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised dense retrieval with conterfactual contrastive learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficiently retrieving a concise set of candidates from a large document corpus remains a pivotal challenge in Information Retrieval (IR). Neural retrieval models, particularly dense retrieval models built with transformers and pretrained language models, have been popular due to their superior performance. However, criticisms have also been raised on their lack of explainability and vulnerability to adversarial attacks. In response to these challenges, we propose to improve the robustness of dense retrieval models by enhancing their sensitivity of fine-graned relevance signals. A model achieving sensitivity in this context should exhibit high variances when documents' key passages determining their relevance to queries have been modified, while maintaining low variances for other changes in irrelevant passages. This sensitivity allows a dense retrieval model to produce robust results with respect to attacks that try to promote documents without actually increasing their relevance. It also makes it possible to analyze which part of a document is actually relevant to a query, and thus improve the explainability of the retrieval model. Motivated by causality and counterfactual analysis, we propose a series of counterfactual regularization methods based on game theory and unsupervised learning with counterfactual passages. Experiments show that, our method can extract key passages without reliance on the passage-level relevance annotations. Moreover, the regularized dense retrieval models exhibit heightened robustness against adversarial attacks, surpassing the state-of-the-art anti-attack methods.</description>

      <title>ERPA: Efficient RPA Model Integrating OCR and LLMs for Intelligent Document Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents ERPA, an innovative Robotic Process Automation (RPA) model designed to enhance ID data extraction and optimize Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tasks within immigration workflows. Traditional RPA solutions often face performance limitations when processing large volumes of documents, leading to inefficiencies. ERPA addresses these challenges by incorporating Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve the accuracy and clarity of extracted text, effectively handling ambiguous characters and complex structures. Benchmark comparisons with leading platforms like UiPath and Automation Anywhere demonstrate that ERPA significantly reduces processing times by up to 94 percent, completing ID data extraction in just 9.94 seconds. These findings highlight ERPA's potential to revolutionize document automation, offering a faster and more reliable alternative to current RPA solutions.</description>

      <title>Left-handed representation in top 100 male professional tennis players: Multi-disciplinary perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A commonly held opinion is that left-handed tennis players are overrepresented compared to the percentage of left-handers within the general population. This study provides the domain insights supported by data analysis that could help inform the decision of parents and coaches considering whether a child should start playing tennis as left- or right-handed when there is no strong arm-handed dominance. Compared to the commonly cited figure of about 10% of left-handed male population, data analysis from the official ATP web site for the top 100 ranked tennis players over the past decades (1985-2016) shows evidence of overrepresentation of left-handed elite tennis players (about 15%). The insights and data analysis can inform the handedness decision, advance coaching and strategic game concepts, enhance media coverage/analytics, left-handed facts and statistics, and inform tennis equipment manufacturing.</description>

      <title>Comparative Performance of Advanced NLP Models and LLMs in Multilingual Geo-Entity Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) methodologies and Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly enhanced the extraction and analysis of geospatial data from multilingual texts, impacting sectors such as national and international security. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of leading NLP models -- SpaCy, XLM-RoBERTa, mLUKE, GeoLM -- and LLMs, specifically OpenAI's GPT 3.5 and GPT 4, within the context of multilingual geo-entity detection. Utilizing datasets from Telegram channels in English, Russian, and Arabic, we examine the performance of these models through metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores, to assess their effectiveness in accurately identifying geospatial references. The analysis exposes each model's distinct advantages and challenges, underscoring the complexities involved in achieving precise geo-entity identification across varied linguistic landscapes. The conclusions drawn from this experiment aim to direct the enhancement and creation of more advanced and inclusive NLP tools, thus advancing the field of geospatial analysis and its application to global security.</description>

      <title>Ontology-grounded Automatic Knowledge Graph Construction by LLM under Wikidata schema</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an ontology-grounded approach to Knowledge Graph (KG) construction using Large Language Models (LLMs) on a knowledge base. An ontology is authored by generating Competency Questions (CQ) on knowledge base to discover knowledge scope, extracting relations from CQs, and attempt to replace equivalent relations by their counterpart in Wikidata. To ensure consistency and interpretability in the resulting KG, we ground generation of KG with the authored ontology based on extracted relations. Evaluation on benchmark datasets demonstrates competitive performance in knowledge graph construction task. Our work presents a promising direction for scalable KG construction pipeline with minimal human intervention, that yields high quality and human-interpretable KGs, which are interoperable with Wikidata semantics for potential knowledge base expansion.</description>

      <title>Rise of Generative Artificial Intelligence in Science</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI, generative AI) has rapidly become available as a tool in scientific research. To explore the use of generative AI in science, we conduct an empirical analysis using OpenAlex. Analyzing GenAI publications and other AI publications from 2017 to 2023, we profile growth patterns, the diffusion of GenAI publications across fields of study, and the geographical spread of scientific research on generative AI. We also investigate team size and international collaborations to explore whether GenAI, as an emerging scientific research area, shows different collaboration patterns compared to other AI technologies. The results indicate that generative AI has experienced rapid growth and increasing presence in scientific publications. The use of GenAI now extends beyond computer science to other scientific research domains. Over the study period, U.S. researchers contributed nearly two-fifths of global GenAI publications. The U.S. is followed by China, with several small and medium-sized advanced economies demonstrating relatively high levels of GenAI deployment in their research publications. Although scientific research overall is becoming increasingly specialized and collaborative, our results suggest that GenAI research groups tend to have slightly smaller team sizes than found in other AI fields. Furthermore, notwithstanding recent geopolitical tensions, GenAI research continues to exhibit levels of international collaboration comparable to other AI technologies.</description>

      <title>Towards Identity-Aware Cross-Modal Retrieval: a Dataset and a Baseline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly enhanced content-based retrieval methods, notably through models like CLIP that map images and texts into a shared embedding space. However, these methods often struggle with domain-specific entities and long-tail concepts absent from their training data, particularly in identifying specific individuals. In this paper, we explore the task of identity-aware cross-modal retrieval, which aims to retrieve images of persons in specific contexts based on natural language queries. This task is critical in various scenarios, such as for searching and browsing personalized video collections or large audio-visual archives maintained by national broadcasters. We introduce a novel dataset, COCO Person FaceSwap (COCO-PFS), derived from the widely used COCO dataset and enriched with deepfake-generated faces from VGGFace2. This dataset addresses the lack of large-scale datasets needed for training and evaluating models for this task. Our experiments assess the performance of different CLIP variations repurposed for this task, including our architecture, Identity-aware CLIP (Id-CLIP), which achieves competitive retrieval performance through targeted fine-tuning. Our contributions lay the groundwork for more robust cross-modal retrieval systems capable of recognizing long-tail identities and contextual nuances. Data and code are available at https://github.com/mesnico/IdCLIP.</description>

      <title>Multi-Grained Preference Enhanced Transformer for Multi-Behavior Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation (SR) aims to predict the next purchasing item according to users' dynamic preference learned from their historical user-item interactions. To improve the performance of recommendation, learning dynamic heterogeneous cross-type behavior dependencies is indispensable for recommender system. However, there still exists some challenges in Multi-Behavior Sequential Recommendation (MBSR). On the one hand, existing methods only model heterogeneous multi-behavior dependencies at behavior-level or item-level, and modelling interaction-level dependencies is still a challenge. On the other hand, the dynamic multi-grained behavior-aware preference is hard to capture in interaction sequences, which reflects interaction-aware sequential pattern. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Multi-Grained Preference enhanced Transformer framework (M-GPT). First, M-GPT constructs a interaction-level graph of historical cross-typed interactions in a sequence. Then graph convolution is performed to derive interaction-level multi-behavior dependency representation repeatedly, in which the complex correlation between historical cross-typed interactions at specific orders can be well learned. Secondly, a novel multi-scale transformer architecture equipped with multi-grained user preference extraction is proposed to encode the interaction-aware sequential pattern enhanced by capturing temporal behavior-aware multi-grained preference . Experiments on the real-world datasets indicate that our method M-GPT consistently outperforms various state-of-the-art recommendation methods.</description>

      <title>Zero-Indexing Internet Search Augmented Generation for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation has emerged as an effective method to enhance large language model performance. This approach typically relies on an internal retrieval module that uses various indexing mechanisms to manage a static pre-processed corpus. However, such a paradigm often falls short when it is necessary to integrate the most up-to-date information that has not been updated into the corpus during generative inference time. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach that leverages standard search engine APIs to dynamically integrate the latest online information (without maintaining any index for any fixed corpus), thereby improving the quality of generated content. We design a collaborative LLM-based paradigm, where we include: (i) a parser-LLM that determines if the Internet augmented generation is demanded and extracts the search keywords if so with a single inference; (ii) a mixed ranking strategy that re-ranks the retrieved HTML files to eliminate bias introduced from the search engine API; and (iii) an extractor-LLM that can accurately and efficiently extract relevant information from the fresh content in each HTML file. We conduct extensive empirical studies to evaluate the performance of this Internet search augmented generation paradigm. The experimental results demonstrate that our method generates content with significantly improved quality. Our system has been successfully deployed in a production environment to serve 01.AI's generative inference requests.</description>

      <title>Molar: Multimodal LLMs with Collaborative Filtering Alignment for Enhanced Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation (SR) systems have evolved significantly over the past decade, transitioning from traditional collaborative filtering to deep learning approaches and, more recently, to large language models (LLMs). While the adoption of LLMs has driven substantial advancements, these models inherently lack collaborative filtering information, relying primarily on textual content data neglecting other modalities and thus failing to achieve optimal recommendation performance. To address this limitation, we propose Molar, a Multimodal large language sequential recommendation framework that integrates multiple content modalities with ID information to capture collaborative signals effectively. Molar employs an MLLM to generate unified item representations from both textual and non-textual data, facilitating comprehensive multimodal modeling and enriching item embeddings. Additionally, it incorporates collaborative filtering signals through a post-alignment mechanism, which aligns user representations from content-based and ID-based models, ensuring precise personalization and robust performance. By seamlessly combining multimodal content with collaborative filtering insights, Molar captures both user interests and contextual semantics, leading to superior recommendation accuracy. Extensive experiments validate that Molar significantly outperforms traditional and LLM-based baselines, highlighting its strength in utilizing multimodal data and collaborative signals for sequential recommendation tasks.

      <title>From Interests to Insights: An LLM Approach to Course Recommendations Using Natural Language Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most universities in the United States encourage their students to explore academic areas before declaring a major and to acquire academic breadth by satisfying a variety of requirements. Each term, students must choose among many thousands of offerings, spanning dozens of subject areas, a handful of courses to take. The curricular environment is also dynamic, and poor communication and search functions on campus can limit a student's ability to discover new courses of interest. To support both students and their advisers in such a setting, we explore a novel Large Language Model (LLM) course recommendation system that applies a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) method to the corpus of course descriptions. The system first generates an 'ideal' course description based on the user's query. This description is converted into a search vector using embeddings, which is then used to find actual courses with similar content by comparing embedding similarities. We describe the method and assess the quality and fairness of some example prompts. Steps to deploy a pilot system on campus are discussed.</description>

      <title>Is ChatGPT Good at Search? Investigating Large Language Models as Re-Ranking Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09542v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot generalization across various language-related tasks, including search engines. However, existing work utilizes the generative ability of LLMs for Information Retrieval (IR) rather than direct passage ranking. The discrepancy between the pre-training objectives of LLMs and the ranking objective poses another challenge. In this paper, we first investigate generative LLMs such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 for relevance ranking in IR. Surprisingly, our experiments reveal that properly instructed LLMs can deliver competitive, even superior results to state-of-the-art supervised methods on popular IR benchmarks. Furthermore, to address concerns about data contamination of LLMs, we collect a new test set called NovelEval, based on the latest knowledge and aiming to verify the model's ability to rank unknown knowledge. Finally, to improve efficiency in real-world applications, we delve into the potential for distilling the ranking capabilities of ChatGPT into small specialized models using a permutation distillation scheme. Our evaluation results turn out that a distilled 440M model outperforms a 3B supervised model on the BEIR benchmark. The code to reproduce our results is available at www.github.com/sunnweiwei/RankGPT.</description>

      <title>Beyond RMSE and MAE: Introducing EAUC to unmask hidden bias and unfairness in dyadic regression models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10690v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dyadic regression models, which output real-valued predictions for pairs of entities, are fundamental in many domains (e.g. obtaining user-product ratings in Recommender Systems) and promising and under exploration in others (e.g. tuning patient-drug dosages in personalized pharmacology). In this work, we prove that non-uniform observed value distributions of individual entities lead to severe biases in state-of-the-art models, skewing predictions towards the average of observed past values for the entity and providing worse-than-random predictive power in eccentric yet crucial cases; we name this phenomenon eccentricity bias. We show that global error metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are insufficient to capture this bias, and we introduce Eccentricity-Area Under the Curve (EAUC) as a novel complementary metric that can quantify it in all studied domains and models. We prove the intuitive interpretation of EAUC by experimenting with naive post-training bias corrections, and theorize other options to use EAUC to guide the construction of fair models. This work contributes a bias-aware evaluation of dyadic regression to prevent unfairness in critical real-world applications of such systems.</description>

      <title>Beyond KAN: Introducing KarSein for Adaptive High-Order Feature Interaction Modeling in CTR Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08713v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling feature interactions is crucial for click-through rate (CTR) prediction, particularly when it comes to high-order explicit interactions. Traditional methods struggle with this task because they often predefine a maximum interaction order, which relies heavily on prior knowledge and can limit the model's effectiveness. Additionally, modeling high-order interactions typically leads to increased computational costs. Therefore, the challenge lies in adaptively modeling high-order feature interactions while maintaining efficiency. To address this issue, we introduce Kolmogorov-Arnold Represented Sparse Efficient Interaction Network (KarSein), designed to optimize both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. We firstly identify limitations of directly applying Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) to CTR and then introduce KarSein to overcome these issues. It features a novel architecture that reduces the computational costs of KAN and supports embedding vectors as feature inputs. Additionally, KarSein employs guided symbolic regression to address the challenge of KAN in spontaneously learning multiplicative relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate KarSein's superior performance, achieving significant predictive accuracy with minimal computational overhead. Furthermore, KarSein maintains strong global explainability while enabling the removal of redundant features, resulting in a sparse network structure. These advantages also position KarSein as a promising method for efficient inference.</description>

      <title>The Design of an LLM-powered Unstructured Analytics System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00847v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLMs demonstrate an uncanny ability to process unstructured data, and as such, have the potential to go beyond search and run complex, semantic analyses at scale. We describe the design of an unstructured analytics system, Aryn, and the tenets and use cases that motivate its design. With Aryn, users specify queries in natural language and the system automatically determines a semantic plan and executes it to compute an answer from a large collection of unstructured documents. At the core of Aryn is Sycamore, a declarative document processing engine, that provides a reliable distributed abstraction called DocSets. Sycamore allows users to analyze, enrich, and transform complex documents at scale. Aryn includes Luna, a query planner that translates natural language queries to Sycamore scripts, and DocParse, which takes raw PDFs and document images, and converts them to DocSets for downstream processing. We show how these pieces come together to achieve better accuracy than RAG on analytics queries over real world reports from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). Also, given current limitations of LLMs, we argue that an analytics system must provide explainability to be practical, and show how Aryn's user interface does this to help build trust.</description>

      <title>DV-FSR: A Dual-View Target Attack Framework for Federated Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated recommendation (FedRec) preserves user privacy by enabling decentralized training of personalized models, but this architecture is inherently vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Significant research has been conducted on targeted attacks in FedRec systems, motivated by commercial and social influence considerations. However, much of this work has largely overlooked the differential robustness of recommendation models. Moreover, our empirical findings indicate that existing targeted attack methods achieve only limited effectiveness in Federated Sequential Recommendation (FSR) tasks. Driven by these observations, we focus on investigating targeted attacks in FSR and propose a novel dualview attack framework, named DV-FSR. This attack method uniquely combines a sampling-based explicit strategy with a contrastive learning-based implicit gradient strategy to orchestrate a coordinated attack. Additionally, we introduce a specific defense mechanism tailored for targeted attacks in FSR, aiming to evaluate the mitigation effects of the attack method we proposed. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach on representative sequential models.</description>

      <title>Segment Discovery: Enhancing E-commerce Targeting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern e-commerce services frequently target customers with incentives or interventions to engage them in their products such as games, shopping, video streaming, etc. This customer engagement increases acquisition of more customers and retention of existing ones, leading to more business for the company while improving customer experience. Often, customers are either randomly targeted or targeted based on the propensity of desirable behavior. However, such policies can be suboptimal as they do not target the set of customers who would benefit the most from the intervention and they may also not take account of any constraints. In this paper, we propose a policy framework based on uplift modeling and constrained optimization that identifies customers to target for a use-case specific intervention so as to maximize the value to the business, while taking account of any given constraints. We demonstrate improvement over state-of-the-art targeting approaches using two large-scale experimental studies and a production implementation.</description>

      <title>Collaborative filtering based on nonnegative/binary matrix factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collaborative filtering generates recommendations based on user-item similarities through rating data, which may involve numerous unrated items. To predict scores for unrated items, matrix factorization techniques, such as nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), are often employed to predict scores for unrated items. Nonnegative/binary matrix factorization (NBMF), which is an extension of NMF, approximates a nonnegative matrix as the product of nonnegative and binary matrices. Previous studies have employed NBMF for image analysis where the data were dense. In this paper, we propose a modified NBMF algorithm that can be applied to collaborative filtering where data are sparse. In the modified method, unrated elements in a rating matrix are masked, which improves the collaborative filtering performance. Utilizing a low-latency Ising machine in NBMF is advantageous in terms of the computation time, making the proposed method beneficial.</description>

      <title>Freshness and Informativity Weighted Cognitive Extent and Its Correlation with Cumulative Citation Count</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit cognitive extent, originally defined as the number of unique phrases in a quota. We introduce Freshness and Informative Weighted Cognitive Extent (FICE), calculated based on two novel weighting factors, the lifetime ratio and informativity of scientific entities. We model the lifetime of each scientific entity as the time-dependent document frequency, which is fit by the composition of multiple Gaussian profiles. The lifetime ratio is then calculated as the cumulative document frequency at the publication time $t_0$ divided by the cumulative document frequency over its entire lifetime. The informativity is calculated by normalizing the document frequency across all scientific entities recognized in a title. Using the ACL Anthology, we verified the trend formerly observed in several other domains that the number of unique scientific entities per quota increased gradually at a slower rate. We found that FICE exhibits a strong correlation with the average cumulative citation count within a quota.

      <title>Cluster-Enhanced Federated Graph Neural Network for Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Personal interaction data can be effectively modeled as individual graphs for each user in recommender systems.Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)-based recommendation techniques have become extremely popular since they can capture high-order collaborative signals between users and items by aggregating the individual graph into a global interactive graph.However, this centralized approach inherently poses a threat to user privacy and security. Recently, federated GNN-based recommendation techniques have emerged as a promising solution to mitigate privacy concerns. Nevertheless, current implementations either limit on-device training to an unaccompanied individual graphs or necessitate reliance on an extra third-party server to touch other individual graphs, which also increases the risk of privacy leakage. To address this challenge, we propose a Cluster-enhanced Federated Graph Neural Network framework for Recommendation, named CFedGR, which introduces high-order collaborative signals to augment individual graphs in a privacy preserving manner. Specifically, the server clusters the pretrained user representations to identify high-order collaborative signals. In addition, two efficient strategies are devised to reduce communication between devices and the server. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Cluster-guided Contrastive Class-imbalanced Graph Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of class-imbalanced graph classification, which aims at effectively classifying the graph categories in scenarios with imbalanced class distributions. While graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success, their modeling ability on imbalanced graph-structured data remains suboptimal, which typically leads to predictions biased towards the majority classes. On the other hand, existing class-imbalanced learning methods in vision may overlook the rich graph semantic substructures of the majority classes and excessively emphasize learning from the minority classes. To address these challenges, we propose a simple yet powerful approach called C$^3$GNN that integrates the idea of clustering into contrastive learning to enhance class-imbalanced graph classification. Technically, C$^3$GNN clusters graphs from each majority class into multiple subclasses, with sizes comparable to the minority class, mitigating class imbalance. It also employs the Mixup technique to generate synthetic samples, enriching the semantic diversity of each subclass. Furthermore, supervised contrastive learning is used to hierarchically learn effective graph representations, enabling the model to thoroughly explore semantic substructures in majority classes while avoiding excessive focus on minority classes. Extensive experiments on real-world graph benchmark datasets verify the superior performance of our proposed method against competitive baselines.</description>

      <title>LLM-assisted Vector Similarity Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As data retrieval demands become increasingly complex, traditional search methods often fall short in addressing nuanced and conceptual queries. Vector similarity search has emerged as a promising technique for finding semantically similar information efficiently. However, its effectiveness diminishes when handling intricate queries with contextual nuances. This paper explores a hybrid approach combining vector similarity search with Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance search accuracy and relevance. The proposed two-step solution first employs vector similarity search to shortlist potential matches, followed by an LLM for context-aware ranking of the results. Experiments on structured datasets demonstrate that while vector similarity search alone performs well for straightforward queries, the LLM-assisted approach excels in processing complex queries involving constraints, negations, or conceptual requirements. By leveraging the natural language understanding capabilities of LLMs, this method improves the accuracy of search results for complex tasks without sacrificing efficiency. We also discuss real-world applications and propose directions for future research to refine and scale this technique for diverse datasets and use cases.
