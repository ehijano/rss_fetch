      <title>Traces left by random walks on large random graphs: local limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we develop a theory for understanding the traces left by a random walk in the vicinity of a randomly chosen reference vertex. The analysis is related to interlacements but goes beyond previous research by showing weak limit theorems for the vicinity around the reference vertex together with the path segments of the random walk in this vicinity. Roughly speaking, our limit theorem requires appropriate mixing properties for the random walk together with a stronger variant of Benjamini-Schramm convergence for the underlying graph model. If these assumptions are satisfied, the limiting object can be explicitly given in terms of the Benjamini-Schramm limit of the graph model.</description>

      <title>Subexponential lower bounds for $f$-ergodic Markov processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a criterion for establishing lower bound on the rate of convergence in $f$-variations of an ergodic Markov processes to its invariant measure. The criterion consists of super and submartingale conditions for certain functionals of the Markov process. Our results complement the existing literature on the stability of Markov processes, based on Lyapunov drift conditions, which primarily focuses on upper bounds. We apply our theory to elliptic diffusions, L\'evy-driven Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes and hypoelliptic stochastic Hamiltonian models with known polynomial/stretched exponential upper bounds on their rates of convergence. Our lower bounds match asymptotically the known upper bounds for these classes of models, establishing their rate of convergence to stationarity.</description>

      <title>Lecture notes on stationary critical and super-critical SPDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of these lecture notes is to present recent results regarding the large-scale behaviour of critical and super-critical non-linear stochastic PDEs, that fall outside the realm of the theory of Regularity Structures. These include the two-dimensional Anisotropic KPZ equation, the stochastic Burgers equation in dimension $d\ge 2$ and the stochastic Navier-Stokes equation with divergence-free noise in dimension $d=2$. Rather than providing complete proofs, we try to emphasise the main ideas, and some crucial aspects of our approach: the role of the generator equation and of the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem to identify the limit process; Wiener chaos decomposition with respect to the stationary measure and its truncation; and the so-called Replacement Lemma, which controls the weak coupling limit of the equations in the critical dimension and identifies the limiting diffusivity. For pedagogical reasons, we will focus exclusively on the stochastic Burgers equation. The notes are based on works in collaboration with Dirk Erhard and Massimiliano Gubinelli.</description>

      <title>Deep learning scheme for forward utilities using ergodic BSDEs *</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a probabilistic numerical method for a class of forward utilities in a stochastic factor model. For this purpose, we use the representation of dynamic consistent utilities with mean of ergodic Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (eBSDEs) introduced by Liang and Zariphopoulou in [27]. We establish a connection between the solution of the ergodic BSDE and the solution of an associated BSDE with random terminal time $\tau$ , defined as the hitting time of the positive recurrent stochastic factor V . The viewpoint based on BSDEs with random horizon yields a new characterization of the ergodic cost $\lambda$ which is a part of the solution of the eBSDEs. In particular, for a certain class of eBSDEs with quadratic generator, the Cole-Hopf transform leads to a semi-explicit representation of the solution as well as a new expression of the ergodic cost $\lambda$. The latter can be estimated with Monte Carlo methods. We also propose two new deep learning numerical schemes for eBSDEs, where the ergodic cost $\lambda$ is optimized according to a loss function at the random horizon $\tau$ or taking into account the whole trajectory. Finally, we present numerical results for different examples of eBSDEs and forward utilities along with the associated investment strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a stochastically monotone Markov chain taking values in a Polish space, we present a number of conditions for existence and for uniqueness of its stationary regime, as well as for closeness of its transient trajectories. In particular, we generalise a basic result by Bhattacharya and Majumdar (2007) where a certain form of mixing, or swap condition was assumed uniformly over the state space. We do not rely on continuity properties of transition probabilities.</description>

      <title>A Markov approach to credit rating migration conditional on economic states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a model for credit rating migration that accounts for the impact of economic state fluctuations on default probabilities. The joint process for the economic state and the rating is modelled as a time-homogeneous Markov chain. While the rating process itself possesses the Markov property only under restrictive conditions, methods from Markov theory can be used to derive the rating process' asymptotic behaviour. We use the mathematical framework to formalise and analyse different rating philosophies, such as point-in-time (PIT) and through-the-cycle (TTC) ratings. Furthermore, we introduce stochastic orders on the bivariate process' transition matrix to establish a consistent notion of "better" and "worse" ratings. Finally, the construction of PIT and TTC ratings is illustrated on a Merton-type firm-value process.</description>

      <title>Stochastic PDEs for large portfolios with general mean-reverting volatility processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:1906.05898v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a structural stochastic volatility model for the loss from a large portfolio of credit risky assets. Both the asset value and the volatility processes are correlated through systemic Brownian motions, with default determined by the asset value reaching a lower boundary. We prove that if our volatility models are picked from a class of mean-reverting diffusions, the system converges as the portfolio becomes large and, when the vol-of-vol function satisfies certain regularity and boundedness conditions, the limit of the empirical measure process has a density given in terms of a solution to a stochastic initial-boundary value problem on a half-space. The problem is defined in a special weighted Sobolev space. Regularity results are established for solutions to this problem, and then we show that there exists a unique solution. In contrast to the CIR volatility setting covered by the existing literature, our results hold even when the systemic Brownian motions are taken to be correlated.</description>

      <title>Branching random walk with non-local competition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.14653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Bolker-Pacala-Dieckmann-Law (BPDL) model of population dynamics in the regime of large population density. The BPDL model is a particle system in which particles reproduce, move randomly in space, and compete with each other locally. We rigorously prove global survival as well as a shape theorem describing the asymptotic spread of the population, when the population density is sufficiently large. In contrast to most previous studies, we allow the competition kernel to have an arbitrary, even infinite range, whence the term non-local competition. This makes the particle system non-monotone and of infinite-range dependence, meaning that the usual comparison arguments break down and have to be replaced by a more hands-on approach. Some ideas in the proof are inspired by works on the non-local Fisher-KPP equation, but the stochasticity of the model creates new difficulties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.13847v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a multidimensional extension of Kellerer's theorem on the existence of mimicking Markov martingales for peacocks, a term derived from the French for stochastic processes increasing in convex order. For a continuous-time peacock in arbitrary dimension, after Gaussian regularization, we show that there exists a strongly Markovian mimicking martingale It\^o diffusion. A novel compactness result for martingale diffusions is a key tool in our proof. Moreover, we provide counterexamples to show, in dimension $d \geq 2$, that uniqueness may not hold, and that some regularization is necessary to guarantee existence of a mimicking Markov martingale.</description>

      <title>Large deviations for triangles in scale-free random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.09198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide large deviations estimates for the upper tail of the number of triangles in scale-free inhomogeneous random graphs where the degrees have power law tails with index $-\alpha, \alpha \in (1,2)$. We show that upper tail probabilities for triangles undergo a phase transition. For $\alpha&lt;4/3$, the upper tail is caused by many vertices of degree of order $n$, and this probability is semi-exponential. In this regime, additional triangles consist of two hubs. For $\alpha&gt;4/3$ on the other hand, the upper tail is caused by one hub of a specific degree, and this probability decays polynomially in $n$, leading to additional triangles with one hub. In the intermediate case $\alpha=4/3$, we show polynomial decay of the tail probability caused by multiple but finitely many hubs. In this case, the additional triangles contain either a single hub or two hubs. Our proofs are partly based on various concentration inequalities. In particular, we tailor concentration bounds for empirical processes to make them well-suited for analyzing heavy-tailed phenomena in nonlinear settings.</description>

      <title>Laws of the iterated and single logarithm for sums of independent indicators, with applications to the Ginibre point process and Karlin's occupancy scheme</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.15027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a law of the iterated logarithm (LIL) for an infinite sum of independent indicators parameterized by $t$ as $t\to\infty$. It is shown that if the expectation $b$ and the variance $a$ of the sum are comparable, then the normalization in the LIL includes the iterated logarithm of $a$. If the expectation grows faster than the variance, while the ratio $\log b/\log a$ remains bounded, then the normalization in the LIL includes the single logarithm of $a$ (so that the LIL becomes a law of the single logarithm). Applications of our result are given to the number of points of the infinite Ginibre point process in a disk and the number of occupied boxes and related quantities in Karlin's occupancy scheme.</description>

      <title>Scaling limit of multi-type invariant measures via the directed landscape</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09284v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the large scale limits of multi-type invariant distributions and Busemann functions of planar stochastic growth models in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) class. We identify a set of sufficient hypotheses for convergence of multi-type invariant measures of last-passage percolation (LPP) models to the stationary horizon (SH), which is the unique multi-type stationary measure of the KPZ fixed point. Our limit theorem utilizes conditions that are expected to hold broadly in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang class, including convergence of the scaled last-passage process to the directed landscape. We verify these conditions for the six exactly solvable models whose scaled bulk versions converge to the directed landscape, as shown by Dauvergne and Vir\'ag. We also present a second, more general, convergence theorem with potential future applications to polymer models and particle systems. Our paper is the first to show convergence to the SH without relying on information about the structure of the multi-type invariant measures of the prelimit models. These results are consistent with the conjecture that the SH is the universal scaling limit of multi-type invariant measures in the KPZ class.</description>

      <title>Statistical inference for a service system with non-stationary arrivals and unobserved balking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a multi-server queueing system with a periodic arrival rate and customers whose joining decision is based on their patience and a delay proxy. Specifically, each customer has a patience level sampled from a common distribution. Upon arrival, they receive an estimate of their delay before joining service and then join the system only if this delay is not more than their patience, otherwise they balk. The main objective is to estimate the parameters pertaining to the arrival rate and patience distribution. Here the complication factor is that this inference should be performed based on the observed process only, i.e., balking customers remain unobserved. We set up a likelihood function of the state dependent effective arrival process (i.e., corresponding to the customers who join), establish strong consistency of the MLE, and derive the asymptotic distribution of the estimation error. Due to the intrinsic non-stationarity of the Poisson arrival process, the proof techniques used in previous work become inapplicable. The novelty of the proving mechanism in this paper lies in the procedure of constructing i.i.d. objects from dependent samples by decomposing the sample path into i.i.d. regeneration cycles. The feasibility of the MLE-approach is discussed via a sequence of numerical experiments, for multiple choices of functions which provide delay estimates. In particular, it is observed that the arrival rate is best estimated at high service capacities, and the patience distribution is best estimated at lower service capacities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study hitting times in simple random walks on graphs, which measure the time required to reach specific target vertices. Our main result establishes a sharp lower bound for the variance of hitting times. For a simple random walk on a graph with $n$ vertices, we prove that the variance of the hitting time from a vertex $x$ to a vertex $y$, denoted $\tau_y$, is at least of the order $\mathbb{E}_x(\tau_y)^2 / \log n$. When the graph is a tree, we show that $n$ can be replaced by the graph's distance between vertices $x$ and $y$.</description>

      <title>Universality and Phase Transitions in Low Moments of Secular Coefficients of Critical Holomorphic Multiplicative Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the low moments $\mathbb{E}[|A_N|^{2q}], 0&lt;q\leq 1$ of {secular coefficients} $A_N$ of the {critical non-Gaussian holomorphic multiplicative chaos}, i.e. coefficients of $z^N$ in the power series expansion of $\exp(\sum_{k=1}^\infty X_kz^k/\sqrt{k})$, where $\{X_k\}_{k\geq 1}$ are i.i.d. rotationally invariant unit variance complex random variables. Inspired by Harper's remarkable result on random multiplicative functions, Soundararajan and Zaman recently showed that if each $X_k$ is standard complex Gaussian, $A_N$ features better-than-square-root cancellation: $\mathbb{E}[|A_N|^2]=1$ and $\mathbb{E}[|A_N|^{2q}]\asymp (\log N)^{-q/2}$ for fixed $q\in(0,1)$ as $N\to\infty$. We show that this asymptotic holds universally if $\mathbb{E}[e^{\gamma|X_k|}]&lt;\infty$ for some $\gamma&gt;2q$. As a consequence, we establish the universality for the tightness of the normalized secular coefficients $A_N(\log(1+N))^{1/4}$, generalizing a result of Najnudel, Paquette, and Simm. Another corollary is the almost sure regularity of some critical non-Gaussian holomorphic chaos in appropriate Sobolev spaces. Moreover, we characterize the asymptotic of $\mathbb{E}[|A_N|^{2q}]$ for $|X_k|$ following a stretched exponential distribution with an arbitrary scale parameter, which exhibits a completely different behavior and underlying mechanism from the Gaussian universality regime. As a result, we unveil a double-layer phase transition around the critical case of exponential tails. Our proofs combine Harper's robust approach with a careful analysis of the (possibly random) leading terms in the monomial decomposition of $A_N$.</description>

For $N \in \mathbb N$, we consider random $N \times N$ symmetric matrices $H^N$ which are such that $H_{ij}^{N}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}X_{i,j}^{N}$ for $1 \leq i,j \leq N$, where the $X_{i,j}^{N}$ for $1 \leq i \leq j \leq N$ are independent and centered. We then denote $\Sigma_{i,j} ^N = \text{Var} (X_{i,j}^{N}) ( 1 + \textbf{1}_{ i =j})^{-1}$ the variance profile of $H^N$. Our large deviation principle is then stated under the assumption that the $\Sigma^N$ converge in a certain sense toward a real continuous function $\sigma$ of $[0,1]^2$ and that the entries of $H^N$ are sharp sub-Gaussian. Our rate function is expressed in terms of the solution of a Dyson equation involving $\sigma$. This result is a generalization of a previous work by the third author and is new even in the case of Gaussian entries.</description>

      <title>New bounds for normal approximation on product spaces with applications to monochromatic edges, random sums and an infinite de Jong CLT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the Malliavin theory for $L^2$-functionals on product probability spaces that has recently been developed by Decreusefond and Halconruy (2019) and by Duerinckx (2021), by characterizing the domains and investigating the actions of the three Malliavin operators in terms of the infinite Hoeffding decomposition in $L^2$, which we identify as the natural analogue of the famous Wiener-It\^{o} chaos decomposition on Gaussian and Poisson spaces. We further combine this theory with Stein's method for normal approximation in order to provide three different types of abstract Berry-Esseen and Wasserstein bounds: a) Malliavin-Stein bounds involving the Malliavin gradient $D$ and the pseudo-inverse of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck generator $L$, b) bounds featuring the carr\'{e}-du-champ operator $\Gamma$ and c) bounds making use of a Clark-Ocone type integration-by-parts formula. To demonstrate the flexibility of these abstract bounds, we derive quantitative central limit theorems for the number of monochromatic edges in a uniform random coloring of a graph sequence as well as for random sums and prove an infinite version of the quantitative de Jong CLT that has recently been proved by G. Peccati and the author (2017) and by the author (2023). As a further theoretical application, we deduce new abstract Berry-Esseen and Wasserstein bounds for functionals of a general independent Rademacher sequence.</description>

      <title>Universality for free fermions and the local Weyl law for semiclassical Schr\"odinger operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.02121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.02121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study local asymptotics for the spectral projector associated to a Schr\"odinger operator $-\hbar^2\Delta+V$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$ in the semiclassical limit as $\hbar\to0$. We prove local uniform convergence of the rescaled integral kernel of this projector towards a universal model, inside the classically allowed region as well as on its boundary. This implies universality of microscopic fluctuations for the corresponding free fermions (determinantal) point processes, both in the bulk and around regular boundary points. Our results apply for a general class of smooth potentials in arbitrary dimension $n\ge 1$. These results are complemented by studying both macroscopic and mesoscopic fluctuations of the point process. We obtain tail bounds for macroscopic linear statistics and, provided $n\geq 2$, a central limit theorem for both macroscopic and mesoscopic linear statistics in the bulk.</description>

      <title>Sharp adaptive and pathwise stable similarity testing for scalar ergodic diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.13776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the nonparametric diffusion model, we develop a multiple test to infer about similarity of an unknown drift $b$ to some reference drift $b_0$: At prescribed significance, we simultaneously identify those regions where violation from similiarity occurs, without a priori knowledge of their number, size and location. This test is shown to be minimax-optimal and adaptive. At the same time, the procedure is robust under small deviation from Brownian motion as the driving noise process. A detailed investigation for fractional driving noise, which is neither a semimartingale nor a Markov process, is provided for Hurst indices close to the Brownian motion case.</description>

      <title>Mean viability theorems and second-order Hamilton-Jacobi equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.13276v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of mean viability for controlled stochastic differential equations and establish counterparts of Nagumo's classical viability theorems (necessary and sufficient conditions for mean viability). As an application, we provide a purely probabilistic proof of a comparison principle and of existence for contingent and viscosity solutions of second-order fully nonlinear path-dependent Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations. We do not use compactness and optimal stopping arguments, which are usually employed in the literature on viscosity solutions for second-order path-dependent PDEs.</description>

      <title>Sampling Proper Colorings on Line Graphs Using $(1+o(1))\Delta$ Colors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the single-site Glauber dynamics for sampling proper $q$-colorings mixes in $O_\Delta(n\log n)$ time on line graphs with $n$ vertices and maximum degree $\Delta$ when $q&gt;(1+o(1))\Delta$. The main tool in our proof is the matrix trickle-down theorem developed by Abdolazimi, Liu and Oveis Gharan (FOCS, 2021).</description>

      <title>On the Metric Temporal Logic for Continuous Stochastic Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00984v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove measurability of event for which a general continuous-time stochastic process satisfies continuous-time Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formula. Continuous-time MTL can define temporal constrains for physical system in natural way. Then there are several researches that deal with probability of continuous MTL semantics for stochastic processes. However, proving measurability for such events is by no means an obvious task, even though it is essential. The difficulty comes from the semantics of "until operator", which is defined by logical sum of uncountably many propositions. Given the difficulty involved in proving the measurability of such an event using classical measure-theoretic methods, we employ a theorem from stochastic analysis. This theorem is utilized to prove the measurability of hitting times for stochastic processes, and it stands as a profound result within the theory of capacity. Next, we provide an example that illustrates the failure of probability approximation when discretizing the continuous semantics of MTL formulas with respect to time. Additionally, we prove that the probability of the discretized semantics converges to that of the continuous semantics when we impose restrictions on diamond operators to prevent nesting.</description>

      <title>Eulerian magnitude homology: subgraph structure and random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we explore the connection between the ranks of the magnitude homology groups of a graph and the structure of its subgraphs. To this end, we introduce variants of magnitude homology called eulerian magnitude homology and discriminant magnitude homology. Leveraging the combinatorics of the differential in magnitude homology, we illustrate a close relationship between the ranks of the eulerian magnitude homology groups on the first diagonal and counts of subgraphs which fall in specific classes. We leverage these tools to study limiting behavior of the eulerian magnitude homology groups for Erdos-Renyi random graphs and random geometric graphs, producing for both models a vanishing threshold for the eulerian magnitude homology groups on the first diagonal. This in turn provides a characterization of the generators for the corresponding magnitude homology groups. Finally, we develop an explicit asymptotic estimate the expected rank of eulerian magnitude homology along the first diagonal for these random graph models.</description>
