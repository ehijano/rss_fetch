      <title>Machine Learning Symmetry Discovery for Classical Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a data-driven, deep-learning-based Machine-Learning Symmetry Discovery (MLSD) algorithm to automate the discovery of continuous Lie group symmetries in classical mechanical systems from their time-evolution trajectory data. MLSD uses neural networks (NNs) to predict conserved physical quantities that implement symmetry transformations of the phase space coordinates. After training, MLSD is able to identify the Lie algebra, particularly non-abelian ones, as indicated by the Lie algebra structure coefficients. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the MLSD method, we applied it to simulated data from the classical three-dimensional Kepler problem and the harmonic oscillator. The results show that the algorithm successfully identified the hidden symmetry groups of both systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum chaos, localization and phase transitions in random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy level statistics of uniform random graphs are studied, by treating the graphs as random tight-binding lattices. The inherent random geometry of the graphs and their dynamical spatial dimensionality, leads to various quantum chaotic and localized phases and transitions between them. Essentially the random geometry acts as disorder, whose strength is characterized by the ratio of edges over vertices R in the graphs. For dense graphs, with large ratio R, the spacing between successive energy levels follows the Wigner-Dyson distribution, leading to a quantum chaotic behavior and a metallic phase, characterized by level repulsion. For ratios near R=0.5, where a large dominating component in the graph appears, the level spacing follows the Poisson distribution with level crossings and a localized phase for the respective wavefunctions lying on the graph. For intermediate ratios R we observe a phase transition between the quantum chaotic and localized phases characterized by a semi-Poisson distribution. The values R of the critical regime where the phase transition occurs depend on the energy of the system. Our analysis shows that physical systems with random geometry, for example ones with a fluctuating/dynamical spatial dimension, contain novel universal phase transition properties, similar to those occuring in more traditional phase transitions based on symmetry breaking mechanisms, whose universal properties are strongly determined by the dimensionality of the system.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Cavity Method for Hypergraphs and its Application to Quenches in the k-XOR-SAT Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamical cavity method and its backtracking version provide a powerful approach to studying the properties of dynamical processes on large random graphs. This paper extends these methods to hypergraphs, enabling the analysis of interactions involving more than two variables. We apply them to analyse the $k$-XOR-satisfiability ($k$-XOR-SAT) problem, an important model in theoretical computer science which is closely related to the diluted $p$-spin model from statistical physics. In particular, we examine whether the quench dynamics -- a deterministic, locally greedy process -- can find solutions with only a few violated constraints on $d$-regular $k$-uniform hypergraphs. Our results demonstrate that the methods accurately characterize the attractors of the dynamics. It enables us to compute the energy reached by typical trajectories of the dynamical process in different parameter regimes. We show that these predictions are accurate, including cases where a classical mean-field approach fails.</description>

      <title>Many-body spectral transitions through the lens of variable-range SYK2 model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model is a cornerstone in the study of quantum chaos and holographic quantum matter. Real-world implementations, however, deviate from the idealized all-to-all connectivity, raising questions about the robustness of its chaotic properties. In this work, we investigate a quadratic SYK model with distance-dependent interactions governed by a power-law decay. By analytically and numerically studying the spectral form factor (SFF), we uncover how the single particle transitions manifest in the many-body system. While the SFF demonstrates robustness under slightly reduced interaction ranges, further suppression leads to a breakdown of perturbation theory and new spectral regimes, marked by a higher dip and the emergence of a secondary plateau. Our results highlight the interplay between single-particle criticality and many-body dynamics, offering new insights into the quantum chaos-to-localization transition and its reflection in spectral statistics.</description>

      <title>Persistent current in a non-Hermitian Hatano-Nelson ring: Disorder-induced amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal hopping induces a synthetic magnetic flux which leads to the non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm effect. Since non-Hermitian Hamiltonians possess both real and imaginary eigenvalues, this effect allows the observation of real and imaginary persistent currents in a ring threaded by the synthetic flux~\cite{nrh8}. Motivated by this, we investigate the behavior of persistent currents in a disordered Hatano-Nelson ring with anti-Hermitian intradimer hopping. The disorder is diagonal and we explore three distinct models, namely the Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper model, the Fibonacci model, both representing correlated disorder, and an uncorrelated (random) model. We conduct a detailed analysis of the energy spectrum and examine the real and imaginary parts of the persistent current under various conditions such as different ring sizes and filling factors. Interestingly, we find that real and imaginary persistent currents exhibit amplification in the presence of correlated disorder. This amplification is also observed in certain individual random configurations but vanishes after configuration averaging. Additionally, we observe both diamagnetic and paramagnetic responses in the current behavior and investigate aspects of persistent currents in the absence of disorder that have not been previously explored. Interestingly, we find that the intradimer bonds host only imaginary currents, while the interdimer bonds carry only real currents.</description>

      <title>Impurity-temperature phase diagram with phase crystals and competing time-reversal symmetry breaking states in nodal $d$-wave superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase crystals are a class of non-uniform superconducting ground states characterized by spontaneous phase gradients of the superconducting order parameter. These phase gradients non-locally drive periodic currents and magnetic fields, thus breaking both time-reversal symmetry and continuous translational symmetry. The phase crystal instability is generally triggered by negative and inhomogeneous superfluid stiffness. Several scenarios have been identified that can realize phase crystals, especially flat bands at specific edges of unconventional nodal superconductors. Motivated by omnipresent disorder in all materials, we employ the ${t}$-matrix approach within the quasiclassical theory of superconductivity to study the emergence of phase crystals at edges of a nodal $d$-wave superconductor. We quantify the full phase diagram as a function of the impurity scattering energy and the temperature, with full self-consistency in the impurity self energies, the superconducting order parameter, and the vector potential. We find that the phase crystal survives even up to $\sim 40-50\%$ of the superconducting critical impurity strength in both the Born and unitary scattering limits. Finally, we show how mesoscopic finite-size effects induce a competition with a state still breaking time-reversal symmetry but with translationally invariant edge currents.</description>

      <title>Quantum Compilation Toolkit for Rydberg Atom Arrays with Implications for Problem Hardness and Quantum Speedups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and implement a comprehensive quantum compilation toolkit for solving the maximum independent set (MIS) problem on quantum hardware based on Rydberg atom arrays. Our end-to-end pipeline involves three core components to efficiently map generic MIS instances onto Rydberg arrays with unit-disk connectivity, with modules for graph reduction, hardware compatibility checks, and graph embedding. The first module (reducer) provides hardware-agnostic and deterministic reduction logic that iteratively reduces the problem size via lazy clique removals. We find that real-world networks can typically be reduced by orders of magnitude on sub-second time scales, thus significantly cutting down the eventual load for quantum devices. Moreover, we show that reduction techniques may be an important tool in the ongoing search for potential quantum speedups, given their ability to identify hard problem instances. In particular, for Rydberg-native MIS instances, we observe signatures of an easy-hard-easy transition and quantify a critical degree indicating the onset of a hard problem regime. The second module (compatibility checker) implements a hardware compatibility checker that quickly determines whether or not a given input graph may be compatible with the restrictions imposed by Rydberg quantum hardware. The third module (embedder) describes hardware-efficient graph embedding routines to generate (approximate) encodings with controllable overhead and optimized ancilla placements. We exemplify our pipeline with experiments run on the QuEra Aquila device available on Amazon Braket. In aggregate, our work provides a set of tools that extends the class of problems that can be tackled with near-term Rydberg atom arrays.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent theory for sound propagation in a simple model of a disordered, harmonic solid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a self-consistent theory for sound propagation in a simple model of a disordered solid. The solid is modeled as a collection of randomly distributed particles connected by harmonic springs with strengths that depend on the interparticle distances, i.e the Euclidean random matrix model of Mezard et al. [Nucl. Phys. 559B, 689 (1999)]. The derivation of the theory combines two exact projection operator steps and a factorization approximation. Within our approach the square of the speed of sound is non-negative. The unjamming transition manifests itself through vanishing of the speed of sound.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks Based Deep Learning for Predicting Structural and Electronic Properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a deep learning approach to predicting structural and electronic properties of materials using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Leveraging data from the Materials Project database, we construct graph representations of crystal structures and employ GNNs to predict multiple properties simultaneously. All crystal structures are from the Materials Project database, with a total of 158,874 structures used. Our model achieves high predictive accuracy across various properties, as indicated by \( R^2 \) values: 0.96 for density, 0.97 for formation energy, 0.54 for energy above hull, 0.47 for structural stability (is\_S), 0.76 for band gap, 0.86 for valence band maximum, 0.78 for conduction band minimum, and 0.82 for Fermi energy. These results demonstrate the potential of GNNs in materials science, offering a powerful tool for rapid screening and discovery of materials with desired properties.</description>

      <title>Interaction-induced phase transitions and critical phases in nonreciprocal non-Hermitian quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian phenomena, such as exceptional points, non-Hermitian skin effects, and topologically nontrivial phases, have attracted continued attention. In this work, we reveal how interactions and nonreciprocal hopping could collectively influence the behavior of two interacting bosons on quasiperiodic lattices. Focusing on the Bose-Hubbard model with Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper quasiperiodic modulations and hopping asymmetry, we discover that the interaction could enlarge the localization transition point of the noninteracting system into a critical phase, in which localized doublons formed by bosonic pairs can coexist with delocalized states. Under the open boundary condition, the bosonic doublons could further show non-Hermitian skin effects, realizing doublon condensation at the edges, and their direction of skin-localization can be flexibly tuned by the hopping parameters. A framework is developed to characterize the spectral, localization, and topological transitions accompanying these phenomena. Our work advances the understanding of localization and topological phases in non-Hermitian systems, particularly in relation to multiparticle interactions.</description>

      <title>Rigidity transition of a highly compressible granular medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A wide range of disordered materials, from biological to geological assemblies, feature discrete elements undergoing large shape changes. How significant geometrical variations at the microscopic scale affect the response of the assembly, in particular rigidity transitions, is an ongoing challenge in soft matter physics. However, the lack of a model granular-like experimental system featuring large and versatile particle deformability impedes advances. Here, we explore the oscillatory shear response of a sponge-like granular assembly composed of highly compressible elastic rings. We highlight a progressive rigidity transition, switching from a yielded phase to a solid one by increasing density or decreasing shear amplitude. The rearranging yielded state consists of crystal clusters separated by melted regions; in contrast, the solid state remains amorphous and absorbs all imposed shear elastically. We rationalize this transition by uncovering an effective, attractive shear force between rings that emerges from a friction-geometry interplay. If friction is sufficiently high, the extent of the contacts between rings, captured analytically by elementary geometry, controls the rigidity transition.</description>

      <title>The joint distribution of first return times and of the number of distinct sites visited by a 1D random walk before returning to the origin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present analytical results for the joint probability distribution $P(T_{FR}=t,S=s)$ of first return (FR) times t and of the number of distinct sites s visited by a random walk (RW) on a one dimensional lattice before returning to the origin. The RW on a one dimensional lattice is recurrent, namely the probability to return to the origin is $P_{R}=1$. However the mean $\langle T_{FR}\rangle$ of the distribution $P(T_{FR}=t)$ of first return times diverges. Similarly, the mean $\langle S\rangle$ of the distribution $P(S=s)$ of the number of distinct sites visited before returning to the origin also diverges. The joint distribution $P(T_{FR}=t,S=s)$ provides a formulation that controls these divergences and accounts for the interplay between the kinetic and geometric properties of first return trajectories. We calculate the conditional distributions $P(T_{FR}=t|S=s)$ and $P(S=s|T_{FR}=t)$. We find that the conditional expectation value of first return times of trajectories that visit s distinct sites is ${\mathbb E}[T_{FR}|S=s]=\frac{2}{3}(s^2+s+1)$, and the variance is $Var(T_{FR}|S=s)=\frac{4}{45}(s-1)(s+2)(s^2+s-1)$. We also find that in the asymptotic limit, the conditional expectation value of the number of distinct sites visited by an RW that first returns to the origin at time $t=2n$ is ${\mathbb E}[S|T_{FR}=2n] \simeq \sqrt{\pi n}$, and the variance is $Var(S|T_{FR}=2n) \simeq \pi\left(\frac{\pi}{3}-1\right)n$. These results go beyond the important recent results of Klinger et al. [{\it Phys. Rev. E} {\bf 105}, 034116 (2022)], who derived a closed form expression for the generating function of the joint distribution, but did not go further to extract an explicit expression for the joint distribution itself. The joint distribution provides useful insight on the efficiency of random search processes, in which the aim is to cover as many sites as possible in a given number of steps.</description>
