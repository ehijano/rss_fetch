      <title>Rheological modeling with GENERIC and with the Onsager principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we compare three frameworks for modeling flows of complex fluids: (i) local conservations of mass, momentum and energy, (ii) GENERIC, and (iii) Onsager principle. The first is based on the mass, momentum, and energy conservation implied by mechanics, the second on the observed approach of externally unforced fluids to equilibrium states at which their behavior is well described by equilibrium thermodynamics, and the third on the minimal resistance to external influences. The comparison is illustrated on isothermal and incompressible polymeric fluids.</description>

      <title>Emergent interactions lead to collective frustration in robotic matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current artificial intelligence systems show near-human-level capabilities when deployed in isolation. Systems of a few collaborating intelligent agents are being engineered to perform tasks collectively. This raises the question of whether robotic matter, where many learning and intelligent agents interact, shows emergence of collective behaviour. And if so, which kind of phenomena would such systems exhibit? Here, we study a paradigmatic model for robotic matter: a stochastic many-particle system in which each particle is endowed with a deep neural network that predicts its transitions based on the particles' environments. For a one-dimensional model, we show that robotic matter exhibits complex emergent phenomena, including transitions between long-lived learning regimes, the emergence of particle species, and frustration. We also find a density-dependent phase transition with signatures of criticality. Using active matter theory, we show that this phase transition is a consequence of self-organisation mediated by emergent inter-particle interactions. Our simple model captures key features of more complex forms of robotic systems.</description>

      <title>A Microfluidic Platform for Actin-Based Membrane Remodeling Reveals the Stabilizing Role of Branched Actin Networks on Lipid Microdomains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell shape changes, essential for processes such as motility or division, are controlled by the actomyosin cortex that actively remodels biological membranes. Their mechanisms can be deciphered in___vitro using biomimetic reconstituted systems, such as giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) with controlled lipid composition coupled to reconstituted actin networks. These assays allow mimicking cell shape changes in controlled biochemical and biophysical environments. However, studying the dynamics of these shape changes on statistically significant populations of GUVs with the possibility to sequentially modify the protein composition of the assay is a major experimental challenge. To address these issues, a microfluidic approach is used to immobilize several dozens of isolated GUVs and monitor membrane and actin network evolution. The loading of the chamber with GUVs and actin is first characterized. Then, the actin-induced remodeling of populations of homogeneous and phase-separated GUVs is monitored and shows that actin networks prevent the coalescence of lipid microdomains and that, in return, the number of domains affects the actin network structure. This microfluidic-based experimental strategy, thus, allows for studying actin-induced membrane deformation in___vitro and can be adapted to other studies on membrane remodeling processes.</description>

      <title>Active spin model for cell assemblies on 1D substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The experimental use of micropatterned quasi-1D substrates has emerged as an useful experimental tool to study the nature of cell-cell interactions and gain insight on collective behaviour of cell colonies. Inspired by these experiments, we propose an active spin model to investigate the emergent properties of the cell assemblies. The lattice gas model incorporates the interplay of self-propulsion, polarity directional switching, intra-cellular attraction, and contact Inhibition Locomotion (CIL). In the absence of vacancies, which corresponds to a confluent cell packing on the substrate, the model reduces to an equilibrium spin model which can be solved exactly. In the presence of vacancies, the clustering is controlled by a dimensionless Peclet Number, Q - the ratio of magnitude of self-propulsion rate and directional switching rate of particles. In the absence of CIL interactions, we invoke a mapping to Katz-Lebowitz-Spohn(KLS) model to determine an exact analytical form of the cluster size distribution in the limit Q &lt;&lt; 1. In the limit of Q &gt;&gt; 1, the cluster size distribution exhibits an universal scaling behaviour (in an approximate sense), such that the distribution function can be expressed as a scaled function of Q, particle density and CIL interaction strength. We characterize the phase behaviour of the system in terms of contour plots of average cluster size. The average cluster size exhibit a non-monotonic dependence on CIL interaction strength, attractive interaction strength, and self-propulsion.</description>

      <title>Transverse Self-Propulsion Enhances the Aggregation of Active Dumbbells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a two-dimensional system of active Brownian dumbbells using molecular dynamics simulations. In this model, each dumbbell is driven by an active force oriented perpendicular to the axis connecting its two constituent beads. We characterize the resulting phase behavior and find that, across all values of activity, the system undergoes phase separation between dilute and dense phases. The dense phase exhibits hexatic order, and for large enough activity, we observe a marked increase in local polarization, with dumbbells predominantly oriented towards the interior of the clusters. Compared to the case of axially self-propelled dumbbells, we find that the binodal region is enlarged towards lower densities at all activities. This shift arises because dumbbells with transverse propulsion can more easily form stable cluster cores, serving as nucleation seeds, and show a highly suppressed escaping rate from the cluster boundary. Finally, we observe that clusters exhibit spontaneous rotation, with the modulus of the angular velocity scaling as $\omega\sim r_g^{-2}$, where $r_g$ is the cluster's radius of gyration. This contrasts with axially propelled dumbbells, where the scaling follows $\omega\sim r_g^{-1}$. We develop a simplified analytical model to rationalize this scaling behavior.</description>

      <title>Doubling the magnetorheological effect of magnetic elastomers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most important properties of soft functionalized magnetic composite materials in view of their technological potential is given by the magnetorheological effect. It describes the change in rheological properties such as the shear modulus by application of external magnetic fields. We demonstrate how computational material design can support in approximately doubling the magnitude of this important phenomenon for magnetic elastomers. Key is to work with two perpendicular magnetic field directions. We expect future practical relevance of our concept.</description>

      <title>Geometrical entanglement and alignment regulate self-organization in active ring polymer suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the emerging self-organization in active ring suspensions, focusing on how the rings' orientational order and geometric entanglement vary with density and spatial confinement. To quantify entanglement, we introduce the wrapping number, a pairwise measure of ring interpenetration, while orientational order is characterized by the alignment of the normal vectors to the rings' osculating planes. Both wrapping number and alignment distinguish active from passive systems, and their combination aptly identifies the self-organized states that emerge with the onset of activity. Mutual-information analysis reveals a significant correlation between alignment and wrapping number across all considered active conditions. However, self-organization displays a non-monotonic dependence on the activity-induced entanglement. Specifically, moderate wrapping stabilizes contacts of neighboring aligned rings, while excessive entanglement disrupts alignment. We show that this competition arises because increasing entanglement interferes with the planar conformations required to form aligned stacks. Given the simplicity of this microscopic mechanism, analogous effects may occur more generally in polymer systems where the degree of entanglement is regulated by out-of-equilibrium effects.</description>

      <title>Complex topologies in phase separated droplets predicted from universal phase diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase separation of two phase separating solutes in a common solvent can result in mesoscale (micron-sized) droplets with complex topologies of the domains of each solute within each droplet. Such topologies have been observed in-vitro in systems of chromatin oligomers, biomolecular condensates, and polymeric mixtures. In these systems the solutes phase separate from the solvent into droplets due to the relatively large free energy gain, which includes the energies and entropies of mixing with the solvent. Within each droplet, further phase separation can occur between the two solutes due to an additional free energy difference that promotes their demixing; in some systems, the extent of demixing can be, in some cases, be modulated by an additional component. The minimal free energy topologies are predicted as universal functions of the interfacial tension ratios and fractions of each solute within a droplet. We compare the predictions with several experimental systems to estimate the ranges of interfacial tensions. Experimental aspects that may depend on the kinetics or molecular weight variations in the system are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Amorphous Solid Model of Vectorial Hopfield Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a vectorial extension of the Hopfield associative memory model inspired by the theory of amorphous solids, where binary neural states are replaced by unit vectors $\mathbf{s}_i \in \mathbb{R}^3$ on the sphere $S^2$. The generalized Hebbian learning rule creates a block-structured weight matrix through outer products of stored pattern vectors, analogous to the Hessian matrix structure in amorphous solids. We demonstrate that this model exhibits quantifiable structural properties characteristic of disordered materials: energy landscapes with deep minima for stored patterns versus random configurations (energy gaps $\sim 7$ units), strongly anisotropic correlations encoded in the weight matrix (anisotropy ratios $\sim 10^2$), and order-disorder transitions controlled by the pattern density $\gamma = P/(N \cdot d)$. The enhanced memory capacity ($\gamma_c \approx 0.55$ for a fully-connected network) compared to binary networks ($\gamma_c \approx 0.138$) and the emergence of orientational correlations establish connections between associative memory mechanisms and amorphous solid physics, particularly in systems with continuous orientational degrees of freedom. We also unveil the scaling with the coordination number $Z$ of the memory capacity: $\gamma_c \sim (Z-6)$ from the isostatic point $Z_c =6$ of the 3D elastic network, which closely mirrors the scaling of the shear modulus $G \sim (Z-6)$ in 3D central-force spring networks.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Bayesian inference for uncertainty quantification of thermal grease rheology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rheologically complex soft solids such as thermal greases consist of filler particles within a polymer matrix. These materials find applications in improving the conformity of solid-solid contacts and enhancing heat transfer. Complex soft solids exhibit a transient non-Newtonian rheological response, including thixotropy and viscoelasticity. Previously, stress relaxation and buildup in sheared commercial thermal greases were successfully captured using a nonlinear elasto-visco-plastic (NEVP) model and a thixo-elasto-visco-plastic (TEVP). However, the previous model calibration methods ignored parameter uncertainty, providing only single values of the rheological parameters, and did not quantitatively address the chosen model's identifiability from the data or credibility of the calibration. We address these limitations via hierarchical Bayesian inference, accounting for uncertainties arising from epistemic and aleatoric sources. Importantly, the hierarchical approach allows us to assimilate experiments measuring the stress responses at various startup shear rates by allowing the models' parameters to vary across different shear rates. Then, a global distribution and the associated uncertainty are obtained by pooling. We also propagate uncertainties to the transient shear stress response predicted by the models. Overall, we demonstrate that the chosen NEVP and TEVP models are identifiable from rheometric startup data. However, for the TEVP model, the uncertainty of the parameters is lower (narrower distributions) when higher shear rates are used for inference.</description>

      <title>Modeling complex particle suspensions: perspectives on the rigid multiblob method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many suspensions contain particles with complex shapes that are affected not only by hydrodynamics, but also by thermal fluctuations, internal kinematic constraints and other long-range non-hydrodynamic interactions. Modeling these systems represents a significant numerical challenge due to the interplay between different effects and the need to accurately capture multiscale phenomena. In this article we review recent developments to model large suspensions of particles of arbitrary shapes and multiple couplings with controllable accuracy within the rigid multiblob framework. We discuss the governing equations, highlight key numerical developments, and illustrate applications ranging from microswimmers to complex colloidal suspensions. This review illustrates the effectiveness and versatility of the rigid multiblob method in tackling a wide range of physical problems in fluid mechanics, soft matter physics, biophysics, materials and colloidal science.</description>
