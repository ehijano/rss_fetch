      <title>Formalising Propositional Information via Implication Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a framework for quantifying the information content of logical propositions through the use of implication hypergraphs. We posit that a proposition's informativeness is primarily determined by its relationships with other propositions -- specifically, the extent to which it implies or derives other propositions. To formalize this notion, we develop a framework based on implication hypergraphs, that seeks to capture these relationships. Within this framework, we define propositional information, derive some key properties, and illustrate the concept through examples. While the approach is broadly applicable, mathematical propositions emerge as an ideal domain for its application due to their inherently rich and interconnected structure. We provide several examples to illustrate this and subsequently discuss the limitations of the framework, along with suggestions for potential refinements.</description>

      <title>Strong marker sets and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence of clopen marker sets with some strong regularity property. For each $n\geq 1$ and any integer $d\geq 1$, we show that there are a positive integer $D$ and a clopen marker set $M$ in $F(2^{\mathbb{Z}^n})$ such that (1) for any distinct $x,y\in M$ in the same orbit, $\rho(x,y)\geq d$; (2) for any $1\leq i\leq n$ and any $x\in F(2^{\mathbb{Z}^n})$, there are non-negative integers $a, b\leq D$ such that $a\cdot x\in M$ and $-b\cdot x\in M$. As an application, we obtain a clopen tree section for $F(2^{\mathbb{Z}^n})$. Based on the strong marker sets, we get a quick proof that there exist clopen continuous edge $(2n+1)$-colorings of $F(2^{\mathbb{Z}^n})$. We also consider a similar strong markers theorem for more general generating sets. In dimension 2, this gives another proof of the fact that for any generating set $S\subseteq \mathbb{Z}^2$, there is a continuous proper edge $(2|S|+1)$-coloring of the Schreier graph of $F(2^{\mathbb{Z}^n})$ with generating set $S$.</description>

      <title>A new categorial equivalence for Stone Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to give a categorical equivalence for Stone algebras. We introduce the variety of Stone-Kleene algebras with intuitionistic negation, or Stone KAN-algebras for short, and explore Kalman's construction for Stone algebras. We examine the centered algebras within this new variety and prove that the category of Stone algebras is equivalent to the category of centered Stone KAN-algebras. Moreover, inspired by Monteiro's construction for Nelson algebras, we propose a method to construct a centered Stone KAN-algebra from a given Stone KAN-algebra and show the connection between Kalman's construction and Monteiro's construction.</description>

      <title>An analogue of U-rank for atomic classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a countable, complete, first-order theory $T$, we study $At$, the class of atomic models of $T$. We develop an analogue of $U$-rank and prove two results. On one hand, if some tp(d/a) is not ranked, then there are $2^{\aleph_1}$ non-isomorphic models in $At$ of size $\aleph_1$. On the other hand, if all types have finite rank, then the rank is fully additive and every finite tuple is dominated by an independent set of realizations of pseudo-minimal types.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fix a d-minimal expansion of an ordered field. We consider the space $\mathcal D^p(M)$ of definable $\mathcal C^p$ functions defined on a definable $\mathcal C^p$ submanifold $M$ equipped with definable $\mathcal C^p$ topology. The set of definable $\mathcal C^p$ Morse functions is dense in $\mathcal D^p(M)$.</description>

      <title>A declarative approach to specifying distributed algorithms using three-valued modal logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Coalition Logic, a three-valued modal fixed-point logic designed for declaratively specifying and reasoning about distributed algorithms, such as the Paxos consensus algorithm.
  Our methodology represents a distributed algorithm as a logical theory, enabling correctness properties to be derived directly within the framework -- or revealing logical errors in the algorithm's design when they exist.
  Coalition Logic adopts a declarative approach, specifying the overall logic of computation without prescribing control flow. Notably, message-passing is not explicitly modeled, distinguishing our framework from approaches like TLA+. This abstraction emphasises the logical essence of distributed algorithms, offering a novel perspective on their specification and reasoning.
  We define the syntax and semantics of Coalition Logic, explore its theoretical properties, and demonstrate its applicability through a detailed treatment of the Paxos consensus algorithm. By presenting Paxos as a logical theory and deriving its standard correctness properties, we showcase the framework's capacity to handle non-trivial distributed systems.
  We envision Coalition Logic as a versatile tool for specifying and reasoning about distributed algorithms. The Paxos example highlights the framework's ability to capture intricate details, offering a new lens through which distributed algorithms can be specified, studied, and checked.</description>

      <title>Almost homomorphisms and measurable cocycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several results regarding the rigidity of maps and cocycles in the setting of Polish groups are established.
  Firstly, if $G\overset{\phi}\longrightarrow H$ is a map from a locally compact second countable group $G$ into a group $H$ and such that there is a conull subset $Z\subseteq G\times G$ satisfying $$ \phi(xy)=\phi(x)\cdot \phi(y) $$ for all $(x,y)\in Z$, then there is a homomorphism $G\overset{\pi}\longrightarrow H$ agreeing with $\phi$ almost everywhere. A similar statement holds for Baire category.
  Secondly, if $G\times X\overset{\psi}\longrightarrow H$ is a Baire measurable cocycle associated with a Polish group action $G\curvearrowright X$ and $\psi$ is continuous in the second variable, then $\psi$ is jointly continuous. Again, a related statement holds for measure.</description>

      <title>Models of Set Theory: Extensions and Dead-ends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is a contribution to the study of extensions of arbitrary models of ZF (Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory), with no regard to countability or well-foundedness of the models involved. We present some new constructions of certain types of extensions, and also establish the existence of models of ZF that cannot be properly end extended.</description>

      <title>Uncountable homogeneous structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17889v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the existence of uncountable first-order structures that are homogeneous with respect to their finitely generated substructures. In many classical cases this is either well-known or follows from general facts, for example, if the language is finite and relational then ultrapowers provide arbitrarily large such sturctures. On the other hand, there are no general results saying that uncountable homogeneous structures with a given age exist. We examine the monoid of self-embeddings of a fixed countable homogeneous structure and, using abstract Fra\"iss\'e theory, we present a method of constructing an uncountable homogeneous structure, based on the amalgamation property of this monoid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the complexity of locally checkable labeling (LCL) problems on $\mathbb{Z}^n$ from the point of view of descriptive set theory, computability theory, and factors of i.i.d. Our results separate various complexity classes that were not previously known to be distinct and serve as counterexamples to a number of natural conjectures in the field.</description>

      <title>Surfaces and other Peano Continua with no Generic Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08667v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The space of chains on a compact connected space encodes all the different ways of continuously growing out of a point until exhausting the space. A chain is \emph{generic} if its orbit under the action of the underlying homeomorphism group is comeager. In this paper we show that a large family of topological spaces do not have a generic chain: in addition to all manifolds of dimension at least 3, for which the result was already known, our theorem covers all compact surfaces except for the sphere and the real projective plane - for which the question remains open - as well as all other homogeneous Peano continua, circle excluded. If the spaces are moreover strongly locally homogeneous, which is the case for any closed manifold and the Menger curve, we prove that chains cannot be classified up to homeomorphism by countable structures, and that the underlying homeomorphism groups have non-metrizable universal minimal flows, with all orbits meager, in contrast to the case of 1-dimensional manifolds. The proof of the main result is of combinatorial nature, and it relies on the creation of a dictionary between open sets of chains on one side, and walks on finite connected graphs on the other.</description>
