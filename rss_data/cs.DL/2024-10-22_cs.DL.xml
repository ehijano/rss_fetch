      <title>CiteClick: A Browser Extension for Real-Time Scholar Citation Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This technical report presents CiteClick, a browser extension designed to monitor and track Google Scholar citation counts for multiple researchers in real-time. We discuss the motivation behind the tool, its key features, implementation details, and potential impact on the academic community. The report covers installation procedures, usage guidelines, and customization options, concluding with a discussion on future work and potential improvements. By automating the process of citation tracking, CiteClick aims to enhance research evaluation processes and facilitate more informed decision-making in academic contexts.</description>

      <title>Automatic Search of Multiword Place Names on Historical Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Historical maps are invaluable sources of information about the past, and scanned historical maps are increasingly accessible in online libraries. To retrieve maps from these large libraries that contain specific places of interest, previous work has applied computer vision techniques to recognize words on historical maps, enabling searches for maps that contain specific place names. However, searching for multiword place names is challenging due to complex layouts of text labels on historical maps. This paper proposes an efficient query method for searching a given multiword place name on historical maps. Using existing methods to recognize words on historical maps, we link single-word text labels into potential multiword phrases by constructing minimum spanning trees. These trees aim to link pairs of text labels that are spatially close and have similar height, angle, and capitalization. We then query these trees for the given multiword place name. We evaluate the proposed method in two experiments: 1) to evaluate the accuracy of the minimum spanning tree approach at linking multiword place names and 2) to evaluate the number and time range of maps retrieved by the query approach. The resulting maps reveal how places using multiword names have changed on a large number of maps from across history.</description>

      <title>Evolution of funding for collaborative health research towards higher-level patient-oriented research. A comparison of the European Union Framework Programmes to the program funding by the United States National Institutes of Health</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigated whether health research funding by the framework programs of the European Union (FP-HR) has moved towards more needs-driven investment, consistent with changes in EU policies, and whether similar changes were present in funding programs of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). To this end, we performed a quantitative analysis of the content of collaborative projects between 2008 and 2023. We used machine learning for classification of projects as basic biomedical, clinical, population, or health policy research. We found that FP-HR funding shifted towards more implementation research. With the exception of the recent NIH-UM1 program, collaborative NIH programs remain predominantly biomedical research. Infectious diseases is an emerging theme. We conclude that demand for solutions for better health care has led to expanded funding for collaborative implementation- and impact-oriented research, at the expense of basic biomedical research. Compared to NIH, the FPs show greater flexibility to adjust their funding portfolios.</description>

      <title>Biases in gendered citation practices: an exploratory study and some reflections on the Matthew and Matilda effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies conducted in different scientific disciplines have concluded that researchers belonging to some socio-cultural groups (e.g., women, racialized people) are usually less cited than other researchers belonging to dominating groups. This is usually due to the presence of citation biases in reference lists. These citation biases towards researchers from some socio-cultural groups may inevitably cause unfairness and inaccuracy in the assessment of articles impact. These citation biases may therefore translate to significant disparities in promotion, retention, grant funding, awards, collaborative opportunities, and publications. In this paper, we conduct the first study aiming at analyzing gendered citation practices in the software engineering (SE) literature. Our study allows reflecting on citations practices adopted in the SE field and serves as a starting point for more robust empirical studies on the analyzed topic. Our results show that some efforts still need to be done to achieve fairness in citation practices in the SE field. Such efforts may notably consist in the inclusion of citation diversity statements in manuscripts submitted for publication in SE journals and conferences.</description>
