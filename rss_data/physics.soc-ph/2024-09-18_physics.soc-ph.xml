      <title>Unveiling the Social Fabric: A Temporal, Nation-Scale Social Network and its Characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social networks shape individuals' lives, influencing everything from career paths to health. This paper presents a registry-based, multi-layer and temporal network of the entire Danish population in the years 2008-2021 (roughly 7.2 mill. individuals). Our network maps the relationships formed through family, households, neighborhoods, colleagues and classmates. We outline key properties of this multiplex network, introducing both an individual-focused perspective as well as a bipartite representation. We show how to aggregate and combine the layers, and how to efficiently compute network measures such as shortest paths in large administrative networks. Our analysis reveals how past connections reappear later in other layers, that the number of relationships aggregated over time reflects the position in the income distribution, and that we can recover canonical shortest path length distributions when appropriately weighting connections. Along with the network data, we release a Python package that uses the bipartite network representation for efficient analysis.</description>

      <title>Normalization in Proportional Feature Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11389</link>

Abstract: The subject of features normalization plays an important central role in data representation, characterization, visualization, analysis, comparison, classification, and modeling, as it can substantially influence and be influenced by all of these activities and respective aspects. The selection of an appropriate normalization method needs to take into account the type and characteristics of the involved features, the methods to be used subsequently for the just mentioned data processing, as well as the specific questions being considered. After briefly considering how normalization constitutes one of the many interrelated parts typically involved in data analysis and modeling, the present work addressed the important issue of feature normalization from the perspective of uniform and proportional (right skewed) features and comparison operations. More general right skewed features are also considered in an approximated manner. Several concepts, properties, and results are described and discussed, including the description of a duality relationship between uniform and proportional feature spaces and respective comparisons, specifying conditions for consistency between comparisons in each of the two domains. Two normalization possibilities based on non-centralized dispersion of features are also presented, and also described is a modified version of the Jaccard similarity index which incorporates intrinsically normalization. Preliminary experiments are presented in order to illustrate the developed concepts and methods.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph reconstruction from dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A plethora of methods have been developed in the past two decades to infer the underlying network structure of an interconnected system from its collective dynamics. However, methods capable of inferring nonpairwise interactions are only starting to appear. Here, we develop an inference algorithm based on sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) to reconstruct hypergraphs and simplicial complexes from time-series data. Our model-free method does not require information about node dynamics or coupling functions, making it applicable to complex systems that do not have a reliable mathematical description. We first benchmark the new method on synthetic data generated from Kuramoto and Lorenz dynamics. We then use it to infer the effective connectivity in the brain from resting-state EEG data, which reveals significant contributions from non-pairwise interactions in shaping the macroscopic brain dynamics.</description>

      <title>Modeling Epidemic Spread: A Gaussian Process Regression Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling epidemic spread is critical for informing policy decisions aimed at mitigation. Accordingly, in this work we present a new data-driven method based on Gaussian process regression (GPR) to model epidemic spread. We bound the variance of the predictions made by GPR, which quantifies the impact of epidemic data on the proposed model. Next, we derive a high-probability error bound on the prediction error in terms of the distance between the training points and a testing point, the posterior variance, and the level of change in the spreading process, and we assess how the characteristics of the epidemic spread and infection data influence this error bound. We present examples that use GPR to model and predict epidemic spread by using real-world infection data gathered in the UK during the COVID-19 epidemic. These examples illustrate that, under typical conditions, the prediction for the next twenty days has 94.29% of the noisy data located within the 95% confidence interval, validating these predictions.</description>

      <title>Mobility-GCN: a human mobility-based graph convolutional network for tracking and analyzing the spatial dynamics of the synthetic opioid crisis in the USA, 2013-2020</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09945v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synthetic opioids are the most common drugs involved in drug-involved overdose mortalities in the U.S. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that in 2018, about 70% of all drug overdose deaths involved opioids and 67% of all opioid-involved deaths were accounted for by synthetic opioids. In this study, we investigated the spread of synthetic opioids between 2013 and 2020 in the U.S. We analyzed the relationship between the spatiotemporal pattern of synthetic opioid-involved deaths and another key opioid, heroin, and compared patterns of deaths involving these two types of drugs during this period. Spatial connections and human mobility between counties were incorporated into a graph convolutional neural network model to represent and analyze the spread of synthetic opioid-involved deaths in the context of previous heroin-involved death patterns.</description>
