      <title>The physics, travels, and tribulations of Ronald Wilfrid Gurney</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ronald Wilfrid Gurney is one of the lesser-known research students of the Cavendish Laboratory in the mid 1920s. Gurney made significant contributions to the application of quantum mechanics to problems related to tunneling of alpha-particles from nuclei, to formation of images in photographic plates, the understanding of the origin of color-centres in salt crystals, and in the theory of semiconductors. He was the first physicist to apply quantum mechanics to the theory of electrochemistry and ionic solutions. He also made fundamental contributions to ballistics research. Gurney wrote a number of textbooks on fundamental and applied quantum mechanics in a distinctive style which are still useful as educational resources. In addition to his scientific contributions, he travelled extensively, and during and after World War II worked in the United States. During the cold war, he got entangled in the Klaus Fuchs affair and lost his employment. He died at the age of 54 in 1953 from a stroke. With the approach of the 100th year anniversary of quantum mechanics, it is timely to commemorate the life and contributions of this somewhat forgotten physicist.</description>

      <title>On the map-territory fallacy fallacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.06924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a meta-theory of the usage of the free energy principle (FEP) and examines its scope in the modelling of physical systems. We consider the so-called `map-territory fallacy' and the fallacious reification of model properties. By showing that the FEP is a consistent, physics-inspired theory of inferences of inferences, we disprove the assertion that the map-territory fallacy contradicts the principled usage of the FEP. As such, we argue that deploying the map-territory fallacy to criticise the use of the FEP and Bayesian mechanics itself constitutes a fallacy: what we call the {\it map-territory fallacy fallacy}. In so doing, we emphasise a few key points: the uniqueness of the FEP as a model of particles or agents that model their environments; the restoration of convention to the FEP via its relation to the principle of constrained maximum entropy; the `Jaynes optimality' of the FEP under this relation; and finally, the way that this meta-theoretical approach to the FEP clarifies its utility and scope as a formal modelling tool. Taken together, these features make the FEP, uniquely, {\it the} ideal model of generic systems in statistical physics.</description>
