      <title>Domain decomposition of the modified Born series approach for large-scale wave propagation simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modified Born series method is a fast and accurate method for simulating wave propagation in complex structures. Currently, its main limitation is that the size of the simulation is limited by the working memory of a single computer or graphics processing unit (GPU). Here, we present a domain decomposition method that removes this limitation. We show how to decompose large problems over subdomains while maintaining the accuracy, memory efficiency, and guaranteed monotonic convergence of the method. We demonstrate our approach by solving the Helmholtz problem for a complex structure of size $315\times 315\times 315$ wavelengths in just 379 seconds on a dual-GPU system.</description>

      <title>A discrete cohesive zone model for beam element: Application to adhesively bonded laminates and sandwich panels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new discrete cohesive zone model (DCZM) is presented for modeling the interface behavior of adhesive-bonded thin laminates and sandwich panels. The proposed model treats the interface as a spring element and the adherent as a beam element. The use of the preceding assumptions facilitates the simplification of the computational framework reducing the problem from a 2D to 1D, thereby relaxing the requirements of maintaining the aspect ratio of elements in the finite element mesh. For thin laminates, the constitutive relation of the adhesive is represented by a bi-linear traction-separation law, whereas for sandwich panels, an exponential law is employed to model the adhesive behavior. In order to validate the proposed model for thin laminates, simulations of three established fracture tests: DCB, ENF, and MMB have been undertaken. Additionally, for the sandwich panel, two experiments documented in the literature have been simulated for assessing the efficacy of the modelling. One experiment has a mode-I interface failure and the other one a mode-II interface failure between the core and skin. It has been observed that the model is not sensitive to either the element size or the load step size. The results have been compared with reported (benchmark) numerical, analytical, and experimental findings. The proposed methodology for thin laminates offers a significant reduction in the computational effort (reduced number of unknown degrees of freedom compared to existing methods) with no compromise on the accuracy of the predictions. Specifically, it reduces the unknown degrees of freedom by more than 25\% compared to the corresponding mesh used in existing continuum cohesive zone model (CCZM) approaches. The Newton-Raphson solver can achieve quick convergence and no line search feature is required. The proposed algorithm is easy to implement on any computational platform.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The second PyHEP.dev workshop, part of the "Python in HEP Developers" series organized by the HEP Software Foundation (HSF), took place in Aachen, Germany, from August 26 to 30, 2024. This gathering brought together nearly 30 Python package developers, maintainers, and power users to engage in informal discussions about current trends in Python, with a primary focus on analysis tools and techniques in High Energy Physics (HEP).
  The workshop agenda encompassed a range of topics, such as defining the scope of HEP data analysis, exploring the Analysis Grand Challenge project, evaluating statistical models and serialization methods, assessing workflow management systems, examining histogramming practices, and investigating distributed processing tools like RDataFrame, Coffea, and Dask. Additionally, the workshop dedicated time to brainstorming the organization of future PyHEP.dev events, upholding the tradition of alternating between Europe and the United States as host locations.
  This document, prepared by the session conveners in the weeks following the workshop, serves as a summary of the key discussions, salient points, and conclusions that emerged.</description>

      <title>Open-source shape optimization for isogeometric shells using FEniCS and OpenMDAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an open-source Python framework for the shape optimization of complex shell structures using isogeometric analysis (IGA). IGA seamlessly integrates computer-aided design (CAD) and analysis models by employing non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS) as basis functions, enabling the natural implementation of the Kirchhoff--Love shell model due to their higher order of continuity. We leverage the recently developed FEniCS-based analysis framework, PENGoLINS, for the direct structural analysis of shell structures consisting of a collection of NURBS patches through a penalty-based formulation. This contribution introduces the open-source implementation of gradient-based shape optimization for isogeometric Kirchhoff--Love shells with a modular architecture. Complex shell structures with non-matching intersections are handled using a free-form deformation (FFD) approach and a moving intersections formulation. The symbolic differentiation and code generation capabilities in FEniCS are utilized to compute the analytical derivatives. By integrating FEniCS with OpenMDAO, we build modular components that facilitate gradient-based shape optimization of shell structures. The modular architecture in this work supports future extensions and integration with other disciplines and solvers, making it highly customizable and suitable for a wide range of applications. We validate the design-analysis-optimization workflow through several benchmark problems and demonstrate its application to aircraft wing design optimization. The framework is implemented in a Python library named GOLDFISH (Gradient-based Optimization and Large-scale Design Framework for Isogeometric SHells) and the source code will be maintained at https://github.com/hanzhao2020/GOLDFISH.</description>

      <title>Dynamical cross-correlations between RR and QT intervals in long-term electrocardiogram recordings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamic relationship between RR and QT intervals is crucial for interpreting electrocardiograms (ECGs) and managing cardiac conditions. We investigated cross-correlation between RR and QT intervals in long-term ECG recordings from 202 healthy subjects using time-lagged cross-correlation analysis to explore how QT intervals correlate with both preceding and succeeding RR intervals across various time lags. Data was preprocessed with the smoothness priors method to remove long-term trends while preserving relevant short-term dynamics.
  Our results reveal that, as expected, the highest RR-QT cross-correlations occur when the intervals overlap the most. Notably, we also observed a strong cross-correlation between the present QT interval and the preceding RR interval, with the overall correlations skewed toward negative lags. This suggests that past RR intervals exert a stronger influence on current QT intervals. These findings align with previous research on RR-QT transfer entropy.
  We found no significant differences in RR-QT cross-correlations between sexes. However, aging was associated with significantly reduced cross-correlations across all lags. This effect is consistent with existing literature on age-related cardiac changes and provides further insight into the impact of aging on RR-QT coupling. Additionally, we observed a slight positive correlation between heart rate and cross-correlation at all lags, with cross-correlation decreasing as the lag increased. These findings enhance our understanding of the dynamic RR-QT relationship and may inform future studies on cardiac electrophysiology and diseases.</description>

      <title>Predictive Modelling of Stress and Heat Flux in Monoblock Divertors Using Machine Learning for Fusion Energy Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The management of extreme heat loads in fusion reactors is critical to the integrity of plasma-facing components (PFCs). This study presents a real-time predictive framework for monoblock divertors, which are primarily composed of tungsten to manage thermal stress effectively. By combining finite element analysis (FEA) data with a Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR), our model predicts stress distribution, heat flux, and potential failure points. Our results indicate significant stress concentrations at thermal gradient points, with stress levels reaching up to 2000 MPa. The proposed framework facilitates data-driven design enhancements, proactive maintenance strategies, and improved operational safety as fusion reactors transition from experimental to commercial applications.</description>

      <title>Learning classical density functionals for ionic fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient theoretical techniques for describing ionic fluids are highly desirable for many applications across the physical, biological and materials sciences. With a rigorous statistical mechanical foundation, classical density functional theory (cDFT) is an appealing approach, but the competition between strong Coulombic interactions and steric repulsion limits the accuracy of current approximate functionals. Here, we extend a recently presented machine learning (ML) approach [Samm\"uller et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 120, e2312484120 (2023)] designed for systems with short-ranged interactions to ionic fluids. By adopting ideas from local molecular field theory, the framework we present amounts to using neural networks to learn the local relationship between the one-body direct correlation functions and inhomogeneous density profiles for a "mimic'' short-ranged system, with effects of long-ranged interactions accounted for in a mean-field, yet well-controlled, manner. By comparing to results from molecular simulations, we show that our approach accurately describes the structure and thermodynamics of the prototypical model for electrolyte solutions and ionic liquids: the restricted primitive model. The framework we present acts as an important step toward extending ML approaches for cDFT to systems with accurate interatomic potentials.</description>

      <title>Quantum many-body solver using artificial neural networks and its applications to strongly correlated electron systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the evolution of numerical methods, we are now aiming at not only qualitative understanding but also quantitative prediction and design of quantum many-body phenomena. As a novel numerical approach, machine learning techniques have been introduced in 2017 to analyze quantum many-body problems. Since then, proposed various novel approaches have opened a new era, in which challenging and fundamental problems in physics can be solved by machine learning methods. Especially, quantitative and accurate estimates of material-dependent physical properties of strongly correlated matter have now become realized by combining first-principles calculations with highly accurate quantum many-body solvers developed with the help of machine learning methods. Thus developed quantitative description of electron correlations will constitute a key element of materials science in the next generation.</description>

      <title>Deconstructing Recurrence, Attention, and Gating: Investigating the transferability of Transformers and Gated Recurrent Neural Networks in forecasting of dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning architectures, including transformers and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have revolutionized forecasting in applications ranging from text processing to extreme weather. Notably, advanced network architectures, tuned for applications such as natural language processing, are transferable to other tasks such as spatiotemporal forecasting tasks. However, there is a scarcity of ablation studies to illustrate the key components that enable this forecasting accuracy. The absence of such studies, although explainable due to the associated computational cost, intensifies the belief that these models ought to be considered as black boxes. In this work, we decompose the key architectural components of the most powerful neural architectures, namely gating and recurrence in RNNs, and attention mechanisms in transformers. Then, we synthesize and build novel hybrid architectures from the standard blocks, performing ablation studies to identify which mechanisms are effective for each task. The importance of considering these components as hyper-parameters that can augment the standard architectures is exhibited on various forecasting datasets, from the spatiotemporal chaotic dynamics of the multiscale Lorenz 96 system, the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, as well as standard real world time-series benchmarks. A key finding is that neural gating and attention improves the performance of all standard RNNs in most tasks, while the addition of a notion of recurrence in transformers is detrimental. Furthermore, our study reveals that a novel, sparsely used, architecture which integrates Recurrent Highway Networks with neural gating and attention mechanisms, emerges as the best performing architecture in high-dimensional spatiotemporal forecasting of dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Rescaled Equations of Fluid Motion for Well-Conditioned Direct Numerical Simulations of Rapidly Rotating Convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convection is a ubiquitous process driving geophysical/astrophysical fluid flows, which are typically strongly constrained by planetary rotation on large scales. A celebrated model of such flows, rapidly rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, has been extensively studied in direct numerical simulations (DNS) and laboratory experiments, but the parameter values attainable by state-of-the-art methods are limited to moderately rapid rotation (Ekman numbers $Ek\gtrsim10^{-8}$), while realistic geophysical/astrophysical $Ek$ are significantly smaller. Asymptotically reduced equations of motion, the nonhydrostatic quasi-geostrophic equations (NHQGE), describing the flow evolution in the limit $Ek\to 0$, do not apply at finite rotation rates. The geophysical/astrophysical regime of small but finite $Ek$ therefore remains currently inaccessible. Here, we introduce a new, numerically advantageous formulation of the Navier-Stokes-Boussinesq equations informed by the scalings valid for $Ek\to0$, the \textit{rescaled incompressible Navier-Stokes equations} (RiNSE). We solve the RiNSE using a spectral quasi-inverse method resulting in a sparse, fast algorithm to perform efficient DNS in this previously unattainable parameter regime. We validate our results against the literature across a range of $Ek$, and demonstrate that the algorithmic approaches taken remain accurate and numerically stable at $Ek$ as low as $10^{-15}$. Like the NHQGE, the RiNSE derive their efficiency from adequate conditioning, eliminating spurious growing modes that otherwise induce numerical instabilities at small $Ek$. We show that the time derivative of the mean temperature is inconsequential for accurately determining the Nusselt number in the stationary state, significantly reducing the required simulation time, and demonstrate that full DNS using RiNSE agree with the NHQGE at very small $Ek$.</description>

      <title>Finite-element methods for noncollinear magnetism and spin-orbit coupling in real-space pseudopotential density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an efficient finite-element approach for large-scale real-space pseudopotential density functional theory (DFT) calculations incorporating noncollinear magnetism and spin-orbit coupling. The approach builds on the open-source DFT-FE computational framework and addresses a crucial gap in real-space DFT calculations using finite elements, which previous studies have shown to offer several advantages over traditional DFT basis sets. In particular, we derive the finite-element (FE) discretized governing equations involving 2-component spinors utilizing the locally reformulated electrostatics in the DFT problem and further develop a generalized force methodology to compute atomic forces and unit-cell stresses in a unified setting within this FE framework of DFT accounting for noncollinear magnetism and spin-orbit effects. Additionally, we design an efficient self-consistent field iteration approach based on Chebyshev filtered subspace iteration procedure exploiting the sparsity of local and non-local parts of FE discretized Hamiltonian to solve the underlying nonlinear eigenvalue problem based on a two-grid strategy. Validation against plane-wave implementations shows excellent agreement in ground-state energetics, vertical ionization potentials, magnetic anisotropy energies, band structures, and spin textures. The proposed method achieves up to 8x-11x speed-ups for semi-periodic and non-periodic systems with ~5000-7000 electrons in terms of minimum wall times compared to widely used plane-wave implementations on CPUs in addition to exhibiting significant computational advantage on GPUs. This methodology provides a robust, systematically convergent framework for large-scale DFT calculations involving noncollinear magnetism and spin-orbit coupling, enabling more complex material simulations and extending the length scales of ab-initio studies.</description>
