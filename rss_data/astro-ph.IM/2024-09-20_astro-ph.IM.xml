      <title>Observations of microlensed images with dual-field interferometry: on-sky demonstration and prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interferometric observations of gravitational microlensing events offer an opportunity for precise, efficient, and direct mass and distance measurements of lensing objects, especially those of isolated neutron stars and black holes. However, such observations were previously possible for only a handful of extremely bright events. The recent development of a dual-field interferometer, GRAVITY Wide, has made it possible to reach out to significantly fainter objects, and increase the pool of microlensing events amenable to interferometric observations by two orders of magnitude. Here, we present the first successful observation of a microlensing event with GRAVITY Wide and the resolution of microlensed images in the event OGLE-2023-BLG-0061/KMT-2023-BLG-0496. We measure the angular Einstein radius of the lens with a sub-percent precision, $\theta_{\rm E} = 1.280 \pm 0.009$ mas. Combined with the microlensing parallax detected from the event light curve, the mass and distance to the lens are found to be $0.472 \pm 0.012 M_{\odot}$ and $1.81 \pm 0.05$ kpc, respectively. We present the procedure for the selection of targets for interferometric observations, and discuss possible systematic effects affecting GRAVITY Wide data. This detection demonstrates the capabilities of the new instrument and it opens up completely new possibilities for the follow-up of microlensing events, and future routine discoveries of isolated neutron stars and black holes.</description>

      <title>Towards a response function for the COSI anticoincidence system: preliminary results from Geant4 simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) is an upcoming NASA Small Explorer satellite mission scheduled for launch in 2027 and designed to conduct an all-sky survey in the energy range of 0.2-5 MeV. Its instrument consists of an array of germanium detectors surrounded on four sides and underneath by active shields that work as anticoincidence system (ACS) to reduce the contribution of background events in the detectors. These shields are composed of bismuth germanium oxide (BGO), a scintillator material, coupled with Silicon photomultipliers, aimed to collect optical photons produced from interaction of ionizing particles in the BGO and convert them into an electric signal. The reference simulation framework for COSI is MEGAlib, a set of software tools based on the Geant4 toolkit. The interaction point of the incoming radiation, the design of the ACS modules and the BGO surface treatment change the light collection and the overall shielding accuracy. The use of the Geant4 optical physics library, with the simulation of the scintillation process, is mandatory for a more realistic evaluation of the ACS performances. However, including the optical processes in MEGAlib would dramatically increase the computing time of the COSI simulations. We propose the use of a response function encoding the energy resolution and 3D light yield correction based on a separate Geant4 simulation of the ACS that includes the full optical interaction. We present the verification of the Geant4 optical physics library against analytical computations and available laboratory measurements obtained using PMTs as readout device, as a preparatory phase for the simulation of the COSI ACS response.</description>

      <title>Tuning the MAPS Adaptive Secondary Mirror: Actuator Control, PID Tuning, Power Spectra and Failure Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The MMT Adaptive optics exoPlanet characterization System (MAPS) is currently in its engineering phase, operating on-sky at the MMT Telescope on Mt. Hopkins in southern Arizona. The MAPS Adaptive Secondary Mirror's actuators are controlled by a closed loop modified PID control law and an open loop feed-forward law, which in combination allows for faster actuator response time. An essential element of achieving the secondary's performance goals involves the process of PID gain tuning. To start, we briefly discuss the design of the MAPS ASM and its actuators. We then describe the actuator positional control system and control law. Next, we discuss a few of the issues that make ASM tuning difficult. We then outline our initial attempts at tuning the actuator controllers and discuss the use of actuator positional power spectra for both tuning and determining the health and failure states of individual actuators. We conclude by presenting the results of our latest round of tuning configuration trials, which have been successful at decreasing mirror latency, increasing operational mirror modes and improving image PSF.</description>

      <title>The Effects of Instrumental Deadtime on NICER Timing Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The X-ray Timing Instrument as part of the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer has the potential to examine the time-domain properties of compact objects in regimes not explored by previous timing instruments, due to its combination of high effective area and timing resolution. We consider the effects of instrumental deadtime at a range of effective countrates in a series of observations of the X-ray binary GX 339-4 to determine what effect deadtime has on photometric and Fourier frequency-domain products. We find that there are no significant inconsistencies across the functional detectors in the instrument, and that in the regimes where instrumental deadtime is a limiting factor on observations that previous approaches to dealing with deadtime, as applied to RXTE and other detectors, are still appropriate, and that performing deadtime corrections to lightcurves before creating Fourier products are not necessary at the count rates considered in our analysis.</description>

      <title>High-contrast imager for complex aperture telescopes (HiCAT): 11. System-level demonstration of the Apodized Pupil Lyot Coronagraph with a segmented aperture in air</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the final results of the Apodized Pupil Lyot Coronagraph (APLC) on the High-contrast imager for Complex Aperture Telescopes (HiCAT) testbed, under NASA's Strategic Astrophysics Technology program. The HiCAT testbed was developed over the past decade to enable a system-level demonstration of coronagraphy for exoplanet direct imaging with the future Habitable Wolds Observatory. HiCAT includes an active, segmented telescope simulator, a coronagraph, and metrology systems (Low-order and Mid-Order Zernike Wavefront Sensors, and Phase Retrieval camera). These results correspond to an off-axis (un-obscured) configuration, as was envisioned in the 2020 Decadal Survey Recommendations. Narrowband and broadband dark holes are generated using two continuous deformable mirrors (DM) to control high order wavefront aberrations, and low-order drifts can be further stabilized using the LOWFS loop. The APLC apodizers, manufactured using carbon nanotubes, were optimized for broadband performance and include the calibrated geometric aperture.
  HiCAT is, to this date, the only testbed facility able to demonstrate high-contrast coronagraphy with a truly segmented aperture, as is required for the Habitable World Observatory, albeit limited to ambient conditions. Results presented here include $6\times 10^{-8}$ (90% CI) contrast in 9% bandpass in a 360 deg dark hole with inner and outer working angles of $4.4 \lambda/D_{pupil}$ and $11 \lambda/D_{pupil}$ . Narrowband contrast (3% bandpass) reaches $2.4\times 10^{-8}$ (90% confidence interval).</description>

      <title>Simulating Self-Lensing and Eclipsing Signals due to Detached Compact Objects in the TESS Light Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fraction of Galactic stars have compact companions which could be white dwarfs (WDs), neutron stars (NSs) or stellar-mass black holes (SBHs). In a detached and edge-on binary system including a main-sequence star and a compact object (denoted by WDMS, NSMS, and BHMS systems), the stellar brightness can change periodically due to self-lensing or eclipsing features. The shape of a self-lensing signals is a degenerate function of stellar radius and compact object's mass because the self-lensing peak strongly depends on the projected source radius normalized to Einstein radius. Increasing the inclination angle $i$ changes the self-lensing shape from a strict top-hat model to one with slow-increasing edges. We simulate stellar light curves due to these binary systems which are observed by NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) telescope and evaluate the efficiencies to detect their periodic signatures using two sets of criteria (i)SNR$&gt;3$ and $N_{\rm{tran}}&gt;1$ (Low-Confidence, LC), and (ii) SNR$&gt;5$ and $N_{\rm{tran}}&gt;2$ (High-Confidence, HC). The HC efficiencies for detecting WDMS, NSMS, and BHMS systems with the inclination angle $i&lt;20^{\circ}$ during different time spans are $5$-$7\%$, $4.5$-$6\%$, and $4$-$5\%$, respectively. Detecting lensing-induced features is possible in only $\lesssim3\%$ and $\lesssim33\%$ of detectable WDMS and NSMS events. The detection efficiencies for closer source stars with higher priorities are higher and drop to zero for $b\gtrsim R_{\star}$, where $b\simeq \tan(i) a$ is the impact parameter($a$ is the semi-major axis). We predict the numbers of WDs, NSs, and SBHs that are discovered from the TESS Candidate Target List stars are $15$-$18$, $6$-$7$, and $&lt;1$.</description>

      <title>Rotation Measure study of FRB 20180916B with the uGMRT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Fast Radio Burst 20180916B is a repeating FRB whose activity window has a 16.34 day periodicity that also shifts and varies in duration with the observing frequency. Recently, arxiv:2205.09221 reported the FRB has started to show secular Rotation Measure (RM) increasing trend after only showing stochastic variability around a constant value of $-114.6$ rad m$^{-2}$ since its discovery.
  Aims. We aim to further study the RM variability of FRB 20180916B. The data comes from the ongoing campaigns of FRB 20180916B using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT). The majority of the observations are in Band 4, which is centered at 650 MHz with 200 MHz bandwidth.
  Methods. We apply a standard single pulse search pipeline to search for bursts. In total, we detect 116 bursts with $\sim$36 hours of on-source time spanning 1200 days, with two bursts detected during simultaneous frequency coverage observations. We develop and apply a polarization calibration strategy suited for our dataset. On the calibrated bursts, we use QU-fitting to measure RM. Lastly, we also measure various other properties such as rate, linear polarization fraction and fluence distribution.
  Results. Of the 116 detected bursts, we could calibrate 79 of them. From which, we observed in our early observations the RM continued to follow linear trend as modeled by arxiv:2205.09221. However, our later observations suggest the source switch from the linear trend to stochastic variations around a constant value of $-58.75$ rad m$^{-2}$. We also study cumulative rate against fluence and note that rate at higher fluences (&gt; 1.2 Jy ms) scales as $\gamma = -1.09(7)$ whereas that at lower fluences (between 0.2 and 1.2 Jy ms) only scales as $\gamma = -0.51(1)$, meaning rate at higher fluence regime is steeper than at lower fluence regime.</description>

      <title>Applying template synthesis to the radio emission from air showers with generic geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studying high-energy cosmic-ray air showers through the radio emission produced by their secondary particles is a well-established technique. However, due to the increasing size and density of the radio arrays, analyses are running into computational limits, as these rely on Monte Carlo simulations to model the emission. To address this, we have been developing template synthesis. With this method, we use semi-analytical expressions to describe how the radio emission from an air shower depends on the shower age and the position of the antenna with respect to the shower. These expressions are extracted from a set of microscopic simulations, thus benefiting from their accuracy. Once obtained, we can use these relations to synthesise the emission from an air shower with any longitudinal profile, by using a single Monte Carlo simulation as an input. Previously we have demonstrated that this hybrid approach can synthesise the radio emission from air showers and agrees with results from microscopic simulations within 10%. The method was however limited to a specific geometry. Here we present our first step towards generalising template synthesis across geometries. We found a set of scaling relations which correct for the shower geometry as well as the viewing angle under which the radiation is observed. This allows us to reformulate the semi-analytical relations in a way that does not longer depend on the geometry, significantly reducing the number of parameters that need to be fitted. We apply these scaling relations to a simulation library of CORSIKA showers with a zenith angle of 50 degrees. We then extract the semi-analytical expressions required for template synthesis, and use them to synthesise the emission from air showers with lower zenith angles. We investigate the accuracy by comparing both to microscopic simulations as well as the single geometry version of template synthesis.</description>

      <title>Generalising template synthesis of EAS radio emission to other geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the last few decades, radio detection has become one of the standard techniques to study high-energy cosmic-ray air showers. For the purpose of analysing the data, we heavily rely on Monte Carlo simulations. Upcoming dense radio array experiments such as LOFAR2.0 and SKA will, however, reach the limit of what is computationally feasible with these. Other techniques are available, based on macroscopic quantities, but their accuracy has thus far not been adequate to use them in precision analyses. In this contribution we present the latest update on the template synthesis approach, a hybrid model using both micro- and macroscopic inputs to synthesise the radio emission for an air shower with an arbitrary longitudinal profile. The method starts from the emission of a given shower and employs semi-analytical relations which only depend on the atmospheric depth at shower maximum and antenna position in order to transform it. Core to the template synthesis approach is the slicing of the atmosphere. By considering the radio emission from each slice separately, we only need to explicitly account for shower age effects. In previous work it was shown this could be done over a wide range of primary energy and across primary types for vertical air showers, with an accuracy of 10%. Here, we generalise the method to other zenith angles. We investigate the potential to synthesise between different geometries using a data set consisting of several hundreds of CORSIKA showers with primary energies ranging from $10^{17}$ eV to $10^{19}$ eV.</description>

      <title>Template synthesis approach for radio emission from extensive air showers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel way to synthesise the radio emission from extensive air showers. It is a hybrid approach which uses a single microscopic Monte-Carlo simulation to generate the radio emission from a shower with a different longitudinal evolution, primary particle type and energy. The method employs semi-analytical relations which only depend on the shower parameters to transform the radio signal in the simulated antennas. We apply this method to vertical air showers with energies ranging from $10^{17}$ eV to $10^{19}$ eV and compare the results with CoREAS using two different metrics. In order to gauge the performance over our simulation set, we subsequently use every shower in the set as a template to synthesise the emission from the other showers. Depending on the scoring metric, template synthesis reconstructs the radio emission with an accuracy of 5 to 10%.</description>

      <title>Calibration of Spectropolarimetry channel of Visible Emission Line Coronagraph onboard Aditya-L1</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnetic field strength and its topology play an important role in understanding the formation, evolution, and dynamics of the solar corona. Also, it plays a significant role in addressing long-standing mysteries such as coronal heating problem, origin and propagation of coronal mass ejections, drivers of space weather, origin and acceleration of solar wind, and so on. Despite having photospheric magnetograms for decades, we do not have reliable observations of coronal magnetic field strengths today. To measure the coronal magnetic field precisely, the spectropolarimetry channel of the Visible Emission Line Coronagraph (VELC) on board the Aditya-L1 mission is designed. Using the observations of coronal emission line Fe XIII [10747{\AA~}], it is possible to generate full Stokes maps (I, Q, U, and V) that help in estimating the Line-of-Sight (LOS) magnetic field strength and to derive the magnetic field topology maps of solar corona in the Field of View (FOV) (1.05 -- 1.5~R$_{\odot}$). In this article, we summarize the instrumental details of the spectropolarimetry channel and detailed calibration procedures adopted to derive the modulation and demodulation matrices. Furthermore, we have applied the derived demodulation matrices to the observed data in the laboratory and studied their performance.</description>

      <title>YOLO-CIANNA: Galaxy detection with deep learning in radio data. I. A new YOLO-inspired source detection method applied to the SKAO SDC1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The upcoming Square Kilometer Array (SKA) will set a new standard regarding data volume generated by an astronomical instrument, which is likely to challenge widely adopted data-analysis tools that scale inadequately with the data size. The aim of this study is to develop a new source detection and characterization method for massive radio astronomical datasets based on modern deep-learning object detection techniques. For this, we seek to identify the specific strengths and weaknesses of this type of approach when applied to astronomical data. We introduce YOLO-CIANNA, a highly customized deep-learning object detector designed specifically for astronomical datasets. In this paper, we present the method and describe all the elements introduced to address the specific challenges of radio astronomical images. We then demonstrate the capabilities of this method by applying it to simulated 2D continuum images from the SKA observatory Science Data Challenge 1 (SDC1) dataset. Using the SDC1 metric, we improve the challenge-winning score by +139% and the score of the only other post-challenge participation by +61%. Our catalog has a detection purity of 94% while detecting 40 to 60% more sources than previous top-score results, and exhibits strong characterization accuracy. The trained model can also be forced to reach 99% purity in post-process and still detect 10 to 30% more sources than the other top-score methods. It is also computationally efficient, with a peak prediction speed of 500 images of 512x512 pixels per second on a single GPU. YOLO-CIANNA achieves state-of-the-art detection and characterization results on the simulated SDC1 dataset and is expected to transfer well to observational data from SKA precursors.</description>

      <title>Improving Early Detection of Gravitational Waves from Binary Neutron Stars Using CNNs and FPGAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves (GWs) from binary neutron stars (BNSs) with possible telescope follow-ups opens a window to ground-breaking discoveries in the field of multi-messenger astronomy. With the improved sensitivity of current and future GW detectors, more BNS detections are expected in the future. Therefore, enhancing low-latency GW search algorithms to achieve rapid speed, high accuracy, and low computational cost is essential. One innovative solution to reduce latency is the use of machine learning (ML) methods embedded in field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). In this work, we present a novel \texttt{WaveNet}-based method, leveraging the state-of-the-art ML model, to produce early-warning alerts for BNS systems. Using simulated GW signals embedded in Gaussian noise from the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors' third observing run (O3) as a proof-of-concept dataset, we demonstrate significant performance improvements. Compared to the current leading ML-based early-warning system, our approach enhances detection accuracy from 66.81\% to 76.22\% at a 1\% false alarm probability. Furthermore, we evaluate the time, energy, and economical cost of our model across CPU, GPU, and FPGA platforms, showcasing its potential for deployment in real-time gravitational wave detection pipelines.</description>

      <title>Exploring Dimensionality Reduction of SDSS Spectral Abundances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-resolution stellar spectra offer valuable insights into atmospheric parameters and chemical compositions. However, their inherent complexity and high-dimensionality present challenges in fully utilizing the information they contain. In this study, we utilize data from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) within the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV (SDSS-IV) to explore latent representations of chemical abundances by applying five dimensionality reduction techniques: PCA, t-SNE, UMAP, Autoencoder, and VAE. Through this exploration, we evaluate the preservation of information and compare reconstructed outputs with the original 19 chemical abundance data. Our findings reveal a performance ranking of PCA &lt; UMAP &lt; t-SNE &lt; VAE &lt; Autoencoder, through comparing their explained variance under optimized MSE. The performance of non-linear (Autoencoder and VAE) algorithms has approximately 10\% improvement compared to linear (PCA) algorithm. This difference can be referred to as the "non-linearity gap." Future work should focus on incorporating measurement errors into extension VAEs, thereby enhancing the reliability and interpretability of chemical abundance exploration in astronomical spectra.</description>

      <title>Vision foundation models: can they be applied to astrophysics data?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision foundation models, which have demonstrated significant potential in many multimedia applications, are often underutilized in the natural sciences. This is primarily due to mismatches between the nature of domain-specific scientific data and the typical training data used for foundation models, leading to distribution shifts. Scientific data often differ substantially in structure and characteristics; researchers frequently face the challenge of optimizing model performance with limited labeled data of only a few hundred or thousand images. To adapt foundation models effectively requires customized approaches in preprocessing, data augmentation, and training techniques. Additionally, each vision foundation model exhibits unique strengths and limitations, influenced by differences in architecture, training procedures, and the datasets used for training. In this work, we evaluate the application of various vision foundation models to astrophysics data, specifically images from optical and radio astronomy. Our results show that using features extracted by specific foundation models improves the classification accuracy of optical galaxy images compared to conventional supervised training. Similarly, these models achieve equivalent or better performance in object detection tasks with radio images. However, their performance in classifying radio galaxy images is generally poor and often inferior to traditional supervised training results. These findings suggest that selecting suitable vision foundation models for astrophysics applications requires careful consideration of the model characteristics and alignment with the specific requirements of the downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Minimally implicit methods for the numerical integration of the neutrino transport equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.12089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The evolution of many astrophysical systems is dominated by the interaction between matter and radiation such as photons or neutrinos. The dynamics can be described by the evolution equations of radiation hydrodynamics in which reactions between matter particles and radiation quanta couples the hydrodynamic equations to those of radiative transfer (see Munier &amp; Weaver (1986a) and Munier &amp; Weaver (1986b)). The numerical treatment has to account for their potential stiffness (e.g., in optically thick environments). In this article, we will present a new method to numerically integrate these equations in a stable way by using minimally implicit Runge-Kutta methods. With these methods, the inversion of the implicit operator can be done analytically, so the computational cost is equivalent to that of an explicit method. We strongly take into account the physical behavior of the evolved variables in the limit of the stiff regime in the derivation of the methods. We will show the results of applying these methods to the reactions between neutrinos and matter in some tests and also in realistic core-collapse supernovae simulations.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic field in a cavity induced by gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The detection method of gravitational waves (GW) using electromagnetic (EM) cavities has garnered significant attention in recent years. This paper thoroughly examines the analysis for the perturbation of the EM field and raises some issues in the existing literature. Our work demonstrates that the rigidity condition imposed on the material, as provided in the literature, is inappropriate due to its reliance on a gauge-dependent quantity that cannot be controlled experimentally. Instead, we incorporate elasticity into the material and revise the governing equations for the electric field induced by GWs, expressing them solely in terms of gauge-invariant quantities. Applying these equations to cylindrical cavities, we present the GW antenna patterns for the detector.</description>

      <title>A Data-Driven Search For Mid-Infrared Excesses Among Five Million Main-Sequence FGK Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stellar infrared excesses can indicate various phenomena of interest, from protoplanetary disks to debris disks, or (more speculatively) techno-signatures along the lines of Dyson spheres. In this paper, we conduct a large search for such excesses, designed as a data-driven contextual anomaly detection pipeline. We focus our search on FGK stars close to the main sequence to favour non-young host stars. We look for excess in the mid-infrared, unlocking a large sample to search in while favouring extreme IR excess akin to the ones produced by Extreme Debris Disks (EDD). We combine observations from ESA Gaia DR3, 2MASS, and the unWISE of NASA WISE, and create a catalogue of 4,898,812 stars with $G &lt; 16$ mag. We consider a star to have an excess if it is substantially brighter in $W1$ and $W2$ bands than what is predicted from an ensemble of machine-learning models trained on the data, taking optical and near-infrared information as input features. We apply a set of additional cuts (derived from the ML models and the objects' astronomical features) to avoid false-positive and identify a set of 53 objects (a rate of $1.1\times 10^{-5}$), including one previously identified EDD candidate. Typical infrared-excess fractional luminosities we find are in the range 0.005 to 0.1, consistent with known EDDs.</description>

      <title>WALLABY Pilot Survey: HI source-finding with a machine learning framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The data volumes generated by the WALLABY atomic Hydrogen (HI) survey using the Australiian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) necessitate greater automation and reliable automation in the task of source-finding and cataloguing. To this end, we introduce and explore a novel deep learning framework for detecting low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) HI sources in an automated fashion. Specfically, our proposed method provides an automated process for separating true HI detections from false positives when used in combination with the Source Finding Application (SoFiA) output candidate catalogues. Leveraging the spatial and depth capabilities of 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), our method is specifically designed to recognise patterns and features in three-dimensional space, making it uniquely suited for rejecting false positive sources in low SNR scenarios generated by conventional linear methods. As a result, our approach is significantly more accurate in source detection and results in considerably fewer false detections compared to previous linear statistics-based source finding algorithms. Performance tests using mock galaxies injected into real ASKAP data cubes reveal our method's capability to achieve near-100% completeness and reliability at a relatively low integrated SNR~3-5. An at-scale version of this tool will greatly maximise the science output from the upcoming widefield HI surveys.</description>
