      <title>Mean Field Game of High-Frequency Anticipatory Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interactions between a large population of high-frequency traders (HFTs) and a large trader (LT) who executes a certain amount of assets at discrete time points are studied. HFTs are faster in the sense that they trade continuously and predict the transactions of LT. A jump process is applied to model the transition of HFTs' attitudes towards inventories and the equilibrium is solved through the mean field game approach. When the crowd of HFTs is averse to running (ending) inventories, they first take then supply liquidity at each transaction of LT (throughout the whole execution period). Inventory-averse HFTs lower LT's costs if the market temporary impact is relatively large to the permanent one. What's more, the repeated liquidity consuming-supplying behavior of HFTs makes LT's optimal strategy close to uniform trading.</description>

      <title>A pure dual approach for hedging Bermudan options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a new dual approach to compute the hedging portfolio of a Bermudan option and its initial value. It gives a "purely dual" algorithm following the spirit of Rogers (2010) in the sense that it only relies on the dual pricing formula. The key is to rewrite the dual formula as an excess reward representation and to combine it with a strict convexification technique. The hedging strategy is then obtained by using a Monte Carlo method, solving backward a sequence of least square problems. We show convergence results for our algorithm and test it on many different Bermudan options. Beyond giving directly the hedging portfolio, the strength of the algorithm is to assess both the relevance of including financial instruments in the hedging portfolio and the effect of the rebalancing frequency.</description>

      <title>Pricing and hedging short-maturity Asian options in local volatility models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.12944</link>
      <description>arXiv:1911.12944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper discusses the short-maturity behavior of Asian option prices and hedging portfolios. We consider the risk-neutral valuation and the delta value of the Asian option having a H\"older continuous payoff function in a local volatility model. The main idea of this analysis is that the local volatility model can be approximated by a Gaussian process at short maturity $T.$ By combining this approximation argument with Malliavin calculus, we conclude that the short-maturity behaviors of Asian option prices and the delta values are approximately expressed as those of their European counterparts with volatility $$\sigma_{A}(T):=\sqrt{\frac{1}{T^3}\int_0^T\sigma^2(t,S_0)(T-t)^2\,dt}\,,$$ where $\sigma(\cdot,\cdot)$ is the local volatility function and $S_0$ is the initial value of the stock. In addition, we show that the convergence rate of the approximation is determined by the H\"older exponent of the payoff function. Finally, the short-maturity asymptotics of Asian call and put options are discussed from the viewpoint of the large deviation principle.</description>

      <title>Time-inconsistent mean field and n-agent games under relative performance criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study a time-inconsistent portfolio optimization problem for competitive agents with CARA utilities and non-exponential discounting. The utility of each agent depends on her own wealth and consumption as well as the relative wealth and consumption to her competitors. Due to the presence of a non-exponential discount factor, each agent's optimal strategy becomes time-inconsistent. In order to resolve time-inconsistency, each agent makes a decision in a sophisticated way, choosing open-loop equilibrium strategy in response to the strategies of all the other agents. We construct explicit solutions for the $n$-agent games and the corresponding mean field games (MFGs) where the limit of former yields the latter. This solution is unique in a special class of equilibria.</description>
