      <title>The Kontsevich invariant and the action of the Grothendieck--Teichm\"{u}ller group on $2$-component string links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kontsevich invariant of links is independent of the choice of associator, whereas for tangles this is not the case in general. In this paper, we focus on $2$-component string links and investigate to what extent the Kontsevich invariant depends on the choice of associator. As an application, we show that the action of the unipotent part of the Grothendieck--Teichm\"{u}ller group on the algebra of proalgebraic $2$-component string links is non-trivial, which provides a partial answer to a problem posed by Furusho.</description>

      <title>New universal vertex algebras as glueings of the basic ones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are three universal $2$-parameter vertex algebras $\mathcal{W}_{\infty}$, $\mathcal{W}^{\text{ev}}_{\infty}$, and $\mathcal{W}^{\mathfrak{sp}}_{\infty}$ which are freely generated of types $\mathcal{W}(2,3,4,\dots)$, $\mathcal{W}(2,4,6,\dots)$, and $\mathcal{W}(1^3, 2, 3^3, 4,\dots)$, respectively. They serve as classifying objects for vertex algebras with these generating types satisfying mild hypotheses. Their $1$-parameter quotients are expected to be the building blocks of all $\mathcal{W}$-algebras of classical Lie types. Furthermore, such $\mathcal{W}$-algebras are expected to be organized into families that are governed by new universal $2$-parameter vertex algebras, which are themselves glueings of copies of $\mathcal{W}_{\infty}$ in type $A$ (together with a Heisenberg algebra), and copies of $\mathcal{W}^{\text{ev}}_{\infty}$ and $\mathcal{W}^{\mathfrak{sp}}_{\infty}$ in types $B$, $C$, and $D$. We denote these universal objects by $\mathcal{W}^{X,S,M}_{\infty}$, where $X$ denotes the Lie type (either $A$, $C$, or $BD$ since types $B$ and $D$ can be treated uniformly), and $S$, $M$ are sets of positive integers that determine certain families of partitions. More precisely, for a partition $P = (n_0^{m_0}, n_1^{m_1},\dots, n_{t}^{m_t})$ of $N = \sum_{i=0}^t n_i m_i$ consisting of $m_i$ parts of size $n_i$, where $n_0&gt; n_1 &gt; \cdots &gt; n_t \geq 2$, $M = \{m_0,\dots, m_t\}$ is the set of multiplicities, and $S = \{d_1,\dots, d_t\}$ is the set of height differences $d_{i+1} = n_i - n_{i+1}$. After introducing this general conjectural picture, we will construct the first nontrivial example $\mathcal{W}^{\mathfrak{so}_2}_{\infty}:=\mathcal{W}^{BD, \emptyset, \{2\}}_{\infty}$, which is a glueing of two copies of $\mathcal{W}^{\text{ev}}_{\infty}$.</description>

      <title>Quantum upper triangular matrix algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the ideas in~\cite{yM88} and some inspiration from~\cite{KO24}, we construct a bialgebra $T_q(n)$ and a pointed Hopf algebra $UT_q(n)$ which quantize the coordinate rings of the algebra of upper triangular matrices and of the group of invertible upper triangular matrices of size $n\geq 2$, respectively, where $q$ is a nonzero parameter. The resulting structure on $UT_q(n)$ is neither commutative nor cocommutative, so we obtain a quantum group. The motivation comes from the idea of quantizing the incidence algebra of a finite poset, as the latter can be embedded as a subalgebra of the algebra of upper triangular matrices. After defining the bialgebra $T_q(n)$ and the Hopf algebra $UT_q(n)$, we study and compare their Lie algebras of derivations, their automorphism groups and their low degree Hochschild cohomology, in case $n=2$.</description>

      <title>Pivotal Module Categories, Factorization Homology and Modular Invariant Modified Traces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The algebraic notion of a pivotal module category was developed by Schaumann and Shimizu and is central to the description of boundary conditions in conformal field theory according to a proposal by Fuchs and Schweigert. In this paper, we present a large class of examples of pivotal module categories of topological origin: For a unimodular finite ribbon category $\mathcal{A}$, we prove that the factorization homology $\int_\Sigma \mathcal{A}$ of a compact oriented surface $\Sigma$ with $n$ marked boundary intervals, at least one per connected component, comes with the structure of a pivotal module category over $\mathcal{A}^{\boxtimes n}$. This endows the internal skein algebras of Ben-Zvi-Brochier-Jordan, in particular the elliptic double, with a symmetric Frobenius structure. As application, we obtain, for each choice of $\mathcal{A}$, a family of full open conformal field theories, each of which comes with correlation functions for all surfaces with marked boundary intervals that are explicitly computable using factorization homology. As a further application, we explain how modified traces can be 'integrated' over surfaces: We show that the modified trace for $\mathcal{A}$ extends in a canonical way to the factorization homology of $\Sigma$. The resulting traces have the remarkable property of being modular invariant, i.e. fixed by the mapping class group action.</description>

      <title>Merge on workspaces as Hopf algebra Markov chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamical properties of a Hopf algebra Markov chain with state space the binary rooted forests with labelled leaves. This Markovian dynamical system describes the core computational process of structure formation and transformation in syntax via the Merge operation, according to Chomsky's Minimalism model of generative linguistics. The dynamics decomposes into an ergodic dynamical system with uniform stationary distribution, given by the action of Internal Merge, while the contributions of External Merge and (a minimal form of) Sideward Merge reduce to a simpler Markov chain with state space the set of partitions and with combinatorial weights. The Sideward Merge part of the dynamics prevents convergence to fully formed connected structures (trees), unless the different forms of Merge are weighted by a cost function, as predicted by linguistic theory. Results on the asymptotic behavior of the Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue and eigenvector in this weighted case, obtained in terms of an associated Perron-Frobenius problem in the tropical semiring, show that the usual cost functions (Minimal Search and Resource Restrictions) proposed in the linguistic literature do not suffice to obtain convergence to the tree structures, while an additional optimization property based on the Shannon entropy achieves the expected result for the dynamics. We also comment on the introduction of continuous parameters related to semantic embedding and other computational models, and also on some filtering of the dynamics by coloring rules that model the linguistic filtering by theta roles and phase structure, and on parametric variation and the process of parameter setting in Externalization.</description>

      <title>Classical and Quantum Algorithms for Topological Invariants of Torus Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computing topological invariants of 3-manifolds is generally intractable, yet specialized algebraic structures can enable efficient algorithms. For Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev (WRT) invariants of torus bundles, we exploit the non-commutative torus structure to embed the skein algebra of the closed torus into its symmetric subalgebra at roots of unity. This yields a fixed $N^2$-dimensional representation that supports polynomial-time classical computation with $O(N^2)$ space, and a quantum algorithm using only $O(\log N)$ qubits -- an exponential space advantage. We further prove that extracting individual expansion coefficients is #P-complete, yet there is a quantum algorithm that can efficiently approximate these coefficients for a non-negligible fraction of configurations.</description>

      <title>Non-invertible defects from the Conway SCFT to K3 sigma models II: duality and Fibonacci defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue the study, initiated in [hep-th:2504.18619], of topological defect lines (TDLs) in the Conway module $V^{f \natural}$ and K3 non-linear sigma models (NLSMs). In the case of $V^{f \natural}$, we fully classify the potential $N=1$ (and $N=4$)--preserving duality defects for cyclic Tambara--Yamagami categories TY$(\mathbb{Z}_N)$, noting a curious relation to genus zero groups of monstrous moonshine. We use the correspondence with Leech lattice endomorphisms, discovered in [hep-th:2504.18619], to construct a number of non-trivial examples of TDLs in $V^{f \natural}$, including examples of irrational quantum dimension. In particular, we fully classify and construct defects for the TY$(\mathbb{Z}_2)$ and TY$(\mathbb{Z}_3)$ cases, and provide examples of duality defects for TY$(\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2)$ and Fibonacci fusion categories as well. In the case of K3 NLSMs, we describe a duality defect of irrational quantum dimension $\sqrt{2}$ for the category TY$(\mathbb{Z}_2, -1)$ in a particular torus orbifold, which exists on a 16-dimensional slice of the moduli space. We also provide a detailed analysis of spectral flow--preserving TDLs in Gepner models of K3, of independent interest, and use this to construct non-invertible defects for Fibonacci and $Rep(S_3)$ categories in particular examples. Finally we provide evidence for our conjecture in [hep-th:2504.18619] that special subcategories of such TDLs in $V^{f \natural}$ correspond to $N=(4,4)$ and spectral flow--preserving defect lines in a corresponding K3 NLSM. In particular, we compute defect--twined elliptic genera for all non-invertible defects constructed in this article, demonstrating that for each defect found in a K3 NLSM, there is a corresponding defect in $V^{f \natural}$ with coincident twining genus, and making a prediction for a number of TDLs in K3 NLSMs yet to be found.</description>
