      <title>An introduction to monitored quantum systems and quantum trajectories: spectrum, typicality, and phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thanks to recent experimental advances in simulating and detecting quantum dynamics with high precision and controllability, our understanding of the physics of monitored quantum systems has considerably deepened over the past decades. In this article, we provide an introductory theoretical review on the basic formalisms governing open quantum dynamics under measurement, along with recent developments in their spectral and typical aspects. After reviewing quantum measurement theory, we introduce the concept of quantum trajectories, which are the conditional dynamics of monitored states shaped by a set of measurement outcomes. We then discuss the spectral properties of the dynamical map describing the evolution averaged over measurement outcomes. As has recently been recognized, these spectral features are intimately connected to whether quantum trajectories exhibit typical behaviors, such as the ergodicity and purification. Moreover, we introduce Lyapunov exponents of typical quantum trajectories and discuss how these quantities serve as indicators of measurement-induced phase transitions in monitored quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Critical Temperature(s) of Sierpi\'{n}ski Carpet(s)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a key algorithmic improvement to the generalized combinatorial Feynman--Vdovichenko method for calculating the critical temperature of the Ising model on Sierpi\'{n}ski carpets $SC_k(a,b)$, originally introduced in {\tt arxiv:1505.02699}. By reformulating the method in terms of purely real-valued transfer matrices, we substantially reduce their dimension. This optimization, together with modern computational resources, enables us to reach generation $k=10$ for the canonical $SC_k(3,1)$ carpet. Extrapolation from these data yields the most accurate estimate to date of the critical temperature $T_c^{(3,1)} = 1.4782927(26)$. We further extend the analysis to additional members of the $SC_k(a,b)$ family and report their corresponding critical temperatures.</description>

      <title>Optimal navigation in a noisy environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Navigating toward a known target in a noisy environment is a fundamental problem shared across biological, physical, and engineered systems. Although optimal strategies are often framed in terms of continuous, fine-grained feedback, we show that efficient navigation emerges from a far simpler principle: natural wandering punctuated by intermittent course corrections. Using a controlled robotic platform, active Brownian particle simulations, and scaling theory, we identify a universal trade-off between noise-induced deviation and the finite cost of reorientation, yielding an optimal course correction frequency governed by only a few system parameters. Despite their differing levels of complexity, our experiment and theory collapse onto common quantitative signatures, including first-passage time distribution and non-Gaussian angular dispersion. Our results establish intermittent course-correction as a minimal and robust alternative to continuous feedback, offering a unifying guiding principle for point-to-point navigation in complex environments.</description>

      <title>Run and Tumble Dynamics of Biased Quantum Trajectories in a Monitored Qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the active stochastic dynamics of a qubit subjected to continuous measurement and conditional feedback. The stochastic equation governing the state vector trajectory of the qubit can be mapped, in the high-diffusion limit, to the dynamics of a classical persistent Run-and-Tumble Particle (p-RTP) in a bounded one-dimensional domain. The mapping enables us to use analytical results from classical active matter to derive an approximate non-equilibrium steady-state (NESS) distribution for the monitored quantum system. The competition between the coherent Rabi drive and the measurement-induced feedback leads to a rich NESS phase displaying Zeno--anti-Zeno transition--which is statistically equivalent to the propulsion-induced trapping observed in confined active particles.</description>

      <title>First results of the Tritium Absorption InfraRed Spectroscopy (T2ApIR) experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The literature on experimentally verified material properties of tritium is sparse but information about this is crucial in fusion for pellet production (Magnetic Confined Fusion), target fueling (Inertial Confined Fusion), cryogenic distillation, as well as in astroparticle physics for neutrino experiments, and search for rare physics. To improve on this, the T$_2$ApIR experiment has been designed and built at the Tritium Laboratory Karlsruhe (TLK), and is in its scientific commissioning phase. The main focus of this experiment is to enable the investigation of the properties of all six hydrogen isotopologues and their mixtures in the gaseous, liquid, and solid phase, as well as the dynamics of their phase changes. In addition, mixtures with noble gases such as xenon and neon can be investigated. This is achieved using a cryogenic setup capable of reaching less than 10 in a measurement cell that allows optical access for infrared absorption spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and a polariscope setup, as well as temperature and pressure measurement.</description>

      <title>Theory of Scalable Spin Squeezing with Disordered Quantum Dipoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin squeezed entanglement enables metrological precision beyond the classical limit. Understood through the lens of continuous symmetry breaking, dipolar spin systems exhibit the remarkable ability to generate spin squeezing via their intrinsic quench dynamics. To date, this understanding has primarily focused on lattice spin systems; in practice however, dipolar spin systems$\unicode{x2014}$ranging from ultracold molecules to nuclear spin ensembles and solid-state color centers$\unicode{x2014}$often exhibit significant amounts of positional disorder. Here, we develop a theory for scalable spin squeezing in a two-dimensional randomly diluted lattice of quantum dipoles, which naturally realize a dipolar XXZ model. Via extensive quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we map out the phase diagram for finite-temperature XY order, and by extension scalable spin squeezing, as a function of both disorder and Ising anisotropy. As the disorder increases, we find that scalable spin squeezing survives only near the Heisenberg point. We show that this behavior is due to the presence of rare tightly-coupled dimers, which effectively heat the system post-quench. In the case of strongly-interacting nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, we demonstrate that an experimentally feasible strategy to decouple the problematic dimers from the dynamics is sufficient to enable scalable spin squeezing.</description>

      <title>Learning transitions of topological surface codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the surface code, topological quantum order allows one to encode logical quantum information in a robust, long-range entangled many-body quantum state. However, if an observer probes this quantum state by performing measurements on the underlying qubits, thereby collecting an ensemble of highly correlated classical snapshots, two closely related questions arise: (i) do measurements decohere the topological order of the quantum state; and (ii) how much of the logical information can one learn from the snapshots? Here we address these questions for measurements in a uniform basis on all qubits. We find that for generic measurement angles, sufficiently far away from the Clifford X, Y, and Z directions (such as the X+Y+Z basis) the logical information is never lost in one of the following two ways: (i) for weak measurement, the topological order is absolutely robust; (ii) for projective measurement, the quantum state inevitably collapses, but the logical quantum information is faithfully transferred from the quantum system to the observer in the form of a tomographically complete classical shadow. At these generic measurement angles and in the projective-measurement limit, the measurement ensemble enforced by Born probabilities can be represented by a 2D tensor network that can be fermionized into a disordered, free-fermion network model in symmetry class DIII, which gives rise to a Majorana "metal" phase. When the measurement angle is biased towards the X or Z limits, a critical angle indicates the threshold of a learning transition beyond which the classical shadow no longer reveals full tomographic information (but reduces to a measurement of the logical X or Z state). This learning transition can be described in the language of the network model as a "metal to insulator" transition...</description>

      <title>Ergotropy of quantum many-body scars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars break ergodicity and evade thermalization, resulting in area law entanglement entropy even with high energy density. While their quantum correlations and entanglement have been elaborated previously, their capacity in storing extractable energy, quantified by the notion ergotropy, remains an open question. Here we focus on the representative PXP model, and unveil the extensive ergotropy scaling of a family of states interpolating between quantum many-body scars and thermal states, the latter of which are known to be passive with vanishing ergotropy. A phenomenological relation between ergotropy and entanglement is uncovered, which generalizes the existing free fermion integrable results to an interacting scenario. The ergotropy in a dynamical protocol shows that a reset with a global uniform coherent rotation can inject extractable energy, as a proof of principle way to charge a quantum "battery". Our protocol is tailored for near term Rydberg neutral atoms array, while also being feasible for other quantum processors. Our results establish that quantum many-body scars, despite the tiny fraction of the Hilbert space they occupy, can be efficiently exploited for storing extractable energy, and "scarring" a many-body system as a promising route for engineering quantum many-body battery.</description>

      <title>Fundamentals of quantum Boltzmann machine learning with visible and hidden units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the primary applications of classical Boltzmann machines is generative modeling, wherein the goal is to tune the parameters of a model distribution so that it closely approximates a target distribution. Training relies on estimating the gradient of the relative entropy between the target and model distributions, a task that is well understood when the classical Boltzmann machine has both visible and hidden units. For some years now, it has been an obstacle to generalize this finding to quantum state learning with quantum Boltzmann machines that have both visible and hidden units. In this paper, I derive an analytical expression for the gradient of the quantum relative entropy between a target quantum state and the reduced state of the visible units of a quantum Boltzmann machine. Crucially, this expression is amenable to estimation on a quantum computer, as it involves modular-flow-generated unitary rotations reminiscent of those appearing in my prior work on rotated Petz recovery maps. This leads to a quantum algorithm for gradient estimation in this setting. I then specialize the setting to quantum visible units and classical hidden units, and vice versa, and provide analytical expressions for the gradients, along with quantum algorithms for estimating them. Finally, I replace the quantum relative entropy objective function with the Petz-Tsallis relative entropy; here I develop an analytical expression for the gradient and sketch a quantum algorithm for estimating it, as an application of a novel formula for the derivative of the matrix power function, which also involves modular-flow-generated unitary rotations. Ultimately, this paper demarcates progress in training quantum Boltzmann machines with visible and hidden units for generative modeling and quantum state learning.</description>

      <title>The relation between classical and quantum Lyapunov exponent and the bound on chaos in classically chaotic quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Out-of-Time-Ordered Commutators (OTOCs), representing a key diagnostic for scrambling as a facet of short-time quantum chaos, have attracted wide-ranging interest, from many-body physics to quantum gravity. By means of a suitable form of the Wigner-Moyal expansion, and invoking ensemble equivalence in statistical physics, we provide a consistent approach to the growth rate of the OTOC for many-body systems with chaotic classical limit where both the classical Lyapunov exponent and the quantum nature of the density of states enter. Applying this construction to quantized high-dimensional hyperbolic motion, i.e., a quantum chaotic system that exhibits gravity-like correlation functions in the late-time regime, we compute the OTOC growth rate $\Lambda$ as a function of the number of degrees of freedom, $f$, and inverse temperature, $\beta$.
  We show that the scaled growth rate, $\Lambda/f$, can be described by a universal function of $f \beta$ and displays a cross-over from classical to quantum behavior as we increase $f$ and/or lower the temperature. In the deep quantum regime of infinite $f$, we find maximally fast scrambling in the sense of the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford bound on chaos. This elucidates the non-perturbative mechanism underlying the saturation of the bound via quantum contributions to the mean density of states, and it provides further support for this dynamical system as a dual to two-dimensional quantum gravity. In this way, we present first evidence of maximally fast scrambling in a quantum chaotic system with a well-defined classical Hamiltonian limit, without invoking any external mechanism such as (disorder) averaging.</description>

      <title>Entanglement of General Subregions in Time-Dependent States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified framework for computing R\'enyi and entanglement entropies of arbitrary spacetime intervals in time-dependent states of $(1+1)$-dimensional conformal field theories. By combining the spacetime density matrix formalism with the replica method, we show that entanglement entropy is well defined for both spacelike and timelike separations. Applying this framework to global quenches prepared by boundary states and to local quenches generated by operator insertions, we obtain analytic expressions for the entanglement entropy in general spacetime configurations. The results reveal qualitative differences between spacelike and timelike intervals: the timelike entanglement entropy is time-independent in the global quench model, depends solely on the temporal separation, and universally exhibits a constant imaginary contribution. These features are naturally explained by a generalized quasiparticle picture in which entanglement is produced precisely when one worldline of each quasiparticle pair intersects the interval. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the linear sum rule relating time- and spacelike entanglement persists in both global and local quenches, indicating a broader universality of spacetime entanglement in real-time quantum dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We study the long-time behavior of a non-interacting two-dimensional quantum gas in a weak random potential with long-range correlations. Any peaked initial momentum distribution will eventually become isotropic and broaden due to scattering events with the random potential. We derive an expression for the long-time average of the momentum distribution and test it against computer simulations. We also discuss momentum isotropization and spatial diffusion.</description>

      <title>Active Brownian particles in power-law viscoelastic media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many active particles are embedded in environments that exhibit viscoelastic properties. An important class of such media lacks a single characteristic relaxation timescale when subjected to a time-dependent stress. Rather, the stress response spans a broad continuum of timescales, a behavior naturally described by a scale-free, fractal-like power-law relaxation modulus. Using a generalization of the fractional Langevin equation, we investigate an active Brownian particle embedded in a power-law viscoelastic environment with translational and rotational dynamics governed by independent fractional orders. We solve the model analytically, develop a numerical scheme to validate the theoretical predictions, and provide tools that can be used in further studies. A rich variety of diffusion regimes emerges, which modify the intermediate-time behavior of the mean squared displacement. Notably, we find that the competition between translational and rotational contributions favors a superdiffusive persistence over the standard ballistic motion, and over-stretches its characteristic timescale, fundamentally altering the standard relation between persistence and propulsion in active matter.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Chaos and Defect Proliferation in Polar-Apolar Active Mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chaotic transitions in inertial fluids typically proceed through a direct energy cascade from large to small scales. In contrast, active systems, composed of self propelled units, inject energy at microscopic scales and therefore exhibit an inverse cascade, giving rise to distinctly unconventional flow patterns. Here, we investigate an active mixture consisting of both apolar and polar self driven components, a setting expected to display richer behaviours than those found in living liquid crystal (LLC) systems, where the apolar constituent is passive. Using numerical solutions of the corresponding hydrodynamic equations, we uncover a variety of complex dynamical states. Our results reveal a non-monotonic response of the apolar species to changes in the density and activity of the polar component. In an intermediate regime, reminiscent of LLC-induced disorder, the system develops a dynamically disordered phase characterised by high-density, chaotically evolving band-like structures and by the continual creation and annihilation of half integer topological defects. We show that this regime exhibits spatiotemporal chaos, which we quantify through two complementary measures: the spectral properties of density fluctuations and the maximal Lyapunov exponent.

      <title>Local composition fluctuations act as precursors for crystal nucleation in polydisperse hard spheres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the effect of polydispersity on the crystal nucleation of hard spheres. Using event-driven molecular dynamics simulations, we obtain the nucleation rate as a function of the supersaturation for a range of polydispersities, and demonstrate that the nucleation rate of polydisperse hard spheres deviates from the trend of monodisperse hard spheres, even when mapped to the effective packing fraction. Furthermore, we show that nucleation tends to originate in regions with on average more larger-sized particles, indicating that such regions act as precursors for nucleation in systems of polydisperse hard spheres.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two prescriptions, the expansion of near horizon of geometry and expansion of metric with zero limit of the expansion parameter $c$ (speed of light in vacuum), of constructing Carroll geometries are known to complement each other. The entropy of an ideal gas, confined in a box and kept very near to the horizon, depends on the transverse area of the container. We show this by using the Carroll geometry constructed through the expansion of the metric and then taking zero limit of the expansion parameter $c$. Therefore the present analysis re-assures the complementing nature of two ways of finding the Carroll geometry from the thermodynamical point of view.</description>

      <title>Profusion of Symmetry-Protected Qubits from Stable Ergodicity Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how combining a discrete symmetry with topological Hilbert space fragmentation can give rise to exponentially many topologically stable qubits protected by a single discrete symmetry. We illustrate this explicitly with the example of the $\mathsf{CZ}_p$ model, where the encoded qubits are stable to arbitrary symmetry-respecting perturbations for parametrically long times, substantially enhancing the robustness of a recently proposed construction based on nontopological fragmentation. In this model, the encoded qubits naturally come in pairs for which a universal set of transversal logical gates can be performed, ruling out (by the Eastin-Knill theorem) the possibility of using them for quantum error correction. We also comment on the combination of symmetry enrichment and topological fragmentation more generally, and the implications for use of systems exhibiting Hilbert space fragmentation as quantum memories.</description>

      <title>The role of charge in thermodynamic uncertainty relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the charge value of transport mechanisms heavily impacts the validity of thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs). Specifically, we show within the framework of full counting statistics, that the recently established quantum TUR can be violated by the presence of transport processes that carry more than one charge, like Andreev reflection processes in normal metal-superconductor junctions. We propose a modified quantum TUR, which incorporates the charge value and demonstrate that this charge-dependent quantum TUR can only be violated if the highest charge transport process exceeds this charge value. In particular, we establish that the breaking of the quantum TUR solely originates from the charge value of the highest charge transport process. Namely, our analytical considerations do not invoke the existence of superconductivity, and these considerations generally hold for non-interacting electronic transport which can be described by the scattering formalism.</description>

Abstract: We examine the distinct discrete time crystals (DTCs) that emerge in the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, subjected to spatially nonuniform periodic driving. Intriguingly, we demonstrate that by appropriately tailoring the drive protocol, distinct DTC orders can be realized in different spatial regions of the system. Consequently, the system exhibits spatially varying sub-harmonic responses with distinct frequencies. We employ a semi-classical analysis to establish the stability of these co-existing DTC orders in the thermodynamic limit. Furthermore, we establish the stability of the stability of these co-existing DTCs in the presence of quantum fluctuations. Our results establish spatially structured driving as a powerful route to engineer novel forms of time-crystalline order.</description>

      <title>Tunably realizing flat-bands and exceptional points in kinetically frustrated systems: An example on the non-Hermitian Creutz ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a non-Hermitian extension of the Creutz ladder with generic non-reciprocal hopping. By mapping the ladder onto two decoupled non-Hermitian Su--Schrieffer--Heeger (SSH) chains, we uncover a rich structure in parameter space under different boundary conditions. Under periodic boundary conditions, the spectrum admits a fine-tuned line in parameter space with entirely real eigenvalues, while deviations from this line induce a real--complex spectral transition without crossing exceptional points. In contrast, an exact analytical diagonalization under open boundary conditions reveals extended regions in parameter space with purely real or purely imaginary spectra, separated from complex spectral domains by exceptional lines. The intersections of these exceptional lines define triple-junction points where distinct spectral regimes meet, giving rise to a structured phase diagram that is absent under periodic boundary conditions. We further show that flat bands in this system can occur both as Hermitian diabolical points and as non-Hermitian exceptional points, known as exceptional flat bands, where the dynamics is more stringent than in the Hermitian case, leading to distinct spectral and dynamical signatures.</description>

      <title>Consistent time reversal and reliable and accurate inference in the presence of memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11819v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermodynamic inference from coarse observations remains a key challenge. Memory, in particular correlations between consecutively observed mesostates, blur signatures of irreversibility and must be accounted for in defining physical time-reversal, which remains an open problem. We derive an experimentally accessible k-th order estimator for the entropy production rate. Using novel measure-theoretic techniques we prove necessary and sufficient conditions for guaranteed lower bounds on the dissipation even in the strongly non-Markovian setting. The proof reveals that estimators saturated in the order unravel the duration of memory which needs to be considered in defining physically consistent time-reversal. We show that Markovian estimators in absence of a time-scale separation lead to artifacts, which convey no physical meaning. Similarly, estimators not saturated in the order may overestimate the dissipation. The necessity of correctly accounting for memory in thermodynamic inference from strongly non-Markovian observations underscores the still underappreciated challenges and intricacies in defining and understanding irreversibility in presence of memory. Our results will hopefully stimulate experiments systematically considering thermodynamic inference on multiple scales consistently accounting for memory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a class of stochastic processes in which the large deviation functions of time-integrated observables exhibit singularities that relate to dynamical phase transitions of trajectories. These illustrative examples include Brownian motion with a death rate or in the presence of an absorbing wall, for which we consider a set of empirical observables such as the net displacement, local time, residence time, and area under the trajectory. Using a backward Fokker-Planck approach, we derive the large deviation functions of these observables, and demonstrate how singularities emerge from a competition between survival and diffusion. Furthermore, we analyse this scenario using an alternative approach with tilted operators, showing that at the singular point, the effective dynamics undergoes an abrupt transition. Extending this approach, we show that similar transitions may generically arise in Markov chains with transient states. This scenario is robust and generalizable for non-Markovian dynamics and for many-body systems, potentially leading to multiple dynamical phase transitions. We have confirmed most of our findings on the singular large-deviation function using rare-event simulation techniques.</description>

      <title>Diffusion with stochastic resetting on a lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19903v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide an exact formula for the mean first-passage time (MFPT) to a target at the origin for a single particle diffusing on a $d$-dimensional hypercubic {\em lattice} starting from a fixed initial position $\vec R_0$ and resetting to $\vec R_0$ with a rate $r$. Previously known results in the continuous space are recovered in the scaling limit $r\to 0$, $R_0=|\vec R_0|\to \infty$ with the product $\sqrt{r}\, R_0$ fixed. However, our formula is valid for any $r$ and any $\vec R_0$ that enables us to explore a much wider region of the parameter space that is inaccessible in the continuum limit. For example, we have shown that the MFPT, as a function of $r$ for fixed $\vec R_0$, diverges in the two opposite limits $r\to 0$ and $r\to \infty$ with a unique minimum in between, provided the starting point is not a nearest neighbour of the target. In this case, the MFPT diverges as a power law $\sim r^{\phi}$ as $r\to \infty$, but very interestingly with an exponent $\phi= (|m_1|+|m_2|+\ldots +|m_d|)-1$ that depends on the starting point $\vec R_0= a\, (m_1,m_2,\ldots, m_d)$ where $a$ is the lattice spacing and $m_i$'s are integers. If, on the other hand, the starting point happens to be a nearest neighbour of the target, then the MFPT decreases monotonically with increasing $r$, approaching a universal limiting value $1$ as $r\to \infty$, indicating that the optimal resetting rate in this case is infinity. We provide a simple physical reason and a simple Markov-chain explanation behind this somewhat unexpected universal result. Our analytical predictions are verified in numerical simulations on lattices up to $50$ dimensions. Finally, in the absence of a target, we also compute exactly the position distribution of the walker in the nonequlibrium stationary state that also displays interesting lattice effects not captured by the continuum theory.</description>

      <title>The Thermodynamic Limit of Extreme First-Passage Times</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06098v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The statistics of the slowest first-passage time among a large population of $N$ searchers is crucial for determining the completion time of many stochastic processes. Classical extreme-value theory predicts that for diffusing particles in a finite domain of size $L$, the slowest first passage time follows a Gumbel distribution, but a Fr\'echet distribution in an infinite domain. Here, we study the physically relevant thermodynamic limit where both $N$ and $L$ diverge while the density $\rho = N/L$ remains constant. We obtain an explicit solution for the extreme value in the thermodynamic limit, which recovers the Fr\'echet and Gumbel distributions in the low- and high-density limits, respectively, and reveals new, nontrivial behavior at intermediate densities. We then extend the framework to compact diffusion on fractal domains, showing that the walk dimension $d_w$ and fractal dimension $d_f$ control the extreme-value statistics via geometry-dependent scaling. The theory yields the full set of moments and finite-density corrections, providing a unified description of slowest-arrival times in confined Euclidean and fractal media.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we employ a semiperturbative theory to study the statistical structural properties of energy eigenfunctions (EFs) in many-body quantum chaotic systems consisting of a central system coupled to an environment. Under certain assumptions, we derive both the average shape and the statistical fluctuations of EFs on the basis formed by the direct product of the energy eigenbases of the system and the environment. Furthermore, we apply our results to two fundamental questions: (i) the properties of the reduced density matrix of the central system in an eigenstate, and (ii) the structure of the off-diagonal smooth function within the framework of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Numerical results are also presented in support of our main findings.</description>

      <title>Approach to Hyperuniformity in the One-Dimensional Facilitated Exclusion Process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the one-dimensional Facilitated Exclusion Process with initial state a product measure of density $\rho=1/2-\delta$, $\delta\ge0$, there exists an infinite-time limiting state $\nu_\rho$ in which all particles are isolated and hence cannot move. We study the variance $V(L)$, under $\nu_\rho$, of the number of particles in an interval of $L$ sites. Under $\nu_{1/2}$ either all odd or all even sites are occupied, so that $V(L)=0$ for $L$ even and $V(L)=1/4$ for $L$ odd: the state is hyperuniform, since $V(L)$ grows more slowly than $L$. We prove that for densities approaching 1/2 from below there exist three regimes in $L$, in which the variance grows at different rates: for $L\gg\delta^{-2}$, $V(L)\simeq\rho(1-\rho)L$, just as in the initial state; for $A(\delta)\ll L\ll\delta^{-2}$, with $A(\delta)=\delta^{-2/3}$ for $L$ odd and $A(\delta)=1$ for $L$ even, $V(L)\simeq CL^{3/2}$ with $C=2\sqrt{2/\pi}/3$; and for $L\ll\delta^{-2/3}$ with $L$ odd, $V(L)\simeq1/4$. The analysis is based on a careful study of a renewal process with a long tail. Our study is motivated by simulation results showing similar behavior in higher dimensions; we discuss this background briefly.</description>

      <title>The Physics of Local Optimization in Complex Disordered Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02927v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Limited resources motivate decomposing large-scale problems into smaller,``local" subsystems and stitching together the so-found solutions. We explore the physics underlying this approach and discuss the concept of ``local hardness", i.e., the complexity of predicting local properties of the solution from local information, for the ground-state problem of both P- and NP-hard spin-glasses and related frustrated spin systems. Depending on the model considered, we observe varying scaling behaviors in how errors associated with local predictions decay as a function of the size of the solved subsystem. These errors are intimately connected to global critical threshold instabilities, characterized by gapless, avalanche-like excitations that follow scale-invariant size distributions. Away from criticality, local solvers quickly achieve high accuracy, aligning closely with the results of the computationally much more expensive global minimization. We leverage these findings to introduce a heuristic contraction-based algorithm for globally studying spin-glass ground states. The local solvers further display sharp imprints of the phase transition from the spin-glass to the ferromagnetic phase as the distribution of spin-glass couplings is shifted, as well as characteristic differences for the infinite-range model, implying the existence of specific classes of local hardness. Our findings shed light on how Nature may operate solely through local actions at her disposal.</description>

      <title>Implementation and representation of qudit multi-controlled unitaries and hypergraph states by N-body angular momentum couplings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a representation of qudit multi-controlled unitary operators in terms of N-body angular momentum interactions. The representation is particularly convenient for odd-dimensional systems, with interesting connections to the Pegg-Barnett phase formalism. We illustrate the main points in the special case of qutrits, where simplifications and connections to dipole-quadrupole and quadrupole-quadrupole interactions can be established. We describe the representation of the closely related set of qudit hypergraph states, identifying possible realizations and their main obstacles. Qutrit tripartite controlled unitaries are decomposed in terms of more familiar two-body angular momentum couplings, enabling their implementation in a variety of physical systems. We give then a concrete example of implementation of qutrit unitaries and hypergraph states in optical systems that employs single-photon sources, two-mode cross-Kerr interactions and linear optical operations. Moreover, we define a new set of states, called angular momentum hypergraph states, which are more directly related to the angular momentum representation.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the dynamical and structural properties of absorbing phase transitions (APTs) within granular systems. Specifically, we examine a model for vibrofluidized systems of spherical grains, which undergo a transition from a state of purely vertical motion to one characterized by horizontal diffusion as the density increases. Numerical simulations reveal that, depending on the specific system parameters, both continuous and discontinuous transitions can occur, each associated with markedly distinct structural properties at the transition point. We explain this using a theoretical analysis based on kinetic theory applied to an effective 2D model, which elucidates the role of a synchronization effect in determining the nature of the transition. A fluctuating hydrodynamic theory, which quantitatively describes the structural and dynamical properties of the active state such as hyperuniformity is derived from the microscopic dynamics, together with an equilibrium-like assumption concerning the noises on the hydrodynamic fields. This work expands on previous studies by providing a comprehensive examination of the APT characteristics and proposing new theoretical models to interpret the observed behaviors.</description>

      <title>Path-Integral Formulation of Bosonic Markovian Open Quantum Dynamics with Monte Carlo stochastic trajectories using the Glauber-Sudarshan P, Wigner, and Husimi Q Functions and Hybrids</title>

Abstract: The Monte Carlo (MC) trajectory sampling of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) based on the quasiprobabilities, such as the Glauber-Sudarshan P, Wigner, and Husimi Q functions, enables us to investigate bosonic open quantum many-body dynamics described by the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) equation. In this method, the MC samplings for the initial distribution and stochastic noises incorporate quantum fluctuations, and thus, we can go beyond the mean-field approximation. However, description using SDEs is possible only when the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation has a positive-semidefinite diffusion matrix. In this work, we analytically derive the SDEs for arbitrary Hamiltonian and jump operators based on the path-integral formula, independently of the derivation of the Fokker-Planck equation (FPE). In the course of the derivation, we formulate the path-integral representation of the GKSL equation by using the $s$-ordered quasiprobability, which systematically describes the aforementioned quasiprobabilities by changing the real parameter $s$. The essential point of this derivation is that we employ the Hubbard-Stratonovich (HS) transformation in the path integral, and its application is not always feasible. We find that the feasible condition of the HS transformation is identical to the positive-semidefiniteness condition of the diffusion matrix in the FPE. In the benchmark calculations, we confirm that the MC simulations of the obtained SDEs well reproduce the exact dynamics of physical quantities and non-equal time correlation functions of numerically solvable models, including the Bose-Hubbard model. This work clarifies the applicability of the approximation and gives systematic and simplified procedures to obtain the SDEs to be numerically solved.</description>

      <title>Critical Dynamics of Superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20750v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use standard techniques of hydrodynamics to construct a relativistic effective field theory for the low energy dynamics of nearly critical superfluids. In an appropriate non-relativistic limit, our theory predicts an additional coefficient when compared and contrasted to earlier work of Khalatnikov and Lebedev. In addition, we provide an alternative derivation of the same effective theory, using the Keldysh-Schwinger framework for non-equilibrium systems. Finally, we comment on the comparison with the results of an appropriate holographic computation presented in a companion paper. This provides further evidence in support of the theory we propose and confirms the existence of the extra coefficient we identified.</description>
