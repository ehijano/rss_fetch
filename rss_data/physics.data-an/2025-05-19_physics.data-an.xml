      <title>MoreFit: A More Optimised, Rapid and Efficient Fit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameter estimation via unbinned maximum likelihood fits is a central technique in particle physics. This article introduces MoreFit, which aims to provide a more optimised, rapid and efficient fitting solution for unbinned maximum likelihood fits. MoreFit is developed with a focus on parallelism and relies on computation graphs that are compiled just-in-time. Several novel automatic optimisation techniques are employed on the computation graphs that significantly increase performance compared to conventional approaches. MoreFit can make efficient use of a wide range of heterogeneous platforms through its compute backends that rely on open standards. It provides an OpenCL backend for execution on GPUs of all major vendors, and a backend based on LLVM and Clang for single- or multithreaded execution on CPUs, which in addition allows for SIMD vectorisation. MoreFit is benchmarked against several other fitting frameworks and shows very promising performance, illustrating the power of the approach.</description>

      <title>IntrinsicTimescales.jl: A Julia package to estimate intrinsic (neural) timescales (INTs) from time-series data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: IntrinsicTimescales.jl is a Julia package to perform estimation of intrinsic neural timescales (INTs). INTs are defined as the time window in which prior information from an ongoing stimulus can affect the processing of newly arriving information. INTs are estimated either from the autocorrelation function (ACF) or the power spectral density (PSD) of time-series data. In addition to the model-free estimates of INTs, IntrinsicTimescales.jl offers implementations of novel techniques of timescale estimation via performing parameter estimation of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with adaptive approximate Bayesian computation (aABC) and automatic differentiation variational inference (ADVI).</description>

      <title>An outlook on the Rapid Decline of Carbon Sequestration in French Forests and associated reporting needs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present and discuss changes in carbon storage in the French forests from 1990 to 2022, derived from CITEPA statistics on forest carbon accounting, fed by National Forest Inventory (NFI) data collected through an extensive network of measurement sites across Metropolitan France, and other data sources as regards forest removals. The NFI is designed to provide statistical estimations of growing stock, gains and losses at the national or subnational levels but is unable, in its classical form, to provide detailed spatial outlook, such as on abrupt losses during fires, droughts and insect attacks. A continuing removal of CO2 from the atmosphere by the French forests occurred from 1990 to 2022, because harvest and mortality CO2 losses remained smaller than CO2 removals by forest growth and the increase in forest area (70,000 ha per year but insignificant in terms of increased carbon stocks at present). The CO2 removal by forests was 49.3 MtCO2 yr-1 in 1990, increased to reach a peak of 74.1 MtCO2 yr-1 in 2008 and then quickly decreased down to 37.8 Mton CO2 yr-1 in 2022. After 2017, the sink remained low and mortality rates stayed larger than during any of the previous years. This recent period is marked by climate shocks such as summer droughts and heatwaves in 2015, 2018, 2022, 2023. The full impacts of the droughts in 2022 and 2023 are not yet covered with full precision, as some of the sites measured by the national inventory before those droughts are still pending a second visit. The different regions of France show contrasted trajectories. Southern Mediterranean regions where forests have a low harvest rate have experienced a lower increase in mortality and a sustained CO2 uptake.</description>

      <title>A Universal Matrix Ensemble that Unifies Eigenspectrum Laws via Neural Network Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random matrix theory, which characterizes the spectrum distribution of infinitely large matrices, plays a central role in theories across diverse fields, including high-dimensional data analysis, ecology, neuroscience, and machine learning. Among its celebrated achievements, the Marchenko--Pastur law and the elliptic law have served as key results for numerous applications. However, the relationship between these two laws remains elusive, and the existence of a universal framework unifying them is unclear. Inspired by a neural network model, we establish a universal matrix ensemble that unifies these laws as special cases. Through an analysis based on the saddle-node equation, we derive an explicit expression for the spectrum distribution of the ensemble. As a direct application, we reveal how the universal law clarifies the stability of a class of associative memory neural networks. By uncovering a fundamental law of random matrix theory, our results deepen the understanding of high-dimensional systems and advance the integration of theories across multiple disciplines.</description>

      <title>WHALES: an optimized retracker for satellite radar altimeter waveforms in sea state applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The latest version of the European Space Agency's Sea State Climate Change Initiative database adopts a dedicated algorithm (retracker) to reprocess two decades of satellite altimetry measurements and provide long time series of significant wave height in the global ocean. This paper describes the main characteristics of this algorithm, called WHALES, and analyzes the impact of algorithm choices on measurement physics, particularly the weighted analysis of residuals in the cost function. Moreover, the impact of WHALES on the sea state database is analyzed in terms of noise reduction and scatter index with in situ data, with a particular focus on the coastal zone, where WHALES primarily improves data quality and quantity compared to previous approaches. We found that valid data records increased by 30% at 5 km from the coast after applying the retracker discussed here.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity to New Physics Phenomena in Anomaly Detection: A Study of Untunable Hyperparameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM) at collider experiments requires model-independent strategies to avoid missing possible discoveries of unexpected signals. Anomaly detection (AD) techniques offer a promising approach by identifying deviations from the Standard Model (SM) and have been extensively studied. The sensitivity of these methods to untunable hyperparameters has not been systematically compared, however. This study addresses it by investigating four semi-supervised AD methods -- Auto-Encoders, Deep Support Vector Data Description, Histogram-based Outlier Score, and Isolation Forest -- trained on simulated SM background events. In this paper, we study the sensitivity of these methods to BSM benchmark signals as a function of these untunable hyperparameters. Such a study is complemented by a proposal of a non-parametric permutation test using signal-agnostic statistics, which can provide a robust statistical assessment.</description>

      <title>Evaluating many-body stabilizer R\'enyi entropy by sampling reduced Pauli strings: singularities, volume law, and nonlocal magic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12146v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel quantum Monte Carlo method for evaluating the $\alpha$-stabilizer R\'enyi entropy (SRE) for any integer $\alpha\ge 2$. By interpreting $\alpha$-SRE as partition function ratios, we eliminate the sign problem in the imaginary-time path integral by sampling \emph{reduced Pauli strings} within a \emph{reduced configuration space}, which enables efficient classical computations of $\alpha$-SRE and its derivatives to explore magic in previously inaccessible 2D/higher-dimensional systems. We first isolate the free energy part in $2$-SRE, which is a trivial term. Notably, at quantum critical points in 1D/2D transverse field Ising (TFI) models, we reveal nontrivial singularities associated with the \emph{characteristic function} contribution, directly tied to magic. Their interplay leads to complicated behaviors of $2$-SRE, avoiding extrema at critical points generally. In contrast, analyzing the volume-law correction to SRE reveals a discontinuity tied to criticalities, suggesting that it is more informative than the full-state magic. For conformal critical points, we claim it could reflect nonlocal magic residing in correlations. Finally, we verify that $2$-SRE fails to characterize magic in mixed states (e.g. Gibbs states), yielding nonphysical results. This work provides a powerful tool for exploring the roles of magic in large-scale many-body systems, and reveals intrinsic relation between magic and many-body physics.</description>
