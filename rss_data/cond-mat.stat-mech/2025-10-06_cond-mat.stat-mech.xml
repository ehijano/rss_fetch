      <title>Statistical Signatures of Integrable and Non-Integrable Quantum Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrability is a cornerstone of classical mechanics, where it has a precise meaning. Extending this notion to quantum systems, however, remains subtle and unresolved. In particular, deciding whether a quantum Hamiltonian - viewed simply as a matrix - defines an integrable system is far from obvious, yet crucial for understanding non-equilibrium dynamics, spectral correlations, and correlation functions in many-body physics. We develop a statistical framework that approaches quantum integrability from a probabilistic standpoint. A key observation is that integrability requires a finite probability of vanishing energy gaps. Building on this, we propose a two-step protocol to distinguish integrable from non-integrable Hamiltonians. First, we apply a systematic Monte Carlo decimation of the spectrum, which exponentially compresses the Hilbert space and reveals whether level spacings approach Poisson statistics or remain mixed. The termination point of this decimation indicates the statistical character of the spectrum. Second, we analyze $k$-step gap distributions, which sharpen the distinction between Poisson and mixed statistics. Our procedure applies to Hamiltonians of any finite size, independent of whether their structure involves a few blocks or an exponentially fragmented Hilbert space. As a benchmark, we implement the protocol on quantum Hamiltonians built from the permutation group $\mathcal{S}_N$, demonstrating both its effectiveness and generality.</description>

      <title>Finite-size fluctuations for stochastic coupled oscillators: A general theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase transitions, sharp in the thermodynamic limit, get smeared in finite systems where macroscopic order-parameter fluctuations dominate. Achieving a coherent and complete theoretical description of these fluctuations is a central challenge. We develop a general framework to quantify these finite-size effects in synchronization transitions of generic stochastic, globally-coupled nonlinear oscillators. By applying a center-manifold reduction to the nonlinear stochastic PDE for the single-oscillator distribution in finite systems, we derive a mesoscopic description that yields the complete time evolution of the order parameter in the form of a Langevin equation. In particular, this equation provides the first closed-form steady-state distribution of the order parameter, fully capturing finite-size effects. Free from integrability constraints and the celebrated Ott-Antonsen ansatz, our theory shows excellent agreement with simulations across diverse coupling functions and frequency distributions, demonstrating broad applicability. Strikingly, it surpasses recent approaches near criticality and in the incoherent phase, where finite-size fluctuations are most pronounced.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional long-range Ising model: two (almost) equivalent approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the critical behavior of the one-dimensional Ising model with long-range interactions using the functional renormalization group in the local potential approximation (LPA), and compare our findings with Dyson's hierarchical model (DHM). While the DHM lacks translational invariance, it admits a field-theoretical description closely resembling the LPA, up to minor but nontrivial differences. After reviewing the real-space renormalization group approach to the DHM, we demonstrate a remarkable agreement in the critical exponent $\nu$ between the two methods across the entire range of power-law decays $1/2 &lt; \sigma &lt; 1$. We further benchmark our results against Monte Carlo simulations and analytical expansions near the upper boundary of the nontrivial regime, $\sigma \lesssim 1$.</description>

      <title>Numerical methods for quasi-stationary distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In stochastic processes with absorbing states, the quasi-stationary distribution provides valuable insights into the long-term behaviour prior to absorption. In this work, we revisit two well-established numerical methods for its computation. The first is an iterative algorithm for solving the non-linear equation that defines the quasi-stationary distribution. We generalise this technique to accommodate general Markov stochastic processes, either with discrete or continuous state space, and with multiple absorbing states. The second is a Monte Carlo method with resetting, for which we propose a novel single-trajectory approach that uses the trajectory's own history to perform resets after absorption. In addition to these methodological contributions, we provide a detailed analysis of implementation aspects for both methods. We also compare their accuracy and efficiency across a range of examples. The results indicate that the iterative algorithm is generally the preferred choice for problems with simple boundaries, while the Monte Carlo approach is more suitable for problems with complex boundaries, where the implementation of the iterative algorithm is a challenging task.</description>

      <title>Percolation and criticality of systems with competing interactions on Bethe lattices: limitations and potential strengths of cluster schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The random clusters introduced by Fortuin and Kasteleyn (FK) and analyzed by Coniglio and Klein (CK) for Ising and related models have led first Swendsen and Wang and then Wolff to formulate remarkably efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling schemes that weaken the critical slowing down. In frustrated models, however, no standard way to produce a comparable gain at small frustration -- let alone efficiently sample the large frustration regime -- has yet been identified. In order to understand why formulating appropriate cluster criteria for frustrated models has thus far been elusive, we here study minimal short-range attractive and long-range repulsive as well as spin-glass models on Bethe lattices. Using a generalization of the CK approach and the cavity-field method, the appropriateness and limitations of the FK--CK type clusters are identified. We find that a standard, constructive cluster scheme is then inoperable, and that the frustration range over which generalized FK--CK clusters are even definable is finite. These results demonstrate the futility of seeking constructive cluster schemes for frustrated systems but leaves open the possibility that alternate approaches could be devised.</description>

      <title>The systemic impact of edges in financial networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we assess how the stability of financial networks is affected by interconnectedness considering its tiniest variation: the edge. We compute the impact of edges as the percentage difference in the systemic risk (SR) of the whole network caused by the inclusion of that edge. We apply this framework to a thorough Brazilian dataset to compute the impact of bank-firm edges. After observing that (i) edges are heterogeneous regarding their impact on the SR, and (ii) the fraction of edges whose impact on the SR is non-positive increases with the level of the initial shock, we use machine learning techniques to try to predict two variables: the criticality of the edges (defining as critical an edge whose impact on SR is significantly greater than that of the others) and the sign of the edge impact. The level of accuracy obtained in these prediction exercises was very high. These results have important implications for the development macroprudential policies aimed at financial stability. Our framework allows to identify, based on features related to the origin and destination nodes of the edge (i.e., the lending bank and the borrowing firm), whether an additional loan will have a significant and positive impact on the SR.</description>

      <title>Analytical solution of a free-fermion chain with time-dependent ramps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an exact analytical solution of the single-particle Schr\"odinger equation for a chain of non-interacting fermions subject to a time-dependent linear potential, with its slope varied as an arbitrary function of time. The resulting dynamics exhibit self-similar behavior, with a structure reminiscent of the domain wall melting problem, albeit characterized by a nontrivial time-dependent length scale and phase. Building on this solution, we derive hydrodynamic predictions for the evolution of particle density, current, and entanglement entropy along the chain. In the special case of a sudden quench, the system develops a breathing interface region, which may be interpreted as a realization of Wannier-Stark localization, as previously suggested on the basis of hydrodynamic arguments.</description>

      <title>Minimal-Dissipation Learning for Energy-Based Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the bias of the approximate maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE) objective of a persistent chain energy-based model (EBM) is precisely equal to the thermodynamic excess work of an overdamped Langevin dynamical system. We then answer the question of whether such a model can be trained with minimal excess work, that is, energy dissipation, in a finite amount of time. We find that a Gaussian energy function with constant variance can be trained with minimal excess work by controlling only the learning rate. This proves that it is possible to train a persistent chain EBM in a finite amount of time with minimal dissipation and also provides a lower bound on the energy required for the computation. We refer to such a learning process that minimizes the excess work as minimal-dissipation learning. We then provide a generalization of the optimal learning rate schedule to general potentials and find that it induces a natural gradient flow on the MLE objective, a well-known second-order optimization method.</description>

      <title>Slow dynamics from a nested hierarchy of frozen states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify the mechanism of slow heterogeneous relaxation in quantum kinetically constrained models (KCMs) in which the potential energy strength is controlled by a coupling parameter. The regime of slow relaxation includes the large-coupling limit. By expanding around that limit, we reveal a \emph{nested hierarchy} of states that remain frozen on time scales determined by powers of the coupling. The classification of such states, together with the evolution of their Krylov complexity, reveal that these time scales are related to the distance between the sites where facilitated dynamics is allowed by the kinetic constraint. While correlations within frozen states relax slowly and exhibit metastable plateaus that persist on time scales set by powers of the coupling parameter, the correlations in the rest of the states decay rapidly. We compute the plateau heights of correlations across all frozen states up to second-order corrections in the inverse coupling. Our results explain slow relaxation in quantum KCMs and elucidate dynamical heterogeneity by relating the relaxation times to the spatial separations between the active regions.</description>

      <title>Modular theory and symmetry resolution in hyperfinite von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study modular theory in hyperfinite von Neumann algebras, i.e. in those of type II or type III, from the viewpoint of a subregion charge sector decomposition. We address this symmetry resolution by considering infinite tensor products of finite-dimensional algebras with fixed subregion charge values. An important ingredient is the combination of these algebras using direct integrals. This allows us to obtain the symmetry-resolved modular operator, modular flow, and modular correlation functions for hyperfinite algebras. Our approach establishes a mathematical foundation for recent results on symmetry resolution and modular theory in conformal field theory. Our analysis applies both to charges defined on a continuous range, or on a discrete set. The latter is of interest for condensed matter theory. Moreover, within the AdS/CFT correspondence we expect our findings to be relevant as a new ingredient for bulk spacetime reconstruction, including information from different boundary charge sectors.</description>

      <title>Computational access to lattice and long-wavelength physics in quantum mutual information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum mutual information is an important tool for characterizing correlations in quantum many-body systems, but its numerical evaluation is often prohibitively expensive. While some variants of R\'enyi Mutual Information (RMI) are computationally more tractable, it is not clear whether they correctly capture the long-wavelength physics or are dominated by UV effects, which is of key importance in lattice simulations. We analyze the relevance of lattice effects on the family of $\alpha$-$z$ R\'enyi mutual informations for ground states of models with conformal field theory descriptions. On the example of massless free fermions we identify distinct regions in the $\alpha$-$z$ plane, where RMI corrections due to the lattice are relevant or irrelevant. We further support these findings with MPS calculations on the transverse field Ising model (TFIM). Our results, accompanied by the open-source Julia package QMICalc.jl, provide guidance to using RMI in quantum-many body physics numerical computations.</description>

      <title>From Motifs to L\'evy Flights: Modeling Urban Mobility in Bogot\'a's Public Transport System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study two years of access card validation records from Bogot\'a's multimodal public transport system, comprising over 2.3 billion trips across bus rapid transit, feeder buses, dual-service buses, and an aerial cable network. By reconstructing user trajectories as motifs, we identify recurrent mobility patterns that extend beyond simple round trips, enabling the construction of an integrated origin-destination (OD) matrix covering 2,828 urban zones. Similarity analysis using the Jensen-Shannon divergence confirms the temporal stability of mobility structures across semesters, despite infrastructure changes and fare policy adjustments. From the obtained OD matrices, we derive transition probabilities between zones and uncover a robust power-law relationship with geographical distance, consistent with L\'evy flight dynamics. We validate our model using Monte Carlo simulations showing that reproduces both local and long-range displacements, with similar scaling exponents across time. These findings demonstrate that Bogot\'a's public transport mobility can be effectively modeled through L\'evy processes, providing a novel framework for analyzing complex transportation systems based solely on user access records.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum phase transitions have been shown to be highly beneficial for quantum sensing, owing to diverging quantum Fisher information close to criticality. In this work we consider a periodically modulated Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model to show that discrete time crystal (DTC) phase transition in this setup can enable us to achieve quantum-enhanced high-precision sensing of field strength. We employ a detailed finite-size scaling analysis and a time-averaged Inverse Participation Ratio analysis to determine the critical properties of this second-order phase transition. Our studies provide a comprehensive understanding of how quantum criticality in DTCs involving long-range interactions can be harnessed for advanced quantum sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Dynamic roughening of cities driven by multiplicative noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of urban landscapes is rapidly altering the surface of our planet. Yet, our understanding of the urbanisation phenomenon remains far from complete. A fundamental challenge is to describe spatiotemporal changes in the built environment. A dynamic theory of urban evolution should account for both vertical and horizontal city expansion, analogous to the dynamical behaviour of surface growth in physical and biological systems. Here we show that building-height dynamics in cities around the world are well described by a zero-dimensional geometric Brownian motion (GBM), where multiplicative noise drives stochastic fluctuations around a deterministic drift associated with economic growth. To account for intra-city correlations, we extend the GBM with spatial coupling, revealing how local interactions effectively mitigate noise-driven fluctuations and shape urban morphology. The continuum limit of this spatial model can be recasted into the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation and we find that empirical estimates of the roughness exponent are in the range of the KPZ prediction for most cities. Together, these results show that multiplicative noise, moderated by local interactions, governs the evolution of urban roughness, anchoring spatiotemporal city dynamics in a well-established statistical physics framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growth of cities has traditionally been studied from a population perspective, while urban sprawl - its spatial growth - has often been approached qualitatively. However, characterizing and modeling this spatial expansion is crucial, particularly given its parallels with surface growth extensively studied in physics. Despite these similarities, approaches to urban sprawl modeling are fragmented and scattered across various disciplines and contexts. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the mathematical modeling of this complex phenomenon. We discuss the key challenges hindering progress and examine models inspired by statistical physics, economics and geography, and theoretical ecology. Finally, we highlight critical directions for future research in this interdisciplinary field.</description>

      <title>Anomalous diffusion in convergence to effective ergodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08693</link>
      <description>arXiv:1606.08693v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nature of diffusion is usually studied for particles or dynamics generating trajectories over time. Similar in principle, these studies can be executed in tracking how a given function of observable properties evolve over time akin to a system's particle motion, so-called {\it functional-diffusion}. This is not the same as systems' own trajectories but can be considered as a meta-trajectory. Following this idea, we measure how an approach to ergodicity evolves over time for the observed magnetization of a full Ising model with an external field. We compute the functional's diffusive behavior depending on a range of temperatures via Metropolis and Glauber single-spin-flip dynamics. System's ensemble-averaged dynamics are computed using expressions from the exact solution. Power-laws on the approach to ergodicity provide the classification of anomalies in the {\it functional-diffusion}, demonstrating non-linear super-diffusive behavior over different temperature ranges.</description>

      <title>Universal trade-off between irreversibility and intrinsic timescale in thermal relaxation with applications to thermodynamic inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.06428v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a general lower bound for the entropy production rate (EPR) based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the Logarithmic-Sobolev constant that characterizes the time-scale of relaxation. This bound can be considered as an enhanced second law of thermodynamics. When applied to thermal relaxation, it reveals a universal trade-off relation between the dissipation rate and the intrinsic relaxation timescale. From this relation, a thermodynamic upper bound on the relaxation time between two given states emerges, acting as an inverse speed limit over the entire time region. We also obtain a quantum version of this upper bound, which is always tighter than its classical counterpart, incorporating an additional term due to decoherence. Remarkably, we further demonstrate that the trade-off relation remains valid for any generally non-Markovian coarse-grained relaxation dynamics, highlighting its significant applications in thermodynamic inference. This trade-off relation is a new tool in inferring EPRs in molecular dynamics simulations and practical experiments.</description>

      <title>Typical reconstruction limit and phase transition of maximum entropy method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03095v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dependence of the maximum entropy method (MEM) reconstruction performance on the default model. The maximum entropy method is a reconstruction technique that utilizes prior information, referred to as the default model, to recover original signals from observed data, and it is widely used in underdetermined systems. The broad applications have been reported in fields ranging from the analysis of observational data in seismology and astronomy, to large-scale computations in quantum chemistry, and even in social sciences such as linguistics. However, a known drawback of MEM is that its results depend on the assumed default model. In this study, we employ the replica method to elucidate how discrepancies in the default model affect the reconstruction of signals with specific distributions. We report that in certain cases, even small discrepancies can induce phase transitions, leading to reconstruction failure. Additionally, by comparing MEM with reconstruction based on L1-norm optimization, a method proposed in recent years, we demonstrate that MEM exhibits lower reconstruction accuracy under certain conditions.</description>

      <title>Nonextensive Thermodynamics of the Morse Oscillator: Signature and Solid State Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a detailed thermodynamic analysis of a bound quantum system: the Morse oscillator within the framework of Tsallis nonextensive statistics. Using the property of the bound spectrum (upper bound) of the Morse potential, limited by the bond dissociation energy, we analytically derive the generalized partition function. We present results for both the high- and low-temperature limits. We propose the effective number of accessible states as a measure of nonextensivity. The calculation shows that the nonextensive framework further restricts the number of accessible states. We also derive the generalized internal energy and entropy and examine their dependence on temperature and the nonextensivity parameter \( q \). Numerical results confirm the strong effect of nonextensive behavior in the low-temperature regime (precisely low to moderate temperature), where the ratio of generalized internal energy and internal energy calculated from the Boltzmann Gibbs (BG) formula develops a nontrivial dip structure for \( q &lt; 1 \). Moreover, the generalized specific heat shows the Schottky-type anomaly. We extend our study by deriving the specific heat of solids with BG and Tsallis statistics using the anharmonic energy levels of the Morse oscillator. This study suggests that the Morse oscillator is a solvable and physically meaningful testing ground for exploring the thermodynamics of quantum systems driven by nonextensive statistics, with implications for the vibrational properties of the non-equilibrium molecular thermodynamics (especially diatomic molecules).</description>

      <title>Multiple crossover in the decay of metastable volume fraction of a Blume-Capel ferromagnetic needle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15219v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transient behaviours of a Blume-Capel ferromagnetic needle have been studied extensively by Monte-Carlo simulation. The needle has an elongated length in one direction compared to its cross-section. In the context of transient behaviour, we have captured the decay of the metastable state and the magnetic relaxation behaviours in our study. The dependence of metastable behaviour with anisotropy (single site) has been studied. \emph{Interestingly, we have observed multiple (different values of $n$ in different time domains) crossover in the decay of metastable volume fraction (obeying Avrami's law $\beta \sim {\rm exp}(-Kt^n)$). We have identified the crossover time, and the values of $n$ are estimated precisely.} The mean (magnetic) reversal time has been studied as a function of anisotropy. It is observed to be almost independent of anisotropy for its negative value; however, it is found to decrease exponentially with positive anisotropy. The exponential relaxation behaviour (in the corresponding paramagnetic phase) is observed. The range of the relaxation time is observed to decrease as the temperature increases.</description>

      <title>Integrability from a Single Conservation Law in Quantum Spin Chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that for quantum spin chains with finite-range interactions, the existence of a specific conservation law known as the Reshetikhin condition implies the presence of infinitely many local conserved quantities, i.e., integrability. This shows that the entire hierarchy of conservation laws associated with solutions of the Yang--Baxter equation is already encoded in the lowest nontrivial conservation law. Combined with recent rigorous results on nonintegrability, our theorem strongly restricts the possibility of partially integrable systems that admit only a finite but large number of local conserved quantities. Our work establishes a rigorous foundation for the systematic identification of new integrable models and deepens the algebraic understanding of conservation-law structures in quantum spin chains.</description>

      <title>Complexity transitions in chaotic quantum systems: Nonstabilizerness, entanglement, and fractal dimension in SYK and random matrix models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex quantum systems -- composed of many, interacting particles -- are intrinsically difficult to model. When a quantum many-body system is subject to disorder, it can undergo transitions to regimes with varying non-ergodic and localized behavior, which can significantly reduce the number of relevant basis states. It remains an open question whether such transitions are also directly related to an abrupt change in the system's complexity. In this work, we study the transition from chaotic to integrable phases in several paradigmatic models, the power-law random banded matrix model, the Rosenzweig--Porter model, and a hybrid SYK+Ising model, comparing three complementary complexity markers -- fractal dimension, von Neumann entanglement entropy, and stabilizer R\'enyi entropy. For all three markers, finite-size scaling reveals sharp transitions between high- and low-complexity regimes, which, however, can occur at different critical points. As a consequence, while in the ergodic and localized regimes the markers align, they diverge significantly in the presence of an intermediate fractal phase. Additionally, our analysis reveals that the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy is more sensitive to underlying many-body symmetries, such as fermion parity and time reversal, than the other markers. As our results show, different markers capture complementary facets of complexity, making it necessary to combine them to obtain a comprehensive diagnosis of phase transitions. The divergence between different complexity markers also has significant consequences for the classical simulability of chaotic many-body systems.</description>

      <title>2D Entanglement from a Twisted Motzkin Spaghetto</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While highly entangled ground states of gapless local Hamiltonians have been known to exist in one dimension, their 2D counterparts were only recently found, with rather sophisticated interactions involving at least 4 neighboring degrees of freedom. Here, we show that similar 2D entanglement properties can be realized by twisting a single 1D chain embedded on a 2D lattice. The interaction to generate such 2D entanglement is much simpler than the previous 2D construction by coupling orthogonal arrays of 1D highly entangled chains. The new construction exhibits an entanglement phase transition with enhanced entanglement entropy at the critical point compared to the previous bona fide 2D models, but the spectral gap in the highly entangled phase decays faster. The tensor network representation of the new ground state is composed of tensors with lower rank, showing a similar global geometry as those of the old ones.</description>

      <title>Symmetry enforces entanglement at high temperatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many-body quantum systems with local interactions undergo ``sudden death of entanglement" at high temperatures, whereby thermal states become classical mixtures of product states. We investigate whether symmetry constraints can prevent this phenomenon. We prove that strongly symmetric thermal states (canonical ensemble) of generic Hamiltonians with on-site Abelian symmetries remain entangled with non-zero entanglement negativity at arbitrarily high temperatures, under mild conditions on the symmetry actions and the charge sector of the strong symmetry. Our results extend to weakly symmetric thermal states (Gibbs ensemble) under superselection rules, which restrict state decompositions to be symmetric. In particular, we show that fermionic Gibbs states evade sudden death of entanglement and have persistent fermionic negativity at high temperatures, proving along the way some existing conjectures about fermionic entanglement. These findings demonstrate that global symmetry correlations can preserve quantum entanglement despite thermal decoherence, providing new insights into the interplay between symmetry and quantum information in thermal equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Tracer diffusion coefficients in a sheared granular gas. Exact results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26115v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The diffusion of tracer particles immersed in a granular gas under uniform shear flow (USF) is analyzed within the framework of the inelastic Boltzmann equation. Two different but complementary approaches are followed to achieve exact results. First, we maintain the structure of the Boltzmann collision operator but consider inelastic Maxwell models (IMM). Using IMM allows us to compute the collisional moments of the Boltzmann operator without knowing the velocity distribution functions of the granular binary mixture explicitly. Second, we consider a kinetic model of the Boltzmann equation for inelastic hard spheres (IHS). This kinetic model is based on the equivalence between a gas of elastic hard spheres subjected to a drag force proportional to the particle velocity and a gas of IHS. We solve the Boltzmann--Lorentz kinetic equation for tracer particles using a generalized Chapman--Enskog--like expansion around the shear flow distribution. This reference distribution retains all hydrodynamic orders in the shear rate. The mass flux is obtained to first order in the deviations of the concentration, pressure, and temperature from their values in the reference state. Due to the velocity space anisotropy induced by the shear flow, the mass flux is expressed in terms of tensorial quantities rather than the conventional scalar diffusion coefficients. The exact results derived here are compared with those previously obtained for IHS by using different approximations [JSTAT P02012 (2007)]. The comparison generally shows reasonable quantitative agreement, especially for IMM results. Finally, we study segregation by thermal diffusion as an application of the theory. The phase diagrams illustrating segregation are shown and compared with IHS results, demonstrating qualitative agreement.</description>
