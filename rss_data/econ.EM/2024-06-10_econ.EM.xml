      <title>Kernel Three Pass Regression Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We forecast a single time series using a high-dimensional set of predictors. When these predictors share common underlying dynamics, an approximate latent factor model provides a powerful characterization of their co-movements Bai(2003). These latent factors succinctly summarize the data and can also be used for prediction, alleviating the curse of dimensionality in high-dimensional prediction exercises, see Stock &amp; Watson (2002a). However, forecasting using these latent factors suffers from two potential drawbacks. First, not all pervasive factors among the set of predictors may be relevant, and using all of them can lead to inefficient forecasts. The second shortcoming is the assumption of linear dependence of predictors on the underlying factors. The first issue can be addressed by using some form of supervision, which leads to the omission of irrelevant information. One example is the three-pass regression filter proposed by Kelly &amp; Pruitt (2015). We extend their framework to cases where the form of dependence might be nonlinear by developing a new estimator, which we refer to as the Kernel Three-Pass Regression Filter (K3PRF). This alleviates the aforementioned second shortcoming. The estimator is computationally efficient and performs well empirically. The short-term performance matches or exceeds that of established models, while the long-term performance shows significant improvement.</description>

      <title>Identification of structural shocks in Bayesian VEC models with two-state Markov-switching heteroskedasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a Bayesian framework for cointegrated structural VAR models identified by two-state Markovian breaks in conditional covariances. The resulting structural VEC specification with Markov-switching heteroskedasticity (SVEC-MSH) is formulated in the so-called B-parameterization, in which the prior distribution is specified directly for the matrix of the instantaneous reactions of the endogenous variables to structural innovations. We discuss some caveats pertaining to the identification conditions presented earlier in the literature on stationary structural VAR-MSH models, and revise the restrictions to actually ensure the unique global identification through the two-state heteroskedasticity. To enable the posterior inference in the proposed model, we design an MCMC procedure, combining the Gibbs sampler and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The methodology is illustrated both with a simulated as well as real-world data examples.</description>
