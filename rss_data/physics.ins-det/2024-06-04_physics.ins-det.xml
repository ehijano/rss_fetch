      <title>Simulation of DAMPE silicon microstrip detectors in the $\rm Allpix^{2}$ framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon strip detectors have been widely utilized in space experiments for gamma-ray and cosmic-ray detections thanks to their high spatial resolution and stable performance. For a silicon micro-strip detector, the Monte Carlo simulation is recognized as a practical and cost-effective approach to verify the detector performance. In this study, a technique for the simulation of the silicon micro-strip detector with the $\rm Allpix^{2}$ framework is developed. By incorporating the electric field into the particle transport simulation based on Geant4, this framework could precisely emulate the carrier drift in the silicon micro-strip detector. The simulation results are validated using the beam test data as well as the flight data of the DAMPE experiment, which suggests that the $\rm Allpix^{2}$ framework is a powerful tool to obtain the performance of the silicon micro-strip detector.</description>

      <title>A Study of the Latest Updates of the Readout System for the Hybird-Pixel Detector at HEPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The High Energy Photon Source (HEPS) represents a fourth-generation light source. This facility has made unprecedented advancements in accelerator technology, necessitating the development of new detectors to satisfy physical requirements such as single-photon resolution, large dynamic range, and high frame rates. Since 2016, the Institute of High Energy Physics has introduced the first user-experimental hybrid pixel detector, progressing to the fourth-generation million-pixel detector designed for challenging conditions, with the dual-threshold single-photon detector HEPS-Beijing PIXel (HEPS-BPIX) set as the next-generation target. HEPS-BPIX will employ the entirely new Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) BP40 for pixel information readout. Data flow will be managed and controlled through readout electronics based on a two-tier Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) system: the Front-End Electronics (FEE) and the Input-Output Board (IOB) handle the fan-out for 12 ASICs, and the u4FCP is tasked with processing serial data on high-speed links, transferring pixel-level data to the back-end RTM and uTCA chassis, or independently outputting through a network port, enabling remote control of the entire detector. The new HEPS-BPIX firmware has undergone a comprehensive redesign and update to meet the electronic characteristics of the new chip and to improve the overall performance of the detector. We provide an overview of the core subunits of HEPS-BPIX, emphasizing the readout system, evaluating the new hardware and firmware, and highlighting some of its innovative features and characteristics.</description>

      <title>A novel measurement method for SiPM external crosstalk probability at low temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) are being considered as potential replacements for conventional photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). However, a significant disadvantage of SiPMs is crosstalk (CT), wherein photons propagate through other pixels, resulting in secondary avalanches. CT can be categorized into internal crosstalk and external crosstalk based on whether the secondary avalanche occurs within the same SiPM or a different one. Numerous methods exist for quantitatively estimating the percentage of internal crosstalk (iCT). However, external crosstalk (eCT) has not been extensively studied.
  This article presents a novel measurement method for the probability of emitting an external crosstalk photon during a single pixel avalanche, using a setup involving two identical SiPMs facing each other, and without the need for complex optical designs. The entire apparatus is enclosed within a stainless steel chamber, functioning as a light-tight enclosure, and maintained at liquid nitrogen temperature. The experimental setup incorporates two Sensl J-60035 SiPM chips along with two 0.5-inch Hamamatsu Photonics (HPK) VUV4 S13370-6050CN SiPM arrays. The findings show a linear relationship between the probability of emitting an external crosstalk photon and the SiPM overvoltage for both SiPM samples. Surprisingly, this novel measurement method also rovides measurements of the SiPM photon detection efficiency (PDE) for eCT photons at low temperature.</description>

      <title>Superconducting resonator parametric amplifiers with intrinsic separation of pump and signal tones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting resonator parametric amplifiers achieve ultra-low-noise amplification through the nonlinear kinetic inductance of thin-film superconductors. One of the main challenges to the operation of these devices is the separation of the strong pump tone from the signal tone after amplification has been achieved. In this paper, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a pump separation method based on operating a half-wave superconducting resonator amplifier behind a cryogenic circulator. Our pump separation scheme does not involve post-amplification interference, and thereby avoids the delicate phase matching of two different pump paths. We demonstrate the scheme using two-port half-wave resonator amplifiers based on superconducting NbN thin-films. We present measurements of gain profiles and degrees of pump separation for amplifiers having different coupling quality factors. On an amplifier having a coupling quality factor of $\sim2000$, we measured a peak signal gain of $15\,\mathrm{dB}$ whilst achieving pump separation of $12\,\mathrm{dB}$. The amplifier was stable for continuous measurements, and the gain drift was measured to be $0.15\,\mathrm{dB}$ over an hour. The same amplifier was operated at $3.2\,\mathrm{K}$ and achieved a peak signal gain of $11\,\mathrm{dB}$ whilst having a pump separation factor of $10.5\,\mathrm{dB}$. The pump separation scheme, and these promising results, will advance the development of superconducting resonator amplifiers as an important technology in quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>First demonstration of a TES based cryogenic Li$_2$MoO$_4$detector for neutrinoless double beta decay search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cryogenic calorimetric experiments to search for neutrinoless double-beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) are highly competitive, scalable and versatile in isotope. The largest planned detector array, CUPID, is comprised of about 1500 individual Li$_2^{100}$MoO$_{4}$ detector modules with a further scale up envisioned for a follow up experiment (CUPID-1T). In this article, we present a novel detector concept targeting this second stage with a low impedance TES based readout for the Li$_2$MoO$_{4}$ absorber that is easily mass-produced and lends itself to a multiplexed readout. We present the detector design and results from a first prototype detector operated at the NEXUS shallow underground facility at Fermilab. The detector is a 2-cm-side cube with 21$\,$g mass that is strongly thermally coupled to its readout chip to allow rise-times of $\sim$0.5$\,$ms. This design is more than one order of magnitude faster than present NTD based detectors and is hence expected to effectively mitigate backgrounds generated through the pile-up of two independent two neutrino decay events coinciding close in time. Together with a baseline resolution of 1.95$\,$keV (FWHM) these performance parameters extrapolate to a background index from pile-up as low as $5\cdot 10^{-6}\,$counts/keV/kg/yr in CUPID size crystals. The detector was calibrated up to the MeV region showing sufficient dynamic range for $0\nu\beta\beta$ searches. In combination with a SuperCDMS HVeV detector this setup also allowed us to perform a precision measurement of the scintillation time constants of Li$_2$MoO$_{4}$. The crystal showed a significant fast scintillation emission with O(10$\,\mu$s) time-scale, more than an order below the detector response of presently considered light detectors suggesting the possibility of further progress in pile-up rejection through better light detectors in the future.</description>

      <title>Calo-VQ: Vector-Quantized Two-Stage Generative Model in Calorimeter Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel machine learning method developed for the fast simulation of calorimeter detector response, adapting vector-quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE). Our model adopts a two-stage generation strategy: initially compressing geometry-aware calorimeter data into a discrete latent space, followed by the application of a sequence model to learn and generate the latent tokens. Extensive experimentation on the Calo-challenge dataset underscores the efficiency of our approach, showcasing a remarkable improvement in the generation speed compared with conventional method by a factor of 2000. Remarkably, our model achieves the generation of calorimeter showers within milliseconds. Furthermore, comprehensive quantitative evaluations across various metrics are performed to validate physics performance of generation.</description>

      <title>Optimizaci\'on del sistema de iluminaci\'on y proyecci\'on para un sensor multiparam\'etrico acusto-\'optico</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18607v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In previous works we presented a novel multiparametric sensor to simultaneously measure the refractive index and the speed of sound in a liquid by means of the acousto-optic effect. The sensor requires an illumination system that expands the laser beam so that it interacts effectively with the liquid under study. Also, a projection system is necessary in order to adequately capture the diffraction pattern at the cell exit. In this article, we present the optimization of the sensor illumination and projection system using the optical design computational tool Zemax OpticStudio. The considered range of refractive indices of the liquid samples is between 1.33 and 1.51. The results show a correct expansion of the incident beam on the cell, and the projection system achieves an image with very few aberrations and an adequate angular separation between the maxima of the diffraction pattern. Based on the resulting dimensions of the sensor after optimizing the illumination and projection system, we confirm that it is compact and portable.</description>
