      <title>Evolution of Collective AI Beyond Individual Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates collective behaviors that emerge from a group of homogeneous individuals optimized for a specific capability. We created a group of simple, identical neural network based agents modeled after chemotaxis-driven vehicles that follow pheromone trails and examined multi-agent simulations using clones of these evolved individuals. Our results show that the evolution of individuals led to population differentiation. Surprisingly, we observed that collective fitness significantly changed during later evolutionary stages, despite maintained high individual performance and simplified neural architectures. This decline occurred when agents developed reduced sensor-motor coupling, suggesting that over-optimization of individual agents almost always lead to less effective group behavior. Our research investigates how individual differentiation can evolve through what evolutionary pathways.</description>

      <title>Distributed Task Allocation for Multi-Agent Systems: A Submodular Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates dynamic task allocation for multi-agent systems (MASs) under resource constraints, with a focus on maximizing the global utility of agents while ensuring a conflict-free allocation of targets. We present a more adaptable submodular maximization framework for the MAS task allocation under resource constraints. Our proposed distributed greedy bundles algorithm (DGBA) is specifically designed to address communication limitations in MASs and provides rigorous approximation guarantees for submodular maximization under $q$-independent systems, with low computational complexity. Specifically, DGBA can generate a feasible task allocation policy within polynomial time complexity, significantly reducing space complexity compared to existing methods. To demonstrate practical viability of our approach, we apply DGBA to the scenario of active observation information acquisition within a micro-satellite constellation, transforming the NP-hard task allocation problem into a tractable submodular maximization problem under a $q$-independent system constraint. Our method not only provides a specific performance bound but also surpasses benchmark algorithms in metrics such as utility, cost, communication time, and running time.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Cruising: Reinforcement Learning based Time-Headway Control for Increased Traffic Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of Connected Automated Vehicles represents an unprecedented opportunity for improving driving efficiency and alleviating traffic congestion. However, existing research fails to address realistic multi-lane highway scenarios without assuming connectivity, perception, and control capabilities that are typically unavailable in current vehicles. This paper proposes a novel AI system that is the first to improve highway traffic efficiency compared with human-like traffic in realistic, simulated multi-lane scenarios, while relying on existing connectivity, perception, and control capabilities. At the core of our approach is a reinforcement learning based controller that dynamically communicates time-headways to automated vehicles near bottlenecks based on real-time traffic conditions. These desired time-headways are then used by Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) systems to adjust their following distance. By (i) integrating existing traffic estimation technology and low-bandwidth vehicle-to-infrastructure connectivity, (ii) leveraging safety-certified ACC systems, and (iii) targeting localized bottleneck challenges that can be addressed independently in different locations, we propose a practical, safe, and scalable system that can positively impact numerous road users.</description>

      <title>Interaction Identification of a Heterogeneous NDS with Quadratic-Bilinear Subsystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper attacks time-domain identification for the interaction parameters of a heterogeneous networked dynamic system (NDS), with each of its subsystems being described by a continuous-time descriptor quadratic-bilinear time-invariant (QBTI) model. No restrictions are put on the sampling rate. Explicit formulas are derived respectively for the transient and steady-state responses of the NDS, provided that the probing signal is generated by a linear time invariant (LTI) system. Some relations have been derived between the NDS steady-state response and its frequency domain input-output mappings. These relations reveal that the value of some NDS associated TFMs can in principle be estimated at almost any interested point of the imaginary axis from input-output experimental data, as well as its derivatives and a right tangential interpolation along an arbitrary direction. Based on these relations, an estimation algorithm is suggested respectively for the parameters of the NDS and the values of these TFMs.</description>

      <title>The Problem of Social Cost in Multi-Agent General Reinforcement Learning: Survey and Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The AI safety literature is full of examples of powerful AI agents that, in blindly pursuing a specific and usually narrow objective, ends up with unacceptable and even catastrophic collateral damage to others. In this paper, we consider the problem of social harms that can result from actions taken by learning and utility-maximising agents in a multi-agent environment. The problem of measuring social harms or impacts in such multi-agent settings, especially when the agents are artificial generally intelligent (AGI) agents, was listed as an open problem in Everitt et al, 2018. We attempt a partial answer to that open problem in the form of market-based mechanisms to quantify and control the cost of such social harms. The proposed setup captures many well-studied special cases and is more general than existing formulations of multi-agent reinforcement learning with mechanism design in two ways: (i) the underlying environment is a history-based general reinforcement learning environment like in AIXI; (ii) the reinforcement-learning agents participating in the environment can have different learning strategies and planning horizons. To demonstrate the practicality of the proposed setup, we survey some key classes of learning algorithms and present a few applications, including a discussion of the Paperclips problem and pollution control with a cap-and-trade system.</description>

      <title>Defending Against Diverse Attacks in Federated Learning Through Consensus-Based Bi-Level Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose significant challenges in many machine learning applications, particularly in the setting of distributed training and federated learning, where malicious agents seek to corrupt the training process with the goal of jeopardizing and compromising the performance and reliability of the final models. In this paper, we address the problem of robust federated learning in the presence of such attacks by formulating the training task as a bi-level optimization problem. We conduct a theoretical analysis of the resilience of consensus-based bi-level optimization (CB$^2$O), an interacting multi-particle metaheuristic optimization method, in adversarial settings. Specifically, we provide a global convergence analysis of CB$^2$O in mean-field law in the presence of malicious agents, demonstrating the robustness of CB$^2$O against a diverse range of attacks. Thereby, we offer insights into how specific hyperparameter choices enable to mitigate adversarial effects. On the practical side, we extend CB$^2$O to the clustered federated learning setting by proposing FedCB$^2$O, a novel interacting multi-particle system, and design a practical algorithm that addresses the demands of real-world applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate the robustness of the FedCB$^2$O algorithm against label-flipping attacks in decentralized clustered federated learning scenarios, showcasing its effectiveness in practical contexts.</description>

      <title>TAB-Fields: A Maximum Entropy Framework for Mission-Aware Adversarial Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous agents operating in adversarial scenarios face a fundamental challenge: while they may know their adversaries' high-level objectives, such as reaching specific destinations within time constraints, the exact policies these adversaries will employ remain unknown. Traditional approaches address this challenge by treating the adversary's state as a partially observable element, leading to a formulation as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). However, the induced belief-space dynamics in a POMDP require knowledge of the system's transition dynamics, which, in this case, depend on the adversary's unknown policy. Our key observation is that while an adversary's exact policy is unknown, their behavior is necessarily constrained by their mission objectives and the physical environment, allowing us to characterize the space of possible behaviors without assuming specific policies. In this paper, we develop Task-Aware Behavior Fields (TAB-Fields), a representation that captures adversary state distributions over time by computing the most unbiased probability distribution consistent with known constraints. We construct TAB-Fields by solving a constrained optimization problem that minimizes additional assumptions about adversary behavior beyond mission and environmental requirements. We integrate TAB-Fields with standard planning algorithms by introducing TAB-conditioned POMCP, an adaptation of Partially Observable Monte Carlo Planning. Through experiments in simulation with underwater robots and hardware implementations with ground robots, we demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance compared to baselines that either assume specific adversary policies or neglect mission constraints altogether. Evaluation videos and code are available at https://tab-fields.github.io.</description>

      <title>Capacity Allocation and Pricing of High Occupancy Toll Lane Systems with Heterogeneous Travelers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study the optimal design of High Occupancy Toll (HOT) lanes. In our setup, the traffic authority determines the road capacity allocation between HOT lanes and ordinary lanes, as well as the toll price charged for travelers who use the HOT lanes but do not meet the high-occupancy eligibility criteria. We build a game-theoretic model to analyze the decisions made by travelers with heterogeneous values of time and carpool disutilities, who choose between paying or forming carpools to take the HOT lanes, or taking the ordinary lanes. Travelers' payoffs depend on the congestion cost of the lane that they take, the payment and the carpool disutilities. We provide a complete characterization of travelers' equilibrium strategies and resulting travel times for any capacity allocation and toll price. We also calibrate our model on the California Interstate highway 880 and compute the optimal capacity allocation and toll design.</description>

      <title>Designing Equilibria in Concurrent Games with Social Welfare and Temporal Logic Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03045v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In game theory, mechanism design is concerned with the design of incentives so that a desired outcome of the game can be achieved. In this paper, we explore the concept of equilibrium design, where incentives are designed to obtain a desirable equilibrium that satisfies a specific temporal logic property. Our study is based on a framework where system specifications are represented as temporal logic formulae, games as quantitative concurrent game structures, and players' goals as mean-payoff objectives. We consider system specifications given by LTL and GR(1) formulae, and show that designing incentives to ensure that a given temporal logic property is satisfied on some/every Nash equilibrium of the game can be achieved in PSPACE for LTL properties and in NP/{\Sigma}P 2 for GR(1) specifications. We also examine the complexity of related decision and optimisation problems, such as optimality and uniqueness of solutions, as well as considering social welfare, and show that the complexities of these problems lie within the polynomial hierarchy. Equilibrium design can be used as an alternative solution to rational synthesis and verification problems for concurrent games with mean-payoff objectives when no solution exists or as a technique to repair concurrent games with undesirable Nash equilibria in an optimal way.</description>

      <title>BonnBot-I: A Precise Weed Management and Crop Monitoring Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cultivation and weeding are two of the primary tasks performed by farmers today. A recent challenge for weeding is the desire to reduce herbicide and pesticide treatments while maintaining crop quality and quantity. In this paper, we introduce BonnBot-I a precise weed management platform which can also performs field monitoring. Driven by crop monitoring approaches that can accurately locate and classify plants (weed and crop) we further improve their performance by fusing the platform available GNSS and wheel odometry. This improves the tracking accuracy of our crop monitoring approach from a normalized average error of 8.3% to 3.5%, evaluated on a new publicly available corn dataset. We also present a novel arrangement of weeding tools mounted on linear actuators evaluated in simulated environments. We replicate weed distributions from a real field, using the results from our monitoring approach, and show the validity of our work-space division techniques which require significantly less movement (a 50% reduction) to achieve similar results. Overall, BonnBot-I is a significant step forward in precise weed management with a novel method of selectively spraying and controlling weeds in an arable field.</description>

      <title>FlickerFusion: Intra-trajectory Domain Generalizing Multi-Agent RL</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15876v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning has demonstrated significant potential in addressing complex cooperative tasks across various real-world applications. However, existing MARL approaches often rely on the restrictive assumption that the number of entities (e.g., agents, obstacles) remains constant between training and inference. This overlooks scenarios where entities are dynamically removed or added during the inference trajectory -- a common occurrence in real-world environments like search and rescue missions and dynamic combat situations. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of intra-trajectory dynamic entity composition under zero-shot out-of-domain (OOD) generalization, where such dynamic changes cannot be anticipated beforehand. Our empirical studies reveal that existing MARL methods suffer significant performance degradation and increased uncertainty in these scenarios. In response, we propose FlickerFusion, a novel OOD generalization method that acts as a universally applicable augmentation technique for MARL backbone methods. FlickerFusion stochastically drops out parts of the observation space, emulating being in-domain when inferenced OOD. The results show that FlickerFusion not only achieves superior inference rewards but also uniquely reduces uncertainty vis-\`a-vis the backbone, compared to existing methods. Benchmarks, implementations, and model weights are organized and open-sourced at flickerfusion305.github.io, accompanied by ample demo video renderings.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Testbed for Cognitive Radio Applications</title>

Abstract: Technological trends show that Radio Frequency Reinforcement Learning (RFRL) will play a prominent role in the wireless communication systems of the future. Applications of RFRL range from military communications jamming to enhancing WiFi networks. Before deploying algorithms for these purposes, they must be trained in a simulation environment to ensure adequate performance. For this reason, we previously created the RFRL Gym: a standardized, accessible tool for the development and testing of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in the wireless communications space. This environment leveraged the OpenAI Gym framework and featured customizable simulation scenarios within the RF spectrum. However, the RFRL Gym was limited to training a single RL agent per simulation; this is not ideal, as most real-world RF scenarios will contain multiple intelligent agents in cooperative, competitive, or mixed settings, which is a natural consequence of spectrum congestion. Therefore, through integration with Ray RLlib, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) functionality for training and assessment has been added to the RFRL Gym, making it even more of a robust tool for RF spectrum simulation. This paper provides an overview of the updated RFRL Gym environment. In this work, the general framework of the tool is described relative to comparable existing resources, highlighting the significant additions and refactoring we have applied to the Gym. Afterward, results from testing various RF scenarios in the MARL environment and future additions are discussed.</description>
