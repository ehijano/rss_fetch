      <title>Ranking and Selection with Simultaneous Input Data Collection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a general and novel formulation of ranking and selection with the existence of streaming input data. The collection of multiple streams of such data may consume different types of resources, and hence can be conducted simultaneously. To utilize the streaming input data, we aggregate simulation outputs generated under heterogeneous input distributions over time to form a performance estimator. By characterizing the asymptotic behavior of the performance estimators, we formulate two optimization problems to optimally allocate budgets for collecting input data and running simulations. We then develop a multi-stage simultaneous budget allocation procedure and provide its statistical guarantees such as consistency and asymptotic normality. We conduct several numerical studies to demonstrate the competitive performance of the proposed procedure.</description>

      <title>Bayes and Biased Estimators Without Hyper-parameter Estimation: Comparable Performance to the Empirical-Bayes-Based Regularized Estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regularized system identification has become a significant complement to more classical system identification. It has been numerically shown that kernel-based regularized estimators often perform better than the maximum likelihood estimator in terms of minimizing mean squared error (MSE). However, regularized estimators often require hyper-parameter estimation. This paper focuses on ridge regression and the regularized estimator by employing the empirical Bayes hyper-parameter estimator. We utilize the excess MSE to quantify the MSE difference between the empirical-Bayes-based regularized estimator and the maximum likelihood estimator for large sample sizes. We then exploit the excess MSE expressions to develop both a family of generalized Bayes estimators and a family of closed-form biased estimators. They have the same excess MSE as the empirical-Bayes-based regularized estimator but eliminate the need for hyper-parameter estimation. Moreover, we conduct numerical simulations to show that the performance of these new estimators is comparable to the empirical-Bayes-based regularized estimator, while computationally, they are more efficient.</description>

      <title>Support Collapse of Deep Gaussian Processes with Polynomial Kernels for a Wide Regime of Hyperparameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the prior that a Deep Gaussian Process with polynomial kernels induces. We observe that, even for relatively small depths, averaging effects occur within such a Deep Gaussian Process and that the prior can be analyzed and approximated effectively by means of the Berry-Esseen Theorem. One of the key findings of this analysis is that, in the absence of careful hyper-parameter tuning, the prior of a Deep Gaussian Process either collapses rapidly towards zero as the depth increases or places negligible mass on low norm functions. This aligns well with experimental findings and mirrors known results for convolution based Deep Gaussian Processes.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Principal Component Analysis with Random Bernoulli Features for Process Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The process generates substantial amounts of data with highly complex structures, leading to the development of numerous nonlinear statistical methods. However, most of these methods rely on computations involving large-scale dense kernel matrices. This dependence poses significant challenges in meeting the high computational demands and real-time responsiveness required by online monitoring systems. To alleviate the computational burden of dense large-scale matrix multiplication, we incorporate the bootstrap sampling concept into random feature mapping and propose a novel random Bernoulli principal component analysis method to efficiently capture nonlinear patterns in the process. We derive a convergence bound for the kernel matrix approximation constructed using random Bernoulli features, ensuring theoretical robustness. Subsequently, we design four fast process monitoring methods based on random Bernoulli principal component analysis to extend its nonlinear capabilities for handling diverse fault scenarios. Finally, numerical experiments and real-world data analyses are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods. Results demonstrate that the proposed methods offer excellent scalability and reduced computational complexity, achieving substantial cost savings with minimal performance loss compared to traditional kernel-based approaches.</description>

      <title>SNPL: Simultaneous Policy Learning and Evaluation for Safe Multi-Objective Policy Improvement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To design effective digital interventions, experimenters face the challenge of learning decision policies that balance multiple objectives using offline data. Often, they aim to develop policies that maximize goal outcomes, while ensuring there are no undesirable changes in guardrail outcomes. To provide credible recommendations, experimenters must not only identify policies that satisfy the desired changes in goal and guardrail outcomes, but also offer probabilistic guarantees about the changes these policies induce. In practice, however, policy classes are often large, and digital experiments tend to produce datasets with small effect sizes relative to noise. In this setting, standard approaches such as data splitting or multiple testing often result in unstable policy selection and/or insufficient statistical power. In this paper, we provide safe noisy policy learning (SNPL), a novel approach that leverages the concept of algorithmic stability to address these challenges. Our method enables policy learning while simultaneously providing high-confidence guarantees using the entire dataset, avoiding the need for data-splitting. We present finite-sample and asymptotic versions of our algorithm that ensure the recommended policy satisfies high-probability guarantees for avoiding guardrail regressions and/or achieving goal outcome improvements. We test both variants of our approach approach empirically on a real-world application of personalizing SMS delivery. Our results on real-world data suggest that our approach offers dramatic improvements in settings with large policy classes and low signal-to-noise across both finite-sample and asymptotic safety guarantees, offering up to 300\% improvements in detection rates and 150\% improvements in policy gains at significantly smaller sample sizes.</description>

      <title>Estimating stationary mass, frequency by frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose we observe a trajectory of length $n$ from an $\alpha$-mixing stochastic process over a finite but potentially large state space. We consider the problem of estimating the probability mass placed by the stationary distribution of any such process on elements that occur with a certain frequency in the observed sequence. We estimate this vector of probabilities in total variation distance, showing universal consistency in $n$ and recovering known results for i.i.d. sequences as special cases. Our proposed methodology carefully combines the plug-in (or empirical) estimator with a recently-proposed modification of the Good--Turing estimator called \textsc{WingIt}, which was originally developed for Markovian sequences. En route to controlling the error of our estimator, we develop new performance bounds on \textsc{WingIt} and the plug-in estimator for $\alpha$-mixing stochastic processes. Importantly, the extensively used method of Poissonization can no longer be applied in our non i.i.d. setting, and so we develop complementary tools -- including concentration inequalities for a natural self-normalized statistic of mixing sequences -- that may prove independently useful in the design and analysis of estimators for related problems.</description>

      <title>Edgeworth Expansion for Semi-hard Triplet Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a higher-order asymptotic analysis for the semi-hard triplet loss using the Edgeworth expansion. It is known that this loss function enforces that embeddings of similar samples are close while those of dissimilar samples are separated by a specified margin. By refining the classical central limit theorem, our approach quantifies the impact of the margin parameter and the skewness of the underlying data distribution on the loss behavior. In particular, we derive explicit Edgeworth expansions that reveal first-order corrections in terms of the third cumulant, thereby characterizing non-Gaussian effects present in the distribution of distance differences between anchor-positive and anchor-negative pairs. Our findings provide detailed insight into the sensitivity of the semi-hard triplet loss to its parameters and offer guidance for choosing the margin to ensure training stability.</description>

      <title>E-Values Expand the Scope of Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal prediction is a powerful framework for distribution-free uncertainty quantification. The standard approach to conformal prediction relies on comparing the ranks of prediction scores: under exchangeability, the rank of a future test point cannot be too extreme relative to a calibration set. This rank-based method can be reformulated in terms of p-values. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach based on e-values, known as conformal e-prediction. E-values offer key advantages that cannot be achieved with p-values, enabling new theoretical and practical capabilities. In particular, we present three applications that leverage the unique strengths of e-values: batch anytime-valid conformal prediction, fixed-size conformal sets with data-dependent coverage, and conformal prediction under ambiguous ground truth. Overall, these examples demonstrate that e-value-based constructions provide a flexible expansion of the toolbox of conformal prediction.</description>

      <title>Do you understand epistemic uncertainty? Think again! Rigorous frequentist epistemic uncertainty estimation in regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying model uncertainty is critical for understanding prediction reliability, yet distinguishing between aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty remains challenging. We extend recent work from classification to regression to provide a novel frequentist approach to epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty estimation. We train models to generate conditional predictions by feeding their initial output back as an additional input. This method allows for a rigorous measurement of model uncertainty by observing how prediction responses change when conditioned on the model's previous answer. We provide a complete theoretical framework to analyze epistemic uncertainty in regression in a frequentist way, and explain how it can be exploited in practice to gauge a model's uncertainty, with minimal changes to the original architecture.</description>

      <title>Conformal Prediction and Human Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Methods to quantify uncertainty in predictions from arbitrary models are in demand in high-stakes domains like medicine and finance. Conformal prediction has emerged as a popular method for producing a set of predictions with specified average coverage, in place of a single prediction and confidence value. However, the value of conformal prediction sets to assist human decisions remains elusive due to the murky relationship between coverage guarantees and decision makers' goals and strategies. How should we think about conformal prediction sets as a form of decision support? Under what conditions do we expect the support they provide to be superior versus inferior to that of alternative presentations of predictive uncertainty? We outline a decision theoretic framework for evaluating predictive uncertainty as informative signals, then contrast what can be said within this framework about idealized use of calibrated probabilities versus conformal prediction sets. Informed by prior empirical results and theories of human decisions under uncertainty, we formalize a set of possible strategies by which a decision maker might use a prediction set. We identify ways in which conformal prediction sets and posthoc predictive uncertainty quantification more broadly are in tension with common goals and needs in human-AI decision making. We give recommendations for future research in predictive uncertainty quantification to support human decision makers.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Predictability of Performative, Social Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social predictions do not passively describe the future; they actively shape it. They inform actions and change individual expectations in ways that influence the likelihood of the predicted outcome. Given these dynamics, to what extent can social events be predicted? This question was discussed throughout the 20th century by authors like Merton, Morgenstern, Simon, and others who considered it a central issue in social science methodology. In this work, we provide a modern answer to this old problem. Using recent ideas from performative prediction and outcome indistinguishability, we establish that one can always efficiently predict social events accurately, regardless of how predictions influence data. While achievable, we also show that these predictions are often undesirable, highlighting the limitations of previous desiderata. We end with a discussion of various avenues forward.</description>

      <title>Generalized Bayesian Ensemble Survival Tree (GBEST) model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new class of predictive models for survival analysis called Generalized Bayesian Ensemble Survival Tree (GBEST). It is well known that survival analysis poses many different challenges, in particular when applied to small data or censorship mechanism. Our contribution is the proposal of an ensemble approach that uses Bayesian bootstrap and beta Stacy bootstrap methods to improve the outcome in survival application with a special focus on small datasets. More precisely, a novel approach to integrate Beta Stacy Bayesian bootstrap in bagging tree models for censored data is proposed in this paper. Empirical evidence achieved on simulated and real data underlines that our approach performs better in terms of predictive performances and stability of the results compared with classical survival models available in the literature. In terms of methodology our novel contribution considers the adaptation of recent Bayesian ensemble approaches to survival data, providing a new model called Generalized Bayesian Ensemble Survival Tree (GBEST). A further result in terms of computational novelty is the implementation in R of GBEST, available in a public GitHub repository.</description>

      <title>UBMF: Uncertainty-Aware Bayesian Meta-Learning Framework for Fault Diagnosis with Imbalanced Industrial Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fault diagnosis of mechanical equipment involves data collection, feature extraction, and pattern recognition but is often hindered by the imbalanced nature of industrial data, introducing significant uncertainty and reducing diagnostic reliability. To address these challenges, this study proposes the Uncertainty-Aware Bayesian Meta-Learning Framework (UBMF), which integrates four key modules: data perturbation injection for enhancing feature robustness, cross-task self-supervised feature extraction for improving transferability, uncertainty-based sample filtering for robust out-of-domain generalization, and Bayesian meta-knowledge integration for fine-grained classification. Experimental results on ten open-source datasets under various imbalanced conditions, including cross-task, small-sample, and unseen-sample scenarios, demonstrate the superiority of UBMF, achieving an average improvement of 42.22% across ten Any-way 1-5-shot diagnostic tasks. This integrated framework effectively enhances diagnostic accuracy, generalization, and adaptability, providing a reliable solution for complex industrial fault diagnosis.</description>

      <title>The Architecture and Evaluation of Bayesian Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As modern neural networks get more complex, specifying a model with high predictive performance and sound uncertainty quantification becomes a more challenging task. Despite some promising theoretical results on the true posterior predictive distribution of Bayesian neural networks, the properties of even the most commonly used posterior approximations are often questioned. Computational burdens and intractable posteriors expose miscalibrated Bayesian neural networks to poor accuracy and unreliable uncertainty estimates. Approximate Bayesian inference aims to replace unknown and intractable posterior distributions with some simpler but feasible distributions. The dimensions of modern deep models coupled with the lack of identifiability make Markov chain Monte Carlo tremendously expensive and unable to fully explore the multimodal posterior. On the other hand, variational inference benefits from improved computational complexity but lacks the asymptotical guarantees of sampling-based inference and tends to concentrate around a single mode. The performance of both approaches heavily depends on architectural choices; this paper aims to shed some light on this, by considering the computational costs, accuracy and uncertainty quantification in different scenarios including large width and out-of-sample data. To improve posterior exploration, different model averaging and ensembling techniques are studied, along with their benefits on predictive performance. In our experiments, variational inference overall provided better uncertainty quantification than Markov chain Monte Carlo; further, stacking and ensembles of variational approximations provided comparable to Markov chain Monte Carlo accuracy at a much-reduced cost.</description>

      <title>Online Assortment and Price Optimization Under Contextual Choice Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an assortment selection and pricing problem in which a seller has $N$ different items available for sale. In each round, the seller observes a $d$-dimensional contextual preference information vector for the user, and offers to the user an assortment of $K$ items at prices chosen by the seller. The user selects at most one of the products from the offered assortment according to a multinomial logit choice model whose parameters are unknown. The seller observes which, if any, item is chosen at the end of each round, with the goal of maximizing cumulative revenue over a selling horizon of length $T$. For this problem, we propose an algorithm that learns from user feedback and achieves a revenue regret of order $\widetilde{O}(d \sqrt{K T} / L_0 )$ where $L_0$ is the minimum price sensitivity parameter. We also obtain a lower bound of order $\Omega(d \sqrt{T}/ L_0)$ for the regret achievable by any algorithm.</description>

      <title>GPDFlow: Generative Multivariate Threshold Exceedance Modeling via Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The multivariate generalized Pareto distribution (mGPD) is a common method for modeling extreme threshold exceedance probabilities in environmental and financial risk management. Despite its broad applicability, mGPD faces challenges due to the infinite possible parametrizations of its dependence function, with only a few parametric models available in practice. To address this limitation, we introduce GPDFlow, an innovative mGPD model that leverages normalizing flows to flexibly represent the dependence structure. Unlike traditional parametric mGPD approaches, GPDFlow does not impose explicit parametric assumptions on dependence, resulting in greater flexibility and enhanced performance. Additionally, GPDFlow allows direct inference of marginal parameters, providing insights into marginal tail behavior. We derive tail dependence coefficients for GPDFlow, including a bivariate formulation, a $d$-dimensional extension, and an alternative measure for partial exceedance dependence. A general relationship between the bivariate tail dependence coefficient and the generative samples from normalizing flows is discussed. Through simulations and a practical application analyzing the risk among five major US banks, we demonstrate that GPDFlow significantly improves modeling accuracy and flexibility compared to traditional parametric methods.</description>

      <title>Test-Time Training Provably Improves Transformers as In-context Learners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Test-time training (TTT) methods explicitly update the weights of a model to adapt to the specific test instance, and they have found success in a variety of settings, including most recently language modeling and reasoning. To demystify this success, we investigate a gradient-based TTT algorithm for in-context learning, where we train a transformer model on the in-context demonstrations provided in the test prompt. Specifically, we provide a comprehensive theoretical characterization of linear transformers when the update rule is a single gradient step. Our theory (i) delineates the role of alignment between pretraining distribution and target task, (ii) demystifies how TTT can alleviate distribution shift, and (iii) quantifies the sample complexity of TTT including how it can significantly reduce the eventual sample size required for in-context learning. As our empirical contribution, we study the benefits of TTT for TabPFN, a tabular foundation model. In line with our theory, we demonstrate that TTT significantly reduces the required sample size for tabular classification (3 to 5 times fewer) unlocking substantial inference efficiency with a negligible training cost.</description>

      <title>Training Diagonal Linear Networks with Stochastic Sharpness-Aware Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the landscape and training dynamics of diagonal linear networks in a linear regression task, with the network parameters being perturbed by small isotropic normal noise. The addition of such noise may be interpreted as a stochastic form of sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) and we prove several results that relate its action on the underlying landscape and training dynamics to the sharpness of the loss. In particular, the noise changes the expected gradient to force balancing of the weight matrices at a fast rate along the descent trajectory. In the diagonal linear model, we show that this equates to minimizing the average sharpness, as well as the trace of the Hessian matrix, among all possible factorizations of the same matrix. Further, the noise forces the gradient descent iterates towards a shrinkage-thresholding of the underlying true parameter, with the noise level explicitly regulating both the shrinkage factor and the threshold.</description>

      <title>Heterogenous graph neural networks for species distribution modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Species distribution models (SDMs) are necessary for measuring and predicting occurrences and habitat suitability of species and their relationship with environmental factors. We introduce a novel presence-only SDM with graph neural networks (GNN). In our model, species and locations are treated as two distinct node sets, and the learning task is predicting detection records as the edges that connect locations to species. Using GNN for SDM allows us to model fine-grained interactions between species and the environment. We evaluate the potential of this methodology on the six-region dataset compiled by National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) for benchmarking SDMs. For each of the regions, the heterogeneous GNN model is comparable to or outperforms previously-benchmarked single-species SDMs as well as a feed-forward neural network baseline model.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we address the enhancement of classification accuracy for 3D point cloud Lidar data, an optical remote sensing technique that estimates the three-dimensional coordinates of a given terrain. Our approach introduces product coefficients, theoretical quantities derived from measure theory, as additional features in the classification process. We define and present the formulation of these product coefficients and conduct a comparative study, using them alongside principal component analysis (PCA) as feature inputs. Results demonstrate that incorporating product coefficients into the feature set significantly improves classification accuracy within this new framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective uncertainty quantification is important for training modern predictive models with limited data, enhancing both accuracy and robustness. While Bayesian methods are effective for this purpose, they can be challenging to scale. When employing approximate Bayesian inference, ensuring the quality of samples from the posterior distribution in a computationally efficient manner is essential. This paper addresses the estimation of the Bayesian posterior to generate diverse samples by approximating the gradient flow of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and the cross entropy of the target approximation under the metric induced by the Stein Operator. It presents empirical evaluations on classification tasks to assess the method's performance and discuss its effectiveness for Model-Based Reinforcement Learning that uses uncertainty-aware network dynamics models.</description>

      <title>Mixed-feature Logistic Regression Robust to Distribution Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Logistic regression models are widely used in the social and behavioral sciences and in high-stakes domains, due to their simplicity and interpretability properties. At the same time, such domains are permeated by distribution shifts, where the distribution generating the data changes between training and deployment. In this paper, we study a distributionally robust logistic regression problem that seeks the model that will perform best against adversarial realizations of the data distribution drawn from a suitably constructed Wasserstein ambiguity set. Our model and solution approach differ from prior work in that we can capture settings where the likelihood of distribution shifts can vary across features, significantly broadening the applicability of our model relative to the state-of-the-art. We propose a graph-based solution approach that can be integrated into off-the-shelf optimization solvers. We evaluate the performance of our model and algorithms on numerous publicly available datasets. Our solution achieves a 408x speed-up relative to the state-of-the-art. Additionally, compared to the state-of-the-art, our model reduces average calibration error by up to 36.19% and worst-case calibration error by up to 41.70%, while increasing the average area under the ROC curve (AUC) by up to 18.02% and worst-case AUC by up to 48.37%.</description>

      <title>Variance-Dependent Regret Lower Bounds for Contextual Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variance-dependent regret bounds for linear contextual bandits, which improve upon the classical $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{K})$ regret bound to $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^K\sigma_k^2})$, where $d$ is the context dimension, $K$ is the number of rounds, and $\sigma^2_k$ is the noise variance in round $k$, has been widely studied in recent years. However, most existing works focus on the regret upper bounds instead of lower bounds. To our knowledge, the only lower bound is from Jia et al. (2024), which proved that for any eluder dimension $d_{\textbf{elu}}$ and total variance budget $\Lambda$, there exists an instance with $\sum_{k=1}^K\sigma_k^2\leq \Lambda$ for which any algorithm incurs a variance-dependent lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{d_{\textbf{elu}}\Lambda})$. However, this lower bound has a $\sqrt{d}$ gap with existing upper bounds. Moreover, it only considers a fixed total variance budget $\Lambda$ and does not apply to a general variance sequence $\{\sigma_1^2,\ldots,\sigma_K^2\}$. In this paper, to overcome the limitations of Jia et al. (2024), we consider the general variance sequence under two settings. For a prefixed sequence, where the entire variance sequence is revealed to the learner at the beginning of the learning process, we establish a variance-dependent lower bound of $\Omega(d \sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^K\sigma_k^2 }/\log K)$ for linear contextual bandits. For an adaptive sequence, where an adversary can generate the variance $\sigma_k^2$ in each round $k$ based on historical observations, we show that when the adversary must generate $\sigma_k^2$ before observing the decision set $\mathcal{D}_k$, a similar lower bound of $\Omega(d\sqrt{ \sum_{k=1}^K\sigma_k^2} /\log^6(dK))$ holds. In both settings, our results match the upper bounds of the SAVE algorithm (Zhao et al., 2023) up to logarithmic factors.</description>

      <title>Evaluation-Time Policy Switching for Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) looks at learning how to optimally solve tasks using a fixed dataset of interactions from the environment. Many off-policy algorithms developed for online learning struggle in the offline setting as they tend to over-estimate the behaviour of out of distributions actions. Existing offline RL algorithms adapt off-policy algorithms, employing techniques such as constraining the policy or modifying the value function to achieve good performance on individual datasets but struggle to adapt to different tasks or datasets of different qualities without tuning hyper-parameters. We introduce a policy switching technique that dynamically combines the behaviour of a pure off-policy RL agent, for improving behaviour, and a behavioural cloning (BC) agent, for staying close to the data. We achieve this by using a combination of epistemic uncertainty, quantified by our RL model, and a metric for aleatoric uncertainty extracted from the dataset. We show empirically that our policy switching technique can outperform not only the individual algorithms used in the switching process but also compete with state-of-the-art methods on numerous benchmarks. Our use of epistemic uncertainty for policy switching also allows us to naturally extend our method to the domain of offline to online fine-tuning allowing our model to adapt quickly and safely from online data, either matching or exceeding the performance of current methods that typically require additional modification or hyper-parameter fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Towards Optimal Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study offline reinforcement learning problems with a long-run average reward objective. The state-action pairs generated by any fixed behavioral policy thus follow a Markov chain, and the {\em empirical} state-action-next-state distribution satisfies a large deviations principle. We use the rate function of this large deviations principle to construct an uncertainty set for the unknown {\em true} state-action-next-state distribution. We also construct a distribution shift transformation that maps any distribution in this uncertainty set to a state-action-next-state distribution of the Markov chain generated by a fixed evaluation policy, which may differ from the unknown behavioral policy. We prove that the worst-case average reward of the evaluation policy with respect to all distributions in the shifted uncertainty set provides, in a rigorous statistical sense, the least conservative estimator for the average reward under the unknown true distribution. This guarantee is available even if one has only access to one single trajectory of serially correlated state-action pairs. The emerging robust optimization problem can be viewed as a robust Markov decision process with a non-rectangular uncertainty set. We adapt an efficient policy gradient algorithm to solve this problem. Numerical experiments show that our methods compare favorably against state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Bi-Criteria Optimization for Combinatorial Bandits: Sublinear Regret and Constraint Violation under Bandit Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study bi-criteria optimization for combinatorial multi-armed bandits (CMAB) with bandit feedback. We propose a general framework that transforms discrete bi-criteria offline approximation algorithms into online algorithms with sublinear regret and cumulative constraint violation (CCV) guarantees. Our framework requires the offline algorithm to provide an $(\alpha, \beta)$-bi-criteria approximation ratio with $\delta$-resilience and utilize $\texttt{N}$ oracle calls to evaluate the objective and constraint functions. We prove that the proposed framework achieves sub-linear regret and CCV, with both bounds scaling as ${O}\left(\delta^{2/3} \texttt{N}^{1/3}T^{2/3}\log^{1/3}(T)\right)$. Crucially, the framework treats the offline algorithm with $\delta$-resilience as a black box, enabling flexible integration of existing approximation algorithms into the CMAB setting. To demonstrate its versatility, we apply our framework to several combinatorial problems, including submodular cover, submodular cost covering, and fair submodular maximization. These applications highlight the framework's broad utility in adapting offline guarantees to online bi-criteria optimization under bandit feedback.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulation-based Bayesian inference (SBI) methods are widely used for parameter estimation in complex models where evaluating the likelihood is challenging but generating simulations is relatively straightforward. However, these methods commonly assume that the simulation model accurately reflects the true data-generating process, an assumption that is frequently violated in realistic scenarios. In this paper, we focus on the challenges faced by SBI methods under model misspecification. We consolidate recent research aimed at mitigating the effects of misspecification, highlighting three key strategies: i) robust summary statistics, ii) generalised Bayesian inference, and iii) error modelling and adjustment parameters. To illustrate both the vulnerabilities of popular SBI methods and the effectiveness of misspecification-robust alternatives, we present empirical results on an illustrative example.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Neural Networks (PNNs) with t-Distributed Outputs: Adaptive Prediction Intervals Beyond Gaussian Assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional neural network regression models provide only point estimates, failing to capture predictive uncertainty. Probabilistic neural networks (PNNs) address this limitation by producing output distributions, enabling the construction of prediction intervals. However, the common assumption of Gaussian output distributions often results in overly wide intervals, particularly in the presence of outliers or deviations from normality. To enhance the adaptability of PNNs, we propose t-Distributed Neural Networks (TDistNNs), which generate t-distributed outputs, parameterized by location, scale, and degrees of freedom. The degrees of freedom parameter allows TDistNNs to model heavy-tailed predictive distributions, improving robustness to non-Gaussian data and enabling more adaptive uncertainty quantification. We develop a novel loss function tailored for the t-distribution and derive efficient gradient computations for seamless integration into deep learning frameworks. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that TDistNNs improve the balance between coverage and interval width. Notably, for identical architectures, TDistNNs consistently produce narrower prediction intervals than Gaussian-based PNNs while maintaining proper coverage. This work contributes a flexible framework for uncertainty estimation in neural networks tasked with regression, particularly suited to settings involving complex output distributions.</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis of alpha-SVRG under Strong Convexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic first-order methods for empirical risk minimization employ gradient approximations based on sampled data in lieu of exact gradients. Such constructions introduce noise into the learning dynamics, which can be corrected through variance-reduction techniques. There is increasing evidence in the literature that in many modern learning applications noise can have a beneficial effect on optimization and generalization. To this end, the recently proposed variance-reduction technique, alpha-SVRG [Yin et al., 2023] allows for fine-grained control of the level of residual noise in the learning dynamics, and has been reported to empirically outperform both SGD and SVRG in modern deep learning scenarios. By focusing on strongly convex environments, we first provide a unified convergence rate expression for alpha-SVRG under fixed learning rate, which reduces to that of either SGD or SVRG by setting alpha=0 or alpha=1, respectively. We show that alpha-SVRG has faster convergence rate compared to SGD and SVRG under suitable choice of alpha. Simulation results on linear regression validate our theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop Clustered Random Forests, a random forests algorithm for clustered data, arising from independent groups that exhibit within-cluster dependence. The leaf-wise predictions for each decision tree making up clustered random forests takes the form of a weighted least squares estimator, which leverage correlations between observations for improved prediction accuracy. Clustered random forests are shown for certain tree splitting criteria to be minimax rate optimal for pointwise conditional mean estimation, while being computationally competitive with standard random forests. Further, we observe that the optimality of a clustered random forest, with regards to how (population level) optimal weights are chosen within this framework i.e. those that minimise mean squared prediction error, vary under covariate distribution shift. In light of this, we advocate weight estimation to be determined by a user-chosen covariate distribution with respect to which optimal prediction or inference is desired. This highlights a key difference in behaviour, between correlated and independent data, with regards to nonparametric conditional mean estimation under covariate shift. We demonstrate our theoretical findings numerically in a number of simulated and real-world settings.</description>

      <title>Understanding Gradient Orthogonalization for Deep Learning via Non-Euclidean Trust-Region Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimization with matrix gradient orthogonalization has recently demonstrated impressive results in the training of deep neural networks (Jordan et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2025). In this paper, we provide a theoretical analysis of this approach. In particular, we show that the orthogonalized gradient method can be seen as a first-order trust-region optimization method, where the trust-region is defined in terms of the matrix spectral norm. Motivated by this observation, we provide the first theoretical analysis of the stochastic non-Euclidean trust-region gradient method with momentum, which recovers the Muon optimizer (Jordan et al., 2024) as a special case. In addition, we establish the convergence of the normalized SGD with momentum (Cutkosky and Mehta, 2020) in the constrained and composite setting, show that its iteration complexity of finding an $\varepsilon$-accurate solution can be improved from $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-3.5})$ to $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-3})$ under the star-convexity assumption, and obtain similar results for the Muon algorithm. Finally, our theoretical findings provide an explanation for the practical superiority of Muon compared to the Orthogonal-SGDM algorithm of Tuddenham et al. (2022).</description>

      <title>In-Context Linear Regression Demystified: Training Dynamics and Mechanistic Interpretability of Multi-Head Softmax Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how multi-head softmax attention models are trained to perform in-context learning on linear data. Through extensive empirical experiments and rigorous theoretical analysis, we demystify the emergence of elegant attention patterns: a diagonal and homogeneous pattern in the key-query (KQ) weights, and a last-entry-only and zero-sum pattern in the output-value (OV) weights. Remarkably, these patterns consistently appear from gradient-based training starting from random initialization. Our analysis reveals that such emergent structures enable multi-head attention to approximately implement a debiased gradient descent predictor -- one that outperforms single-head attention and nearly achieves Bayesian optimality up to proportional factor. Furthermore, compared to linear transformers, the softmax attention readily generalizes to sequences longer than those seen during training. We also extend our study to scenarios with non-isotropic covariates and multi-task linear regression. In the former, multi-head attention learns to implement a form of pre-conditioned gradient descent. In the latter, we uncover an intriguing regime where the interplay between head number and task number triggers a superposition phenomenon that efficiently resolves multi-task in-context learning. Our results reveal that in-context learning ability emerges from the trained transformer as an aggregated effect of its architecture and the underlying data distribution, paving the way for deeper understanding and broader applications of in-context learning.</description>

      <title>Statistical Inference for Weighted Sample Average Approximation in Contextual Stochastic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contextual stochastic optimization provides a framework for decision-making under uncertainty incorporating observable contextual information through covariates. We analyze statistical inference for weighted sample average approximation (wSAA), a widely-used method for solving contextual stochastic optimization problems. We first establish central limit theorems for wSAA estimates of optimal values when problems can be solved exactly, characterizing how estimation uncertainty scales with covariate sample size. We then investigate practical scenarios with computational budget constraints, revealing a fundamental tradeoff between statistical accuracy and computational cost as sample sizes increase. Through central limit theorems for budget-constrained wSAA estimates, we precisely characterize this statistical-computational tradeoff. We also develop "over-optimizing" strategies for solving wSAA problems that ensure valid statistical inference. Extensive numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Cohort-attention Evaluation Metric against Tied Data: Studying Performance of Classification Models in Cancer Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly improved medical screening accuracy, particularly in cancer detection and risk assessment. However, traditional classification metrics often fail to account for imbalanced data, varying performance across cohorts, and patient-level inconsistencies, leading to biased evaluations. We propose the Cohort-Attention Evaluation Metrics (CAT) framework to address these challenges. CAT introduces patient-level assessment, entropy-based distribution weighting, and cohort-weighted sensitivity and specificity. Key metrics like CATSensitivity (CATSen), CATSpecificity (CATSpe), and CATMean ensure balanced and fair evaluation across diverse populations. This approach enhances predictive reliability, fairness, and interpretability, providing a robust evaluation method for AI-driven medical screening models.</description>

      <title>LangDA: Building Context-Awareness via Language for Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation for semantic segmentation (DASS) aims to transfer knowledge from a label-rich source domain to a target domain with no labels. Two key approaches in DASS are (1) vision-only approaches using masking or multi-resolution crops, and (2) language-based approaches that use generic class-wise prompts informed by target domain (e.g. "a {snowy} photo of a {class}"). However, the former is susceptible to noisy pseudo-labels that are biased to the source domain. The latter does not fully capture the intricate spatial relationships of objects -- key for dense prediction tasks. To this end, we propose LangDA. LangDA addresses these challenges by, first, learning contextual relationships between objects via VLM-generated scene descriptions (e.g. "a pedestrian is on the sidewalk, and the street is lined with buildings."). Second, LangDA aligns the entire image features with text representation of this context-aware scene caption and learns generalized representations via text. With this, LangDA sets the new state-of-the-art across three DASS benchmarks, outperforming existing methods by 2.6%, 1.4% and 3.9%.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Power Law for Loss Curve Prediction Across Learning Rate Schedules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training large models is both resource-intensive and time-consuming, making it crucial to understand the quantitative relationship between model performance and hyperparameters. In this paper, we present an empirical law that describes how the pretraining loss of large language models evolves under different learning rate schedules, such as constant, cosine, and step decay schedules. Our proposed law takes a multi-power form, combining a power law based on the sum of learning rates and additional power laws to account for a loss reduction effect induced by learning rate decay. We extensively validate this law on various model sizes and architectures, and demonstrate that after fitting on a few learning rate schedules, the law accurately predicts the loss curves for unseen schedules of different shapes and horizons. Moreover, by minimizing the predicted final pretraining loss across learning rate schedules, we are able to find a schedule that outperforms the widely used cosine learning rate schedule. Interestingly, this automatically discovered schedule bears some resemblance to the recently proposed Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD) schedule (Hu et al, 2024) but achieves a slightly lower final loss. We believe these results could offer valuable insights for understanding the dynamics of pretraining and designing learning rate schedules to improve efficiency.</description>

      <title>An Optimization Framework for Differentially Private Sparse Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) is broadly considered to be the gold standard for training and fine-tuning neural networks under differential privacy (DP). With the increasing availability of high-quality pre-trained model checkpoints (e.g., vision and language models), fine-tuning has become a popular strategy. However, despite recent progress in understanding and applying DP-SGD for private transfer learning tasks, significant challenges remain -- most notably, the performance gap between models fine-tuned with DP-SGD and their non-private counterparts. Sparse fine-tuning on private data has emerged as an alternative to full-model fine-tuning; recent work has shown that privately fine-tuning only a small subset of model weights and keeping the rest of the weights fixed can lead to better performance. In this work, we propose a new approach for sparse fine-tuning of neural networks under DP. Existing work on private sparse finetuning often used fixed choice of trainable weights (e.g., updating only the last layer), or relied on public model's weights to choose the subset of weights to modify. Such choice of weights remains suboptimal. In contrast, we explore an optimization-based approach, where our selection method makes use of the private gradient information, while using off the shelf privacy accounting techniques. Our numerical experiments on several computer vision models and datasets show that our selection method leads to better prediction accuracy, compared to full-model private fine-tuning or existing private sparse fine-tuning approaches.</description>

      <title>Augmented Invertible Koopman Autoencoder for long-term time series forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following the introduction of Dynamic Mode Decomposition and its numerous extensions, many neural autoencoder-based implementations of the Koopman operator have recently been proposed. This class of methods appears to be of interest for modeling dynamical systems, either through direct long-term prediction of the evolution of the state or as a powerful embedding for downstream methods. In particular, a recent line of work has developed invertible Koopman autoencoders (IKAEs), which provide an exact reconstruction of the input state thanks to their analytically invertible encoder, based on coupling layer normalizing flow models. We identify that the conservation of the dimension imposed by the normalizing flows is a limitation for the IKAE models, and thus we propose to augment the latent state with a second, non-invertible encoder network. This results in our new model: the Augmented Invertible Koopman AutoEncoder (AIKAE). We demonstrate the relevance of the AIKAE through a series of long-term time series forecasting experiments, on satellite image time series as well as on a benchmark involving predictions based on a large lookback window of observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Score-based generative models achieve state-of-the-art sampling performance by denoising a distribution perturbed by Gaussian noise. In this paper, we focus on a single deterministic denoising step, and compare the optimal denoiser for the quadratic loss, we name ''full-denoising'', to the alternative ''half-denoising'' introduced by Hyv{\"a}rinen (2024). We show that looking at the performances in term of distance between distribution tells a more nuanced story, with different assumptions on the data leading to very different conclusions.We prove that half-denoising is better than full-denoising for regular enough densities, while full-denoising is better for singular densities such as mixtures of Dirac measures or densities supported on a low-dimensional subspace. In the latter case, we prove that full-denoising can alleviate the curse of dimensionality under a linear manifold hypothesis.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Heteroscedastic AddiVortes model, a Bayesian non-parametric regression framework that simultaneously models the conditional mean and variance of a response variable using adaptive Voronoi tessellations. By employing a sum-of-tessellations approach for the mean and a product-of-tessellations approach for the variance, the model provides a flexible and interpretable means to capture complex, predictor-dependent relationships and heteroscedastic patterns in data. This dual-layer representation enables precise inference, even in high-dimensional settings, while maintaining computational feasibility through efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and conjugate prior structures. We illustrate the model's capability through both simulated and real-world datasets, demonstrating its ability to capture nuanced variance structures, provide reliable predictive uncertainty quantification, and highlight key predictors influencing both the mean response and its variability. Empirical results show that the Heteroscedastic AddiVortes model offers a substantial improvement in capturing distributional properties compared to both homoscedastic and heteroscedastic alternatives, making it a robust tool for complex regression problems in various applied settings.</description>

      <title>Permutation Learning with Only N Parameters: From SoftSort to Self-Organizing Gaussians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sorting and permutation learning are key concepts in optimization and machine learning, especially when organizing high-dimensional data into meaningful spatial layouts. The Gumbel-Sinkhorn method, while effective, requires N*N parameters to determine a full permutation matrix, making it computationally expensive for large datasets. Low-rank matrix factorization approximations reduce memory requirements to 2MN (with M &lt;&lt; N), but they still struggle with very large problems. SoftSort, by providing a continuous relaxation of the argsort operator, allows differentiable 1D sorting, but it faces challenges with multidimensional data and complex permutations. In this paper, we present a novel method for learning permutations using only N parameters, which dramatically reduces storage costs. Our approach builds on SoftSort, but extends it by iteratively shuffling the N indices of the elements to be sorted through a separable learning process. This modification significantly improves sorting quality, especially for multidimensional data and complex optimization criteria, and outperforms pure SoftSort. Our method offers improved memory efficiency and scalability compared to existing approaches, while maintaining high-quality permutation learning. Its dramatically reduced memory requirements make it particularly well-suited for large-scale optimization tasks, such as "Self-Organizing Gaussians", where efficient and scalable permutation learning is critical.</description>

      <title>Beyond Propagation of Chaos: A Stochastic Algorithm for Mean Field Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gradient flow in the 2-Wasserstein space is widely used to optimize functionals over probability distributions and is typically implemented using an interacting particle system with $n$ particles. Analyzing these algorithms requires showing (a) that the finite-particle system converges and/or (b) that the resultant empirical distribution of the particles closely approximates the optimal distribution (i.e., propagation of chaos). However, establishing efficient sufficient conditions can be challenging, as the finite particle system may produce heavily dependent random variables.
  In this work, we study the virtual particle stochastic approximation, originally introduced for Stein Variational Gradient Descent. This method can be viewed as a form of stochastic gradient descent in the Wasserstein space and can be implemented efficiently. In popular settings, we demonstrate that our algorithm's output converges to the optimal distribution under conditions similar to those for the infinite particle limit, and it produces i.i.d. samples without the need to explicitly establish propagation of chaos bounds.</description>

      <title>On Local Posterior Structure in Deep Ensembles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) often improve model calibration and predictive uncertainty quantification compared to point estimators such as maximum-a-posteriori (MAP). Similarly, deep ensembles (DEs) are also known to improve calibration, and therefore, it is natural to hypothesize that deep ensembles of BNNs (DE-BNNs) should provide even further improvements. In this work, we systematically investigate this across a number of datasets, neural network architectures, and BNN approximation methods and surprisingly find that when the ensembles grow large enough, DEs consistently outperform DE-BNNs on in-distribution data. To shine light on this observation, we conduct several sensitivity and ablation studies. Moreover, we show that even though DE-BNNs outperform DEs on out-of-distribution metrics, this comes at the cost of decreased in-distribution performance. As a final contribution, we open-source the large pool of trained models to facilitate further research on this topic.</description>

Abstract: Constrained Online Convex Optimization (COCO) can be seen as a generalization of the standard Online Convex Optimization (OCO) framework. At each round, a cost function and constraint function are revealed after a learner chooses an action. The goal is to minimize both the regret and cumulative constraint violation (CCV) against an adaptive adversary. We show for the first time that is possible to obtain the optimal $O(\sqrt{T})$ bound on both regret and CCV, improving the best known bounds of $O \left( \sqrt{T} \right)$ and $\~{O} \left( \sqrt{T} \right)$ for the regret and CCV, respectively.</description>

      <title>Fed-Joint: Joint Modeling of Nonlinear Degradation Signals and Failure Events for Remaining Useful Life Prediction using Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many failure mechanisms of machinery are closely related to the behavior of condition monitoring (CM) signals. To achieve a cost-effective preventive maintenance strategy, accurate remaining useful life (RUL) prediction based on the signals is of paramount importance. However, the CM signals are often recorded at different factories and production lines, with limited amounts of data. Unfortunately, these datasets have rarely been shared between the sites due to data confidentiality and ownership issues, a lack of computing and storage power, and high communication costs associated with data transfer between sites and a data center. Another challenge in real applications is that the CM signals are often not explicitly specified \textit{a priori}, meaning that existing methods, which often usually a parametric form, may not be applicable. To address these challenges, we propose a new prognostic framework for RUL prediction using the joint modeling of nonlinear degradation signals and time-to-failure data within a federated learning scheme. The proposed method constructs a nonparametric degradation model using a federated multi-output Gaussian process and then employs a federated survival model to predict failure times and probabilities for in-service machinery. The superiority of the proposed method over other alternatives is demonstrated through comprehensive simulation studies and a case study using turbofan engine degradation signal data that include run-to-failure events.</description>

      <title>The Nystr\"om method for convex loss functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.10016v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate an extension of classical empirical risk minimization, where the hypothesis space consists of a random subspace within a given Hilbert space. Specifically, we examine the Nystr\"om method where the subspaces are defined by a random subset of the data. This approach recovers Nystr\"om approximations used in kernel methods as a specific case. Using random subspaces naturally leads to computational advantages, but a key question is whether it compromises the learning accuracy. Recently, the tradeoffs between statistics and computation have been explored for the square loss and self-concordant losses, such as the logistic loss. In this paper, we extend these analyses to general convex Lipschitz losses, which may lack smoothness, such as the hinge loss used in support vector machines. Our main results show the existence of various scenarios where computational gains can be achieved without sacrificing learning performance. When specialized to smooth loss functions, our analysis recovers most previous results. Moreover, it allows to consider classification problems and translate the surrogate risk bounds into classification error bounds. Indeed, this gives the opportunity to compare the effect of Nystr\"om approximations when combined with different loss functions such as the hinge or the square loss.</description>

      <title>Doubly Inhomogeneous Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.03983v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies reinforcement learning (RL) in doubly inhomogeneous environments under temporal non-stationarity and subject heterogeneity. In a number of applications, it is commonplace to encounter datasets generated by system dynamics that may change over time and population, challenging high-quality sequential decision making. Nonetheless, most existing RL solutions require either temporal stationarity or subject homogeneity, which would result in sub-optimal policies if both assumptions were violated. To address both challenges simultaneously, we propose an original algorithm to determine the ``best data chunks" that display similar dynamics over time and across individuals for policy learning, which alternates between most recent change point detection and cluster identification. Our method is general, and works with a wide range of clustering and change point detection algorithms. It is multiply robust in the sense that it takes multiple initial estimators as input and only requires one of them to be consistent. Moreover, by borrowing information over time and population, it allows us to detect weaker signals and has better convergence properties when compared to applying the clustering algorithm per time or the change point detection algorithm per subject. Empirically, we demonstrate the usefulness of our method through extensive simulations and a real data application.</description>

      <title>Nystr\"om $M$-Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.09930v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kernel techniques are among the most popular and powerful approaches of data science. Among the key features that make kernels ubiquitous are (i) the number of domains they have been designed for, (ii) the Hilbert structure of the function class associated to kernels facilitating their statistical analysis, and (iii) their ability to represent probability distributions without loss of information. These properties give rise to the immense success of Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) which is able to capture joint independence of random variables under mild conditions, and permits closed-form estimators with quadratic computational complexity (w.r.t. the sample size). In order to alleviate the quadratic computational bottleneck in large-scale applications, multiple HSIC approximations have been proposed, however these estimators are restricted to $M=2$ random variables, do not extend naturally to the $M\ge 2$ case, and lack theoretical guarantees. In this work, we propose an alternative Nystr\"om-based HSIC estimator which handles the $M\ge 2$ case, prove its consistency, and demonstrate its applicability in multiple contexts, including synthetic examples, dependency testing of media annotations, and causal discovery.</description>

      <title>Semidefinite programming relaxations and debiasing for MAXCUT-based clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of partitioning a small data sample of size $n$ drawn from a mixture of 2 sub-gaussian distributions in $\mathbb{R}^p$. We consider semidefinite programming relaxations of an integer quadratic program that is formulated as finding the maximum cut on a graph, where edge weights in the cut represent dissimilarity scores between two nodes based on their $p$ features. We are interested in the case that individual features are of low average quality $\gamma$, and we want to use as few of them as possible to correctly partition the sample. Denote by $\Delta^2:=p \gamma$ the $\ell_2^2$ distance between two centers (mean vectors) in $\mathbb{R}^p$. The goal is to allow a full range of tradeoffs between $n, p, \gamma$ in the sense that partial recovery (success rate $&lt; 100\%$) is feasible once the signal to noise ratio $s^2 := \min\{np \gamma^2, \Delta^2\}$ is lower bounded by a constant. For both balanced and unbalanced cases, we allow each population to have distinct covariance structures with diagonal matrices as special cases. In the present work, (a) we provide a unified framework for analyzing three computationally efficient algorithms, namely, SDP1, BalancedSDP, and Spectral clustering; and (b) we prove that the misclassification error decays exponentially with respect to the SNR $s^2$ for SDP1. Moreover, for balanced partitions, we design an estimator {\bf BalancedSDP} with a superb debiasing property. Indeed, with this new estimator, we remove an assumption (A2) on bounding the trace difference between the two population covariance matrices while proving the exponential error bound as stated above. These estimators and their statistical analyses are novel to the best of our knowledge. We provide simulation evidence illuminating the theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Alpha-divergence loss function for neural density ratio estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02041v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Density ratio estimation (DRE) is a fundamental machine learning technique for capturing relationships between two probability distributions. State-of-the-art DRE methods estimate the density ratio using neural networks trained with loss functions derived from variational representations of $f$-divergences. However, existing methods face optimization challenges, such as overfitting due to lower-unbounded loss functions, biased mini-batch gradients, vanishing training loss gradients, and high sample requirements for Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence loss functions. To address these issues, we focus on $\alpha$-divergence, which provides a suitable variational representation of $f$-divergence. Subsequently, a novel loss function for DRE, the $\alpha$-divergence loss function ($\alpha$-Div), is derived. $\alpha$-Div is concise but offers stable and effective optimization for DRE. The boundedness of $\alpha$-divergence provides the potential for successful DRE with data exhibiting high KL-divergence. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of $\alpha$-Div in optimization. However, the experiments also show that the proposed loss function offers no significant advantage over the KL-divergence loss function in terms of RMSE for DRE. This indicates that the accuracy of DRE is primarily determined by the amount of KL-divergence in the data and is less dependent on $\alpha$-divergence.</description>

      <title>Optimal Kernel Quantile Learning with Random Features</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The random feature (RF) approach is a well-established and efficient tool for scalable kernel methods, but existing literature has primarily focused on kernel ridge regression with random features (KRR-RF), which has limitations in handling heterogeneous data with heavy-tailed noises. This paper presents a generalization study of kernel quantile regression with random features (KQR-RF), which accounts for the non-smoothness of the check loss in KQR-RF by introducing a refined error decomposition and establishing a novel connection between KQR-RF and KRR-RF. Our study establishes the capacity-dependent learning rates for KQR-RF under mild conditions on the number of RFs, which are minimax optimal up to some logarithmic factors. Importantly, our theoretical results, utilizing a data-dependent sampling strategy, can be extended to cover the agnostic setting where the target quantile function may not precisely align with the assumed kernel space. By slightly modifying our assumptions, the capacity-dependent error analysis can also be applied to cases with Lipschitz continuous losses, enabling broader applications in the machine learning community. To validate our theoretical findings, simulated experiments and a real data application are conducted.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) provides robust privacy guarantees for statistical inference, but this can lead to unreliable results and biases in downstream applications. While several noise-aware approaches have been proposed which integrate DP perturbation into the inference, they are limited to specific types of simple probabilistic models. In this work, we propose a novel method for noise-aware approximate Bayesian inference based on stochastic gradient variational inference which can also be applied to high-dimensional and non-conjugate models. We also propose a more accurate evaluation method for noise-aware posteriors. Empirically, our inference method has similar performance to existing methods in the domain where they are applicable. Outside this domain, we obtain accurate coverages on high-dimensional Bayesian linear regression and well-calibrated predictive probabilities on Bayesian logistic regression with the UCI Adult dataset.</description>

      <title>All or None: Identifiable Linear Properties of Next-token Predictors in Language Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze identifiability as a possible explanation for the ubiquity of linear properties across language models, such as the vector difference between the representations of "easy" and "easiest" being parallel to that between "lucky" and "luckiest". For this, we ask whether finding a linear property in one model implies that any model that induces the same distribution has that property, too. To answer that, we first prove an identifiability result to characterize distribution-equivalent next-token predictors, lifting a diversity requirement of previous results. Second, based on a refinement of relational linearity [Paccanaro and Hinton, 2001; Hernandez et al., 2024], we show how many notions of linearity are amenable to our analysis. Finally, we show that under suitable conditions, these linear properties either hold in all or none distribution-equivalent next-token predictors.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Multi-Scale Representations to Detect Effect Heterogeneity Using Earth Observation and Computer Vision: Applications to Two Anti-Poverty RCTs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Earth Observation (EO) data are increasingly used in policy analysis by enabling granular estimation of conditional average treatment effects (CATE). However, a challenge in EO-based causal inference is determining the scale of the input satellite imagery -- balancing the trade-off between capturing fine-grained individual heterogeneity in smaller images and broader contextual information in larger ones. This paper introduces Multi-Scale Representation Concatenation, a set of composable procedures that transform arbitrary single-scale EO-based CATE estimation algorithms into multi-scale ones. We benchmark the performance of Multi-Scale Representation Concatenation on a CATE estimation pipeline that combines Vision Transformer (ViT) models (which encode images) with Causal Forests (CFs) to obtain CATE estimates from those encodings. We first perform simulation studies where the causal mechanism is known, showing that our multi-scale approach captures information relevant to effect heterogeneity that single-scale ViT models fail to capture as measured by $R^2$. We then apply the multi-scale method to two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in Peru and Uganda using Landsat satellite imagery. As we do not have access to ground truth CATEs in the RCT analysis, the Rank Average Treatment Effect Ratio (RATE Ratio) measure is employed to assess performance. Results indicate that Multi-Scale Representation Concatenation improves the performance of deep learning models in EO-based CATE estimation without the complexity of designing new multi-scale architectures for a specific use case. The application of Multi-Scale Representation Concatenation could have meaningful policy benefits -- e.g., potentially increasing the impact of poverty alleviation programs without additional resource expenditure.</description>

      <title>How compositional generalization and creativity improve as diffusion models are trained</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Natural data is often organized as a hierarchical composition of features. How many samples do generative models need in order to learn the composition rules, so as to produce a combinatorially large number of novel data? What signal in the data is exploited to learn those rules? We investigate these questions in the context of diffusion models both theoretically and empirically. Theoretically, we consider simple probabilistic context-free grammars - tree-like graphical models used to represent the hierarchical and compositional structure of data such as language and images. We demonstrate that diffusion models learn the grammar's composition rules with the sample complexity required for clustering features with statistically similar context, a process similar to the word2vec algorithm. However, this clustering emerges hierarchically: higher-level features associated with longer contexts require more data to be identified. This mechanism leads to a sample complexity that scales polynomially with the said context size. As a result, diffusion models trained on an intermediate dataset size generate data coherent up to a certain scale, but that lacks global coherence. We test these predictions in different domains, and find remarkable agreement: both generated texts and images achieve progressively larger coherence lengths as the training time or dataset size grows. We discuss connections between the hierarchical clustering mechanism we introduce here and the renormalization group in physics.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Analysis of Two-Layer Neural Networks after One Gradient Step under Gaussian Mixtures Data with Structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the training and generalization performance of two-layer neural networks (NNs) after one gradient descent step under structured data modeled by Gaussian mixtures. While previous research has extensively analyzed this model under isotropic data assumption, such simplifications overlook the complexities inherent in real-world datasets. Our work addresses this limitation by analyzing two-layer NNs under Gaussian mixture data assumption in the asymptotically proportional limit, where the input dimension, number of hidden neurons, and sample size grow with finite ratios. We characterize the training and generalization errors by leveraging recent advancements in Gaussian universality. Specifically, we prove that a high-order polynomial model performs equivalent to the nonlinear neural networks under certain conditions. The degree of the equivalent model is intricately linked to both the "data spread" and the learning rate employed during one gradient step. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate the equivalence between the original model and its polynomial counterpart across various regression and classification tasks. Additionally, we explore how different properties of Gaussian mixtures affect learning outcomes. Finally, we illustrate experimental results on Fashion-MNIST classification, indicating that our findings can translate to realistic data.</description>

Abstract: In real-life scenarios, a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent aiming to maximise their reward, must often also behave in a safe manner, including at training time. Thus, much attention in recent years has been given to Safe RL, where an agent aims to learn an optimal policy among all policies that satisfy a given safety constraint. However, strict safety guarantees are often provided through approaches based on linear programming, and thus have limited scaling. In this paper we present a new, scalable method, which enjoys strict formal guarantees for Safe RL, in the case where the safety dynamics of the Markov Decision Process (MDP) are known, and safety is defined as an undiscounted probabilistic avoidance property. Our approach is based on state-augmentation of the MDP, and on the design of a shield that restricts the actions available to the agent. We show that our approach provides a strict formal safety guarantee that the agent stays safe at training and test time. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach is viable in practice through experimental evaluation.</description>

Abstract: Classification is an important statistical learning tool. In real application, besides high prediction accuracy, it is often desirable to estimate class conditional probabilities for new observations. For traditional problems where the number of observations is large, there exist many well developed approaches. Recently, high dimensional low sample size problems are becoming increasingly popular. Margin-based classifiers, such as logistic regression, are well established methods in the literature. On the other hand, in terms of probability estimation, it is known that for binary classifiers, the commonly used methods tend to under-estimate the norm of the classification function. This can lead to biased probability estimation. Remedy approaches have been proposed in the literature. However, for the simultaneous multicategory classification framework, much less work has been done. We fill the gap in this paper. In particular, we give theoretical insights on why heavy regularization terms are often needed in high dimensional applications, and how this can lead to bias in probability estimation. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a new refit strategy for multicategory angle-based classifiers. Our new method only adds a small computation cost to the problem, and is able to attain prediction accuracy that is as good as the regular margin-based classifiers. On the other hand, the improvement of probability estimation can be very significant. Numerical results suggest that the new refit approach is highly competitive.</description>

      <title>Sequential Kernel Embedding for Mediated and Time-Varying Dose Response Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.03950v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose simple nonparametric estimators for mediated and time-varying dose response curves based on kernel ridge regression. By embedding Pearl's mediation formula and Robins' g-formula with kernels, we allow treatments, mediators, and covariates to be continuous in general spaces, and also allow for nonlinear treatment-confounder feedback. Our key innovation is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space technique called sequential kernel embedding, which we use to construct simple estimators that account for complex feedback. Our estimators preserve the generality of classic identification while also achieving nonasymptotic uniform rates. In nonlinear simulations with many covariates, we demonstrate strong performance. We estimate mediated and time-varying dose response curves of the US Job Corps, and clean data that may serve as a benchmark in future work. We extend our results to mediated and time-varying treatment effects and counterfactual distributions, verifying semiparametric efficiency and weak convergence.</description>

      <title>Gaussian and Non-Gaussian Universality of Data Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.09134v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide universality results that quantify how data augmentation affects the variance and limiting distribution of estimates through simple surrogates, and analyze several specific models in detail. The results confirm some observations made in machine learning practice, but also lead to unexpected findings: Data augmentation may increase rather than decrease the uncertainty of estimates, such as the empirical prediction risk. It can act as a regularizer, but fails to do so in certain high-dimensional problems, and it may shift the double-descent peak of an empirical risk. Overall, the analysis shows that several properties data augmentation has been attributed with are not either true or false, but rather depend on a combination of factors -- notably the data distribution, the properties of the estimator, and the interplay of sample size, number of augmentations, and dimension. As our main theoretical tool, we develop an adaptation of Lindeberg's technique for block dependence. The resulting universality regime may be Gaussian or non-Gaussian.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Synthetic Tabular Data Generated To Augment Small Sample Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.10760v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a method to evaluate synthetic tabular data generated to augment small sample datasets. While data augmentation techniques can increase sample counts for machine learning applications, traditional validation approaches fail when applied to extremely limited sample sizes. Our experiments across four datasets reveal significant inconsistencies between global metrics and topological measures, with statistical tests producing unreliable significance values due to insufficient sample sizes. We demonstrate that common metrics like propensity scoring and MMD often suggest similarity where fundamental topological differences exist. Our proposed normalized Bottleneck distance based metric provides complementary insights but suffers from high variability across experimental runs and occasional values exceeding theoretical bounds, showing inherent instability in topological approaches for very small datasets. These findings highlight the critical need for multi-faceted evaluation methodologies when validating synthetic data generated from limited samples, as no single metric reliably captures both distributional and structural similarity.</description>

      <title>The Conditional Cauchy-Schwarz Divergence with Applications to Time-Series Data and Sequential Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.08970v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Cauchy-Schwarz (CS) divergence was developed by Pr\'{i}ncipe et al. in 2000. In this paper, we extend the classic CS divergence to quantify the closeness between two conditional distributions and show that the developed conditional CS divergence can be simply estimated by a kernel density estimator from given samples. We illustrate the advantages (e.g., rigorous faithfulness guarantee, lower computational complexity, higher statistical power, and much more flexibility in a wide range of applications) of our conditional CS divergence over previous proposals, such as the conditional KL divergence and the conditional maximum mean discrepancy. We also demonstrate the compelling performance of conditional CS divergence in two machine learning tasks related to time series data and sequential inference, namely time series clustering and uncertainty-guided exploration for sequential decision making. The code of conditional CS divergence is available at https://github.com/SJYuCNEL/conditional_CS_divergence.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous inference for generalized linear models with unmeasured confounders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07261v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tens of thousands of simultaneous hypothesis tests are routinely performed in genomic studies to identify differentially expressed genes. However, due to unmeasured confounders, many standard statistical approaches may be substantially biased. This paper investigates the large-scale hypothesis testing problem for multivariate generalized linear models in the presence of confounding effects. Under arbitrary confounding mechanisms, we propose a unified statistical estimation and inference framework that harnesses orthogonal structures and integrates linear projections into three key stages. It begins by disentangling marginal and uncorrelated confounding effects to recover the latent coefficients. Subsequently, latent factors and primary effects are jointly estimated through lasso-type optimization. Finally, we incorporate projected and weighted bias-correction steps for hypothesis testing. Theoretically, we establish the identification conditions of various effects and non-asymptotic error bounds. We show effective Type-I error control of asymptotic $z$-tests as sample and response sizes approach infinity. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method controls the false discovery rate by the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure and is more powerful than alternative methods. By comparing single-cell RNA-seq counts from two groups of samples, we demonstrate the suitability of adjusting confounding effects when significant covariates are absent from the model.</description>

      <title>Entropic Matching for Expectation Propagation of Markov Jump Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel, tractable latent state inference scheme for Markov jump processes, for which exact inference is often intractable. Our approach is based on an entropic matching framework that can be embedded into the well-known expectation propagation algorithm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by providing closed-form results for a simple family of approximate distributions and apply it to the general class of chemical reaction networks, which are a crucial tool for modeling in systems biology. Moreover, we derive closed-form expressions for point estimation of the underlying parameters using an approximate expectation maximization procedure. We evaluate our method across various chemical reaction networks and compare it to multiple baseline approaches, demonstrating superior performance in approximating the mean of the posterior process. Finally, we discuss the limitations of our method and potential avenues for future improvement, highlighting its promising direction for addressing complex continuous-time Bayesian inference problems.</description>

      <title>A Coefficient Makes SVRG Effective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic Variance Reduced Gradient (SVRG), introduced by Johnson &amp; Zhang (2013), is a theoretically compelling optimization method. However, as Defazio &amp; Bottou (2019) highlight, its effectiveness in deep learning is yet to be proven. In this work, we demonstrate the potential of SVRG in optimizing real-world neural networks. Our empirical analysis finds that, for deeper neural networks, the strength of the variance reduction term in SVRG should be smaller and decrease as training progresses. Inspired by this, we introduce a multiplicative coefficient $\alpha$ to control the strength and adjust it through a linear decay schedule. We name our method $\alpha$-SVRG. Our results show $\alpha$-SVRG better optimizes models, consistently reducing training loss compared to the baseline and standard SVRG across various model architectures and multiple image classification datasets. We hope our findings encourage further exploration into variance reduction techniques in deep learning. Code is available at github.com/davidyyd/alpha-SVRG.</description>

      <title>Critical Influence of Overparameterization on Sharpness-aware Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17539v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training overparameterized neural networks often yields solutions with varying generalization capabilities, even when achieving similar training losses. Recent evidence indicates a strong correlation between the sharpness of a minimum and its generalization error, leading to increased interest in optimization methods that explicitly seek flatter minima for improved generalization. Despite its contemporary relevance to overparameterization, however, this sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) strategy has not been studied much yet as to exactly how it is affected by overparameterization. In this work, we analyze SAM under varying degrees of overparameterization, presenting both empirical and theoretical findings that reveal its critical influence on SAM's effectiveness. First, we conduct extensive numerical experiments across diverse domains, demonstrating that SAM consistently benefits from overparameterization. Next, we attribute this phenomenon to the interplay between the enlarged solution space and increased implicit bias resulting from overparameterization. Furthermore, we show that this effect is particularly pronounced in practical settings involving label noise and sparsity, and yet, sufficient regularization is necessary. Last but not least, we provide other theoretical insights into how overparameterization helps SAM achieve minima with more uniform Hessian moments compared to SGD, and much faster convergence at a linear rate.</description>

      <title>Learning under Temporal Label Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many time series classification tasks, where labels vary over time, are affected by label noise that also varies over time. Such noise can cause label quality to improve, worsen, or periodically change over time. We first propose and formalize temporal label noise, an unstudied problem for sequential classification of time series. In this setting, multiple labels are recorded over time while being corrupted by a time-dependent noise function. We first demonstrate the importance of modeling the temporal nature of the label noise function and how existing methods will consistently underperform. We then propose methods to train noise-tolerant classifiers by estimating the temporal label noise function directly from data. We show that our methods lead to state-of-the-art performance under diverse types of temporal label noise on real-world datasets</description>

      <title>Logistic-beta processes for dependent random probabilities with beta marginals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07048v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The beta distribution serves as a canonical tool for modeling probabilities in statistics and machine learning. However, there is limited work on flexible and computationally convenient stochastic process extensions for modeling dependent random probabilities. We propose a novel stochastic process called the logistic-beta process, whose logistic transformation yields a stochastic process with common beta marginals. Logistic-beta processes can model dependence on both discrete and continuous domains, such as space or time, and have a flexible dependence structure through correlation kernels. Moreover, its normal variance-mean mixture representation leads to effective posterior inference algorithms. We show how the proposed logistic-beta process can be used to design computationally tractable dependent Bayesian nonparametric models, including dependent Dirichlet processes and extensions. We illustrate the benefits through nonparametric binary regression and conditional density estimation examples, both in simulation studies and in a pregnancy outcome application.</description>

      <title>Resilience of Rademacher chaos of low degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10504v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The resilience of a Rademacher chaos is the maximum number of adversarial sign-flips that the chaos can sustain without having its largest atom probability significantly altered. Inspired by probabilistic lower-bound guarantees for the resilience of linear Rademacher chaos, obtained by Bandeira, Ferber, and Kwan (Advances in Mathematics, Vol. $319$, $2017$), we provide probabilistic lower-bound guarantees for the resilience of Rademacher chaos of arbitrary yet sufficiently low degree.
  Our main results distinguish between Rademacher chaos of order two and those of higher order. In that, our first main result pertains to the resilience of decoupled bilinear Rademacher forms where different asymptotic behaviour is observed for sparse and dense matrices. For our second main result, we bootstrap our first result in order to provide resilience guarantees for quadratic Rademacher chaos. Our third main result, generalises the first and handles the resilience of decoupled Rademacher chaos of arbitrary yet sufficiently low order.
  Our results for decoupled Rademacher chaos of order two and that of higher order whilst are established through the same conceptual framework, differ substantially. A difference incurred due to the implementation of the same conceptual argument. The order two result is established using Dudley's maximal inequality for sub-Gaussian processes, the Hanson-Wright inequality, as well as the Kolmogorov-Rogozin inequality. To handle higher order chaos, appeals to Dudley's inequality as well as the Hanson-Wright inequality are replaced with tools suited for random tensors. Appeals to the Hanson-Wright inequality are replaced with appeals to a concentration result for random tensors put forth by Adamczak and Wolff.
  Our results are instance-dependent and thus allow for the efficient computation of resilience guarantees provided the order of the chaos is constant.</description>

      <title>Learning 3-Manifold Triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real 3-manifold triangulations can be uniquely represented by isomorphism signatures. Databases of these isomorphism signatures are generated for a variety of 3-manifolds and knot complements, using SnapPy and Regina, then these language-like inputs are used to train various machine learning architectures to differentiate the manifolds, as well as their Dehn surgeries, via their triangulations. Gradient saliency analysis then extracts key parts of this language-like encoding scheme from the trained models. The isomorphism signature databases are taken from the 3-manifolds' Pachner graphs, which are also generated in bulk for some selected manifolds of focus and for the subset of the SnapPy orientable cusped census with $&lt;8$ initial tetrahedra. These Pachner graphs are further analysed through the lens of network science to identify new structure in the triangulation representation; in particular for the hyperbolic case, a relation between the length of the shortest geodesic (systole) and the size of the Pachner graph's ball is observed.</description>

      <title>Standardizing Structural Causal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11601v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synthetic datasets generated by structural causal models (SCMs) are commonly used for benchmarking causal structure learning algorithms. However, the variances and pairwise correlations in SCM data tend to increase along the causal ordering. Several popular algorithms exploit these artifacts, possibly leading to conclusions that do not generalize to real-world settings. Existing metrics like $\operatorname{Var}$-sortability and $\operatorname{R^2}$-sortability quantify these patterns, but they do not provide tools to remedy them. To address this, we propose internally-standardized structural causal models (iSCMs), a modification of SCMs that introduces a standardization operation at each variable during the generative process. By construction, iSCMs are not $\operatorname{Var}$-sortable. We also find empirical evidence that they are mostly not $\operatorname{R^2}$-sortable for commonly-used graph families. Moreover, contrary to the post-hoc standardization of data generated by standard SCMs, we prove that linear iSCMs are less identifiable from prior knowledge on the weights and do not collapse to deterministic relationships in large systems, which may make iSCMs a useful model in causal inference beyond the benchmarking problem studied here.

      <title>Second Order Bounds for Contextual Bandits with Function Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16197v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many works have developed no-regret algorithms for contextual bandits with function approximation, where the mean reward function over context-action pairs belongs to a function class. Although there are many approaches to this problem, one that has gained in importance is the use of algorithms based on the optimism principle such as optimistic least squares. It can be shown the regret of this algorithm scales as square root of the product of the eluder dimension (a statistical measure of the complexity of the function class), the logarithm of the function class size and the time horizon. Unfortunately, even if the variance of the measurement noise of the rewards at each time is changing and is very small, the regret of the optimistic least squares algorithm scales with square root of the time horizon. In this work we are the first to develop algorithms that satisfy regret bounds of scaling not with the square root of the time horizon, but the square root of the sum of the measurement variances in the setting of contextual bandits with function approximation when the variances are unknown. These bounds generalize existing techniques for deriving second order bounds in contextual linear problems.</description>

      <title>Implementing NLPs in industrial process modeling: Addressing Categorical Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Important variables of processes are often categorical, i.e. names or labels representing, e.g. categories of inputs, or types of reactors or a sequence of steps. In this work, we use Natural Language Processing Models to derive embeddings of such inputs that represent their actual meaning, or reflect the "distances" between categories, i.e. how similar or dissimilar they are. This is a marked difference from the current standard practice of using binary, or one-hot encoding to replace categorical variables with sequences of ones and zeros. Combined with dimensionality reduction techniques, either linear such as Principal Component Analysis, or nonlinear such as Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection, the proposed approach leads to a meaningful, low-dimensional feature space. The significance of obtaining meaningful embeddings is illustrated in the context of an industrial coating process for cutting tools that includes both numerical and categorical inputs. In this industrial process, subject matter expertise suggests that the categorical inputs are critical for determining the final outcome but this cannot be taken into account with the current state-of-the-art. The proposed approach enables feature importance which is a marked improvement compared to the current state-of-the-art in the encoding of categorical variables. The proposed approach is not limited to the case-study presented here and is suitable for applications with similar mix of categorical and numerical critical inputs.</description>

      <title>Interval Estimation of Coefficients in Penalized Regression Models of Insurance Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01008v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Tweedie exponential dispersion family is a popular choice among many to model insurance losses that consist of zero-inflated semicontinuous data. In such data, it is often important to obtain credibility (inference) of the most important features that describe the endogenous variables. Post-selection inference is the standard procedure in statistics to obtain confidence intervals of model parameters after performing a feature extraction procedure. For a linear model, the lasso estimate often has non-negligible estimation bias for large coefficients corresponding to exogenous variables. To have valid inference on those coefficients, it is necessary to correct the bias of the lasso estimate. Traditional statistical methods, such as hypothesis testing or standard confidence interval construction might lead to incorrect conclusions during post-selection, as they are generally too optimistic. Here we discuss a few methodologies for constructing confidence intervals of the coefficients after feature selection in the Generalized Linear Model (GLM) family with application to insurance data.</description>

      <title>P1-KAN: an effective Kolmogorov-Arnold network with application to hydraulic valley optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03801v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) is proposed to approximate potentially irregular functions in high dimensions. We provide error bounds for this approximation, assuming that the Kolmogorov-Arnold expansion functions are sufficiently smooth. When the function is only continuous, we also provide universal approximation theorems. We show that it outperforms multilayer perceptrons in terms of accuracy and convergence speed. We also compare it with several proposed KAN networks: it outperforms all networks for irregular functions and achieves similar accuracy to the original spline-based KAN network for smooth functions. Finally, we compare some of the KAN networks in optimizing a French hydraulic valley.</description>

      <title>What Does It Mean to Be a Transformer? Insights from a Theoretical Hessian Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Transformer architecture has inarguably revolutionized deep learning, overtaking classical architectures like multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). At its core, the attention block differs in form and functionality from most other architectural components in deep learning--to the extent that, in comparison to MLPs/CNNs, Transformers are more often accompanied by adaptive optimizers, layer normalization, learning rate warmup, etc. The root causes behind these outward manifestations and the precise mechanisms that govern them remain poorly understood. In this work, we bridge this gap by providing a fundamental understanding of what distinguishes the Transformer from the other architectures--grounded in a theoretical comparison of the (loss) Hessian. Concretely, for a single self-attention layer, (a) we first entirely derive the Transformer's Hessian and express it in matrix derivatives; (b) we then characterize it in terms of data, weight, and attention moment dependencies; and (c) while doing so further highlight the important structural differences to the Hessian of classical networks. Our results suggest that various common architectural and optimization choices in Transformers can be traced back to their highly non-linear dependencies on the data and weight matrices, which vary heterogeneously across parameters. Ultimately, our findings provide a deeper understanding of the Transformer's unique optimization landscape and the challenges it poses.</description>

      <title>L3Ms -- Lagrange Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21533v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and alignment of large language models (LLMs) are key steps in providing a good user experience. However, the concept of an appropriate alignment is inherently application-dependent, and current methods often rely on heuristic choices to drive optimization. In this work, we formulate SFT and alignment as a constrained optimization problem: the LLM is fine-tuned on a task while being required to meet application-specific requirements, without resorting to heuristics. To solve this, we propose Lagrange Large Language Models (L3Ms), which employ logarithmic barriers to enforce the constraints. This approach allows for the customization of L3Ms across diverse applications while avoiding heuristic-driven processes. We experimentally demonstrate the versatility and efficacy of L3Ms in achieving tailored alignments for various applications.</description>

      <title>Improving Pareto Set Learning for Expensive Multi-objective Optimization via Stein Variational Hypernetworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17312v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Expensive multi-objective optimization problems (EMOPs) are common in real-world scenarios where evaluating objective functions is costly and involves extensive computations or physical experiments. Current Pareto set learning methods for such problems often rely on surrogate models like Gaussian processes to approximate the objective functions. These surrogate models can become fragmented, resulting in numerous small uncertain regions between explored solutions. When using acquisition functions such as the Lower Confidence Bound (LCB), these uncertain regions can turn into pseudo-local optima, complicating the search for globally optimal solutions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach called SVH-PSL, which integrates Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) with Hypernetworks for efficient Pareto set learning. Our method addresses the issues of fragmented surrogate models and pseudo-local optima by collectively moving particles in a manner that smooths out the solution space. The particles interact with each other through a kernel function, which helps maintain diversity and encourages the exploration of underexplored regions. This kernel-based interaction prevents particles from clustering around pseudo-local optima and promotes convergence towards globally optimal solutions. Our approach aims to establish robust relationships between trade-off reference vectors and their corresponding true Pareto solutions, overcoming the limitations of existing methods. Through extensive experiments across both synthetic and real-world MOO benchmarks, we demonstrate that SVH-PSL significantly improves the quality of the learned Pareto set, offering a promising solution for expensive multi-objective optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Batch Size Schedules for Distributed Training of Language Models with Data and Model Parallelism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An appropriate choice of batch sizes in large-scale model training is crucial, yet it involves an intrinsic yet inevitable dilemma: large-batch training improves training efficiency in terms of memory utilization, while generalization performance often deteriorates due to small amounts of gradient noise. Despite this dilemma, the common practice of choosing batch sizes in language model training often prioritizes training efficiency -- employing either constant large sizes with data parallelism or implementing batch size warmup schedules. However, such batch size schedule designs remain heuristic and often fail to adapt to training dynamics, presenting the challenge of designing adaptive batch size schedules. Given the abundance of available datasets and the data-hungry nature of language models, data parallelism has become an indispensable distributed training paradigm, enabling the use of larger batch sizes for gradient computation. However, vanilla data parallelism requires replicas of model parameters, gradients, and optimizer states at each worker, which prohibits training larger models with billions of parameters. To optimize memory usage, more advanced parallelism strategies must be employed. In this work, we propose general-purpose and theoretically principled adaptive batch size schedules compatible with data parallelism and model parallelism. We develop a practical implementation with PyTorch Fully Sharded Data Parallel, facilitating the pretraining of language models of different sizes. We empirically demonstrate that our proposed approaches outperform constant batch sizes and heuristic batch size warmup schedules in the pretraining of models in the Llama 2 family, with particular focus on smaller models with up to 3 billion parameters. We also establish theoretical convergence guarantees for such adaptive batch size schedules with Adam for general smooth nonconvex objectives.</description>

      <title>Alternating minimization for square root principal component pursuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the square root principal component pursuit (SRPCP) model has garnered significant research interest. It is shown in the literature that the SRPCP model guarantees robust matrix recovery with a universal, constant penalty parameter. While its statistical advantages are well-documented, the computational aspects from an optimization perspective remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we focus on developing efficient optimization algorithms for solving the SRPCP problem. Specifically, we propose a tuning-free alternating minimization (AltMin) algorithm, where each iteration involves subproblems enjoying closed-form optimal solutions. Additionally, we introduce techniques based on the variational formulation of the nuclear norm and Burer-Monteiro decomposition to further accelerate the AltMin method. Extensive numerical experiments confirm the efficiency and robustness of our algorithms.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimization by Kernel Regression and Density-based Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06178v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization is highly effective for optimizing expensive-to-evaluate black-box functions, but it faces significant computational challenges due to the high computational complexity of Gaussian processes, which results in a total time complexity that is quartic with respect to the number of iterations. To address this limitation, we propose the Bayesian Optimization by Kernel regression and density-based Exploration (BOKE) algorithm. BOKE uses kernel regression for efficient function approximation, kernel density for exploration, and integrates them into the confidence bound criteria to guide the optimization process, thus reducing computational costs to quadratic. Our theoretical analysis rigorously establishes the global convergence of BOKE and ensures its robustness in noisy settings. Through extensive numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world optimization tasks, we demonstrate that BOKE not only performs competitively compared to Gaussian process-based methods but also exhibits superior computational efficiency. These results highlight BOKE's effectiveness in resource-constrained environments, providing a practical approach for optimization problems in engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Optimal Recovery Meets Minimax Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental problem in statistics and machine learning is to estimate a function $f$ from possibly noisy observations of its point samples. The goal is to design a numerical algorithm to construct an approximation $\hat f$ to $f$ in a prescribed norm that asymptotically achieves the best possible error (as a function of the number $m$ of observations and the variance $\sigma^2$ of the noise). This problem has received considerable attention in both nonparametric statistics (noisy observations) and optimal recovery (noiseless observations). Quantitative bounds require assumptions on $f$, known as model class assumptions. Classical results assume that $f$ is in the unit ball of a Besov space. In nonparametric statistics, the best possible performance of an algorithm for finding $\hat f$ is known as the minimax rate and has been studied in this setting under the assumption that the noise is Gaussian. In optimal recovery, the best possible performance of an algorithm is known as the optimal recovery rate and has also been determined in this setting. While one would expect that the minimax rate recovers the optimal recovery rate when the noise level $\sigma$ tends to zero, it turns out that the current results on minimax rates do not carefully determine the dependence on $\sigma$ and the limit cannot be taken. This paper handles this issue and determines the noise-level-aware (NLA) minimax rates for Besov classes when error is measured in an $L_q$-norm with matching upper and lower bounds. The end result is a reconciliation between minimax rates and optimal recovery rates. The NLA minimax rate continuously depends on the noise level and recovers the optimal recovery rate when $\sigma$ tends to zero.</description>
