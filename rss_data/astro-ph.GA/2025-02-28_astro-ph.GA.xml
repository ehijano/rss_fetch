      <title>A Closer Look at an Unusual Ultra-Diffuse Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a spectroscopic study of the ``Disco Ball'' (SMDG0038365-064207), a rotationally-supported, red-sequence, ultra-diffuse galaxy (UDG) with a nuclear star cluster (NSC), multiple stellar clusters, and active star-forming regions using data obtained with KCWI on the Keck II Telescope. We calculate that the galaxy hosts $34\pm11$ ``globular" clusters. Kinematic measurements confirm rotation with a peak rotational velocity of at least 53km s$^{-1}$ and a dynamical mass within $r_{\rm e}$ of at least $10^{9.3 \pm 0.2}M_{\odot}$. Our dynamical estimates of the halo mass are consistent with that obtained using the number of globular clusters and together suggest $M_{\rm h}=10^{11.1\pm0.2}M_{\odot}$. The NSC may exhibit signatures of weak AGN activity. Our findings challenge two common assumptions: (1) clusters in some UDGs may be younger than generally assumed, and thus more luminous than standard globular clusters (GCs), affecting GC counts and the derived GC luminosity function in these UDGs, and (2) quiescent UDGs can be rotationally supported, making kinematic measurements viewing-angle dependent in such cases. The Disco Ball, while unremarkable in mass, size, projected structural properties, or color, reveals surprising complexity, highlighting the need for detailed studies of more UDGs.</description>

      <title>Photometric vs dynamical stellar masses and their impact on scaling relations in nearby disc galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of scaling relations of disc galaxies and their evolution across cosmic time requires accurate estimates of galaxy stellar masses $M_\star$ over broad redshift ranges. While photometric $M_\star$ estimates ($M_{\rm phot}$) based on spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling methods are employed routinely at high-$z$, it is unclear to what extent these are compatible with dynamical $M_\star$ estimates ($M_{\rm dyn}$), available for nearby galaxies. Here we compare newly determined, SED-model based $M_{\rm phot}$ with previously obtained $M_{\rm dyn}$ inferred via rotation curve decomposition techniques in a sample of $\sim100$ nearby galaxies from the SPARC database. We find that the two mass estimates show a systematic agreement at the $\sim12\%$ ($0.05$ dex) level and a $\sim55\%$ ($0.22$ dex) scatter across almost $5$ dex in $M_\star$. Our $M_{\rm phot}$ estimates correspond to mass-to-light ratios in the $3.6\mu$m band that increase gradually with $3.6\mu$m luminosity, as a consequence of the earlier (later) assembly history of high-mass (low-mass) disc galaxies. The choice of using either $M_{\rm dyn}$ or $M_{\rm phot}$ has only a marginal impact on the slope and zero-point of the Tully-Fisher and Fall relations: the observed orthogonal scatter in both relations is virtually the same for the two methods, and indistinguishable from that derived using a constant mass-to-light ratio in the $3.6\mu$m band. $M_\star$ estimates based on the assumption that discs are marginally stable lead to the largest scatter in the scaling relations.</description>

      <title>VLTI/GRAVITY upper limit on near-infrared emission from the nearby 33 Msun black hole Gaia BH3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent astrometric discovery of the nearby (590 pc) massive ($33 M_\odot$) dormant black hole candidate Gaia BH3 offers the possibility to angularly resolve the black hole from its companion star by using optical interferometry. Our aim is to detect emission in the near-infrared K band from the close-in environment of Gaia BH3 caused by accretion. Gaia BH3 was observed with the GRAVITY instrument using the four 8-meter Unit Telescopes of the VLT Interferometer. We searched for the signature of emission from the black hole in the interferometric data using the CANDID, PMOIRED, and exoGravity tools. With a present separation of 18 mas, the Gaia BH3 system can be well resolved angularly by GRAVITY. We did not detect emission from the black hole at a contrast level of $\Delta m = 6.8$ mag with respect to the companion star, that is, $f_\mathrm{BH}/f_* &lt; 0.2\%$. This corresponds to an upper limit on the continuum flux density of $f_\mathrm{BH} &lt; 1.9 \times 10^{-16}$ W m$^{-2}$ ${\mu}$m$^{-1}$ in the K band. In addition, we did not detect emission from the black hole in the hydrogen Br{\gamma} line. The non-detection of near-infrared emission from the black hole in Gaia BH3 indicates that its accretion of the giant star wind is presently occurring at most at a very low rate. This is consistent with the limit of $f_\mathrm{Edd} &lt; 4.9 \times 10^{-7}$ derived previously on the Eddington ratio for an advection-dominated accretion flow. Deeper observations with GRAVITY may be able to detect the black hole as the companion star approaches periastron around 2030.</description>

      <title>Impulsive mixing of stellar populations in dwarf spheroidal galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the response of mono-energetic stellar populations with initially isotropic kinematics to impulsive and adiabatic changes to an underlying dark matter potential. Half-light radii expand and velocity dispersions decrease as enclosed dark matter is removed. The details of this expansion and cooling depend on the time scale on which the underlying potential changes. In the adiabatic regime, the product of half-light radius and average velocity dispersion is conserved. We show that the stellar populations maintain centrally isotropic kinematics throughout their adiabatic evolution, and their densities can be approximated by a family of analytical radial profiles. Metallicity gradients within the galaxy flatten as dark matter is slowly removed. In the case of strong impulsive perturbations, stellar populations develop power-law-like density tails with radially biased kinematics. We show that the distribution of stellar binding energies within the dark matter halo substantially widens after an impulsive perturbation, no matter the sign of the perturbation. This allows initially energetically separated stellar populations to mix, to the extent that previously chemo-dynamically distinct populations may masquerade as a single population with large metallicity and energy spread. Finally, we show that in response to an impulsive perturbation, stellar populations that are deeply embedded in cored dark matter halos undergo a series of damped oscillations before reaching a virialised equilibrium state, driven by inefficient phase mixing in the harmonic potentials of cored halos. This slow return to equilibrium adds substantial systematic uncertainty to dynamical masses estimated from Jeans modeling or the virial theorem.</description>

      <title>A massive HI-absorption-selected galaxy at $z\approx2.356$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to detect $\rm CO(1-0)$, $\rm CO(3-2)$, and rest-frame 349-GHz continuum emission from an HI-selected galaxy, DLA1020+2733g, at $z\approx2.3568$ in the field of the $z=2.3553$ damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorber (DLA) towards QSO J1020+2733. The VLA $\rm CO(1-0)$ detection yields a molecular gas mass of $(2.84\pm0.42)\times10^{11}\times(\alpha_{\rm CO}/4.36)\,\rm{M_\odot}$, the largest ever measured in an HI-selected galaxy. The DLA metallicity is $+0.28 \pm 0.16$, from the ZnII$\, \lambda2026$\r{A} absorption line detected in a Keck Echellette Spectrograph and Imager spectrum. This continues the trend of high-metallicity DLAs being frequently associated with massive galaxies. We obtain a star-formation rate (SFR) of $\lesssim400~$M$_\odot~$yr$^{-1}$ from the rest-frame 349-GHz continuum emission, and a relatively long molecular gas depletion timescale of $\gtrsim0.6~$Gyr. The excitation of the J=3 rotational level is sub-thermal, with $r_{31}\equiv{L'_{\rm{CO(3-2)}}/L'_{\rm{CO(1-0)}}}=0.513\pm0.081$, suggesting that DLA1020+2733g has a low SFR surface density. The large velocity spread of the CO lines, $\approx500~\rm km~s^{-1}$, and the long molecular gas depletion timescale suggest that DLA1020+2733g is likely to be a cold rotating-disk galaxy.</description>

      <title>A Tentative Detection of Molecular Hydrogen (H$_2$) Emission Lines at Cosmic Dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES), we tentatively detect two molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) fluorescent emission features in high-redshift galaxies at 2.3 and 3.1$\sigma$. These features consist of many blended emission lines that result from the de-excitation cascade of H$_2$ molecules that have absorbed Lyman-Werner band photons. Our study targets galaxies at redshifts $z \geq 7$ galaxies of the early Universe, as they host some of the most extreme conditions in terms of star formation, molecular gas content, and the possible presence of outflows driven by starbursts and active galactic nuclei. To enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of H$_2$ emission features in the rest-frame wavelength range of 155-191 nm, we stack JWST/NIRSpec spectra from $z=7.0-13.4$. These stacked spectra also exhibit atomic emission features, such as CIV emission with a P-Cygni profile, as well as CIII], OIII], and HeII. The presence of these features and the slightly blue-shifted fluorescent H$_2$ lines suggest active multiphase atomic and molecular outflows may be common at these redshifts. Our results suggest that it is possible to search for FUV fluorescent H$_2$ lines in high redshift galaxies using JWST, which would enable the characterization of interstellar radiation fields, densities, and temperatures in extreme photodissociation environments.</description>

      <title>XMAGNET: Velocity structure functions of AGN-driven turbulence in the multiphase intracluster medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significant theoretical and observational efforts are underway to investigate the properties of turbulence in the hot plasma that pervades galaxy clusters. Spectroscopy has been used to study the projected line-of-sight velocities in both the hot intracluster medium and the cold gas phase using optical and X-ray telescopes. In this paper, we characterize the velocity structure functions of the multiphase intracluster medium in a simulated galaxy cluster core and study the effects of projections on the hot and cold phase of the gas. To do so, we use the fiducial run of the XMAGNET suite, a collection of exascale magneto-hydrodynamical simulations of a cool-core cluster, to compute velocity structure functions. The simulation includes radiative cooling as well as a model for active galactic nuclei feedback. Examining three-dimensional and line-of-sight velocity structure functions, we find no clear correlation between the behavior of the hot ($10^6\, \mathrm{K}\, \leq T \leq 10^8 \, \mathrm{K}$) and cold ($T\leq 10^5$ K) phases VSFs. Assuming a power law model for the VSF, we find that the power law index $m$ of the cold phase varies significantly throughout the 4 Gyr simulation time. We compare our VSFs with observations using mock optical and X-ray images, and conclude that projection effects significantly impact the amplitude and power law index of both the hot and cold phases. In the cold phase, applying a Gaussian smoothing filter to model effects of atmospheric seeing increases significantly the power law index of the projected VSF at scales below the filter's kernel size. Moreover, the VSF amplitude and power law index vary significantly depending on the viewing orientation. We conclude that observational biases such as projection effects, atmospheric seeing and the viewing angle cannot be ignored when interpreting line-of-sight velocity structure of the intracluster medium.</description>

      <title>Evolution of massive quiescent galaxies via envelope accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive quiescent galaxies at high redshift are significantly more compact than their present-day counterparts. We investigate the roles, in determining this evolution, of major and minor mergers, and of the accretion of diffuse envelopes of stars and dark matter. We model the evolution in stellar mass ($M_\star$), effective radius ($R_{\rm e}$) and effective stellar velocity dispersion ($\sigma_{\rm e}$) of a representative massive quiescent galaxy from $z=3$ to $z=0$, and compare the model with the observed redshift-dependent $R_{\rm e}$-$M_\star$ and $\sigma_{\rm e}$-$M_\star$ relations. In the model we account for the effects of collisionless (dry) major (satellite-to-main galaxy mass ratio $\xi&gt;1/4$) and minor ($1/10&lt;\xi&lt;1/4$) mergers, using analytic recipes consistent with the results of N-body simulations of binary mergers. For the poorly constrained mini mergers ($\xi&lt;1/10$) we explore both a "standard" model (based on the same assumptions used in the case of higher-$\xi$ mergers), and a heuristic "envelope accretion" model, aimed at describing the case in which diffuse satellites are completely disrupted in the galaxy outskirts. Major and minor dry mergers, at rates estimated observationally from galaxy-pair counts, induce relatively small variations of $R_{\rm e}$ and $\sigma_{\rm e}$, accounting only for $\approx 6\%$ of the size evolution and $\approx 40\%$ of the velocity-dispersion evolution observed from $z=3$ to $z=0$. As addition to major and minor dry mergers, envelope accretion performs better than standard mini mergers at reproducing the redshift-dependence of the $R_{\rm e}$-$M_\star$ and $\sigma_{\rm e}$-$M_\star$ relations, being also consistent with plausible evolutionary scenarios of scaling relations involving the mass of the central supermassive black hole.</description>

      <title>A Full AGN Feedback Prescription for Numerical Models: Negative, Positive and Hot Gas-Ejection Mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We build upon the state-of-the-art semi-analytic model \texttt{FEGA24} (Formation and Evolution of GAlaxies, \citealt{contini2024d}), which integrates the latest prescriptions relevant to galaxy formation and evolution, alongside a comprehensive AGN feedback model. This model incorporates three modes of feedback: negative (preventing excessive cooling), positive (enhancing star formation), and hot gas ejection (expelling gas beyond the virial radius of halos). These modes operate in a coordinated manner: the negative mode regulates the cooling process, the positive mode promotes bursts of star formation, and the hot gas ejection mode expels gas beyond the virial radius when the AGN is sufficiently powerful. Our updated semi-analytic model, \texttt{FEGA25}, retains the qualitative and quantitative consistency of the analyses presented in \cite{contini2024d}, while delivering more robust results. Notably, \texttt{FEGA25} provides a more detailed characterization of the fraction of red galaxies as a function of stellar mass, predicts a main sequence of star-forming galaxies more consistent with observations, and estimates the fraction of hot gas in halos closer to observed values. These findings underscore the importance of a physical mechanism capable of ejecting hot gas beyond the virialized region of dark matter halos without significantly altering the stellar and cold gas components. Such a mechanism is crucial to ensure the proper functioning of other processes, such as cooling and star formation. Since supernova feedback is already modeled at its maximum efficiency, AGN feedback emerges as the natural candidate for this role.</description>

      <title>Andromeda XXXV: The Faintest Dwarf Satellite of the Andromeda Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery of Andromeda XXXV, the faintest Andromeda satellite galaxy discovered to date, identified as an overdensity of stars in the Pan-Andromeda Archaeological Survey and confirmed via Hubble Space Telescope imaging. Located at a heliocentric distance of $927^{+76}_{-63}$ kpc and $158^{+57}_{-45}$ kpc from Andromeda, Andromeda XXXV is an extended ($r_h = 53\,^{+13}_{-11}$ pc), elliptical ($\epsilon = 0.4\, \pm 0.2$), metal-poor ($[\text{Fe}/\text{H}]\sim-1.9$) system, and the least luminous ($M_V=-5.2 \pm 0.3$) of Andromeda's dwarf satellites discovered so far. Andromeda XXXV's properties are consistent with the known population of dwarf galaxies around the Local Group, bearing close structural resemblance to the Canes Venatici II and Hydra II Milky Way (MW) dwarf satellite galaxies. Its stellar population, characterized by a red horizontal branch or a red clump feature, mirrors that of other Andromeda satellite galaxies in showing evidence for a spread in age and metallicity, with no signs of younger stellar generations. This age-metallicity spread is not observed in MW satellites of comparable stellar mass, and highlights the persistent differences between the satellite systems of Andromeda and the MW, extending even into the ultrafaint regime.</description>

      <title>The Massive and Distant Clusters of $WISE$ Survey. XII. Exploring X-ray AGN in Dynamically Active Massive Galaxy Clusters at z~1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the cluster X-ray morphology and active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity in nine $z\sim1$ galaxy clusters from the Massive and Distant Clusters of $WISE$ Survey (MaDCoWS) observed with $Chandra$. Using photon asymmetry ($A_{\text{phot}}$) to quantify X-ray morphologies, we find evidence that the four most dynamically disturbed clusters are likely to be mergers. Employing a luminosity cut of $7.6\times10^{42}$ erg/s to identify AGN in the 0.7-7.0 keV, we show that the majority of these clusters host excess AGN compared to the local field. We use the cumulative number-count ($\log N-\log S$) model to predict AGN incidence in cluster isophotes under this luminosity cut. Our analysis finds evidence (at $&gt; 2\sigma$) of a positive correlation between AGN surface densities and photon asymmetry, suggesting that a disturbed cluster environment plays a pivotal role in regulating AGN triggering. Studying AGN incidence in cluster X-ray isophotes equivalent in area to $1.0r_{500}$, we find that the AGN space density inversely scales with cluster mass as $\sim M^{-0.5^{+0.18}_{-0.18}}$ at the 3.18$\sigma$ level. Finally, when we separately explore the cluster mass dependence of excess AGN surface density in disturbed and relaxed clusters, we see tentative evidence that the two morphologically distinct sub-populations exhibit diverging trends, especially near the outskirts, likely due to cluster merger-driven AGN triggering/suppression.</description>

      <title>Shared Stochastic Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models: A Multi-modal Generative Model for Quasar Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes a scalable probabilistic latent variable model based on Gaussian processes (Lawrence, 2004) in the context of multiple observation spaces. We focus on an application in astrophysics where data sets typically contain both observed spectral features and scientific properties of astrophysical objects such as galaxies or exoplanets. In our application, we study the spectra of very luminous galaxies known as quasars, along with their properties, such as the mass of their central supermassive black hole, accretion rate, and luminosity-resulting in multiple observation spaces. A single data point is then characterized by different classes of observations, each with different likelihoods. Our proposed model extends the baseline stochastic variational Gaussian process latent variable model (GPLVM) introduced by Lalchand et al. (2022) to this setting, proposing a seamless generative model where the quasar spectra and scientific labels can be generated simultaneously using a shared latent space as input to different sets of Gaussian process decoders, one for each observation space. Additionally, this framework enables training in a missing data setting where a large number of dimensions per data point may be unknown or unobserved. We demonstrate high-fidelity reconstructions of the spectra and scientific labels during test-time inference and briefly discuss the scientific interpretations of the results, along with the significance of such a generative model.</description>

      <title>Temperature Profiles of Accretion Disks in Luminous Active Galactic Nuclei derived from Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The characteristic timescale ($\tau$) of continuum variability of the accretion disk in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is known to be related to the thermal timescale, which is predicted to scale with AGN luminosity ($L$) and restframe wavelength ($\lambda_{\rm RF}$) as $t_{\rm th} \propto L^{0.5} \lambda_{\rm RF}^2$ in the standard disk model. Using multi-epoch spectroscopic data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Reverberation Mapping project, we construct ultraviolet ensemble structure functions of luminous AGNs as a function of their luminosity and wavelength. Assuming that AGNs exhibit a single universal structure function when $\Delta t$ is normalized by $\tau$, wherein $\tau \propto L^{a} \lambda_{\rm RF}^{b}$, we find $a=0.50\pm0.03$ and $b=1.42\pm0.09$. While the value of $a$ aligns with the prediction from the standard disk model, $b$ is significantly smaller than expected, suggesting that the radial temperature (color) profile of the accretion disk is significantly steeper (shallower) than the standard disk model. Notably, this discrepancy with theory has been observed in previous studies based on spectroscopic reverberation mapping and gravitational microlensing. Although no current model of accretion disks fully matches our results, our findings provide valuable constraints for testing future physical models.</description>

      <title>The COSMOS-Web ring: Spectroscopic confirmation of the background source at z = 5.1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the spectroscopic confirmation of the background source of the most distant Einstein ring known to date, the COSMOS-Web ring. This system consists of a complete Einstein ring at $z=5.1$, lensed by a massive early-type galaxy at $z\sim2$. The redshift $z=5.1043\pm0.0004$ is unambiguously identified with our NOEMA and Keck/MOSFIRE spectroscopy, where the NOEMA observations reveal the CO(4-3) and CO(5-4) lines at $&gt;8\,\sigma$, and the MOSFIRE data detect [O\textsc{ii}] at $\sim 6\,\sigma$. Using multi-wavelength photometry spanning near-infrared to radio bands, we find that the lensed galaxy is a dust-obscured starburst ($M_{\star} \sim 1.8\times10^{10}\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$, ${\rm SFR_{IR}\sim 60\,{\rm M_{\odot}} ~yr^{-1}}$) with high star-formation efficiency (gas depletion time $\tau_{\rm dep}&lt;100~$Myr) as indicated by the [C\textsc{i}](1-0) non-detection. The redshift confirmation revalidates that the total lens mass budget within the Einstein radius is fully accounted for by the stellar and dark matter components, without the need of modifying the initial mass function or dark matter distribution profile. This work paves the way for detailed studies and future follow-ups of this unique lensing system, providing an ideal laboratory for studying mass distribution at $z\sim2$ and physical conditions of star formation at $z\sim5$.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Orbital Chaos: The Wild Heart of Fuzzy Dark Matter Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the behavior of test particles on top of a galactic-type of Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) structure, characterized by the core-halo density profile found in simulations. Our workhorse structure is an anisotropic, time-dependent, virialized core-tail FDM clump resulting from a multicore merger. For our analysis we allow this structure to keep evolving, which implies that the core oscillates and accretes matter from the halo, while the halo dynamics is dominated by its characteristic high kinetic energy. On top of this time-dependent structure that in turn has a time-dependent gravitational potential, we solve the motion equations of test particles with initial conditions associated to circular orbits at different radii. Our results indicate that: 1) no trajectory remains circular, 2) the trajectories are sensitive to initial conditions and 3) the departure of initially near trajectories has always a positive Lyapunov exponent. A qualitative result is that the motion of test particles is more erratic with a bigger Lyapunov exponent within and near the core than in the halo region, which can be understood in terms of the random motion of the core within the core-halo structure. We expect these results warn on the importance of the anisotropic and time-dependent nature of FDM clumps when studying the motion of test particles.</description>

      <title>Discovery of WINERED-HVS1: A metal-rich hyper-velocity star candidate ejected from the Galactic center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a metal-rich red giant star, WINERED-HVS1, which is a candidate for a hyper-velocity star (HVS). Its past trajectory suggests that this star may have been ejected by the Galactic supermassive black hole (SMBH; Sgr A*) about 14 Myr ago, with a modest ejection velocity of at least 500 km/s. Since WINERED-HVS1 is gravitationally bound to the Milky Way and is not necessarily young, it is not an unambiguous HVS candidate from a kinematic perspective, unlike the previously confirmed A-type main-sequence HVS known as S5-HVS1. Therefore, the chemical characterization of this star is essential for understanding its origin. Through a spectroscopic follow-up observation with Magellan/WINERED, we determined its metallicity [Fe/H]=$-0.136^{+0.040}_{-0.038}$, as well as the abundances for Na, Mg, Si, S, K, Ca, Ti, Cr, Ni, and Sr. The high metallicity value suggests that this star was ejected from the Galactic center and is unlikely to be a halo star with a radial orbit. The abundance pattern of this star -- including the pattern of [$\alpha$/Fe], [Mg/Fe], [Si/Mg], and [Ca/Mg] -- is consistent with that of the nuclear star cluster surrounding the SMBH, further supporting our view. This discovery opens a new window to look through the Galactic center environment without the hindrance of dust extinction, by using the HVSs moving in the halo region where dust extinction is minimal.</description>

      <title>A physically motivated galaxy size definition across different state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy sizes are a key parameter to distinguishing between different galaxy types and morphologies, reflecting their formation and assembly histories. Several methods define galaxy boundaries, often relying on light concentration or isophotal densities. However, these approaches were often constrained by observational limitations and did not necessarily provide a clear physical boundary for galaxy outskirts. With modern deep imaging surveys, a new physically motivated definition has emerged using the radial position of the star formation threshold as the galaxy size, approximated by the stellar mass density contour at 1 Msun pc^-2 (R_1). We test this definition using three state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulation suites, analyzing stellar surface density profiles across a wide range of stellar masses and redshifts. We measure the galaxy sizes according to this new definition and compare them with the most traditional size metric, the stellar half-mass radius. Our analysis demonstrates that the R_1-M_star relation exhibits consistent behaviour across both low and high-stellar mass galaxies, with remarkably low scatter. This relation is independent of redshift and holds across the three different cosmological hydrodynamical simulation suites, highlighting its robustness to variations in galaxy formation models. Furthermore, we explore the connection between a galaxy's total mass within R1 and its stellar mass, finding very little scatter in this relation. This suggests that R1 could serve as a reliable observational tracer for the galaxy's dynamical mass. The size-stellar mass relation proposed provides a reliable and physically motivated method for defining the outskirts of galaxies. This method remains consistent not only at z=0 but also throughout the evolutionary history of galaxies, offering a robust and meaningful framework for galaxy evolution studies.</description>

      <title>The Non-Uniform Expansion of the Crab Nebula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present extensive proper motion measurements of the Crab Nebula made from Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope MegaPrime/MegaCam images taken in 2007, 2016, and 2019. A total of 19974 proper motion vectors with uncertainty $&lt;10$\,mas\,yr$^{-1}$ located over the majority of the Crab Nebula are used to map the supernova remnant's two-dimensional expansion properties that reflect the dynamics of the original explosion, acceleration of ejecta imparted by spin-down energy from the pulsar, and interaction between the ejecta and surrounding cicumstellar material (CSM). The average convergence date we derive is 1105.5 $\pm$ 0.5 CE, which is 15-35 yr earlier compared to most previous estimates. We find that it varies as a function of position angle around the nebula, with the earliest date and smallest proper motions measured along the equator defined by the east and west bays. The lower acceleration of material along the equatorial plane may be indicative of the supernova's interaction with a disk-like CSM geometry. Comparing our measurements to previous analytical solutions of the Crab's expansion and our own numerical simulation using the moving mesh hydrodynamics code \texttt{Sprout}, we conclude that the ejecta have relaxed closer to homologous expansion than expected for the commonly adopted pulsar spindown age of $\tau \sim 700$ yr and a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) still evolving inside the flat part of the ejecta density profile. These findings provide further evidence that the PWN has broken out of the inner flat part of the supernova ejecta density profile and has experienced ``blowout''.</description>

      <title>Solid Identification of Extragalactic Gamma-Ray Source Using High-Resolution Radio Interferometric Observation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dominant fraction of the extragalactic $\gamma$-ray sources are blazars, active galactic nuclei with jets inclined at a small angle to the line of sight. Apart from blazars, a few dozen narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1) and a number of radio galaxies are associated with $\gamma$-ray sources. The identification of $\gamma$-ray sources requires multiwavelength follow-up observations since several candidates could reside within the relatively large $\gamma$-ray localisation area. The $\gamma$-ray source 4FGL 0959.6+4606 was originally associated with a radio galaxy. However, follow-up multiwavelength work suggested a nearby NLS1 as the more probable origin of the $\gamma$-ray emission. We performed high-resolution very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observation at 5 GHz of both proposed counterparts of 4FGL 0959.6+4606. We clearly detected the NLS1 source SDSS J095909.51+460014.3 with relativistically boosted jet emission. On the other hand, we did not detect milliarcsecond-scale compact emission in the radio galaxy 2MASX J09591976+4603515. Our VLBI imaging results suggest that the NLS1 object is the origin of the $\gamma$-ray emission in 4FGL 0959.6+4606.</description>

      <title>The diffuse extragalactic gamma-ray background radiation: star-forming galaxies are not the dominant component</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Star-forming galaxies (SFGs) are considered to be an important component of the diffuse extragalactic gamma-ray background (EGB) radiation observed in 0.1 -- 820 GeV, but their quantitative contribution has not yet been precisely determined. In this study, we aim to provide the currently most reliable estimate of the contribution of SFGs based on careful calibration with gamma-ray luminosities of nearby galaxies and physical quantities (star formation rate, stellar mass, and size) of galaxies observed by high-redshift galaxy surveys. Our calculations are based on the latest database of particle collision cross-sections and energy spectra of secondary particles, and take into account not only hadronic but also leptonic processes with various radiation fields in a galaxy. We find that SFGs are not the dominant component of the unresolved EGB measured by Fermi; the largest contribution is around 50% -- 60% in the 1 -- 10 GeV region, and the contribution falls rapidly in lower and higher energy ranges. This result appears to contradict a previous study, which claimed that SFGs are the dominant component of the unresolved EGB, and the origin of the discrepancy is examined. In calculations of cosmic-ray production, propagation, and interaction in a galaxy, we try models developed by two independent groups and find that they have little impact on EGB.</description>

      <title>Turbulence and large-scale structures in self-gravitating superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study turbulence in self-gravitating superfluids by performing direct numerical simulations of the 3D Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson (GPP) equation, which is also a model for dark matter haloes around galaxies. In the absence of self-gravity, the spectrally truncated Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation shows the emergence of Kolmogorov's $5/3$ scaling in the incompressible kinetic energy spectrum. Introducing self-gravity, we observe the formation of spherically collapsed structures, which introduce a minimum in the kinetic energy spectrum that corresponds to the sizes of these structures. The system shows early convergence towards statistically stationary states, which we show by the onset of thermalisation in the compressible kinetic energy spectrum, where $E_{\rm kin}^c \propto k^2$. We also show that the formation of such large-scale structures suggests that the particles (bosons) move from small to large scales through an inverse cascade, supporting a mechanism for the formation of large-scale structures, such as dark matter haloes, around our galaxy Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Self-similar decomposition of the hierarchical merger tree of dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the merger tree of dark matter halos is approximately self-similar by investigating the universality of the subhalo peak mass function (PMF) describing the mass distribution of progenitor halos. Using a set of cosmological simulations and identifying subhalos of different merger levels with HBT+, we verify that the level-1 subhalo PMF is close to universal across halo mass, redshift, and cosmology. This approximate self-similarity allows us to analytically derive the subhalo PMF for subhalos accreted at any level (i.e., for sub-sub...halos) through self-convolutions of the level-1 PMF, and the resulting model shows good agreement with simulation measurements. We further derive a number of analytical properties on the hierarchical origin of subhalos, including the level distribution, accretion rate at each level, initial merger ratio distribution, and accretion redshift distribution. We find that higher-level subhalos dominate at progressively lower peak mass in the PMF and are more likely to originate from major mergers than lower-level ones. At a given mass ratio at accretion time, the subhalo accretion rates at each level track the growth rate of the host halo. At a fixed final mass ratio, however, the accretion redshift distribution of subhalos depends on the subhalo level, peak mass, and host mass. Higher-level and higher-mass-ratio subhalos tend to be accreted more recently, and more massive halos also accrete their subhalos more recently. Our model provides a concise summary of simulation results and can serve as a basis for further theoretical understanding of the hierarchical structure formation.</description>

Abstract: We study the stability properties of multi-state configurations of the Schr\"odinger-Poisson system without self-interaction, with monopolar and first dipolar components $(1,0,0)$+$(2,1,0)$. We show these configurations studied are stable using numerical simulations, and using criteria of stationarity, unitarity and time dependence consistency. The study covers a range of states with monopolar to dipolar mass ratio between 47 and 0.17. The astrophysical implication of this result is that this type of configurations is at least stable and can be considered physically sound in multi-state ultralight bosonic dark matter.</description>

      <title>Extreme Metallicity Dwarf Galaxies in IllustrisTNG</title>

Abstract: The use of extremely metal-deficient dwarf galaxies (XMDs) as nearby analogs for high-redshift protogalaxies is generating renewed interest due to recent JWST observations studying these protogalaxies. However, the existence of a population of unenriched galaxies at $z\sim0$ raises fundamental questions about how galaxies with such pristine gas reservoirs could be formed. To address these questions we study XMDs in the IllustrisTNG simulation. We find that XMDs at $z=0$ are not relics of the first galaxies, but dwarf galaxies that experience a dramatic $\sim0.3$ dex drop in their gas-phase metallicity in the past few Gyr. We investigate possible causes of this drop in metallicity including high gas fractions, outflow efficiency or inflow/outflow rates, unique environments, pristine inflow metallicity, and inflow/SFR interactions. Of these, we find that inflow/outflow interactions, parameterized by the cumulative regional SFR experienced by inflows, has the strongest correlation with dwarf galaxy metallicity and XMD formation. In other words, inefficient gas enrichment during the short time between its accretion from the CGM and the initiation of star formation is the most important cause of XMD formation in the simulation. Observationally, we identify differences in star formation history between XMDs and non-XMDs (with XMDs having significantly decreased star formation rates on $1-5$ Gyr timescales) and differences in galaxy size (with XMDs having a more extended young stellar population) as the primary differences between the two populations. These results highlight the importance of inflow enrichment efficiency as a possible driver of dwarf galaxy metallicities.</description>

Abstract: To test the hypothesis that megaparsec-scale giant radio galaxies (GRGs) experience multiple epochs of recurrent activity leading to their giant sizes and to understand the nature of double-double radio galaxies (DDRGs), we have built the largest sample of giant DDRGs from the LOFAR Two Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) data release 2. This sample comprises 111 sources, including 76 newly identified DDRGs, with redshifts ranging from 0.06 to 1.6 and projected sizes between 0.7 Mpc and 3.3 Mpc. We conducted a detailed analysis to characterise their properties, including arm-length ratios, flux density ratios of pairs of lobes, and misalignment angles. These measurements allow us to study the symmetry parameters, which are influenced by the immediate and large-scale environments of DDRGs. Our study shows that based on the observed asymmetries of the inner lobes, the cocoons in which the inner lobes of DDRGs grow are often (~26%) asymmetrically contaminated with surrounding material from the external medium. Our analysis also reveals highly misaligned DDRGs, which could be due to environmental factors and/or changes in the supermassive black hole jet ejection axes. By studying the misalignment angles, we assess the stability of the jets in these systems in relation to their environment. For the first time, we systematically characterised the large-scale environments of DDRGs, identifying their association with dense galaxy clusters and revealing the influence of cluster weather on their morphologies. We discovered a DDRG in a distant galaxy cluster at z ~ 1.4, confirming that dynamic cluster environments can induce significant misalignment in DDRGs, consistent with simulations. Additionally, we identified two gigahertz peaked-spectrum (GPS) candidates in DDRG cores and a potential triple-double candidate, which, if confirmed, would be the fifth known case.

      <title>Unveiling a 36 Billion Solar Mass Black Hole at the Centre of the Cosmic Horseshoe Gravitational Lens</title>

Abstract: Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are found at the centre of every massive galaxy, with their masses tightly connected to their host galaxies through a co-evolution over cosmic time. For massive ellipticals, the SMBH mass ($M_\text{BH}$) strongly correlates with the central stellar velocity dispersion ($\sigma_e$), via the $M_\text{BH}-\sigma_e$ relation. However, SMBH mass measurements have traditionally relied on central stellar dynamics in nearby galaxies ($z &lt; 0.1$), limiting our ability to explore the SMBHs across cosmic time. In this work, we present a self-consistent analysis combining 2D stellar dynamics and lens modelling of the Cosmic Horseshoe gravitational lens system ($z = 0.44$), one of the most massive galaxies ever observed. Using integral-field spectroscopic data from MUSE and high-resolution imaging from HST, we model the radial arc and stellar kinematics, constraining the galaxy's central mass distribution and SMBH mass. Bayesian model comparison yields a $5\sigma$ detection of an ultramassive black hole (UMBH) with $\log_{10}(M_\text{BH}/M_{\odot}) = 10.56^{+0.07}_{-0.08} \pm (0.12)^\text{sys}$, consistent across various systematic tests. Our findings place the Cosmic Horseshoe $\sim$$1.5\sigma$ above the $M_\text{BH}-\sigma_e$ relation, supporting an emerging trend observed in BGCs and other massive galaxies. This suggests a steeper $M_\text{BH}-\sigma_e$ relationship at the highest masses, potentially driven by a different co-evolution of SMBHs and their host galaxies. Future surveys will uncover more radial arcs, enabling the detection of SMBHs over a broader redshift and mass range. These discoveries will further refine our understanding of the $M_\text{BH}-\sigma_e$ relation and its evolution across cosmic time.</description>

      <title>Kinematics of metallicity populations in Omega Centauri using Gaia Focused Product Release and Hubble Space Telescope</title>

Abstract: Context. Omega Cen is the largest known globular cluster in the Milky Way. It is also quite a complex object with a large metallicity spread and multiple stellar populations. Despite a number of studies over the past several decades, the series of events that led to the formation of this cluster is still poorly understood. One of its peculiarities is the presence of a metal-rich population which does not show the phenomenon of light-element anti-correlations (C-N, Na-O, Mg-Al), a trait that is considered as characteristic of Galactic Globular Clusters, and is in fact present among more metal-poor Omega Cen stars, leading to speculations that such anomalous population was accreted by the cluster. In this paper, we aim at investigating the kinematics of Omega Cen populations to gain insight on the formation scenario of the cluster. Using the newly released Gaia FPR and DR3 catalogue, we conducted a detailed kinematical analysis of cluster members within Omega Cen. The cluster members were divided into four metallicity populations and their mean proper motion in radial and tangential components were compared with each other. We also performed Gaussian Mixture Model fitting on the metallicity distribution to estimate the number of populations within our sample and an independent analysis of the HST catalogue as confirmation. The mean proper motions (mu_r and mu_t) of the metallicity populations do not show any significant differences. It is also not dependent on the approach chosen to determine the number of metallicity populations. We do find clear signature of rotation in all of the populations (including the metal-rich) with similar velocities.</description>

      <title>AT2021aeuk: A Repeating Partial Tidal Disruption Event Candidate in a Narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A black hole (BH) can tear apart a star that ventures within its tidal radius, producing a luminous flare as the stellar debris falls back, known as a tidal disruption event (TDE). While TDEs in quiescent galaxies are relatively well understood, identifying TDEs in active galactic nuclei (AGN) still remains a significant challenge. We present the discovery of AT2021aeuk, a transient exhibiting dual flares within around three years in a narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy. Multi-wavelength observations triggered during the second flare in 2023 revealed an extraordinary X-ray V-shaped light curve, strongly anti-correlated with the optical light curve and accompanied by a lag of $\sim$40 days. This behavior is inconsistent with both supernova and pure AGN origins. In addition, a new broad component emerges in the Balmer lines during the second flare, showing a clear reverberation signal to the continuum variation. We propose that the dual-flare may be linked to a repeating partial TDE (rpTDE), where the second flare results from a collision between the TDE stream and the inner accretion disk, triggering an optical flare while simultaneously partially destroying the X-ray corona. However, other mechanisms, such as a stellar-mass BH (sBH) merger within an accretion disk, could produce similar phenomena, which we cannot entirely rule out. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory will be a powerful tool for further investigating the nature of such events in the future.</description>
