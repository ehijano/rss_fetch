      <title>Plasma lens with frequency-dependent dispersion measure effects on fast radio bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio signals propagating through inhomogeneous plasma media deviate from their original paths, producing frequency-dependent magnification effects. In this paper, after reviewing the classical plasma-lensing theory, we have found a fundamental contradiction: the classical model assumes that the distribution of lensing plasma medium is related to the frequency-independent image position; however, our analysis demonstrates that both the image position ($\theta(\nu)$) and dispersion measure (DM$(\nu)$) are inherently frequency-dependent when signals traverse a structured plasma medium.
  We have been able to resolve this paradox by developing a framework that explicitly incorporates frequency-dependent dispersion measures (DMs) following power-law relationships ($\rm DM\propto \nu^\gamma$). Our analysis shows that the signal magnification decreases systematically with decreasing frequency, offering a plausible explanation for the frequency-dependent peak flux densities observed in fast radio bursts (FRBs), particularly in the case of the repeating FRB 180814.J0422+73. Our results suggest these FRBs could originate from the magnetized compact star magnetospheres. By considering these plasma-lensing effects on the sub-pulses of an FRB across different frequencies, we have the ability to more accurately investigate the intrinsic properties of FRBs via precise measurements of radio signals.</description>

      <title>Multiwavelength study of Galactic PeVatron LHAASO J0341+5258</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galactic PeVatrons are astrophysical sources accelerating particles up to a few PeV (~10$^{15}$ eV). The primary method to identify both electron and proton PeVatrons is the observation of $\gamma$-ray radiation at ultra-high energies (UHE; E$&gt;$100 TeV). In 2021, LHAASO detected 14 steady $\gamma$-ray sources with photon energies above 100 TeV and up to 1.4 PeV. Most of these sources can be plausibly associated with objects such as supernova remnants, pulsar wind nebulae, and stellar clusters. However, LHAASO J0341$+$5258 is detected as an unidentified PeVatron, emitting $\gamma$ rays at energies above hundreds of TeV. It is extended in nature and notably bright, with a flux $&gt;$ 20% of the Crab Nebula's flux above 25 TeV. Multiwavelength observations are required to identify the PeVatron responsible for the UHE $\gamma$ rays, understand the source morphology and association, and shed light on the emission processes. Here, we will present the results from the VERITAS and HAWC observations of this PeVatron, along with a discussion on potential emission scenarios through multiwavelength modeling.</description>

      <title>Probing the Parameter Space of Axion-Like Particles Using Simulation-Based Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs), hypothetical pseudoscalar particles that couple to photons, are among the most actively investigated candidates for new physics beyond the Standard Model. Their interaction with gamma rays in the presence of astrophysical magnetic fields can leave characteristic, energy-dependent modulations in observed spectra. Capturing such subtle features requires precise statistical inference, but standard likelihood-based methods often fall short when faced with complex models, large number of nuisance parameters and limited analytical tractability. In this work, we investigate the application of simulation-based inference (SBI), specifically Truncated Marginal Neural Ratio Estimation (TMNRE), to constrain ALP parameters using simulated observations from the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO). We model the gamma-ray emission from the active galactic nucleus NGC 1275, accounting for photon-ALP mixing, extragalactic background light (EBL) absorption, and the full CTAO instrument response. Leveraging the Swyft framework, we infer posteriors for the ALP mass and coupling strength and demonstrate its potential to extract meaningful constraints on ALPs from future real gamma-ray data with CTAO.</description>

      <title>The First 4 Years of SN 1993J Revisited: Geometric $m$-ring Modeling of the Radio Shell with Closure Quantities Only</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SN 1993J is the best-studied radio supernova, with observations using very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) spanning from within weeks of explosion through nearly three decades of ejecta evolution. Imaging and modeling techniques have revealed an expanding shell-like ejecta structure, with a width well-constrained after ~1000 days. In this work, we present a re-analysis of the first ~1700 days of SN 1993J evolution, using a new VLBI analysis technique with somewhat intrinsically higher angular resolution and compare our results with those from previous conventional techniques. We adopt the m-ring model, with potentially somewhat higher angular resolution, but only as a phenomenological alternative to the physically-motivated spherical shell model used in past analyses and shape the profile to approximately match that of the shell. We use closure quantities only, providing calibration insensitive constraints on ejecta geometry and largely independent comparisons with previous results from the same data sets. Using this approach we find the ejecta expanding with a power-law exponent $\omega=0.80\pm0.01$ averaged for the time from 175 to 1693 days, consistent with shell-fitting analyses. For the first time, we report estimates of the ejecta width at t &lt; 1000 days -- as early as 264 days post-explosion -- finding a mean fractional width with standard deviation of $0.24 \pm 0.04$ (of the radius) with no significant evolution. We present a fit of the azimuthal brightness modulation over time with the maximum of a horseshoe pattern rotating from east to south-southwest from 175 to 1000 d and then evolving to a more complex behavior, quantifying previous results from images only. The constraints on the angular brightness modulation and width over time and ~700 days earlier than existing analyses provide an avenue to test more advanced simulations of the explosion and interaction mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Two Highly Scattered Pulsars from Image-Based Circular Polarization Searches with the Australian SKA Pathfinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery and timing of two pulsars from a sample of four circularly polarized sources identified in radio continuum images taken as part of the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) Variables and Slow Transients (VAST) survey. Observations with the Parkes (Murriyang) radio telescope confirmed both sources as normal pulsars with high dispersion measures. PSR J1646$-$4451 has a spin period of 217 ms and a dispersion measure (DM) of 928 $\rm cm^{-3} \, pc$, while PSR J1837$-$0616 exhibits a spin period of 118 ms and a DM of 793 $\rm cm^{-3} \, pc$. These pulsars show extreme pulse broadening due to scattering, with measured scattering timescales of 290 ms and 343 ms at observing frequencies of 1.8 GHz and 1.9 GHz, respectively. These measurements imply extrapolated scattering timescales at 1 GHz of 2479 ms and 2154 ms, placing them among the most heavily scattered pulsars known to date. Our findings underscore the potential of using circular polarization in radio continuum images as a tool for identifying highly scattered pulsars. Future wide-field radio continuum surveys are poised to uncover a broader population of extreme pulsars particularly those that are heavily scattered at 1.4 GHz, intrinsically faint, or residing in binaries$-$offering valuable insights into both pulsar demographics and the complex structure of the interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>Millisecond Pulsar Discoveries in an Image-based MeerKAT Survey of the Galactic Bulge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the follow-up observations of circularly polarized sources identified in the MeerKAT image-based survey of the Galactic bulge. Using the Parkes radio telescope, we observed sixteen circularly polarized sources with the UWL receiver and detected nine pulsars among which six of them are new discoveries. All pulsars are fast rotators with spin periods under 100\,ms. Among the new discoveries five are millisecond pulsars (MSPs) and one has a spin period of 55\,ms. At least four new MSPs exhibit clear signs of binary motion in their discovery observations. The dispersion measures (DMs) of these pulsars fall between 18 and 330\,pc\,cm$^{-3}$, which is lower than expected for Galactic bulge members and indicates that these pulsars lie in the foreground along the line of sight rather than within the bulge itself. This is the first time such a large number of pulsars have been confirmed via an image-based survey. These discoveries underscore the exceptional efficacy of circular polarization selection in image-based pulsar surveys, and demonstrate the powerful synergy between high-sensitivity imaging and targeted time-domain follow-up using wide-band receivers and strengthen prospects for future deep pulsation searches$-$e.g., with MeerKAT or the forthcoming SKA or DSA-2000$-$to uncover the true millisecond pulsar population in the Galactic bulge.</description>

      <title>Reconciling the Tension Between Light Curve Modeling of Type II Supernovae and Neutrino-Driven Core-Collapse Supernovae Models with Late-Phase Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type II supernovae (SNe II) are the most frequently observed outcome of core-collapse explosions and provide a valuable window into the physical mechanisms governing the deaths of massive stars. However, estimates of explosion properties based on optical light curve modeling often show tension with the predictions of modern neutrino-driven explosion models. In particular, when based on light curves from the explosions of red supergiant (RSG) tied to specific stellar wind models, many SNe II are found to originate from low-mass progenitors yet exhibit unusually high explosion energies ($E_{\rm K}$), far exceeding theoretical predictions. In this study, we incorporate late-phase (nebular) spectroscopy to estimate the helium core mass of the progenitor ($M_{\rm He\,core}$), which serves as an additional constraint to break degeneracies in light curve modeling. This approach is applied to a sample of 32 well-observed SNe II, using a light curve model grid constructed from RSGs with arbitrarily stripped hydrogen-rich envelopes, rather than assuming a fixed wind model. Examining the resulting correlations among the physical parameters, we find that the tension between the observed $M_{\rm He\,core}$-$E_{\rm K}$ and $E_{\rm K}$-$M_{\rm Ni}$ relations and those predicted by neutrino-driven explosion models has significantly lessened by incorporating nebular spectroscopy in light curve modeling. This study highlights the crucial role of nebular spectroscopy in interpreting SNe II observations and provides support to the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism as the dominant engine powering these events.</description>

      <title>Performance of LACT Array: Instrument Response Functions and Source Prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Array of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope (LACT) is an array of 32 Cherenkov telescopes with 6-meter diameter mirrors to be constructed at the LHAASO site, aiming to enhance our understanding of ultra-high energy gamma ray astronomy. This work presents a detailed performance assessment of the LACT array, focusing on the IRFs for both an 8-telescope subarray configuration optimized for large zenith angle observations (60{\deg}) and the full 32-telescope array, with a particular emphasis on a 20{\deg} zenith angle configuration for lower energy threshold observations.
  We have generated IRFs using extensive Monte Carlo simulations of gamma-ray showers and the detector response. The IRFs include the effective area, angular resolution, and energy resolution as a function of energy and offset angle. Crucially, these IRFs are produced in the standard Data format for Gamma ray astronomy (GADF), ensuring interoperability with existing analysis tools like Gammapy and ctools and enabling seamless integration into scientific workflows.
  In this work, we also have used these GADF-format IRFs to simulate observations towards the Galactic Center Region.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Power-Law Emissivity Assumption in X-ray Reflection Spectroscopy: A Simulation-Based Evaluation of Different Coronal Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emissivity profile assumed in X-ray reflection spectroscopy significantly impacts black hole spin measurements. Using simulated NuSTAR spectra generated for lamppost and disk-like coronae with the relxill model suite, we evaluate systematic biases introduced when fitting with power-law or broken power-law emissivity profiles. We find that a simple power-law can accurately recover spins for low-height lamppost coronae with long exposures and low inclination angle, while broken power-laws introduce degeneracies when the simple power-law already performs adequately. However, for extended or high-height coronae, especially at high inclinations, both models produce large systematic biases unresolved by longer exposure times. Our results demonstrate that power-law approximations are reliable for compact coronae, highlighting the need for geometry-specific models in complex cases.</description>

      <title>Exciting Stellar Eccentricity in Gaia BH3 via a Hidden Black Hole Binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose that the high eccentricity of the stellar orbit in Gaia BH3 system could be excited through a secular resonance effect if the inner dark object is, in effect, a tight and eccentric black hole binary (BHB). During the orbital decay of the inner BHB, the apsidal precession rate of the inner binary matches that of the outer stellar orbit, and this resonance advection can drive the outer eccentricity into some extreme values. For a Gaia BH3-like system, we show that a near equal-mass ($q=0.8$) BHB with an initial semi-major axis of 1--3 au and an initial eccentricity $\gtrsim 0.95$ is able to excite the outer orbit to the observed value, leaving a current BHB with semi-major axis 0.25--0.5 au and eccentricity $\sim 0.8$. The eccentric inner BHB imprints two observable signatures on the outer star: (1) short-term RV modulations with an amplitude $\lesssim 100$ m/s and (2) long-term apsidal precession with a rate $\lesssim 0.1^{\circ}$/yr. Although neither of these is detected in the currently available astrometry and RV data, we show that these signals are detectable with the full Gaia astrometry data and dedicated high-precision and/or long-term RV observations. Our work provides a new perspective on the dynamical formation of Gaia BH3, and the methodology is readily applicable to similar systems such as HD 130298, Gaia BH1, and Gaia BH2.</description>

      <title>High energy gammas and neutrinos from the Sun, Jupiter and Earth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic rays reaching the atmosphere of an astrophysical object produce showers of secondary particles that may then scape into space. Here we obtain the flux of gammas and neutrinos of energy $E&gt;10$ GeV emited by the Sun, Jupiter and Earth. We show that, while the solar magnetic field induces an albedo flux of gammas from all the points in the Sun's surface, the dipolar magnetic field in the planets implies gammas only from the very peripheral region. Neutrinos, in contrast, can cross these objects and emerge from any point in their surface. The emission from these astrophysical objects is above the diffuse flux from cosmic ray interactions with the interstellar medium and has a distinct spectrum and gamma to neutrino ratio.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microquasars are increasingly recognized as efficient particle accelerators, potentially contributing to the cosmic-ray flux up to the "knee". Among them, SS 433 stands out as a unique system with precessing relativistic jets embedded within the W50 supernova remnant. Recent detections of very- and ultra-high-energy gamma rays from SS 433 have solidified its role as a key laboratory for studying particle acceleration in jet-powered astrophysical sources. We present results from over 100 hours of observations of SS 433 with VERITAS, spanning more than a decade. These high-resolution measurements allow for a detailed morphological study of the eastern and western jet lobes with an angular resolution of &lt;0.1{\deg}. By analyzing the spatial and spectral characteristics of the gamma-ray emission, we investigate the particle acceleration mechanisms within the jets and at the jet-medium interaction in W50.</description>

      <title>A statistical study of type II outbursts of XRPs: Brighter accreting pulsars rotate faster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray pulsars (XRPs) consist of a magnetized neutron star (NS) and an optical donor star. The NS accretes matter from the donor star producing pulsed X-ray emission. In most cases the donor stars are Be stars, and accretion is episodic, that is, the NSs are generally X-ray dim, but occasionally experience outbursts. Here, we carry out a statistical study with the X-ray monitoring data, and obtain strong correlations between the spin periods of the NSs and the outburst parameters for the first time. We show that XRPs containing faster rotating NSs tend to display more violent eruptions. In addition, pulsating ultraluminous X-ray sources in nearby galaxies follow the similar relationship. We demonstrate that most of these systems are close to the spin equilibrium, and that brighter pulsars have acquired more angular momentum by accreting matter from their companion stars, resulting in faster rotating NSs.</description>

      <title>A new era for multi-wavelength studies of blazars with Rubin and the CTAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both the Rubin Observatory and the first telescopes of the CTAO will be collecting data by 2026, marking a new era in optical and gamma-ray astronomy. Compared to predecessors, their enhanced sensitivity will extend extragalactic observations to a redshift of at least 2.5. This advancement offers insights into non-thermal astrophysical sources, particularly blazars. The 3-night cadence monitoring with Rubin, in one of its six filters, will produce blazar light curves that, when combined with targeted in-depth observations from the CTAO, could help distinguish acceleration and radiative models. Existing data from the ZTF and Fermi-LAT, though less sensitive, offer insights into what Rubin and the CTAO may achieve. However, the real-time processing of the immense data stream coming from Rubin/LSST presents a major challenge.
  Addressing this challenge is the work of brokers such as Fink, which we develop for multi-messenger astrophysics. Fink processes data in real-time before sending relevant information to other observatories like the CTAO. In this contribution, we present how we characterize the optical variability of blazars that emit in the gamma-ray range using the ZTF, with timescales spanning from the intra-night to multi-years. We identify properties in the resulting parameter space that could not only enable the identification of blazar-like sources, but also the characterization of the continuum of states. We describe our fast identification of transitions from one state to another, enabling the trigger of observations in the gamma-ray band and follow-up spectroscopic observations. Finally, we review the communication channel we set from the ZTF to the CTAO via Fink for blazars and discuss its outlook in light of the Rubin Observatory. This method is also applicable to other astrophysical sources and helps lay the groundwork for a fruitful era for time-domain astronomy.</description>

      <title>A LOFAR search for coherent radio emission accompanying prompt engine activity in gamma-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic jets generated in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) produce luminous transient events, yet the fundamentals of jet composition and radiation mechanisms remain unclear. One means of identifying a magnetically-dominated outflow would be detection of prompt, coherent radio emission at low frequencies, and we are able to search for this using the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) coupled with modelling of high energy pulses detected by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (Swift). We present the rapid response mode follow-up LOFAR observations of four long GRBs, each beginning within a few hundred seconds of the initial Swift-BAT trigger. We interpreted our findings under the framework of a magnetic wind model, predicting coherent radio emission analogous to prompt emission pulses. Using 60 second and 180 second time sliced imaging at 120-168 MHz, we obtain upper limits on radio pulse emission, finding no significant signals. In the case of GRB 200925B, we observed a small increase of radio flux seen at $\sim$60-360 s post burst. In this model, this could represent the radio emission related to the Swift-BAT pulses, for a redshift of $z=1.8$, however, with a low signal-to-noise ratio of $\sim 2$, it is not deemed significant enough to confirm coincident prompt radio and gamma-ray emission. Instead, we can constrain the $\epsilon_{B}$ parameter, deriving upper limits of $\epsilon_{B} &lt; 4.2 \times 10^{-4}$ for GRB 200925B. In GRB 240414A, with a reported redshift of $z=1.833$, we constrain $\epsilon_{B} &lt; 2.8 \times 10^{-4}$. We discuss these results in the context of our whole LOFAR rapid response sample of six long gamma-ray bursts, finding our $\epsilon_{B}$ values are generally consistent with previous GRB studies.</description>

      <title>A Two-Stage Kick Scenario for the Peculiar LMXB GX 1+4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) GX 1+4 stands out with its unique properties. Despite being an old system, it hosts a strongly magnetized neutron star (NS), a trait usually linked to younger systems. Its exceptionally long orbital period (1160 days) and low eccentricity (0.101) imply that the NS formed with minimal mass loss and a weak natal kick. These features collectively point towards the NS having formed through the accretion induced collapse (AIC) of a white dwarf (WD). However, GX 1+4's unusually high peculiar velocity (~ 189.36 km/s) defies standard AIC explanations. To address this discrepancy, we propose a two-stage kick scenario within the AIC framework: an initial natal kick followed by a delayed electromagnetic "rocket effect" kick. Our Monte Carlo simulations indicate that while the natal kick (&lt; 100 km/s) can generate a wide range of orbital eccentricities, the subsequent rocket kick (~ 240-480 km/s) explains both the high systemic velocity and low eccentricity. This two-stage kick mechanism naturally reproduces the observed characteristics of GX 1+4, provided that the NS's initially buried magnetic field re-emerges after the acceleration process ends. Our study represents the first attempt to quantitatively constrain the kick velocities in GX 1+4 and underscores the importance of possible rocket kicks in forming such peculiar LMXB systems.</description>

      <title>The NANOGrav 15-Year Data Set: Improved Timing Precision With VLBI Astrometric Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate pulsar astrometric estimates play an essential role in almost all high-precision pulsar timing experiments. Traditional pulsar timing techniques refine these estimates by including them as free parameters when fitting a model to observed pulse time-of-arrival measurements. However, reliable sub-milliarcsecond astrometric estimations require years of observations and, even then, power from red noise can be inadvertently absorbed into astrometric parameter fits, biasing the resulting estimations and reducing our sensitivity to red noise processes, including gravitational waves (GWs). In this work, we seek to mitigate these shortcomings by using pulsar astrometric estimates derived from Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) as priors for the timing fit. First, we calibrated a frame tie to account for the offsets between the reference frames used in VLBI and timing. Then, we used the VLBI-informed priors and timing-based likelihoods of several astrometric solutions consistent with both techniques to obtain a maximum-posterior astrometric solution. We found offsets between our results and the timing-based astrometric solutions, which, if real, would lead to absorption of spectral power at frequencies of interest for single-source GW searches. However, we do not find significant power absorption due to astrometric fitting at the low-frequency domain of the GW background.</description>

      <title>Outflow-cloud interaction as the possible origin of the peculiar radio emission in the tidal disruption event AT2018cqh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AT2018cqh is a unique optical tidal disruption event (TDE) discovered in a dwarf galaxy exhibiting delayed X-ray and radio flares. We present the results from high-resolution VLBA and e-MERLIN radio observations of AT2018cqh extending to $\delta$t $\sim$ 2250 days post discovery, which reveal a compact radio emission, unresolved at a scale of &lt;~ 0.13 pc at 7.6 GHz, with a high brightness temperature of $T_b$ ~&gt; 4.03 $\times$ 10$^{9}$ K. The radio spectral energy distribution (SED) is found to gradually shift towards a higher peak flux density and frequency over a period of $\sim$1000 days. An equipartition analysis suggests that there is a little change in the radio emitting region over this period, while the electron density increases by a factor of 3. The radio light curve at 0.89 GHz continues to rise, with a bump feature lasting for 240 days. These properties are in contrast to the predictions of standard shockwave model from a diffuse circumnuclear medium, but could be explained if dense clouds exist in the circumnuclear environment. The latter scenario is supported by our hydrodynamic simulations of the interaction of TDE outflow with a cloud, which can reproduce the temporal evolution in the radio SED. This work highlights the importance of the outflow-cloud interaction in explaining the delayed, fast-rising radio emission observed in some TDEs, especially those occurring in galaxies with pre-existing AGN activity.</description>

      <title>Einstein@Home Searches for Gamma-ray Pulsars in the Inner Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) has revealed a mysterious extended excess of GeV gamma-ray emission around the Galactic Center, which can potentially be explained by unresolved emission from a population of pulsars, particularly millisecond pulsars (MSPs), in the Galactic bulge. We used the distributed volunteer computing system Einstein@Home to search the Fermi-LAT data for gamma-ray pulsations from sources in the inner Galaxy, to try to identify the brightest members of this putative population. We discovered four new pulsars, including one new MSP and one young pulsar whose angular separation to the Galactic Center of 0.93{\deg} is the smallest of any known gamma-ray pulsar. We demonstrate a phase-resolved difference imaging technique that allows the flux from this pulsar to be disentangled from the diffuse Galactic Center emission. No radio pulsations were detected from the four new pulsars in archival radio observations or during the MPIfR-MeerKAT Galactic Plane Survey. While the distances to these pulsars remain uncertain, we find that it is more likely that they are all foreground sources from the Galactic disk, rather than pulsars originating from the predicted bulge population. Nevertheless, our results are not incompatible with an MSP explanation for the GC excess, as only one or two members of this population would have been detectable in our searches.</description>

      <title>Explaining the Origin of TeV Gamma Rays from M87 During High and Low States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of very high-energy gamma-rays from M87 can provide crucial insights into particle acceleration and radiation mechanisms in jets. The recent observations by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) detector extend the energy range of TeV gamma-ray astronomy, and also the variability study to the TeV energy domain. We have modelled the low state and flare state multi-wavelength spectral energy distributions of M87 within a time-dependent framework. In our model, the low state gamma-ray flux results from the emissions from the sub-parsec and the kilo-parsec scale jets of M87, whereas the flare state gamma-ray flux is mainly produced in the sub-parsec scale jet. We have shown that the spectral and temporal features of the TeV gamma-ray spectrum of M87 are consistent with this two-zone model, where the contribution from the sub-parsec scale jet significantly increases during the flare state.</description>

      <title>Dark matter: red or blue?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the first calculation of light scattering on heavy dark matter (DM) particles. We show that despite the fact that DM has no direct coupling to photons, the light-DM($\gamma\chi$) ($m_\chi \sim 1$ TeV) cross-section is non-vanishing, albeit small. The cross section, calculated within the Standard Model (SM) framework, is particularly large in the case of heavy Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMP). Combined with astrophysical observation, these results can constrain existing WIMP DM models in favor of lighter DM, $M_\chi&lt;&lt;M_{\mathrm{Planck}}$, (axions, composite DM, etc..) or non-weakly interacting pure gravitational DM. We also show that the energy dependence of light scattering on dark matter should make the DM colored - red in the case of weak-DM and blue for the gravitational-DM, when a white background light is passing through. Gravitational scattering of light on DM particles also leads to non-trivial polarization effects, which might be easier to detect than the deflection of light from the scattering on DM particles, $\gamma\chi\rightarrow\gamma\chi$.</description>

      <title>Splitting the Gravitational Atom: Instabilities of Black Holes with Synchronized/Resonant Hair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black holes (BHs) with synchronized bosonic hair challenge the Kerr paradigm, linking superradiance from ultralight fields -- creating gravitational atoms -- to bosonic stars across parameter space. In the ''very hairy'' regime, where a small horizon lies inside a bosonic star containing most of the energy, they deviate sharply from Kerr, but their dynamics remain unexplored. We show that for such solutions the horizon gets naturally ejected from the center of its scalar environment, and observe a similar dynamics in a cousin model of BHs with resonant scalar hair, albeit with a different fate. This dynamical splitting is likely to be generic for sufficiently hairy BHs in the broader class of models with synchronized or resonant hair, but possible exceptions may exist.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the stability and possible fates of Little Red Dots, under the stellar-only interpretation of their observational features. This is performed by a combination of analyzing the relevant timescales in their stellar dynamics and also, the application of recent numerical results on the evolution of the densest stellar systems. We study different scenarios for the evolution of Little Red Dots and conclude that in a fair fraction of those systems, the formation of a massive black hole by runaway collisions seems unavoidable, in all the possibilities studied within the stellar-only interpretation. We conclude that Little Red Dots are the most favourable known places to find a recently formed massive black hole seed, or in the process of formation, most probably formed directly in the supermassive range</description>

      <title>A relativistic treatment of accretion disk torques on extreme mass-ratio inspirals around non-spinning black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a relativistically accurate formalism to model the interaction between stellar mass compact objects embedded in thin accretion disks around a non-spinning supermassive black hole, using tools from self-force theory and Hamiltonian perturbation theory. We then apply this formalism to analyze the evolution of a compact object on a nearly circular and equatorial orbit interacting with a thin equatorial disk. We provide analytic and relativistically-accurate expressions for the rates of energy and angular momentum exchanged during interactions due to Lindblad and corotation resonances. Our results show that relativistic corrections can enhance the magnitude of the torque by 1-2 orders of magnitude compared to purely Newtonian expressions when the orbit of the compact object is smaller than $10$ Schwarzschild radii of the supermassive black hole. We also demonstrate that strong relativistic shifts the inner Lindblad resonances closer to the compact object than the outer Lindblad resonances when the compact object is closer than 4 Schwarzschild radii to the supermassive black hole, potentially leading to a reversal in the direction of the torque acting on the compact object. Finally, we provide a dephasing estimate and show that using the relativistic torque formula is crucial to obtain reliable estimates for extreme mass ratio inspirals in orbits closer than 5 Schwarzschild radii to the supermassive black hole. Our results highlight the importance of using relativistically-accurate models of environmental interactions in extreme mass-ratio inspirals close to a supermassive black hole.</description>

      <title>Anderson self-localization of light in pair plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that in pair plasma weakly nonlinear electromagnetic waves, $a_0 \leq 1$, experience Anderson self-localization. The beat between the driver and a back-scattered wave creates random, charge-neutral, large density fluctuations $\delta \rho/\rho \gg 1$, and corresponding random fluctuations of the dielectric permittivity $\epsilon$. Propagating in quasi-1D, waves in a medium with spatially random, time-varying, self-created fluctuations of dielectric permeability experience localization. Anderson self-localization of light leads to (i) reflection of EM waves by the under-dense pair plasma; (ii) a wave already present inside the plasma separates into bright trapped pockets and dark regions. Mild initial thermal spread restores wave propagation by suppressing the seeds of parametrically unstable density fluctuations. A circularly polarized driver produces linearly polarized structures, with position angle varying randomly between the bright pulses. We discuss possible applications to astrophysical Fast Radio Bursts.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Strategy for Coordinated Interstellar Signaling: Linking the Galactic Center and Extragalactic Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) is largely limited by the vastness of the signaling parameter space. The concurrent signaling scheme offers a framework in which civilizations can coordinate their transmission and reception by referring to a common astrophysical event. Building on this idea, I propose a hybrid strategy that combines the Galactic Center as a spatial reference with an extragalactic burst as a temporal marker. If such a scheme is indeed employed, the sky area to be surveyed in SETI could be reduced by more than two orders of magnitude, based solely on existing astronomical data. I examine records of three types of extragalactic bursts (supernovae, neutron star mergers, and gamma-ray bursts [GRBs]) to identify suitable temporal markers. Among them, GRB 221009A is particularly notable due to its high fluence and favorable sky location.</description>

      <title>Techniques for Continuous Wave Identification and Filtering in the Askaryan Radio Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Askaryan Radio Array (ARA), located near the South Pole, is among the first experiments there designed to detect ultra-high energy neutrinos through the Askaryan effect. When such neutrinos interact in dense media like ice, they initiate particle cascades that generate coherent radio pulses. Operating in the 150-850 MHz band, ARA is deployed 80-200 meters deep in Antarctic ice, where the radio background is exceptionally low. Despite this, experiments such as ARA must still account for continuous wave (CW) signals, which can originate from anthropogenic sources, instrumental noise, and other environmental factors. These CW signals can obscure faint neutrino-induced pulses, complicating data analysis and event identification. Over the years, ARA has developed and refined techniques for CW filtering and identification, including spectral analysis, notch filtering, and phase-variance methods. These approaches exploit CW characteristics such as their narrowband nature and persistence to separate contamination from genuine impulsive events. We review the main CW identification and filtering techniques developed within the ARA collaboration and present recent improvements in adaptive, multi-stage filtering pipelines. These advances have led to faster processing, simpler operation, and more accurate CW suppression, improving data analysis quality. Their efficacy is demonstrated across all ARA stations, underscoring their role in reducing event misclassification and enhancing performance. By refining these techniques, this work not only improves the sensitivity of ARA but also highlights the importance of robust CW filtering for current and future neutrino radio detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Galactic chemical evolution of short-lived radioactive isotopes produced by explosive nucleosynthesis: $^{60}$Fe and $^{53}$Mn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several short-lived radionuclides (SLRs) are know to have existed in the early Solar System (ESS). These species, which typically decay with half-lives of the order of a few million years, can be used to probe the timescale of events preceding the birth of the Sun. We investigate the ESS origin of $^{53}$Mn, produced by core-collapse (CCSNe) and Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), and $^{60}$Fe, produced exclusively by CCSNe. We model the evolution of the radioactive-to-stable abundance ratios of these SLRs with a galactic chemical evolution (GCE) framework accounting for different supernova yields, SN Ia delay times, and other galactic features $(K)$. A further set of models are calculated assuming that SN Ia did not contribute any $^{53}$Mn to the ESS. The predicted ratios are compared to meteoritic ratios to derive a distribution of solar isolation times that includes uncertainties due to stochastic chemical enrichment and precision of the ESS values. The isolation times are then compared to those of $^{107}$Pd and $^{182}$Hf calculated in previous work. A self-consistent solution can be found within the current uncertainties, especially when using the GCE setups with $K = 1.6$ and 2.3, although the maximum likelihood for the \iso{60}Fe distribution is typically $\sim 4-5$ Myr shorter than for \iso{53}Mn. The predicted \iso{60}Fe/\iso{53}Mn ratio, instead, is completely inconsistent with the ESS value; this could be resolved using a larger fraction of faint CCSNe than usually considered in GCE models.</description>

      <title>A sample of 3403 galaxy clusters identified in XMM-Newton X-ray images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Currently, the number of galaxy clusters identified using galaxy data has far exceeded the number derived from intracluster medium data. In this study, we used positional information from large optical cluster catalogues to search for previously unrecognized X-ray galaxy clusters in archival XMM-Newton data. We successfully identified 1490 galaxy clusters in X-ray images for the first time. By incorporating 1913 previously known X-ray clusters, we constructed a sample of 3403 galaxy clusters observed by XMM-Newton. Our cluster mass estimates show broad consistency with previous measurements. Comparative analyses between the known and newly identified subsamples revealed that new X-ray clusters exhibit systematically higher redshifts, lower masses, and smaller X-ray-to-optical mass ratios, but show no systematic differences in dynamical properties. The newly identified X-ray clusters are a valuable addition to previous X-ray samples and are important for future statistical studies.</description>

      <title>Search for GeV-PeV neutrinos from nova T Coronae Borealis with IceCube</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The widely anticipated outburst of recurrent nova T Coronae Borealis (T CrB), which is near the end of its 80-year cycle, provides an excellent opportunity to search for neutrinos from novae. Novae are an energetic class of transients, which have been studied for hundreds of years. Because many of them are located nearby, novae provide an excellent astrophysical laboratory to study shock-powered emission in our own backyard. Several recent novae have previously been detected in GeV gamma rays, and the 2021 outburst of RS Ophiuchi was detected up to TeV energies, with evidence for a hadronic origin of the observed emission. Previous searches for GeV-TeV neutrinos from novae, predicted to occur alongside their gamma-ray emission, have been performed using data from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. However, no significant neutrino signals from novae have yet been observed. We present plans for follow-up of T CrB in real time with IceCube, using datasets spanning GeV to PeV neutrino energies. Due to its closer distance and higher optical flux, which has been well measured in two historical eruptions, the expected neutrino signal from T CrB is several times stronger than that from RS Ophiuchi. Furthermore, T CrB is located in the Northern sky at a declination where IceCube's sensitivity is an additional factor of a few better than at the location of RS Ophiuchi, which is beneficial to this search.</description>

      <title>Constraining Common Envelope Evolution in Binary Neutron Star Formation with Combined Galactic and Gravitational-Wave Observations</title>

Abstract: Binary neutron stars (BNSs) are among the most interesting sources for multimessenger studies. A number of recently discovered BNSs in the Milky Way by radio telescopes have added new information to the parameter distribution of the Galactic BNSs. The scarcity of BNS mergers during the O4 run of the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra (LVK) suggests a BNS local merger rate six times lower than the previous constraint obtained by O1-O3 runs. With these new multimessenger observations, in this letter, we adopt the compact binary population synthesis model and Bayesian analysis to constrain the formation and evolution of BNSs, especially the common envelope (CE) evolution. We find that it is required: (1) a fraction ($f_{\rm HG}\sim0.8$) but not all of the Hertzsprung gap donors merged with their companions in the CE stage, in order to simultaneously explain the low BNS merger rate density and the existence of the short-orbital-period ($\lesssim 1$ day) Galactic BNSs, different from either all ($f_{\rm HG}=1$) or none ($f_{\rm HG}=0$) adopted in previous studies; (2) a large CE ejection efficiency $\alpha$ ($\sim 5$), in order to explain the existence of the long-orbital-period ($\gtrsim 10$ day) Galactic BNSs.</description>

      <title>Road map for the tuning of hadronic interaction models with accelerator-based and astroparticle data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In high-energy and astroparticle physics, event generators play an essential role, even in the simplest data analyses. As analysis techniques become more sophisticated, e.g. based on deep neural networks, their correct description of the observed event characteristics becomes even more important. Physical processes occurring in hadronic collisions are simulated within a Monte Carlo framework. A major challenge is the modeling of hadron dynamics at low momentum transfer, which includes the initial and final phases of every hadronic collision. QCD-inspired phenomenological models used for these phases cannot guarantee completeness or correctness over the full phase space. These models usually include parameters which must be tuned to suitable experimental data. Until now, event generators have been developed and tuned mainly on the basis of data from high-energy physics experiments at accelerators. The wealth of data available from the latest generation of astroparticle experiments has not yet been fully exploited, and in many cases is not satisfactorily described. Both kinds of data sets are complementary as astroparticle experiments provide sensitivity especially to hadrons produced nearly parallel to the collision axis and cover center-of-mass energies up to several hundred TeV, well beyond those reached at colliders so far. In this report, we provide an overview of state-of-the-art event generators and their tuning, including the most relevant inputs from high-energy accelerator and astroparticle experiments. We present a road map that shows, for the first time, how the unified tuning of event generators with accelerator-based and astroparticle data can be performed.</description>

      <title>Tidal disruption events in active galactic nuclei: on orbital inclination and Schwarzschild apsidal precession</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) mark a regime where traditional vacuum models fail to capture the full dynamics, especially due to interaction between stellar debris and pre-existing accretion disks. We perform meshless hydrodynamic simulations incorporating both general relativistic (GR) effects and radiative cooling to study TDEs in AGNs with different orbital inclinations ($\theta_{\rm inc}$) of the disrupted star, ranging from projected prograde to retrograde orbits. We post-process the simulations to derive multi-wavelength light curves and identify several distinct features in the light curves, including a precursor flare from early debris-disk collision and a major flare driven by fallback. The dynamics of the stellar debris and accretion disk, and subsequently the light curve features, are strongly affected by $\theta_{\rm inc}$ and GR effects. Retrograde orbits ($\theta_{\rm inc}=135^\circ$) yield a more luminous, shorter major flare and a more prominent precursor than prograde ones ($\theta_{\rm inc}=22.5^\circ$). During fallback, prograde cases ($\theta_{\rm inc} = 22.5^\circ$, $45^\circ$) develop a central cavity with spirals in the inner region of the AGN disk, leading to transient UV/X-ray suppression accompanied by oscillations, while higher inclinations ($\theta_{\rm inc}=90^\circ$, $135^\circ$) form a gradually tilting inner disk, potentially causing UV/X-ray dips via geometric effects at certain viewing angles. Relativistic apsidal precession alters stream collisions, producing structural differences in the inner disk, outer disk, and debris compared to Newtonian cases, and drives quasi-periodic signals in prograde configurations. These results provide predictive diagnostics for identifying AGN TDEs and interpreting observed light-curve diversity.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Ray Spatial Distribution and the Galactic/Extragalactic Transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determining the spatial distribution of Galactic cosmic rays (CRs) is fundamental to understand how these particles propagate in interstellar space and to infer their source spectra. The most sensitive method of studying this problem is observing the gamma--ray and neutrino diffuse fluxes produced in the inelastic interactions of CR protons and nuclei with interstellar gas that encode the energy and spatial distributions of the interacting particles. Most theoretical models assume that the spatial and energy dependencies of the spectra of CR protons and nuclei are factorized, so that the CR energy spectra have the same shape at all points of the Milky Way. However, on the base of the Fermi--LAT observations, some authors have tentatively inferred that particles in the inner regions of the Milky Way have significantly harder spectra. Recently the ground--based telescopes Tibet--AS$\gamma$, LHAASO and HAWC have extended the measurements of the diffuse gamma--ray flux to much higher energies, and the IceCube neutrino telescope has obtained evidence for a $\nu$ flux from the Galactic disk. These new measurements allow for new tests of the factorization hypothesis, and disfavor models in which the spectral shape of CR protons and nuclei is harder in the inner part of the Galaxy. In fact, the LHAASO data above 30~TeV are in better agreement with the opposite hypothesis, that cosmic rays is the inner Galaxy have softer spectra than those in the outer Galaxy. This result, that has currently only modest significance due to large statistical and systematic uncertainties, could be explained by assuming that the CR confinement volume increases with energy. An alternative explanation is that a significant fraction of cosmic rays in the multi--PeV energy range is of extragalactic origin.</description>

      <title>Probing Hernquist dark matter with black hole shadows: A comprehensive study of various accretions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The shadow of a black hole is critically dependent on the surrounding accreting matter. We investigate the observational signatures of a Schwarzschild black hole embedded in a Hernquist dark matter (DM) halo under three distinct accretion scenarios: a geometrically thin disk, a static spherical flow, and an infalling spherical flow. For the thin disk model, we find that direct emission dominates the total observed intensity, while the size and brightness of the lensing and photon rings serve as sensitive probes of the Hernquist DM parameters. Under spherical accretion, the Hernquist DM halo significantly enlarges the photon sphere. This results in an observable shadow that is approximately $2\%$ to $30\%$ larger than in the vacuum case, though this increase in size is accompanied by a considerable decrease in overall image brightness. Furthermore, the Doppler de-boosting effect in the infalling scenario produces a markedly darker image than its static counterpart. Our results demonstrate that the size and brightness profile of a black hole shadow provide a powerful observational tool to probe and constrain the distribution of dark matter in galactic centers.</description>

      <title>Expected Constraints on the Intergalactic Magnetic Field using Gamma-Ray Bursts with the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The InterGalactic Magnetic Field (IGMF), which could permeate the cosmic voids but was never detected so far, is considered a relic of the early Universe. Constraints on its strength $B$ can be derived from its influence on time-delayed very-high-energy photons from Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) in the electromagnetic cascades along their path to the Earth. The present lower limit achieved on its intensity is $10^{-18}\;\mathrm{G}$. In this work, we simulate data from the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), accounting for realistic observational constraints, and we apply a joint spectral and temporal fit to characterise the IGMF. GRBs 190114C and 221009A are used as test cases to assess the sensitivity of CTAO. They demonstrate that a broad range of IGMF strengths can be probed with a lower bound as high as $10^{-15}\;\mathrm{G}$. Notably, we show that observations by the CTAO first large telescope, LST-1, already allow us to exclude field strengths up to $3\times 10^{-17}\;\mathrm{G}$.</description>

      <title>Are X-Ray Detected Active Galactic Nuclei in Dwarf Galaxies Gamma-Ray Bright?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $\gamma$-ray emission from active galactic nuclei (AGN), including both beamed blazars and misaligned-AGN, dominates the extragalactic $\gamma$-ray point-source population count and flux. While multi-wavelength studies have detected an increasing number of AGN within dwarf galaxies in the local Universe, $\gamma$-ray emission has so far only been associated with systems hosting supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Dwarf-galaxy AGN are of particular interest because their central black holes fall in the intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) regime, offering insight into the early evolution of SMBHs. Using 15~years of \textit{Fermi}-LAT data, we present the first search for $\gamma$-ray emission from dwarf-galaxy AGN. In the sample of 74 X-ray-selected dwarf-galaxy AGN, we find no sources that exceed the \textit{Fermi}-LAT detection threshold. However, a joint-likelihood analysis reveals a modest, trials-corrected population-level excess ($\sim2\sigma$) above blank-field expectations at very soft photon indices $\Gamma \gtrsim 3.8$ above 500~MeV. This hint is most pronounced when source contributions are weighed by $M^\alpha_{{\rm IMBH},i}/d_i^2$, with $\alpha\simeq1$--$1.5$, suggesting -- but not confirming -- that $\gamma$-ray emission could scale with the central black hole mass or a property correlated with it (e.g., accretion rate), but with a markedly softer spectrum than in SMBH-hosted AGN.</description>

      <title>Supernova axions convert to gamma-rays in magnetic fields of progenitor stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has long been established that axions could have been produced within the nascent proto-neutron-star formed following the type II supernova SN1987A, escaped the star due to their weak interactions, and then converted to gamma-rays in the Galactic magnetic fields; the non-observation of a gamma-ray flash coincident with the neutrino burst leads to strong constraints on the axion-photon coupling for axion masses $m_a \lesssim 10^{-10}$ eV. In this work we use SN1987A to constrain higher mass axions, all the way to $m_a \sim 10^{-3}$ eV, by accounting for axion production from the Primakoff process, nucleon bremsstrahlung, and pion conversion along with axion-photon conversion on the still-intact magnetic fields of the progenitor star. Moreover, we show that gamma-ray observations of the next Galactic supernova, leveraging the magnetic fields of the progenitor star, could detect quantum chromodynamics axions for masses above roughly 50 $\mu$eV, depending on the supernova. We propose a new full-sky gamma-ray satellite constellation that we call the GALactic AXion Instrument for Supernova (GALAXIS) to search for such future signals along with related signals from extragalactic neutron star mergers.</description>

Abstract: The symmetry energy expansion is a useful way to parametrize the properties of dense matter near nuclear saturation density, and much work has been done to connect physical quantities like the neutron star radius and the core-crust transition density to the symmetry energy parameters. In this work, I connect the weak-interaction-driven bulk viscosity in neutron-proton-electron ($npe$) matter to the symmetry parameters by calculating the susceptibilities of dense matter in terms of the symmetry energy. I use this result to calculate the resonant-peak value of the bulk viscosity as a function of density, finding that it strongly depends on $L$, as does the minimum bulk-viscous dissipation timescale. Also resulting from this calculation is a formula for finding the conformal points of the zero-temperature equation of state. Finally, I determine for which values of the symmetry parameters the maximum r-mode-stable rotation frequency of an $npe$-matter neutron star is smaller than the Kepler frequency, in the high-temperature conditions where bulk viscosity is the dominant dissipation mechanism.</description>
