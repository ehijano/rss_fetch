      <title>Altruism and energy flow in dynamic beehive models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the relationship between altruism and the genetic system of arrhenotoky through an evolutionary game theory (EGT)-inspired lens, using a dynamic model of beehive populations consisting of three castes: workers, drones, and the queen. Arrhenotoky is a form of asexual reproduction in which unfertilized eggs become males while fertilized eggs develop into females, leading to unusual patterns of genetic relatedness between family members. This mode of reproduction occurs in insects such as the Hymenoptera, including bees. In the hive environment, bees often display altruistic behavior, or actions taken by an organism that reduce its own fitness to increase the fitness of others. Eusociality, an elaborate form of social organization characterized by complex and altruistic social behaviors, is also observed in the Hymenoptera. To explore the interplay between altruism and the reproductive patterns of arrhenotoky, we employ a population dynamics model to simulate beehive populations over a range of parameters, controlling for altruism in workers and the queen. Our results show that altruistic behaviors are essential for beehive success, with optimal worker altruism corresponding to the division of labor observed in eusocial species. Furthermore, we find that modest altruism from the queen is also vital for hive survival, emphasizing the delicate balance that can exist in these complex social systems. Overall, our findings shed light on the co-evolution of altruism, arrhenotoky, and eusociality in the natural world.</description>

      <title>ARTreeFormer: A Faster Attention-based Autoregressive Model for Phylogenetic Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probabilistic modeling over the combinatorially large space of tree topologies remains a central challenge in phylogenetic inference. Previous approaches often necessitate pre-sampled tree topologies, limiting their modeling capability to a subset of the entire tree space. A recent advancement is ARTree, a deep autoregressive model that offers unrestricted distributions for tree topologies. However, its reliance on repetitive tree traversals and inefficient local message passing for computing topological node representations may hamper the scalability to large datasets. This paper proposes ARTreeFormer, a novel approach that harnesses fixed-point iteration and attention mechanisms to accelerate ARTree. By introducing a fixed-point iteration algorithm for computing the topological node embeddings, ARTreeFormer allows fast vectorized computation, especially on CUDA devices. This, together with an attention-based global message passing scheme, significantly improves the computation speed of ARTree while maintaining great approximation performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method on a benchmark of challenging real data phylogenetic inference problems.</description>

      <title>The unreasonable likelihood of being: origin of life, terraforming, and AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of life on Earth via the spontaneous emergence of a protocell prior to Darwinian evolution remains a fundamental open question in physics and chemistry. Here, we develop a conceptual framework based on information theory and algorithmic complexity. Using estimates grounded in modern computational models, we evaluate the difficulty of assembling structured biological information under plausible prebiotic conditions. Our results highlight the formidable entropic and informational barriers to forming a viable protocell within the available window of Earth's early history. While the idea of Earth being terraformed by advanced extraterrestrials might violate Occam's razor from within mainstream science, directed panspermia -- originally proposed by Francis Crick and Leslie Orgel -- remains a speculative but logically open alternative. Ultimately, uncovering physical principles for life's spontaneous emergence remains a grand challenge for biological physics.</description>

      <title>Investigating Mobility in Spatial Biodiversity Models through Recurrence Quantification Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recurrence plots and their associated quantifiers provide a robust framework for detecting and characterising complex patterns in non-linear time-series. In this paper, we employ recurrence quantification analysis to investigate the dynamics of the cyclic, non-hierarchical May-Leonard model, also referred to as rock--paper--scissors systems, that describes competitive interactions among three species. A crucial control parameter in these systems is the species' mobility $m$, which governs the spatial displacement of individuals and profoundly influences the resulting dynamics. By systematically varying $m$ and constructing suitable recurrence plots from numerical simulations, we explore how recurrence quantifiers reflect distinct dynamical features associated with different ecological states. We then introduce an ensemble-based approach that leverages statistical distributions of recurrence quantifiers, computed from numerous independent realisations, allowing us to identify dynamical outliers as significant deviations from typical system behaviour. Through detailed numerical analyses, we demonstrate that these outliers correspond to divergent ecological regimes associated with specific mobility values, providing also a robust manner to infer the mobility parameter from observed numerical data. Our results highlight the potential of recurrence-based methods as diagnostic tools for analysing spatial ecological systems and extracting ecologically relevant information from their non-linear dynamical patterns.</description>

      <title>The Price equation reveals a universal force-metric-bias law of algorithmic learning and natural selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diverse learning algorithms, optimization methods, and natural selection share a common mathematical structure, despite their apparent differences. Here I show that a simple notational partitioning of change by the Price equation reveals a universal force-metric-bias (FMB) law: $\Delta\mathbf{\theta} = \mathbf{M}\,\mathbf{f} + \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{\xi}$. The force $\mathbf{f}$ drives improvement in parameters, $\Delta\mathbf{\theta}$, through the covariance between the parameters and performance. The metric $\mathbf{M}$ rescales movement by inverse curvature. The bias $\mathbf{b}$ adds momentum or changes in the frame of reference. The noise $\mathbf{\xi}$ enables exploration. This framework unifies natural selection, Bayesian updating, Newton's method, stochastic gradient descent, stochastic Langevin dynamics, Adam optimization, and most other algorithms as special cases of the same underlying process. The Price equation also reveals why Fisher information, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and d'Alembert's principle arise naturally in learning dynamics. By exposing this common structure, the FMB law provides a principled foundation for understanding, comparing, and designing learning algorithms across disciplines.</description>

      <title>Individual or collective treatments: how to target antimicrobial use to limit the spread of \textit{Mannheimia haemolytica} among beef cattle?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16269v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The overuse of antibiotics has become a major global concern due to its role in diminishing treatment effectiveness and positively selecting antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains. This issue is particularly important in the beef cattle sector, where Bovine Respiratory Diseases (BRD) impose significant economic and welfare burdens. BRD are complex, multifactorial conditions primarily affecting young calves and feedlot cattle, caused by a combination of viral and bacterial pathogens, environmental factors, and stressors. Despite efforts to reduce antimicrobial use (AMU), the cattle production system remains heavily reliant on antibiotics to control BRD, often through the implementation of collective treatments to prevent outbreaks. This study aimed at evaluating the impact of various treatment practices on the spread of BRD, specifically focusing on criteria for implementing collective treatments. Using a mechanistic stochastic model, we simulated the spread of \textit{Mannheimia haemolytica} in a multi-pen fattening operation under sixteen different scenarios, considering pen composition, individual risk levels, and treatment strategies. Our findings suggest that an alternative criterion for collective treatments based on the speed of the disease spread, could reduce BRD incidence and AMU more effectively than conventional methods. This research highlights the importance of responsible treatment practices and the potential benefits of novel criteria for collective treatment strategies in improving animal health. Moreover, it emphasizes the need for transparency on the exposure to risk factors along the production chain.</description>

      <title>Exploiting individual differences to bootstrap communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Establishing a communication system is hard because the intended meaning of a signal is unknown to its receiver when first produced, and the signaller also has no idea how that signal will be interpreted. Most theoretical accounts of the emergence of communication systems rely on feedback to reinforce behaviours that have led to successful communication in the past. However, providing such feedback requires already being able to communicate the meaning that was intended or interpreted. Therefore these accounts cannot explain how communication can be bootstrapped from non-communicative behaviours. Here we present a model that shows how a communication system, capable of expressing an unbounded number of meanings, can emerge as a result of individual behavioural differences in a large population without any pre-existing means to determine communicative success. The two key cognitive capabilities responsible for this outcome are behaving predictably in a given situation, and an alignment of psychological states ahead of signal production that derives from shared intentionality. Since both capabilities can exist independently of communication, our results are compatible with theories in which large flexible socially-learned communication systems like language are the product of a general but well-developed capacity for social cognition.</description>
