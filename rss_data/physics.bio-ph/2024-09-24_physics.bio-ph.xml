      <title>Irreversibility in Bacterial Regulatory Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Irreversibility, in which a transient perturbation leaves a system in a new state, is an emergent property in systems of interacting entities. This property has well-established implications in statistical physics but remains underexplored in biological networks, especially for bacteria and other prokaryotes whose regulation of gene expression occurs predominantly at the transcriptional level. Focusing on the reconstructed regulatory network of \emph{Escherichia coli}, we examine network responses to transient single-gene perturbations. We predict irreversibility in numerous cases and find that the incidence of irreversibility increases with the proximity of the perturbed gene to positive circuits in the network. Comparison with experimental data suggests a connection between the predicted irreversibility to transient perturbations and the evolutionary response to permanent perturbations.</description>

      <title>An integrated evanescent-field biosensor in silicon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized diagnostic testing that is accurate, portable, quantitative, and capable of making multiple simultaneous measurements of different biomarkers at the point-of-need remains an important unmet need in the post-pandemic world. Resonator-based biosensors using silicon photonic integrated circuits are a promising technology to meet this need, as they can leverage (1) semiconductor manufacturing economies of scale, (2) exquisite optical sensitivity, and (3) the ability to integrate tens to hundreds of sensors on a millimeter-scale photonic chip. However, their application to decentralized testing has historically been limited by the expensive, bulky tunable lasers and alignment optics required for their readout. In this work, we introduce a segmented sensor architecture that addresses this important challenge by facilitating resonance-tracking readout using a fixed-wavelength laser. The architecture incorporates an in-resonator phase shifter modulated by CMOS drivers to periodically sweep and acquire the resonance peak shifts as well as a distinct high-sensitivity sensing region, maintaining high performance at a fraction of the cost and size. We show, for the first time, that fixed-wavelength sensor readout can offer similar performance to traditional tunable laser readout, demonstrating a system limit of detection of 6.1 x 10-5 RIU as well as immunoassay-based detection of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We anticipate that this sensor architecture will open the door to a new data-rich class of portable, accurate, multiplexed diagnostics for decentralized testing.</description>

      <title>Condensate Size Control by Charge Asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biomolecular condensates are complex droplets comprising many different types of molecules that interact using various mechanisms. Condensation is often driven by short-ranged attraction, but net charges can also mediate long-ranged repulsion. Using molecular dynamics simulations and an equilibrium field theory, we show that such opposing interactions can suppress coarsening so that many droplets of equal size coexist at equilibrium. This size control depends strongly on the charge asymmetry between constituents, while the strength of the short-ranged attractions has a weak influence. Our work reveals how electrostatic effects control droplet size, which is relevant for understanding biomolecular condensates and creating synthetic patterns in chemical engineering.</description>

      <title>Hyperdisordered cell packing on a growing surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the physics of disordered packing in non-growing systems is well understood, unexplored phenomena can emerge when packing takes place in growing domains. We study the arrangements of pigment cells (chromatophores) on squid skin as a biological example of a packed system on an expanding surface. We find that relative density fluctuations in cell numbers grow with spatial scale. We term this behavior ''hyperdisordered'', in contrast with hyperuniform behavior in which relative fluctuations tend to zero at large scale. We find that hyperdisordered scaling, akin to that of a critical system, is quantitatively reproduced by a model in which hard disks are randomly inserted in a homogeneously growing surface. In addition, we find that chromatophores increase in size during animal development, but maintain a stationary size distribution. The physical mechanisms described in our work may apply to a broad class of growing dense systems.</description>

      <title>The interplay between membrane viscosity and ligand-binding receptor kinetics in lipid bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasma membranes appear as deformable systems wherein molecules are free to move and diffuse giving rise to condensed microdomains (composed of ordered lipids, transmembrane proteins and cholesterol) surrounded by disordered lipid molecules. Such denser and thicker regions, namely lipid rafts, are important communication hubs for cells. Indeed, recent experiments revealed how the most of active signaling proteins co-localize on such domains, thereby intensifying the biochemical trafficking of substances. From a material standpoint, it is reasonable to assume the bilayer as a visco-elastic body accounting for both in-plane fluidity and elasticity. Consequently, lipid rafts contribute to membrane heterogeneity by typically exhibiting higher stiffness and viscosity and by locally altering the bilayer dynamics and proteins activity. A chemo-mechanical model of lipid bilayer coupled with interspecific dynamics among the resident species (typically transmembrane receptors and trasporters) has been recently formulated to explain and predict how proteins regulate the dynamic heterogeneity of membrane. However, the explicit inclusion of the membrane viscosity in the model was not considered. To this aim, the present work enriches the constitutive description of the bilayer by modeling its visco-elastic behavior. This is done through a strain-level dependent viscosity able to theoretically trace back the alteration of membrane fluidity experimentally observed in lipid phase transitions. This provides new insights into how the quasi-solid and fluid components of lipid membrane response interact with the evolution of resident proteins by affecting the activity of raft domains, with effects on cell mechano-signaling.</description>

      <title>Phase Separation on Deformable Membranes: interplay of mechanical coupling and dynamic surface geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The self-organization of proteins into enriched compartments and the formation of complex patterns are crucial processes for life on the cellular level. Liquid-liquid phase separation is one mechanism for forming such enriched compartments. When phase-separating proteins are membrane-bound and locally disturb it, the mechanical response of the membrane mediates interactions between these proteins. How these membrane-mediated interactions influence the steady state of the protein density distribution is thus an important question to investigate in order to understand the rich diversity of protein and membrane-shape patterns present at the cellular level. This work starts with a widely used model for membrane-bound phase-separating proteins. We numerically solve our system to map out its phase space and perform a careful, systematic expansion of the model equations to characterize the phase transitions through linear stability analysis and free energy arguments. We observe that the membrane-mediated interactions, due to their long-range nature, are capable of qualitatively altering the equilibrium state of the proteins. This leads to arrested coarsening and length-scale selection instead of simple demixing and complete coarsening. In this study, we unambiguously show that long-range membrane-mediated interactions lead to pattern formation in a system that otherwise would not do so. This work provides a basis for further systematic study of membrane-bound pattern-forming systems.</description>

      <title>Epithelial Tissues from the Bottom-Up: Contact Inhibition, Wound Healing, and Force Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In processes such as embryo shaping, wound healing, and malignant cell invasion, epithelial cells transition between dispersed phases, where the cells move independently, and condensed phases, where they aggregate and deform to close gaps, forming confluent tissues. Understanding how cells regulate these transitions and how these transitions differ from those of inert particles remains an open challenge. Addressing these questions requires linking the macroscopic properties of tissues to the mechanical characteristics and active responses of individual cells, driven by sub-cellular processes. Here, we introduce a computational model that incorporates key factors such as cell deformability, lamellipodium-driven dynamics, cell-junction-mediated adhesion, and contact inhibition of locomotion (CIL)-a process where cells alter their motion upon contact with others. We demonstrate how these factors, along with cell density, regulate the dynamical and mechanical properties of tissues. We show that CIL imparts unique living-like behaviors to cells and tissues by reducing density fluctuations. This reduction in fluctuations affects the dynamics: it inhibits cell motion in steady states but promotes it in the presence of gaps, accelerating wound healing. Furthermore, the stabilization of tensile states by CIL, which would otherwise fracture, enables the formation of tensile force chains.</description>

Abstract: From cytoskeletal networks to tissues, many biological systems behave as active materials. Their composition and stress-generation is affected by chemical reaction networks. In such systems, the coupling between mechanics and chemistry enables self-organization, for example, into waves. Recently, contractile mechanochemical systems were shown to be able to spontaneously develop localized spatial patterns. Here, we show that these localized patterns can present intrinsic spatiotemporal dynamics, including oscillations and chaotic-like dynamics. We discuss their physical origin and bifurcation structure.</description>

      <title>Dynamic learning of synchronization in coupled nonlinear systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11691v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synchronization phenomena are pervasive in coupled nonlinear systems across the natural world and engineering domains. Understanding how to dynamically identify the parameter space (or network structure) of coupled nonlinear systems in a synchronized state is crucial for the study of system synchronization. To address the challenge of achieving stable synchronization in coupled nonlinear systems, we develop a set of mathematical optimization techniques for dynamic learning of synchronization (DLS) inspired by machine learning. This technology captures the state differences between nodes within the system and dynamically adjusts weights, allowing coupled nonlinear systems to maintain a stable state of synchronization after appropriate weight adjustments. To enhance synchronization optimization, we use the Master Stability Function (MSF) to demonstrate how DLS effectively adjusts networks into their synchronization regions. We introduce several variants of the DLS technique, including adaptive, supervised, and hybrid methods, effectively promoting synchronization in heterogeneous networks such as small-world, scale-free, and random networks. The efficacy of this technique is validated through its application to simple FitzHugh-Nagumo neural networks and complex Hodgkin-Huxley neuronal networks, examining its impact on both global and local synchronization. The DLS technique proposed in this study offers a new solution to synchronization problems in dynamic network environments, addressing the deficiencies in adaptability and flexibility of existing technologies and providing a fresh perspective for understanding and implementing synchronization phenomena in coupled nonlinear systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bacterial cells exhibit a diverse array of shapes and sizes, largely governed by their cell walls in conjunction with cytoskeletal proteins and internal turgor pressure. The present study develops a theoretical framework for modeling the shape dynamics of actively expanding bacterial cell walls, grounded in the concept of minimal energy dissipation. In the context of a bacterial cell wall, dissipative forces are generated through the insertion of peptidoglycan (PG) strands, while driving forces stem from alterations in mechanochemical energy, crucial for sustaining the cell wall's shape. The interplay between mechanical and chemical energies facilitates in evaluating the free energy landscape and helps in predicting the homeostasis of the bacterial cell size. The size limit derived through linear stability analysis (LSA) of a model system accurately mirrors the phase diagram produced by the theoretical model. Nonetheless, given the cell wall's intricate molecular architecture, a more detailed constitutive model is expected to provide more precise quantitative insights.</description>

Abstract: In the realm of pandemic dynamics, understanding the intricate interplay between disease transmission, interventions, and immunity is pivotal for effective control strategies. Through a rigorous agent-based computer simulation, we embarked on a comprehensive exploration, traversing unmitigated spread, lockdown scenarios, and the transformative potential of vaccination. We unveil that while quarantine unquestionably delays the pandemic peak, it does not act as an impenetrable barrier to halt the progression of infectious diseases. Vaccination factor revealed a potent weapon against outbreaks higher vaccination percentage not only delayed infection peaks but also substantially curtailed their impact. Our investigation into bond dilution below the percolation threshold presents an additional dimension to pandemic control. We observed that localized isolation through bond dilution offers a more resource-efficient targeted control strategy than blanket lockdowns or large-scale vaccination campaigns.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fractional killing in response to drugs is a hallmark of non-genetic cellular heterogeneity. Yet how individual lineages evade drug treatment, as observed in bacteria and cancer cells, is not quantitatively understood. We analyse a stochastic population model with age-dependent division and death rates and characterise the emergence of fractional killing as a stochastic phenomenon under constant and periodic drug environments. In constant environments, increasing cell cycle noise induces a phase transition from complete to fractional killing, while increasing death noise can induce the reverse transition. In periodic drug environments, we discover survival resonance phenomena that give rise to peaks in the survival probabilities at division or death times that are multiples of the environment duration not seen in unstructured populations.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic dissipation does not bound replicator growth and decay rates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01130v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a well-known paper, Jeremy England derived a bound on the free energy dissipated by a self-replicating system [England, "Statistical physics of self-replication", The Journal of Chemical Physics, 2013]. This bound is usually interpreted as a universal relationship that connects thermodynamic dissipation to replicator per-capita decay and growth rates. We argue from basic thermodynamic principles against this interpretation. In fact, we suggest that such a relationship cannot exist in principle, because it is impossible for a thermodynamically-consistent replicator to undergo both per-capita growth and per-capita decay back into reactants. Instead, replicator may decay into separate waste products, but in that case, replication and decay are two independent physical processes, and there is no universal relationship that connects their thermodynamic and dynamical properties.</description>
