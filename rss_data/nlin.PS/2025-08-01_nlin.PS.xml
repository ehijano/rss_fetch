      <title>Theory of dispersive shock waves induced by the Raman effect in optical fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the theory of dispersive shock waves in optical fibers for the case of long-distance propagation of optical pulses, when the small Raman effect stabilizes the profile of the shock. The Whitham modulation equations are derived as the basis for the Gurevich-Pitaevskii approach to the analytical theory of such shocks. We show that the wave variables at both sides of the shock are related by the analogue of the Rankine-Hugoniot condition that follows from the conservation laws of the Whitham equations. Solutions of the Whitham equations yield the profiles of the wave variables that agree very well with the exact numerical solution of the generalized nonlinear Schroedinger equation for propagation of optical pulses.</description>

      <title>Fluctuating interfaces in barotropic beta-plane turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zonal jets manifest themselves as bands with sharp interfaces in the vorticity configuration. We develop an algorithm to track these fluctuating vorticity interfaces and systematically investigate their characteristic spatio-temporal behavior. While the interfacial height fluctuations are typically sub-Gaussian, the corresponding $\textit{fluctuation speeds}$ exhibit wider, heavy-tailed distributions reflecting the influence of lateral dispersion induced by the zonal velocity profile along the interfacial contours. The temporal evolution of these fluctuations is further characterized through their power spectrum displaying scale invariance in the frequency domain. The sharp, dense, shock-like features present in the time series of the $\textit{height}$ field suggest a possible lacking of differentiability. We confirm this by calculating the moments of the time-increments of the interfacial height fluctuations. Finally, the fractal nature of these boundaries is investigated systematically through a multifractal approach, revealing the non-trivial, complex statistics of interfaces in such geophysical, turbulent flows.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behaviors and dynamics of degenerate and mixed solitons for the coupled Hirota system with strong coherent coupling effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the asymptotic behaviors and dynamics of degenerate and mixed solitons for the coupled Hirota system with strong coherent coupling effects in the isotropic nonlinear medium. Using the binary Darboux transformation, we derive the solutions to represent the degenerate solitons with two eigenvalues that are conjugate to each other. We obtain three types of degenerate solitons and provide their asymptotic expressions. Notably, these degenerate solitons exhibit time-dependent velocities, and the relative distance between the two asymptotic solitons increases logarithmically with the higher-order perturbation parameter $|\varepsilon|$ increasing. We also asymptotically reveal four interaction mechanisms between a degenerate soliton and a bell-shaped soliton: (1) elastic interaction with a position shift; (2) inelastic interaction for the degenerate soliton but elastic for the bell-shaped one; (3) elastic interaction for the degenerate soliton but inelastic for the bell-shaped one; and (4) the coherent interaction during a longer interaction region and elastic interaction based on specific parameter conditions. Besides, we analyze a special degenerate vector soliton that exhibits significant coherence effects, and numerically study the relationship between the robustness of such solitons and parameter $\varepsilon$. Our results indicate that $\varepsilon$ significantly affects the coherence of these solitons, and their robustness decreases when $|\varepsilon|$ increases.</description>
