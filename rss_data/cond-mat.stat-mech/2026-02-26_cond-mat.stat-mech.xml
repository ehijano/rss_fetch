      <title>Yet another look at narrow escape through a tube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The narrow escape problem concerns the time needed for a diffusing particle to exit a confining domain through a small hole in the boundary. While this problem is now well-understood, determining the escape time for a particle that must exit through a narrow tube has proven challenging. Indeed, relying on analogies with electrodynamics, parameter fits to simulations, and heuristics, a variety of conflicting estimates for this escape time have been offered over the last three decades, some of which are counterintuitive and arguably non-physical. In this paper, we combine matched asymptotic analysis and probabilistic methods to determine the exact asymptotics of the narrow escape time through a tube. We obtain a new escape time formula which reduces to the various prior estimates in certain special cases. If the diffusivity in the tube differs from the diffusivity in the rest of the domain, our results reveal the importance of the form of the multiplicative noise inherent to any diffusivity that varies in space. We discuss our results in the context of asymmetric cell division.</description>

      <title>Integral formula for the propagator of the one-dimensional Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an exact integral formula for the multi-particle propagator of the one-dimensional Fermi--Hubbard model on an infinite lattice. The proof is based on the nested Bethe ansatz without relying on the string hypothesis. Our formula enables an explicit integral representation of the time evolution of arbitrary finite-particle wave functions and thereby provides a foundation for the exact analysis of nonequilibrium dynamics in the Hubbard model. It can further be applied to related open quantum models.</description>

      <title>A diffusion approximation for systems with frequent weak resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a diffusion approximation for systems subject to fast random resetting by small amplitudes. Equivalently, this describes systems with frequent but small catastrophes. We demonstrate the validity of the approximation by computing the stationary distribution and mean first-passage times of simple one-dimensional systems. The approximation captures dynamically induced correlations in multi-particle systems, and it can be used to generalise the conditionally independent and identically distributed structure recently found in systems with full resetting. Finally, we show that resetting can induce cycles and patterns, which can be characterised using the diffusion approximation.</description>

      <title>Plausible universality of uniaxial order in self-assembly of cross junctions in space dimension $d \ge 3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the self-assembly of cross junctions in a general space dimension ($d$) as an extension of the problem studied in a previous paper for $d = 3$. This problem is equivalent to constructing a $d$-dimensional hypercubic jungle gym, at all junctions of which $2d$ rods with different colours meet. The analysis reveals a unique feature of the $d = 3$ case: the forced presence of at least one perfectly-ordered (singly coloured) direction (axis), in contrast to the possible absence of such a direction in $d \ge 4$. However, we will show that the uniaxial order is overwhelming not only in $d = 3$ but also for $d \ge 4$ in a sufficiently large system.</description>

      <title>On the electrical double layer capacitance of the restricted primitive model: a link between the mesoscopic theory and the associative mean spherical approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21731v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The results for the electrical double layer capacitance and the charge density of ``free ions'' obtained from the mesoscopic theory are compared with the corresponding results of the associative mean spherical approximation. While the first theory takes into account the fluctuations of the charge density, the second theory assumes that the free ions and ion pairs are in chemical equilibrium according to the mass action law. Our results demonstrate a fairly good agreement between the two theories at high densities and low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Stochasticity of fatigue failure times in sheared glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fatigue failure occurs when a solid is subjected to repeated, cyclic loading. Glasses subjected to cyclic to shear deformation have recently been investigated using computer simulations and theoretical models, to characterize and rationalize the dependence of the number of cycles to failure, depending on the properties of the glasses, and the deformation amplitude. The average number of cycles to failure has been observed to diverge as the strain amplitude approaches the so-called fatigue limit from above. In this work, rather than the average times themselves, we investigate by computer simulations the distribution of fatigue failure times, in model glasses subjected to cyclic shear deformation and in an elasto-plastic model. In particular, we observe in atomistic simulations that the standard deviation of the logarithm of failure times are proportional to their mean values, with the proportionality constant decreasing as the system size increases, indicating a sharper distribution of failure times. Using a finite-element-based elasto-plastic model, we observe similar behavior and perform a system-size analysis showing that the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean tends toward zero in the thermodynamic limit. Such distributions, rather than arising solely from the distribution of disorder in the samples that have been subjected to cyclic deformation, appear to arise from the intrinsic stochasticity of the failure process, which we analyze through a stochastic damage accumulation model.</description>

      <title>Computing Nonequilibrium Transport from Short-Time Transients: From Lorentz Gas to Heat Conduction in One Dimensional Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We test the Transient Time Correlation Function (TTCF) method to compute nonequilibrium transport coefficients, highlighting its conceptual and practical difference from the standard time-average approach. While time averages extract transport properties from long stationary trajectories and discard transient dynamics, TTCF adopts the complementary strategy: it exploits the information contained in short-time transients following the onset of an external perturbation, while discarding the long-time evolution once stationarity is reached. We revisit the theoretical framework of TTCF and assess its numerical performance through representative case studies, the Lorentz gas and a many-body system, namely a chain of oscillators with anharmonic pinning potential. By direct comparison with time averages, we show that for the Lorentz gas TTCF yields consistent transport coefficients in both linear and nonlinear regimes at a reduced computational cost. Moreover, the TTCF displays superior precision in the linear-response regime, and remains reliable in non-ergodic situations, revealing the presence of regions of phase space corresponding to different behaviors, as well as the possibility of phase transitions. For the anharmonic chain, we show that TTCF is a scalable and efficient alternative for the numerical study of nonequilibrium transport.</description>

      <title>XY Model with Persistent Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a 2D XY model subjected to time-correlated noise, a model of direct relevance to active crystals, which were shown recently to be able to support very large deformations without melting in the presence of persistent fluctuations. We find that our persistent XY model can remain quasi-ordered in spite of correlations decaying much faster than allowed in equilibrium. We then investigate theoretically and numerically the order-disorder transition and conclude that it remains of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless type, but with scaling exponents that vary with the persistence time of the noise.</description>

      <title>From Global Flocking to Local Clustering: Interplay between Velocity Alignment and Visual Perception of Active Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective behavior in biological systems was first captured by the Vicsek model, in which particles align their velocities in the average direction of neighbors, leading to coherent motion and showing an order-disorder transition. However, in many complex environments, the interactions are non-reciprocal, lacking an action-reaction symmetry. Using framework of the Vicsek model, we implement non-reciprocity by restricting interactions to neighbors located inside a finite vision cone, for a particle by limiting its set of interacting neighbors which fall within a vision-cone, providing a minimal description for cognitive perception. Using detailed numerical simulations, we explore the clustering and flocking behavior due to competition between noise and limited visual perception in the presence of alignment interaction. For low noise, with reduction in the vision angle the system shows transition from a global coherent motion to locally ordered small-sized clusters. This behavior is confirmed through the steady-state distributions of velocity components and their fluctuation relative to the global mean. This is also characterized using a polar order-parameter and a two-point velocity correlation function. Interestingly, at small vision angles, particles exhibit strong short-range correlations within clusters even in the absence of any global coherence. Time-evolution of the related correlation functions illustrate the pathways towards the emergence of such structures. The time dependence of the average cluster size and the length-scale calculated from the two-point velocity correlation show scaling behavior and indicate that the emergence of density field clustering is a consequence of the velocity-field coherence. Any kind of ordering and clustering disappear in the limit of high noise and low vision-angle regime.</description>

      <title>Computational Frameworks for Patterned Two-Dimensional Magnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Patterned two-dimensional (2D) magnetic nanostructures constitute geometry-engineered spin systems in which exchange, anisotropy, dipolar coupling, and finite-size effects operate on comparable energy scales. Spatial modulation of continuous magnetic films produces confinement-driven critical behavior, compensation phenomena, metastable switching pathways, and topologically non-trivial textures such as vortices and skyrmions. Computational modeling plays a central role in resolving this complexity, enabling quantitative construction of thermodynamic phase diagrams and analysis of geometry-dependent stability regimes. This review synthesizes theoretical and numerical frameworks for patterned 2D magnetism, including classical spin models, stochastic spin dynamics, rare-event methods, and multiscale parameterization informed by first-principles calculations. Representative systems-nanodot and antidot arrays, artificial spin-ice lattices, exchange-modulated heterostructures, and patterned van der Waals magnets- illustrate how geometry functions as an effective thermodynamic control parameter. Emerging directions in nonequilibrium modeling, multiphysics coupling, and scalable data-centric workflows are discussed in the context of predictive phase mapping. Patterned 2D magnetism thus exemplifies the convergence of geometry-controlled materials engineering and computational statistical physics, with phase stability and controlled spin textures at the core of next-generation spintronic architectures.</description>

      <title>Self-avoiding tethered surfaces are always flat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scaling behavior of fully flexible elastic tethered surfaces has been debated for decades. Some theories predict that self-avoiding surfaces would crumple in the absence of bending rigidity, while most simulations suggested that they would remain flat. Recent simulations on ideal membranes with lattice perforations suggest that systematically removing surface area from a membrane may provide an alternative way to crumpling self-avoiding surfaces. We perform extensive numerical simulations of two models of fully flexible elastic tethered surfaces in which self-avoidance can be systematically and continuously tuned to the ideal limit. We show that in the thermodynamic limit, these surfaces remain flat with a size exponent $\nu=1$ for any finite degree of self-avoidance, with or without membrane perforations.</description>

      <title>On some mathematical problems for open quantum systems with varying particle number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the effective Hamiltonian $H - \mu N$ for open quantum systems with varying particle number from first principles within the framework of non-relativistic quantum statistical mechanics. We prove that under physically motivated assumptions regarding the size of the system and the range of the interaction, this form of the Hamiltonian is unique up to a constant. Our argument relies firstly on establishing a rigorous version of the surface-to-volume ratio approximation, which is routinely used in an empirical form in statistical mechanics, and secondly on showing that the Hilbert space for systems with varying particle number must be isomorphic to Fock space. Together, these findings provide a rigorous mathematical justification for the standard grand canonical formalism employed in statistical physics.</description>

      <title>Quantum jumps in open cavity optomechanics and Liouvillian versus Hamiltonian exceptional points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points, where two or more eigenstates of a non-Hermitian system coalesce, are now of interest across many fields of physics, from the perspective of open-system dynamics, sensing, nonreciprocal transport, and topological phase transitions. In this work, we investigate exceptional points in cavity optomechanics, a platform of interest to diverse communities working on gravitational-wave detection, macroscopic quantum mechanics, quantum transduction, etc. Specifically, we clarify the role of quantum jumps in making a clear distinction between Liouvillian and Hamiltonian exceptional points in optomechanical systems. While the Liouvillian exceptional point arises from the unconditional Lindblad dynamics and is independent of the phonon-bath temperature, the Hamiltonian exceptional point emerges from the conditional no-jump evolution and acquires a thermal shift due to an enhanced conditional damping. Employing the thermofield formalism, we derive a unified spectral framework that interpolates between these regimes via an analytical hybrid-Liouvillian description. Remarkably, in the weak-quantum-jump regime, the exceptional point is perturbed only at the second order, highlighting the robustness of the Hamiltonian exceptional point under small hybrid perturbations. Our work reveals a continuous family of hybrid exceptional points, clarifies the operational and physical differences between the conditional and unconditional dissipative dynamics in optomechanical systems, and provides a probe for thermal baths.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1905.06332v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents an entropy stability analysis of smoothed dissipative particle dynamics (SDPD) to review the validity of particle discretization of entropy equations. First, we consider the simplest SDPD system: a simulation of incompressible flows using an explicit time integration scheme, assuming a quasi-static scenario with constant volume, constant number of particles, and infinitesimal time shift. Next, we derive a form of entropy from the discretized entropy equation of SDPD by integrating it with respect to time. We then examine the properties of a two-particle system for a constant temperature gradient. Interestingly, our theoretical analysis suggests that there exist eight different types of entropy stability conditions, which depend on the types of kernel functions. It is found that the Lucy kernel, poly6 kernel, and spiky kernel produce the same types of entropy stability conditions, whereas the spline kernel produces different types of entropy stability conditions. Our results contribute to a deeper understanding of particle discretization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a quasi-adiabatic thermal process for preparing finite-temperature ensembles in the thermodynamic limit. The process gradually transforms a thermal ensemble of a noninteracting system into that of an interacting system of interest over a finite operation time, with the temperature controlled by parameters associated with the entropy of the initial state. We analyze this process in both nonintegrable and integrable spin chains with translational invariance. For the nonintegrable case, numerical simulations combined with a thermodynamic argument indicate that the thermal properties of local observables are accurately reproduced with a single parameter, although the operation time increases exponentially with precision. In contrast, for the integrable transverse-field Ising model, we analytically show that an extensive number of parameters tied to local conserved quantities is generally necessary, and the performance is affected by the presence of a quantum phase transition. These results clarify the potential and limitations of the quasi-adiabatic thermal process for an ensemble preparation and highlight the role of integrability in determining its efficiency.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Phase Transitions in Mean-Field Ginzburg-Landau Models: Conjugate Fields and Fourier-Mode Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic phase transitions of periodically forced mean-field ferromagnets are often described by a single order parameter and a scalar conjugate field. Building from previous work, we show that, at the critical period $P_c$ of the mean-field Ginzburg-Landau (MFGL) dynamics with energy $F(m)=am^2+bm^4-hm$, the correct conjugate field is the entire even-Fourier component part of the applied field. The correct order parameter is $z_k=\sqrt{\bigl|\,m_k^2-|m_{k,c}|^2\,\bigr|}$, where $m_k$ is the $k^{th}$ Fourier component of the magnetization m(t), and $m_{k,c}$ is the $k^{th}$ Fourier component at the critical period. Using high-accuracy limit-cycle integration and Fourier analysis, we first confirm that, for periodic fields that contain only odd components, the symmetry-broken branch below $P_c$ exhibits $z_k \propto \varepsilon^{1/2}$ (computationally tested for modes $k\le30$), where $\varepsilon=(P_c-P)/P_c$. This provides strong evidence that the 1/2 scaling holds for all Fourier modes. We then find three robust facts: (1) Exactly at $P_c$, adding a small perturbation composed of even Fourier components with an overall field multiplier $h_{mult}$ yields $z_k \propto h_{mult}^{1/3}$ across many $k$. (2) Mode-resolved deviations obey a parity rule: $|\delta m_{2n}| \propto h_{mult}^{1/3}$ and $|\delta m_{2n+1}| \propto h_{mult}^{2/3}$. (3) These scalings persist in two MFGL models with higher-order nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Lorentz Mirror Model: Normal Transport and a Universal $2/3$ Mean--Variance Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07988v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lorentz mirror model provides a clean setting to study macroscopic transport generated solely by quenched environmental randomness. We introduce a hierarchical version whose distribution of left--right crossings satisfies an exact recursion. In dimensions $d\geq 3$, we prove normal transport: the mean conductance scales as (cross-section)/(length) on all length scales. A Gaussian closure, supported by numerics, predicts that the variance-to-mean ratio of the conductance converges to the universal value $2/3$ for all $d\geq 2$ (the ``$2/3$ law''). We provide numerical evidence for the $2/3$ law in the original (non-hierarchical) Lorentz mirror model in $d=3$, and conjecture that it is a universal signature of normal transport induced by random current matching. In the marginal case $d=2$, our hierarchical recursion reproduces the known scaling of the mean conductance and its variance.

      <title>Nonequilibrium Dynamics of Dirac Quantum Criticality in Imaginary Time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10601v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum criticality within Dirac fermions harbors a plethora of exotic phenomena, attracting sustained attention in the past decades. Here, we explore the imaginary-time relaxation dynamics in a typical Dirac quantum criticality belonging to chiral Heisenberg universality class. Performing large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we unveil rich nonequilibrium critical phenomena from different initial states. In particular, we identify a non-stationary initial slip evolution characterized by an unconventional negative critical exponent $\theta=-0.84(4)$, corroborating the significant impact of fermionic critical fluctuations. Furthermore, we generalize the nonequilibrium scaling theory to incorporate both fermionic and bosonic critical modes, capturing their distinct relaxation behaviors. Armed with the scaling theory, we establish a new framework to investigate fermionic quantum criticality based on short-time dynamics, paving a promising avenue to fathoming quantum criticality in diverse fermionic systems with high efficiency.</description>

      <title>Hermitian and non-Hermitian topology in active matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-propulsion is a quintessential aspect of biological systems, which can induce nonequilibrium phenomena that have no counterparts in passive systems. Motivated by biophysical interest together with recent advances in experimental techniques, active matter has been a rapidly developing field in physics. Meanwhile, over the past few decades, topology has played a crucial role to understand certain robust properties appearing in condensed matter systems. For instance, the nontrivial topology of band structures leads to the notion of topological insulators, where one can find robust gapless edge modes protected by the bulk band topology. We here review recent progress in an interdisciplinary area of research at the intersection of these two fields. Specifically, we give brief introductions to active matter and band topology in Hermitian systems, and then explain how the notion of band topology can be extended to nonequilibrium (and thus non-Hermitian) systems including active matter. We review recent studies that have demonstrated the intimate connections between active matter and topological materials, where exotic topological phenomena that are unfeasible in passive systems have been found. A possible extension of the band topology to nonlinear systems is also briefly discussed. Active matter can thus provide an ideal playground to explore topological phenomena in qualitatively new realms beyond conservative linear systems.</description>

      <title>Impact of Clifford operations on non-stabilizing power and quantum chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14793v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-stabilizerness, alongside entanglement, is a crucial ingredient for fault-tolerant quantum computation and achieving a genuine quantum advantage. Despite recent progress, a complete understanding of the generation and thermalization of non-stabilizerness in circuits that mix Clifford and non-Clifford operations remains elusive. While Clifford operations do not generate non-stabilizerness, their interplay with non-Clifford gates can strongly impact the overall non-stabilizing dynamics of generic quantum circuits. In this work, we establish a direct relationship between the final non-stabilizing power and the individual powers of the non-Clifford gates, in circuits where these gates are interspersed with random Clifford operations. By leveraging this result, we unveil the thermalization of non-stabilizing power to its Haar-averaged value in generic circuits. As a precursor, we analyze two-qubit gates and illustrate this thermalization in analytically tractable systems. Extending this, we explore the operator-space non-stabilizing power and demonstrate its behavior in physical models. Finally, we examine the role of non-stabilizing power in the emergence of quantum chaos in brick-wall quantum circuits. Our work elucidates how non-stabilizing dynamics evolve and thermalize in quantum circuits and thus contributes to a better understanding of quantum computational resources and of their role in quantum chaos.</description>

      <title>Universality of stochastic control of quantum chaos with measurement and feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate universal features of measurement-and-feedback control of quantum chaotic dynamics by examining the quantum Arnold cat map, a paradigmatic model of quantum chaos. Inspired by probabilistic control of classical chaos, our protocol stochastically alternates between intrinsic instability and engineered control operations that steer trajectories toward a target point. Simulation of exact quantum dynamics and a semiclassical truncated Wigner approximation reveal universal properties of the cat map's control transition. To further characterize this universality, we introduce the inverted harmonic oscillator as an analytically tractable effective model of instability. By integrating numerical simulations, a semiclassical Fokker-Planck description, and a direct spectral analysis of the stochastic quantum channel, we identify quantum signatures absent in classical limits. The close agreement between quantum simulation, truncated Wigner approximation, and inverted oscillator analysis shows that universal features of the transition are set by uncertainty-limited quantum fluctuations and are insensitive to genuine quantum interference.</description>

      <title>Density-Independent transient caging in the high-density phase of motility-induced phase separation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of active matter using a two-dimensional active Brownian particles model. In these systems, self-propelled particles undergo motility-induced phase separation (MIPS), spontaneously segregating into dense and dilute phases. We find that in the high-density phase, local particle mobility exhibits transient caging, with diffusivity remaining unchanged despite variations in the global system density. As global density increases further, the system undergoes a transition to a solid-like state through an intermediate regime with pronounced dynamical arrest. Our findings identify a distinct high-density regime characterized by transient caging and dynamical slowing down in a monodisperse active system, shedding new light on the connection between MIPS and nonequilibrium arrest.</description>

      <title>Semi-Dirac spin liquids and frustrated quantum magnetism on the trellis lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Geometrical frustration in quantum magnets provides a fertile setting for unconventional phases of matter, including quantum spin liquids (QSLs). The trellis lattice, with its complex site arrangements and edge-sharing triangular motifs, presents a promising platform for such physics. In this work, we undertake a comprehensive classification of all fully symmetric QSLs on the trellis lattice using the projective symmetry group approach within the Abrikosov-fermion representation. We find 7 U(1) and 25 $Z_2$ short-ranged Ans\"atze and analyze the phase diagram in the mean-field parameter space, uncovering both gapped and Dirac QSLs as well as a semi-Dirac spin liquid that emerges at the level of projective symmetry group classification and mean-field band structure, in which the spinon dispersion is linear along one momentum direction but quadratic along the orthogonal one. We demonstrate that such dispersions can occur only at high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone with $C_{2v}$ little groups and analyze their characteristic correlation signatures. Moreover, by optimizing over all symmetry-allowed mean-field states, we map out a phase diagram -- featuring six distinct phases -- of the nearest-neighbor Heisenberg Hamiltonian on the trellis lattice. Among these, we find four quasi-one-dimensional QSL phases, one dimer phase, and one Dirac QSL phase. Going beyond mean field, we also assess equal-time and dynamical spin structure factors of these phases using density-matrix renormalization group and Keldysh pseudofermion functional renormalization group calculations and compare qualitative momentum-space features of these spectra with those obtained at the mean-field level. Finally, we identify four cuprate and vanadate compounds as promising experimental realizations and provide spectroscopic predictions, based on first-principles Hamiltonians, as a guide for neutron-scattering studies.</description>

      <title>Higher-form entanglement asymmetry. Part I. The limits of symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry is a relative entropy that faithfully diagnoses symmetry breaking in quantum states, possibly within a spatial subregion. In this work, we extend such framework to higher-form symmetries and compute entanglement asymmetry in theories with spontaneously-broken continuous zero- and higher-form symmetries. One of our central results is an entropic Coleman-Mermin-Wagner theorem, for 0- and $p$-form symmetries, valid also on subregions, which forbids spontaneous breaking of continuous $p$-form symmetries in spacetime dimensions $d\leq p+2$. Our theorem not only qualifies symmetry breaking, it also quantifies it: spontaneous breaking triggers a nonvanishing entanglement asymmetry that grows monotonically towards the infrared, and counts the number of Goldstone fields. Along the way, we derive standalone results concerning the entanglement entropy and asymmetry of Goldstone bosons and gauge fields. In particular, we find a closed-form expression for the R\'enyi asymmetries of a compact scalar field on spherical subregions in three and four spacetime dimensions, and for higher-form gauge fields in higher dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22734v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although the two-dimensional model of random networks of metallic nanowires or carbon nanotubes is widely used, it significantly overestimates the number of contacts between elements compared to quasi-three-dimensional models. This, within the mean-field approximation, leads to overestimates of the electrical conductivity, especially when the main contribution to the system's electrical conductivity comes from the contact resistances between the conductors. In the two-dimensional model, the system's electrical conductivity depends quadratically on the conductor density, whereas in the three-dimensional model, this dependence is linear. We propose a simple modification of a two-dimensional model, which can capture the saturation effect of the number of contacts per conductor in a real nanowire network.</description>

      <title>Ergotropic Mpemba crossings in finite-dimensional quantum batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum Mpemba effect is a counterintuitive phenomenon in which a state initially farther from equilibrium relaxes more rapidly than one that starts nearer to equilibrium. In the context of finite-dimensional quantum batteries interacting with an environment, we introduce the notion of an ergotropic Mpemba crossing (EMC), defined by the intersection of ergotropy trajectories during the dynamics. For qubit batteries subjected to amplitude damping noise, we derive a condition for the occurrence of EMC in terms of the relative coherence of the initial states and fully characterize the region of state space that exhibits EMC with respect to a fixed reference state. Interestingly, our analysis reveals that under anisotropic Pauli noise, the emergence of EMC is jointly governed by the coherence and the energy of the initial states. To elucidate the physical origin of EMC, we decompose ergotropy into coherent and incoherent contributions and show that, in qubit systems, the coherent component plays a crucial role for EMC, an observation that strikingly does not extend to three-level batteries. Further, by extending our analysis to non-Markovian environments, we demonstrate that, unlike the Markovian case, non-Markovian dynamics can give rise to multiple Mpemba crossings, with the total number of crossings always being odd. Moreover, analyzing the connection between the EMC and the conventional state Mpemba effect reveals that, for qubits, an EMC necessarily entails a state Mpemba crossing while this correspondence breaks down for qutrits, where EMCs may arise without any state Mpemba crossing.</description>

      <title>From Classical to Quantum: Extending Prometheus for Unsupervised Discovery of Phase Transitions in Three Dimensions and Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the Prometheus framework for unsupervised phase transition discovery from 2D classical systems to 3D classical and quantum many-body systems, addressing scalability in higher dimensions and generalization to quantum fluctuations. For the 3D Ising model ($L \leq 32$), the framework detects the critical temperature within 0.01\% of literature values ($T_c/J = 4.511 \pm 0.005$) and extracts critical exponents with $\geq 70\%$ accuracy ($\beta = 0.328 \pm 0.015$, $\gamma = 1.24 \pm 0.06$, $\nu = 0.632 \pm 0.025$), correctly identifying the 3D Ising universality class via $\chi^2$ comparison ($p = 0.72$) without analytical guidance. For quantum systems, we developed quantum-aware VAE (Q-VAE) architectures using complex-valued wavefunctions and fidelity-based loss. Applied to the transverse field Ising model, we achieve 2\% accuracy in quantum critical point detection ($h_c/J = 1.00 \pm 0.02$) and successfully discover ground state magnetization as the order parameter ($r = 0.97$). Notably, for the disordered transverse field Ising model, we detect exotic infinite-randomness criticality characterized by activated dynamical scaling $\ln \xi \sim |h - h_c|^{-\psi}$, extracting a tunneling exponent $\psi = 0.48 \pm 0.08$ consistent with theoretical predictions ($\psi = 0.5$). This demonstrates that unsupervised learning can identify qualitatively different types of critical behavior, not just locate critical points. Our systematic validation across classical thermal transitions ($T = 0$ to $T &gt; 0$) and quantum phase transitions ($T = 0$, varying $h$) establishes that VAE-based discovery generalizes across fundamentally different physical domains, providing robust tools for exploring phase diagrams where analytical solutions are unavailable.</description>
