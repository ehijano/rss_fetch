      <title>Ubiquitous Flat Bands in a Cr-based Kagome Superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the quest for novel quantum states driven by topology and correlation, kagome lattice materials have garnered significant interest due to their distinctive electronic band structures, featuring flat bands (FBs) arising from the quantum destructive interference of the electronic wave function. The tuning of the FBs to the chemical potential would lead to the possibility of liberating electronic instabilities that lead to emergent electronic orders. Despite extensive studies, direct evidence of FBs tuned to the chemical potential and their participation in emergent electronic orders have been lacking in bulk quantum materials. Here using a combination of Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) and Density Functional Theory (DFT), we reveal that the low-energy electronic structure of the recently discovered Cr-based kagome metal superconductor {\Cr} is dominated by a pervasive FB in close proximity to, and below the Fermi level. A comparative analysis with orbital-projected DFT and polarization dependence measurement uncovers that an orbital-selective renormalization mechanism is needed to reconcile the discrepancy with the DFT calculations, which predict the FB to appear 200 meV above the Fermi level. Furthermore, we observe the FB to shift away from the Fermi level by 20 meV in the low-temperature density wave-ordered phase, highlighting the role of the FB in the emergent electronic order. Our results reveal {\Cr} to stand out as a promising platform for further exploration into the effects of FBs near the Fermi level on kagome lattices, and their role in emergent orders in bulk quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Spin and lattice dynamics of a van der Waals antiferromagnet MnPSe$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic van der Waals family $\rm \textit{M}P\textit{X}_{3}\ (M=Fe,\ Mn,\ Co,\text{ and}\ Ni; X=S\text{ and}\ Se)$ have attracted significant research attention due to the possibility of realizing long-range magnetic order down to the monolayer limit. Here, we perform inelastic neutron scattering measurements on single crystal samples of MnPSe$_3$, a member of the $\rm \textit{M}P\textit{X}_{3}$ family, to study the spin dynamics and determine the effective spin model. The excited magnon bands are well characterized by a spin model, which includes a Heisenberg term with three intraplane exchange parameters ($J_{1}=-0.73$~meV, $J_{2}=-0.014$~meV, $J_{3}=-0.43$~meV) and one interplane parameter ($J_{c}=-0.054$~meV), and an easy-plane single-ion anisotropy term ($D=-0.035$~meV). Additionally, we observe the intersection of the magnon and phonon bands but no anomalous spectral features induced by the formation of magnon-phonon hybrid excitations at the intersecting region. We discuss possible reasons for the absence of such hybrid excitations in MnPSe$_3$.</description>

      <title>Probably the simplest and cheapest quantum Monte Carlo method so far for extracting high-precision entanglement entropy and its derivative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring entanglement entropy (EE) to probe the intrinsic physics of quantum many-body systems is an important but challenging topic in condensed matter, high energy and computational physics. Designing quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm to obtain the R\'enyi EE is a promising solution in large-scale many-body systems. However, to gain high-precision EE, the QMC-based algorithm for EE becomes more and more complex at the designing level. The entangled region needs being changed during the QMC simulation, and the detailed balance condition becomes more complicated. Moreover, the intermediately incremental processes introduced cannot be exploited neither. In this paper, we propose a simple QMC scheme able to extract EE and its derivative with high-precision, which requires neither changing replica manifold during the simulation nor adding extra detailed balance conditions. All the values measured in the incremental process are the EE under physical parameters, which greatly improves the efficiency. It opens an access to numerically probe the novel phases and phase transitions by scanning EE in a wide parameter-region in 2D and higher dimensional systems. The method has low-technical barrier and is natural for parallel computing. Our algorithm makes it no longer a dream to calculate a large amount of high-precision EE values without complicated techniques and huge computational cost.</description>

      <title>Exact quantization of topological order parameter in SU($N$) spin models, $N$-ality transformation and ingappabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the ground-state expectation value of twisting operator is a topological order parameter for $\text{U}(1)$- and $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$-symmetric symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in one-dimensional ``spin'' systems -- it is quantized in the thermodynamic limit and can be used to identify different SPT phases and to diagnose phase transitions among them. We prove that this (non-local) order parameter must take values in $N$-th roots of unity, and its value can be changed by a generalized lattice translation acting as an $N$-ality transformation connecting distinct phases. This result also implies the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis ingappability for SU($N$) spins if we further impose a general translation symmetry. Furthermore, our exact result for the order parameter of SPT phases can predict a large number of LSM ingappabilities by the general lattice translation. We also apply the $N$-ality property to provide an efficient way to construct possible multi-critical phase transitions starting from a single Hamiltonian with a unique gapped ground state.</description>

      <title>Generating Lattice Non-invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice non-invertible symmetries have rich fusion structures and play important roles in understanding various exotic topological phases. In this paper, we explore methods to generate new lattice non-invertible transformations/symmetries from a given non-invertible seed transformation/symmetry. The new lattice non-invertible symmetry is constructed by composing the seed transformations on different sites or sandwiching a unitary transformation between the transformations on the same sites. In addition to known non-invertible symmetries with fusion algebras of Tambara-Yamagami $\mathbb Z_N\times\mathbb Z_N$ type, we obtain a new non-invertible symmetry in models with $\mathbb Z_N$ dipole symmetries. We name the latter the dipole Kramers-Wannier symmetry because it arises from gauging the dipole symmetry. We further study the dipole Kramers-Wannier symmetry in depth, including its topological defect, its anomaly and its associated generalized Kennedy-Tasaki transformation.</description>

      <title>Engineering 2D square lattice Hubbard models in 90$^\circ$ twisted Ge/SnX (X=S, Se) moir\'e supperlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the large-period superlattices emerging in moir\'e two-dimensional (2D) materials, electronic states in such systems exhibit low energy flat bands that can be used to simulate strongly correlated physics in a highly tunable setup. While many investigations have thus far focused on moir\'e flat bands and emergent correlated electron physics in triangular, honeycomb and quasi-one-dimensional lattices, tunable moir\'e realizations of square lattices subject to strong correlations remain elusive. Here we propose a feasible scheme to construct moire square lattice systems by twisting two layers of 2D materials in a rectangular lattice by 90 degrees. We demonstrate such scheme with twisted Ge/SnX (X=S,Se) moir\'e superlattices and theoretical calculate their electronic structures from first principles. We show that the lowest conduction flat band in these systems can be described by a square lattice Hubbard model with parameters which can be controlled by varying the choice of host materials, number of layers, and external electric fields. In particular, twisted double bilayer GeSe realizes a square lattice Hubbard model with strong frustration due to the next nearest neighbour hopping that could lead to unconventional superconductivity, in close analogy to the Hubbard model for copper-oxygen planes of cuprate high-temperature superconductors. The basic concept of using 90-degree twisted 2D materials with rectangular unit cell to realize the square lattice Hubbard model works in general and therefore we establish those systems as tunable platforms to simulate correlation physics in such a geometries.</description>

      <title>Good plasmons in a bad metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correlated materials may exhibit unusually high resistivity increasing linearly in temperature, breaking through the Mott-Ioffe-Regel bound, above which coherent quasiparticles are destroyed. The fate of collective charge excitations, or plasmons, in these systems is a subject of debate. Several studies suggest plasmons are overdamped while others detect unrenormalized plasmons. Here, we present direct optical images of low-loss hyperbolic plasmon polaritons (HPPs) in the correlated van der Waals metal MoOCl2. HPPs are plasmon-photon modes that waveguide through extremely anisotropic media and are remarkably long-lived in MoOCl2. Many-body theory supported by photoemission results reveals that MoOCl2 is in an orbital-selective and highly incoherent Peierls phase. Different orbitals acquire markedly different bonding-antibonding character, producing a highly-anisotropic, isolated Fermi surface. The Fermi surface is further reconstructed and made partly incoherent by electronic interactions, renormalizing the plasma frequency. HPPs remain long-lived in spite of this, allowing us to uncover previously unseen imprints of electronic correlations on plasmonic collective modes.</description>

      <title>Photoinduced non-reciprocal magnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Out of equilibrium, the action-reaction symmetry of the interactions is often broken, leading to the emergence of various collective phenomena with no equilibrium counterparts. Although ubiquitous in classical active systems, implementing such non-reciprocal interactions in solid-state systems has remained challenging, as the known quantum schemes require precise control over the system on a single-site level. Here, we propose a novel dissipation-engineering protocol to induce non-reciprocal interactions in solid-state platforms with light, which we expect to be achievable with state-of-the-art experimental techniques. Focusing on magnetic metals for concreteness, we show microscopically that a light injection that introduces the decay channel to a virtually excited state gives rise to non-reciprocal interactions between localized spins. One can even realize a situation where spin A tries to align with spin B but the B tries the opposite, resulting in a chase-and-runaway dynamics. Applying our scheme to layered ferromagnets, we show that a non-reciprocal phase transition from a static to a many-body time-dependent chiral phase emerges. Our work paves the way to bring solid-state systems to the realm of non-reciprocal science, providing yet another possibility to control quantum matter with light.</description>

      <title>Exact Entanglement correlation complements the chemical bond description</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the properties of the exact solution obtained by us recently for the extended Hetiler-London model for chemical bonding which has an analytic form. The emphasis is put on defining two-particle entanglement correlation as the complementary characterization of the chemical bond and relating it to the partial atomicity and the so-called true covalency. The newly introduced characteristics remove the deficiency of the standard definition of covalency which now vanishes in the limit of the separated atoms. In effect, a gradual evolution of the system of two indistinguishable electrons in a bound state into their distinguishable correspondents can be traced systematically. The present analysis has a universal meaning and may also be applied to more complex systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering the role of electron correlation in a two-dimensional (2D) system in strong magnetic field, we investigate the quantum states of two interacting electrons in the quantum Hall effect regime. We introduce sub-Landau levels of the two-electron states by determining their energies and degeneracies. The effects of electron correlation, Zeeman splitting and energy-level broadening on the stability of the electron-pair states are discussed. It is shown that the two electrons in the triplet state with spins aligned parallel to the magnetic field can form a stable electron pair in the 2D system in GaAs/AlGaAs heterojunction. A wavefunction of many electron pairs are presented and compared with the Laughlin wavefunction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the high-temperature expansion of the free energy and arbitrary connected correlation functions of quantum spin systems can be recursively obtained from the exact renormalization group flow equation for the generating functional of connected spin correlation functions derived by Krieg and Kopietz [Phys. Rev. B 99, 060403(R) (2019)]. Our recursive algorithm can be explicitly written down in closed form including all combinatorial factors. We use our method to estimate critical temperatures of Heisenberg magnets from low-order truncations of the inverse spin susceptibility in the static limit. We also calculate the connected correlation function involving three different spin components (chiral non-linear susceptibility) of quantum Heisenberg magnets up to second order in the exchange couplings.</description>

      <title>Quadratic dispersion relations in gapless frustration-free systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent case-by-case studies revealed that the dispersion of low energy excitations in gapless frustration-free Hamiltonians is often quadratic or softer. In this work, we argue that this is actually a general property of such systems. By combining a previous study by Bravyi and Gosset and the min-max principle, we prove this hypothesis for models with local Hilbert spaces of dimension two that contains only nearest-neighbor interactions on cubic lattice. This may be understood as a no-go theorem realizing gapless phases with linearly dispersive excitations in frustration-free Hamiltonians. We also provide examples of frustration-free Hamiltonians in which the plane-wave state of a single spin flip does not constitute low energy excitations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamic critical exponent $z$ characterizes the finite-size gap in gapless quantum many-body systems. We establish a rigorous lower bound $z \geq 2$ for frustration-free Hamiltonians on any lattice in any spatial dimension, given that their ground state exhibits a power-law decaying correlation function. This bound applies to representative classes of frustration-free Hamiltonians, including Rokhsar-Kivelson Hamiltonians, which are in one-to-one correspondence to Markov chains with locality, as well as parent Hamiltonians of critical projected entangled pair states with either a unique ground state or topologically degenerate ground states, and Hamiltonians with a plane-wave ground state.</description>

      <title>Discovering classical spin liquids by topological search of high symmetry nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin liquids are a paradigmatic example of a non-trivial state of matter, and the search for new spin liquids is a key direction of physics, chemistry, and materials science. Geometric frustration -- where the geometry of the net that the spins occupy precludes the generation of a simple ordered state -- is a particularly fruitful way to generate these intrinsically disordered states. A particular focus has been on a handful of high symmetry nets. There are, however, many three-dimensional nets, each of which has the potential to form unique states. In this paper, we investigate the high symmetry nets -- those which are both node- and edge-transitive -- for the simplest possible interaction sets: nearest-neighbour couplings of antiferromagnetic Heisenberg and Ising spins. While the well-known crs (pyrochlore) net is the only nearest-neighbour Heisenberg antiferromagnet which does not order, we identify two new frustrated nets (lcx and thp) that possess finite temperature Heisenberg spin-liquid states with strongly suppressed magnetic ordering and non-collinear ground states. With Ising spins, we identify four new classical spin liquids that do not order down to $T/J = 10^{-2}$. We highlight materials that contain these high symmetry nets, and which could, if substituted with appropriate magnetic ions, potentially host these unusual states. Our systematic survey will guide searches for novel magnetic phases.</description>

      <title>Multifractality and hyperuniformity in quasicrystalline Bose-Hubbard models with and without disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clarifying similarities and differences in physical properties between crystalline and quasicrystalline systems is one of central issues in studying quasicrystals. To contribute to this, we apply multifractal and hyperuniform analyses to nonuniform spatial patterns in the Bose-Hubbard model on the Penrose and Ammann-Beenker tilings. Based on the mean-field approximation, we obtain real-space distributions of boson density and bosonic condensate. In both Mott insulating and superfluid phases, the distributions are hyperuniform. Analyzing the order metric that quantifies the complexity of nonuniform spatial patterns, we find that both quasicrystals show a divergence of the order metric at a phase boundary between the Mott insulating and superfluid phases, in stark contrast to the case of a periodic square lattice. Our results suggest that hyperuniformity is a useful concept to differentiate between crystalline and quasicrystalline bosonic systems. Moreover, we introduce on-site random potentials into these quasicrystalline Bose-Hubbard models, leading to a Bose glass phase. Contrary to the Mott insulating and superfluid phases, we find that the Bose glass phase is multifractal. The same multifractality appears on a Bose glass phase in the periodic square lattice. Therefore, multifractality is common in a Bose glass phase irrespective of the periodicity of systems.</description>

      <title>Phonon-induced renormalization of exchange interactions in metallic 2D magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The presence of spin-polarized charge carriers in metallic magnets provides a mechanism for spin-lattice interactions mediated by electron-phonon coupling. Here, we present a theory of this mechanism used to estimate its effect on the exchange interactions in 2D magnets. Starting from a square lattice model at half filling, we show that the presence of electron-phonon coupling with equilibrium phonon distribution leads to a notable suppression of exchange interactions with temperature. We then apply our approach to the prototypical 2D metallic ferromagnet, Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$, with moderate electron-phonon coupling. We find that the exchange interactions undergo a renormalization, leading to a softening of the magnon modes, and suppression of the Curie temperature by $\sim$10\%. We expect that this effect can be further enhanced in systems with strong electron-phonon coupling, as well as for non-equilibrium distribution of phonons induced by strong laser fields or charge currents.</description>

      <title>High-precision simulation of finite-size thermalizing systems at long times</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To simulate thermalizing systems at long times, the most straightforward approach is to calculate the thermal properties at the corresponding energy. In a quantum many-body system of size $N$, for local observables and many initial states, this approach has an error of $O(1/N)$, which is reminiscent of the finite-size error of the equivalence of ensembles. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient numerical method so that the simulation error is of higher order in $1/N$. This finite-size error scaling is proved by assuming the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Visualizing uniform lattice-scale pair density wave in single-layer FeSe/SrTiO3 films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Typical BCS superconductors are microscopically homogeneous in real space governed by the coherent Cooper pairs with high phase stiffness of superfluid density, which is characterized by a coherence length. However, a periodic oscillation of superconducting order parameter may develop driven by breaking the time-reversal or translational invariance. To date, such modulated orders were specific to each material systems, with a periodicity much larger than the lattice constant. Here we report the direct observation of a uniform lattice-scale pair density wave (PDW) in single-layer FeSe/SrTiO3 films, enforced by peculiar interfacial structure of crystal symmetries breaking. Our spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy unravels a spatial modulation of Cooper-pairing gap within a single unit-cell, depending on inequivalent atomic sites. Prominent periodic variation of superfluid density is visualized via Josephson current by a superconducting tip, indicating a real-space oscillation of phase stiffness. Such a lattice-scale superconducting modulation, which coexists with a larger length scale of PDW order, indicates the lattice-scale variation of both pairing strength and phase stiffness. Our findings provide new insights into the intertwined density-wave orders of quasiparticle character in correlated electronic systems, and provoke future studies on the unconventional paring interaction and phase stiffness in the two-dimensional limit.</description>

      <title>Carrier-induced transition from antiferromagnetic insulator to ferromagnetic metal in the layered phosphide EuZn$_2$P$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: EuZn$_2$P$_2$ was reported to be an insulating antiferromagnet with $T_\mathrm{N}$ of 23.5 K. In this study, single crystals of EuZn$_2$P$_2$ exhibiting metallic behavior and a ferromagnetic order of 72 K ($T_\mathrm{C}$) are successfully synthesized via a salt flux method. The presence of hole carriers induced by the Eu vacancies in the lattice is found to be crucial for the drastic changes in magnetism and electrical transport. The carriers mediate the interlayer ferromagnetic interaction, and the coupling strength is directly related to $T_\mathrm{C}$, as evidenced by the linear dependence of $T_\mathrm{C}$ and the fitted Curie-Weiss temperatures on the Eu-layer distances for ferromagnetic Eu$M_2X_2$ ($M$ = Zn, Cd; $X$ = P, As). The ferromagnetic EuZn$_2$P$_2$ shows conspicuous negative magnetoresistance (MR) near $T_\mathrm{C}$, owing to strong magnetic scattering. The MR behavior is consistent with the Majumdar-Littlewood model, indicating that the MR can be enhanced by decreasing the carrier density. Our findings suggest that Eu$M_2X_2$ has highly tunable magnetism and charge transport, making it a promising material family for potential applications in spintronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Materials that exhibit strongly coupled magnetic order and electronic properties are crucial for both fundamental research and technological applications. However, finding a material that not only shows remarkable magnetoresistive responses but also has an easily tunable ground state remains a challenge. Here, we report successful manipulation of the magnetic and transport properties of EuCd$_2$P$_2$, which is transformed from an A-type antiferromagnet ($T_\mathrm{N}$ = 11 K) exhibiting colossal magnetoresistance into a ferromagnet ($T_\mathrm{C}$ = 47 K) with metallic behavior. The dramatic alteration results from a low hole concentration of $10^{19}$ cm$^{-3}$ induced by changing the growth conditions. Electronic structure and total energy calculations confirm the tunability of magnetism with a small carrier concentration for EuCd$_2$P$_2$. It is feasible to switch between the magnetic states by using field-effect to control the carrier density, thereby changing the magneto-electronic response. The controllable magnetism and electrical transport of EuCd$_2$P$_2$ make it a potential candidate for spintronics.</description>

      <title>Replica symmetry breaking in spin glasses in the replica-free Keldysh formalism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At asymptotically late times ultrametricity can emerge from the persistent slow aging dynamics of the glass phase. We show that this suffices to recover the breaking of replica symmetry in mean-field spin glasses from the late time limit of the time evolution using the Keldysh path integral. This provides an alternative approach to replica symmetry breaking by connecting it rigorously to the dynamic formulation. Stationary spin glasses are thereby understood to spontaneously break thermal symmetry, or the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger relation of a state in global thermal equilibrium. We demonstrate our general statements for the spherical quantum $p$-spin model and the quantum Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model in the presence of transverse and longitudinal fields. In doing so, we also derive their dynamical Ginzburg-Landau effective Keldysh actions starting from microscopic quantum models.</description>

      <title>Electronic Wigner-Molecule Polymeric Chains in Elongated Silicon Quantum Dots and Finite-Length Quantum Wires</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spectral properties of electrons confined in a wire-like quasi-one-dimensional (1D) elongated quantum dot (EQD) coupler between silicon qubits, are investigated with a newly developed valley-augmented unrestricted Hartree-Fock (va-UHF) method, generalized to include the valley degree of freedom treated as an isospin, allowing calculations for a large number of electrons. The lower energy symmetry-broken solutions of the self-consistent generalized Pople-Nesbet equations exhibit, for a confinement that has been modeled after an experimentally fabricated one in silicon, formation of Wigner-molecular polymeric (longitudinal) chains, initiating through charge accumulation at the edges of the finite-length quasi-1D wire. An increasing number of parallel zig-zag chains form as the number of electrons loaded into the confinement is increased, with the formation of newly added chains determined by the strength of the transverse harmonic confinement. The broken-symmetry va-UHF solutions, subsequently augmented by the quantum-mechanically required parity-restoration, go beyond the va-UHF single-determinant solution, predicting formation of entangled Wigner-molecular chains whose charge distributions obliterate the zig-zag organization of the broken-symmetry solutions. The symmetry-restored va-UHF methodology enables systematic investigations of multi-electron complex nano-scale confined structures that could be targeted for future imaging microscopy experiments in silicon and other materials (e.g., 1D domain walls in TMD materials), and quantum information utilization.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the magnetic responses of bilayer graphene from the perspective of the quantum distance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the influence of the quantum geometry on the magnetic responses of quadratic band crossing semimetals. More explicitly, we examine the Landau levels, quantum Hall effect, and magnetic susceptibility of a general two-band Hamiltonian that has fixed isotropic quadratic band dispersion but with tunable quantum geometry, in which the interband coupling is fully characterized by the maximum quantum distance $d_\mathrm{max}$. By continuously tuning $d_\mathrm{max}$ in the range of $0\leq d_\mathrm{max}\leq 1$, we investigate how the magnetic properties of the free electron model with $d_\mathrm{max}=0$ evolve into those of the bilayer graphene with $d_\mathrm{max}=1$. We demonstrate that despite sharing the same energy dispersion $\epsilon(p) =\pm\frac{p^2}{2m}$, the charge carriers in the free electron model and bilayer graphene exhibit entirely distinct Landau levels and quantum Hall responses due to the nontrivial quantum geometry of the wave functions.</description>

Abstract: The thermodynamics and the entanglement properties of two-dimensional conformal field theories ($2$d CFTs) on curved backgrounds are studied. By means of conformal mapping we study the equivalent system on flat space governed by the deformed Hamiltonian, which is a spatial integral of the Hamiltonian density modulated by an enveloping function. Focusing on holographic CFTs, we observe Hawking-Page like phase transition for the thermal and the entanglement entropy as we vary the background metric. We also compute the mutual information to study the information theoretic correlation between parts of the curved spacetime. The gravity dual of 2d CFTs on curved background is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Evidence of 3$d$-4$f$ antiferromagnetic coupling in strain-tuned PrCo$_{0.5}$Ni$_{0.5}$O$_{3-\delta}$ epitaxial films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strong exchange interaction between 3$d$-4$f$ magnetic sublattice in rare-earth perovskites introduces a variety of complex magnetic states hosting fascinating electronic ground states with exotic properties. Especially when it comes to rare-earth nickelate and cobaltite perovskites, tuning their rich magnetic phase diagram and spin-state transitions make them potential candidates for spintronic applications. Here, we report the observation of antiferromagnetic coupling between Pr 4$f$ and Ni/Co 3$d$ magnetic sublattices and its tunability with strain in PrCo$_{0.5}$Ni$_{0.5}$O$_{3-\delta}$ (PCNO) thin films. SQUID magnetization measurements reveal ferromagnetic (FM) ordering around 25 K, followed by a spin glass transition at low temperatures subject to spin reorientation. Competing magnetic interactions arise owing to the 3$d$-4$f$ antiferromagnetic (AFM) coupling between Pr and Co/Ni sublattice as revealed by the X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) at the Pr $M_{4,5}$ and Co/Ni $L_{2,3}$ absorption edges. Strain dependence on these AFM coupling reveals an increase (decrease) in the AFM exchange interaction for tensile (compressive) strained films, leading to a net decrease (increase) in the magnetization of PCNO films at low temperatures. The relative increase in low-temperature negative magnetoresistance for compressively strained films also reflects the enhanced ferromagnetic ordering in the system. The angle-dependent magnetoresistance measurements reveal a two-fold anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) in tensile strained PCNO films. In contrast, temperature-dependent switching of AMR accompanied by a two- to four-fold symmetry crossover is observed for LaAlO$_3$-grown compressive strained films.</description>

      <title>Quantifying fault tolerant simulation of strongly correlated systems using the Fermi-Hubbard model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the physics of strongly correlated materials is one of the grand challenge problems for physics today. A large class of scientifically interesting materials, from high-$T_c$ superconductors to spin liquids, involve medium to strong correlations, and building a holistic understanding of these materials is critical. Doing so is hindered by the competition between the kinetic energy and Coulomb repulsion, which renders both analytic and numerical methods unsatisfactory for describing interacting materials. Fault-tolerant quantum computers have been proposed as a path forward to overcome these difficulties, but this potential capability has not yet been fully assessed. Here, using the multi-orbital Fermi-Hubbard model as a representative model and a source of scalable problem specifications, we estimate the resource costs needed to use fault-tolerant quantum computers for obtaining experimentally relevant quantities such as correlation function estimation. We find that advances in quantum algorithms and hardware will be needed in order to reduce quantum resources and feasibly address utility-scale problem instances.</description>

Abstract: Quantum dissipation arises when a large system can be split in a quantum system and an environment where the energy of the former flows to. Understanding the effect of dissipation on quantum many-body systems is of particular importance due to its potential relations with quantum information processing. We propose a conceptually simple approach to introduce the dissipation into interacting quantum systems in a thermodynamical context, in which every site of a 1d lattice is coupled off-diagonally to its own bath. The interplay between quantum dissipation and interactions gives rise to counterintuitive interpretations such as a compressible zero-temperature state with spontaneous discrete symmetry breaking and a thermal phase transition in a one-dimensional dissipative quantum many-body system as revealed by Quantum Monte Carlo path integral simulations.</description>

Abstract: A fundamental distinction between many-body quantum states are those with short- and long-range entanglement (SRE and LRE). The latter cannot be created by finite-depth circuits, underscoring the nonlocal nature of Schr\"odinger cat states, topological order, and quantum criticality. Remarkably, examples are known where LRE is obtained by performing single-site measurements on SRE, such as the toric code from measuring a sublattice of a 2D cluster state. However, a systematic understanding of when and how measurements of SRE give rise to LRE is still lacking. Here, we establish that LRE appears upon performing measurements on symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases -- of which the cluster state is one example. For instance, we show how to implement the Kramers-Wannier transformation by adding a cluster SPT to an input state followed by measurement. This transformation naturally relates states with SRE and LRE. An application is the realization of double-semion order when the input state is the $\mathbb Z_2$ Levin-Gu SPT. Similarly, the addition of fermionic SPTs and measurement leads to an implementation of the Jordan-Wigner transformation of a general state. More generally, we argue that a large class of SPT phases protected by $G \times H$ symmetry gives rise to anomalous LRE upon measuring $G$-charges, and we prove that this persists for generic points in the SPT phase under certain conditions. Our work introduces a new practical tool for using SPT phases as resources for creating LRE, and uncovers the classification result that all states related by sequentially gauging Abelian groups or by Jordan-Wigner transformation are in the same equivalence class, once we augment finite-depth circuits with single-site measurements. In particular, any topological or fracton order with a solvable finite gauge group can be obtained from a product state in this way.</description>

      <title>Observation of terahertz second harmonic generation from Dirac surface states in the topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.05271v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the observation of second harmonic generation with high conversion efficiency $\sim 0.005\%$ in the terahertz regime from thin films of the topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$ that exhibit the linear photogalvanic effect, measured via time-domain terahertz spectroscopy and terahertz emission, respectively. As neither phenomena is observable from topologically trivial In-doped Bi$_2$Se$_3$, and since no enhancement is observed when subject to band bending, the efficient thickness-independent nonliear responses are attributable to the Dirac fermions of topological surface states of Bi$_2$Se$_3$. This observation of intrinsic terahertz second harmonic generation in an equilibrium system unlocks the full suite of both even and odd harmonic orders in the terahertz regime and opens new pathways to probing quantum geometry via intraband nonlinear processes. We hope our work will motivate the theoretical development of a full treatment of second harmonic generation for probing the quantum geometry in various inversion-breaking topological and twisted materials.</description>

      <title>Symmetry constraints and spectral crossing in a Mott insulator with Green's function zeros</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.13870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lattice symmetries are central to the characterization of electronic topology. Recently, it was shown that Green's function eigenvectors form a representation of the space group. This formulation has allowed the identification of gapless topological states even when quasiparticles are absent. Here we demonstrate the profundity of the framework in the extreme case, when interactions lead to a Mott insulator, through a solvable model with long-range interactions. We find that both Mott poles and zeros are subject to the symmetry constraints, and relate the symmetry-enforced spectral crossings to degeneracies of the original non-interacting eigenstates. Our results lead to new understandings of topological quantum materials and highlight the utility of interacting Green's functions toward their symmetry-based design.</description>

      <title>Primary and Secondary Order Parameters in the Fully Frustrated Transverse Field Ising Model on the Square Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02407v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using quantum Monte Carlo simulations and field-theory arguments, we study the fully frustrated (Villain) transverse-field Ising model on the square lattice. We consider a "primary" spin order parameter and a "secondary" dimer order parameter, which both lead to the same phase diagram but detect $Z_8$ and $Z_4$ symmetry, respectively. The spin order scales with conventional exponents, both in the finite temperature critical phase and at the $T = 0$ quantum critical point. The scaling of the dimer order requires more detailed investigations of the applicable low-energy theories; the height model at $T &gt; 0$ and the $O(2)$ model in 2+1 dimensions at $T = 0$. Relating the order parameters to operators in these effective models, we predict the secondary critical exponents and confirm them numerically. The relationships between the primary and secondary order parameters have not been previously discussed in this context and provide insight more broadly for Ising models whose low-energy physics involves dimer degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Conformal field theory approach to parton fractional quantum Hall trial wave functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that all lowest Landau level projected and unprojected chiral parton type fractional quantum Hall ground and edge state trial wave functions, which take the form of products of integer quantum Hall wave functions, can be expressed as conformal field theory (CFT) correlation functions, where we can associate a chiral algebra to each parton state such that the CFT defined by the algebra is the ``smallest'' such CFT that can generate the corresponding ground and edge state trial wave functions. A field-theoretic generalisation of Laughlin's plasma analogy, known as generalised screening, is formulated for these states. If this holds, we argue that the inner products of edge state trial wave functions, for parton states where the ``densest'' trial wave function is unique, can be expressed as matrix elements of an exponentiated local action operator of the CFT, generalising the result of Dubail et al. [PRB 85, 11531 (2012)], which implies the equality between edge state and entanglement level counting to state counting in the corresponding CFT. We numerically test this result in two specific cases. We discuss how Read's arguments [PRB 79, 045308 (2009)] still apply, implying that conformal blocks of the CFT defined by the corresponding chiral algebra are valid quasi-hole trial wave functions, with the adiabatic braiding statistics given by the monodromy of these functions, assuming the existence of a quasi-particle trapping Hamiltonian. Generalisations of these constructions are discussed. It is shown that all chiral composite fermion wave functions can be expressed as CFT correlation functions without explicit symmetrisation or anti-symmetrisation and that the ground, edge, and certain quasi-hole trial wave functions of the $\phi_n^m$ parton states can be expressed as the conformal blocks of the $U(1) \otimes SU(n)_m$ WZW models.</description>

      <title>Relevant long-range interaction of the entanglement Hamiltonian emerges from a short-range gapped system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16089v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Beyond the Li-Haldane-Poilblanc conjecture, we find the entanglement Hamiltonian (EH) is actually not closely similar to the original Hamiltonian on the virtual edge. Unexpectedly, the EH has some relevant long-range interacting terms which hugely affect the physics. Without loss of generality, we study a spin-1/2 Heisenberg bilayer to obtain the entanglement information between the two layers through our newly developed quantum Monte Carlo scheme, which can simulate large-scale EH. Although the entanglement spectrum carrying the Goldstone mode seems like a Heisenberg model on a single layer, which is consistent with Li-Haldane-Poilblanc conjecture, we demonstrate that there actually exists a finite-temperature phase transition of the EH. The results violate the Mermin-Wagner theorem, which means there should be relevant long-range terms in the EH. It reveals that the Li-Haldane-Poilblanc conjecture ignores necessary corrections for the EH which may lead totally different physics.</description>

Abstract: A formalism based on the fermionic functional-renormalization-group approach to interacting electron models defined on a lattice is presented. One-loop flow equations for the coupling constants and susceptibilities in the particle-particle and particle-hole channels are derived in weak-coupling conditions. It is shown that lattice effects manifest themselves through the curvature of the spectrum and the dependence of the coupling constants on momenta. This method is then applied to the one-dimensional extended Hubbard model; we thoroughly discuss the evolution of the phase diagram, and in particular the fate of the bond-centered charge-density-wave phase, as the system is doped away from half-filling. Our findings are compared to the predictions of the field-theory continuum limit and available numerical results.</description>

      <title>Unveiling UV/IR Mixing via Symmetry Defects: A View from Topological Entanglement Entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some topological lattice models in two spatial dimensions exhibit intricate lattice size dependence in their ground state degeneracy (GSD). This and other features such as the position-dependent anyonic excitations are manifestations of UV/IR mixing. In the first part of the paper we exactly calculate the topological entanglement entropy (TEE) of one such model, the rank-2 toric code, after identifying the minimum entropy states for a non-contractible boundary around the torus. The resulting TEE, as with the GSD, shows intricate dependence on the lattice size. In the latter part of the paper we focus on the fact that the rank-2 toric code is an example of a translation symmetry-enriched topological phase, and show that viewing distinct lattice size as a consequence of different translation symmetry defects can explain both our TEE results and the GSD of the rank-2 toric code. Our work establishes the translation symmetry defect framework as a robust description of the UV/IR mixing in topological lattice models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01967v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay of frustrated interactions and lattice geometry can lead to a variety of exotic quantum phases. Here we unearth a particularly rich phase diagram of the Kitaev-Heisenberg model on the star lattice, a triangle decorated honeycomb lattice breaking sublattice symmetry. In the antiferromagnetic regime, the interplay of Heisenberg coupling and geometric frustration leads to the formation of valence bond solid (VBS) phases -- a singlet VBS and a bond selective triplet VBS stabilized by the Kitaev exchange. We show that the ratio of the Kitaev versus Heisenberg exchange tunes between these VBS phases and chiral quantum spin liquid regimes. Remarkably, the VBS phases host a whole variety of chiral triplon excitations with high Chern numbers in the presence of a weak magnetic field. We discuss our results in light of a recently synthesized star lattice material and other decorated lattice systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By virtue of being atomically thin, the electronic properties of heterostructures built from two-dimensional materials are strongly influenced by atomic relaxation. The atomic layers behave as flexible membranes rather than rigid crystals. Here we develop an analytical theory of lattice relaxation in twisted moir\'e materials. We obtain analytical results for the lattice displacements and corresponding pseudo gauge fields, as a function of twist angle. We benchmark our results for twisted bilayer graphene and twisted WSe$_2$ bilayers using large-scale molecular dynamics simulations. Our theory is valid in graphene bilayers for twist angles $\theta \gtrsim 1^\circ$, and in twisted transition metal dichalcogenides for $\theta \gtrsim 4^\circ$. We also investigate how relaxation alters the electronic structure in twisted bilayer graphene, providing a simple extension to the continuum model to account for lattice relaxation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17352v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Geometric fluctuations of the density mode in a fractional quantum Hall (FQH) state can give rise to a nematic FQH phase, a topological state with a spontaneously broken rotational symmetry. While experiments on FQH states in the second Landau level have reported signatures of putative FQH nematics in anisotropic transport, a realistic model for this state has been lacking. We show that the standard model of particles in the lowest Landau level interacting via the Coulomb potential realizes the FQH nematic transition, which is reached by a progressive reduction of the strength of the shortest-range Haldane pseudopotential. Using exact diagonalization and variational wave functions, we demonstrate that the FQH nematic transition occurs when the system's neutral gap closes in the long-wavelength limit while the charge gap remains open. We confirm the symmetry-breaking nature of the transition by demonstrating the existence of a "circular moat" potential in the manifold of states with broken rotational symmetry, while its geometric character is revealed through the strong fluctuations of the nematic susceptibility and Hall viscosity.</description>

      <title>Quantum robustness of the toric code in a parallel field on the honeycomb and triangular lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15389v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum robustness of the topological order in the toric code on the honeycomb lattice in the presence of a uniform parallel field. For a field in $z$-direction, the low-energy physics is in the flux-free sector and can be mapped to the transverse-field Ising model on the honeycomb lattice. One finds a second-order quantum phase transition in the 3D Ising$^\star$ universality class for both signs of the field. The same is true for a postive field in $x$-direction where an analogue mapping in the charge-free sector yields a ferromagnetic transverse-field Ising model on the triangular lattice and the phase transition is still 3D Ising$^\star$. In contrast, for negative $x$-field, the charge-free sector is mapped to the highly frustrated antiferromagnetic transverse-field Ising model on the triangular lattice which is known to host a quantum phase transition in the 3D XY$^\star$ universality class. Further, the charge-free sector does not always contain the low-energy physics for negative $x$-fields and a first-order phase transition to the polarized phase in the charge-full sector takes place at larger negative field values. We quantify the location of this transition by comparing quantum Monte Carlo simulations and high-field series expansions. The full extension of the topological phase in the presence of $x$- and $z$-fields is determined by perturbative linked-cluster expansions using a full graph decomposition. Extrapolating the high-order series of the charge and the flux gap allows to estimate critical exponents of the gap closing. This analysis indicates that the topological order breaks down by critical lines of 3D Ising$^\star$ and 3D XY$^\star$ type with interesting potential multi-critical crossing points. All findings for the toric code on the honeycomb lattice can be transferred exactly to the toric code on the triangular lattice.</description>

Abstract: Akali superoxides AO2 (A=Na, K, Rb, Cs), due to an open p shell of the oxygen ion O2^- with degenerate pi orbitals, have spin and orbital degrees of freedom. The complex magnetic, orbital, and structural phase transitions observed experimentally in this family of materials are only partially understood. Based on density functional theory, we derive a strong-coupling effective model for the isostructural compounds AO2 (A=K, Rb, Cs) from a two-orbital Hubbard model. We find that CsO2 has highly frustrated exchange interactions in the a-b plane, while the frustration is weaker for RbO2 and KO2. We solve the resulting Kugel-Khomskii model in the mean-field approximation. We show that CsO2 exhibits an antiferro-orbital (AFO) order with the ordering vector q=(1,0,0) and a stripe antiferromagnetic order with q=(1/2,0,0), which is consistent with recent neutron scattering experiments. We discuss the role of the pi-orbital degrees of freedom for the experimentally observed magnetic transitions and interpret the as-yet-unidentified T_s2=70K transition in CsO2 as an orbital ordering transition.</description>

      <title>Dirac spin liquid as an "unnecessary" quantum critical point on square lattice antiferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum spin liquids are exotic phases of quantum matter especially pertinent to many modern condensed matter systems. Dirac spin liquids (DSLs) are a class of gapless quantum spin liquids that do not have a quasi-particle description and are potentially realized in a wide variety of spin $1/2$ magnetic systems on $2d$ lattices. In particular, the DSL in square lattice spin-$1/2$ magnets is described at low energies by $(2+1)d$ quantum electrodynamics with $N_f=4$ flavors of massless Dirac fermions minimally coupled to an emergent $U(1)$ gauge field. The existence of a relevant, symmetry-allowed monopole perturbation renders the DSL on the square lattice intrinsically unstable. We argue that the DSL describes a stable continuous phase transition within the familiar Neel phase (or within the Valence Bond Solid (VBS) phase). In other words, the DSL is an "unnecessary" quantum critical point within a single phase of matter. Our result offers a novel view of the square lattice DSL in that the critical spin liquid can exist within either the Neel or VBS state itself, and does not require leaving these conventional states.</description>

      <title>Fractionalization of Coset Non-Invertible Symmetry and Exotic Hall Conductance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate fractionalization of non-invertible symmetry in (2+1)D topological orders. We focus on coset non-invertible symmetries obtained by gauging non-normal subgroups of invertible $0$-form symmetries. These symmetries can arise as global symmetries in quantum spin liquids, given by the quotient of the projective symmetry group by a non-normal subgroup as invariant gauge group. We point out that such coset non-invertible symmetries in topological orders can exhibit symmetry fractionalization: each anyon can carry a "fractional charge" under the coset non-invertible symmetry given by a gauge invariant superposition of fractional quantum numbers. We present various examples using field theories and quantum double lattice models, such as fractional quantum Hall systems with charge conjugation symmetry gauged and finite group gauge theory from gauging a non-normal subgroup. They include symmetry enriched $S_3$ and $O(2)$ gauge theories. We show that such systems have a fractionalized continuous non-invertible coset symmetry and a well-defined electric Hall conductance. The coset symmetry enforces a gapless edge state if the boundary preserves the continuous non-invertible symmetry. We propose a general approach for constructing coset symmetry defects using a "sandwich" construction: non-invertible symmetry defects can generally be constructed from an invertible defect sandwiched by condensation defects. The anomaly free condition for finite coset symmetry is also identified.</description>

Abstract: Effective Lagrangian of itinerant electron system of finite density at finite magnetic field is found to include Chern-Simons term of electromagnetic potentials of lower scale dimension than those studied before. This term has an origin in many-body wave function and unique topological property that is independent of a spin degree of freedom. The coupling strength is proportional to $\frac{\rho}{eB}$, which is singular at $B=0$ for a constant charge density. The effective Lagrangian at a finite $B$ represents physical effects at $ B \neq 0$ properly. A universal shift of the magnetic field known as Slater-Pauling curve is derived from the effective Lagrangian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06036v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: During time evolution of many-body systems entanglement grows rapidly, limiting exact simulations to small-scale systems or small timescales. Quantum information tends however to flow towards larger scales without returning to local scales, such that its detailed large-scale structure does not directly affect local observables. This allows for the removal of large-scale quantum information in a way that preserves all local observables and gives access to large-scale and large-time quantum dynamics. To this end, we use the recently introduced information lattice to organize quantum information into different scales, allowing us to define local information and information currents which we employ to systematically discard long-range quantum correlations in a controlled way. Our approach relies on decomposing the system into subsystems up to a maximum scale and time evolving the subsystem density matrices by solving the subsystem von Neumann equations in parallel. Importantly, the information flow needs to be preserved during the discarding of large-scale information. To achieve this without the need to make assumptions about the microscopic details of the information current, we introduce a second scale at which information is discarded while using the state at the maximum scale to accurately obtain the information flow. The resulting algorithm, which we call local information time evolution (LITE), is highly versatile and suitable for investigating many-body quantum dynamics in both closed and open quantum systems with diverse hydrodynamic behaviors. We present results for energy transport in the mixed-field Ising model and magnetization transport in an open XX spin chain where we accurately determine the diffusion coefficients. The information lattice framework employed here promises to offer insightful results about the spatial and temporal behavior of entanglement in many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Size Winding Mechanism beyond Maximal Chaos</title>

Abstract: The concept of information scrambling elucidates the dispersion of local information in quantum many-body systems, offering insights into various physical phenomena such as wormhole teleportation. This phenomenon has spurred extensive theoretical and experimental investigations. Among these, the size-winding mechanism emerges as a valuable diagnostic tool for optimizing signal detection. In this work, we establish a computational framework for determining the winding size distribution in large-$N$ quantum systems with all-to-all interactions, utilizing the scramblon effective theory. We obtain the winding size distribution for the large-$q$ SYK model across the entire time domain. Notably, we unveil that the manifestation of size winding results from a universal phase factor in the scramblon propagator, highlighting the significance of the Lyapunov exponent. These findings contribute to a sharp and precise connection between operator dynamics and the phenomenon of wormhole teleportation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Theory of Phonon Induced Anomalous Hall Effect in 2D Massive Dirac metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The phonon induced anomalous Hall or thermal Hall effects have been observed in various systems in recent experiments. However, the theoretical studies on this subject are very scarce and incomplete. In this work, we present a systematic quantum field theory study on the phonon induced anomalous Hall effect, including both the side jump and skew scattering contributions, in a 2D massive Dirac metal, which is considered as the minimum anomalous Hall system. We reveal significant difference from the anomalous Hall effect induced by the widely studied Gaussian disorder which is known to be insensitive to temperature. While the anomalous Hall effect induced by phonon approaches that by Gaussian disorder at high temperature, it behaves very differently at low temperature. Our work provides a microscopic and quantitative description of the crossover from the low to high temperature regime of the phonon induced anomalous Hall conductivity, which may be observed in 2D Dirac metals with breaking time reversal symmetry.</description>

      <title>Defect Fusion and Casimir Energy in Higher Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05815v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the operator algebra of extended conformal defects in more than two spacetime dimensions. Such algebra structure encodes the combined effect of multiple impurities on physical observables at long distances as well as the interactions among the impurities. These features are formalized by a fusion product which we define for a pair of defects, after isolating divergences that capture the effective potential between the defects, which generalizes the usual Casimir energy. We discuss general properties of the corresponding fusion algebra and contrast with the more familiar cases that involve topological defects. We also describe the relation to a different defect setup in the shape of a wedge. We provide explicit examples to illustrate these properties using line defects and interfaces in the Wilson-Fisher CFT and the Gross-Neveu(-Yukawa) CFT and determine the defect fusion data thereof.</description>

      <title>Schwinger-Keldysh nonequilibrium quantum field theory of open quantum systems beyond the Markovian regime: Application to the spin-boson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a Schwinger-Keldysh field theory (SKFT) for open quantum systems interacting with a dissipative environment and apply it to the spin-boson model as an archetypical example where the environment is composed of a bosonic bath. Prior SKFT developments of this type have been confined to the Markovian regime, as an alternative to a conventional description by the Lindblad quantum master equation (QME) which is a time-local matrix differential equation. Here we combine SKFT with a two-particle irreducible (2PI) action that resums a class of Feynman diagrams to infinite order. We obtain the time-evolution of the spin density matrix in the form of a system of integro-differential equations applicable to both Markovian and non-Markovian regimes. The latter regime--where taking into account memory effects becomes essential--poses a challenge for standard methods when trying to incorporate arbitrary properties of the system, bath, and length of time evolution. The SKFT+2PI-computed time evolution of the spin expectation values in the Markovian regime reproduces the solution of the Lindblad QME, as long as the system-bath coupling in the latter is adjusted by increasing it. In the non-Markovian regime, SKFT+2PI yields a nonperturbative solution that mimics results from both hierarchical equations of motion and tensor networks methods that we employ as benchmarks. Our SKFT+2PI approach can also access challenging cases, such as zero-temperature and sub-Ohmic bath, as well as arbitrary long evolution times. Taking into account favorable numerical cost of solving the integro-differential equations with increasing number of spins, time steps or dimensionality the SKFT+2PI approach offers a promising route for simulation of driven-dissipative systems in quantum computing or quantum magnonics and spintronics in the presence of a variety of (single or multiple) dissipative environments.</description>

      <title>Constructing vortex functions and basis states of Chern insulators: ideal condition, inequality from index theorem, and coherent-like states on von Neumann lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the field of fractional Chern insulators, a great deal of effort has been devoted to characterizing Chern bands that exhibit properties similar to the Landau levels. Among them, the concept of the vortex function, which generalizes the complex coordinate used for the symmetric-gauge Landau-level basis, allows for a concise description. In this paper, we develop a theory of constructing the vortex function and basis states of Chern insulators in the tight-binding formalism. In the first half, we consider the optimization process of the vortex function, which minimizes an indicator that measures the difference from the ideal Chern insulators. In particular, we focus on the sublattice position dependence of the vortex function or the quantum geometric tensor. This degree of freedom serves as a discrete analog of the non-uniformity in the spatial metric and magnetic field in a continuous model. In the second half, we construct two types of basis sets for a given vortex function: radially localized basis set and coherent-like basis set. The former basis set is defined as the eigenstates of an analogy of the angular momentum operator. Remarkably, one can always find exact zero mode(s) for this operator, which is explained by the celebrated Atiyah-Singer index theorem. As a byproduct, we propose an inequality rooted in the band topology. We also discuss the subtle differences between our formalism and the previous works about the momentum-space Landau level. The latter basis set generalizes the concept of coherent states on von Neumann lattice. While this basis set is not orthogonal, it is useful to compare the LLL and the given Chern insulator directly in the Brillouin zone. These basis sets are expected to be useful for many-body calculations of fractional Chern insulators.</description>

      <title>Effective Field Theory of Conformal Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an effective field theory (EFT) for conformal impurity by considering a pair of transversely displaced impurities and integrating out modes with mass inversely proportional to the separation distance. This EFT captures the universal signature of the impurity seen by a heavy local operator. We focus on the case of conformal boundaries and derive universal formulas from this EFT for the boundary structure constants at high energy. We point out that the more familiar thermal EFT for conformal field theory is a special case of this EFT with distinguished conformal boundaries. We also derive, for general conformal impurities, non-positivity and convexity-like constraints on the Casimir energy which determines the leading EFT coefficient.</description>
