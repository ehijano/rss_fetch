      <title>Active compensation of the AC Stark shift in a two-photon rubidium optical frequency reference using power modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We implement a feedback protocol to suppress the AC Stark shift in a two-photon rubidium optical frequency reference, reducing its sensitivity to optical power variations by a factor of 1000. This method alleviates the tradeoff between short-term and long-term stability imposed by the AC Stark shift, enabling us to simultaneously achieve instabilities of $3\times10^{-14}$ at 1 s and $2\times10^{-14}$ at $10^4$ s. We also quantitatively describe, and experimentally explore, a stability limit imposed on clocks using this method by frequency noise on the local oscillator.</description>

      <title>Broadband Reflective Elastic Mode Conversion Enabled by a Single Row of Inclined Long-Slits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Broadband longitudinal-to-transverse mode conversion under normal incidence remains difficult to achieve, especially with structurally simple designs. Numerical simulations show that a single periodic row of inclined long-slits near a free surface enables high-efficiency broadband conversion, where the conversion rate exceeds 0.8 across a normalized-frequency range of 0.27 to 0.74, corresponding to a 93.1% relative bandwidth. The broadband response originates from two intrinsic deformation modes of the mass blocks between adjacent inclined slits: a rotational mode and a quadrupole mode. The spectral overlap of these two modes sustains a continuous high-efficiency band. The effect is robust against geometric variations, demonstrating that geometric asymmetry alone offers a minimal yet effective route to broadband elastic-wave mode conversion.</description>

      <title>Urban Buildings Energy Consumption Estimation Using HPC: A Case Study of Bologna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Urban Building Energy Modeling (UBEM) plays a central role in understanding and forecasting energy consumption at the city scale. In this work, we present a UBEM pipeline that integrates EnergyPlus simulations, high-performance computing (HPC), and open geospatial datasets to estimate the energy demand of buildings in Bologna, Italy. Geometric information including building footprints and heights was obtained from the Bologna Open Data portal and enhanced with aerial LiDAR measurements. Non-geometric attributes such as construction materials, insulation characteristics, and window performance were derived from regional building regulations and the European TABULA database. The computation was carried out on Leonardo, the Cineca-hosted supercomputer, enabling the simulation of approximately 25,000 buildings in under 30 minutes.</description>

      <title>Designing Space-Time Metamaterials: The Central Role of Dispersion Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space-time metamaterials are redefining wave engineering by enabling fully dynamic four-dimensional control of electromagnetic fields, allowing simultaneous manipulation of frequency, amplitude, momentum, and propagation direction. This unified functionality moves well beyond reciprocity-breaking mechanisms, marking a fundamental transition from static media to polychromatic, energy-efficient wave processors. This article establishes dispersion engineering as the core design paradigm for these dynamic systems. We show that the dispersion relation, linking frequency and wavenumber, serves as a master blueprint governing exotic wave phenomena such as nonreciprocity, beam splitting, asymmetric frequency conversion, amplification, spatial decomposition, and momentum bandgaps. By analyzing analytical dispersion surfaces and isofrequency contours in subluminal, luminal, and superluminal modulation regimes, we reveal how tailored spatiotemporal modulation orchestrates controlled energy flow among harmonic modes. We further demonstrate how this framework directly informs practical device operation, highlighting advanced implementations including angular-frequency beam multiplexing in superconducting Josephson junction arrays. Combining insights from wave theory, numerical modeling, and experimental realization, this work provides a comprehensive roadmap for leveraging dispersion engineering to design next-generation metamaterials for wireless communication, quantum technologies, and integrated photonics.</description>

      <title>Perfectly Matched Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19545v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fully harnessing the vast design space enabled by metamaterials to control electromagnetic (EM) fields remains an open problem for researchers. Inverse-design techniques have shown to best exploit the degrees of freedom available in design, resulting in high-performing systems for wireless communications, sensing and analog signal processing. Nonetheless, fundamental yet powerful properties of metamaterials are still to be revealed. In this paper, we introduce the concept of Perfectly Matched Metamaterials (PMMs). PMMs are passive, inhomogeneous media that perform purely refractive field transformations under different excitations. Their advantage lies in their simplicity, reflectionless behavior and suitability for both analytical and numerical design methods. Unlike Transformation Optics, PMM-based designs are devoid of coordinate transformations. Anisotropic unit cells are configured to control EM fields in a true-time delay manner. Simple analytical designs are reported which demonstrate the broadband capability of PMM devices. Proposed PMMs may find application in wideband beamforming and analog computing, realizing functionalities such as spatial filtering and signal pre-processing.</description>

      <title>Techno economic feasibility study of solar ORC in India</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar energy has enormous potential because there is a worldwide need to meet energy demands. Depleting non-renewable energy resources, increasing carbon emissions, and other environmental effects concern the scientific community to develop an alternative approach to electricity production. In this article, we present the study of a solar-powered Organic Rankine cycle considering Indian climatic conditions. Initially, we scrutinized seven working fluids and assessed their performance in the ORC at an evaporator pressure range of 9-30 bar and a mass flow rate range of 0.2 kg/s to 4.5 kg/s. For a fixed sink temperature of 298 K, we evaluate the system using four different power ratings of 2, 20, 50, and 100 kW based on four different source temperatures of 423 K, 403 K, 383 K, and 363 K. We estimate the system cost for each working fluid in each scenario separately. Our findings suggest that R 1233zd(E) is the optimum performing working fluid based on cost, cost-effectiveness, and environmental friendliness. We also notice that the estimated system scale cost is very competitive and could be a great alternative to the technologies already on the Indian market.</description>

      <title>High-pressure melting and elastic behavior of vanadium and niobium based on ab initio and machine learning molecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Under high pressure, the group-VB transition metals vanadium (V) and niobium (Nb) exhibit simple crystal structures but complex physical behaviors, such as anomalous compression-induced softening and heating-induced hardening (CISHIH). Meanwhile, the impact of lattice thermal expansion-induced softening at elevated temperatures on HIH is yet to be investigated. Therefore, this study utilized ab initio (AIMD) and machine learning molecular dynamics (MLMD) to investigate the melting and abnormal mechanical softening-hardening behaviors of V and Nb under high pressure. Simulations reveal that the high-temperature Pnma phase of Nb reported in previous experimental studies is highly susceptible to mechanical instability and reverts to the body-centered cubic (BCC) phase. This discovery prompted a revised determination of the high-pressure melting line of Nb. The melting temperature of Nb significantly exceeds the existing theoretical and experimental estimate compared with that of V. AIMD simulations demonstrate that atomic thermal displacements have a greater influence on the HIH of V and Nb than pure electron temperature effects. In addition, the temperature-dependent anomalous elastic properties of V and Nb were investigated within a pressure range of 0-250 GPa using MLMD. The mechanical properties of V and Nb transitioned from HIH to heating-induced softening, elucidating the competition between thermal-expansion-induced softening and HIH. This study advances fundamental understanding of V and Nb physics, providing crucial theoretical foundations for establishing accurate equations of state and constitutive models for these metals.</description>

      <title>Planar Josephson junctions for sensors and electronics:Different geometry, new functionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Josephson junctions are key elements in superconducting electronics. The most common type is the overlap (sandwich-type) junction, formed by vertically stacking two superconducting layers. In contrast, planar junctions are fabricated without overlap, at the edge of two superconducting films within a single plane. This geometric distinction has a significant impact on their physical properties. The planar geometry greatly enhances sensitivity to magnetic fields and improves impedance matching for terahertz (THz) devices. Its two-dimensional structure allows for simple and flexible electronic component design, enabling drastic miniaturization. Here I highlight recent advances in the application of planar junctions for novel technologies, including junction-on-cantilever sensors for super-resolution magnetic imaging, vortex-based memory cells, and programmable superconducting diodes. I will also discuss the general requirements, future perspectives, and key challenges in the evolving field of superconducting electronics.</description>

      <title>Optical excitation of bulk plasmons in n-doped InAsSb thin films : investigating the second viscosity in electron gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that including the second viscosity of an electron gas in the hydrodynamic model allows for highly accurate modeling of the optical response of heavily doped semiconductors. In our setup, which improves resonance visibility compared to previous approaches, plasmon resonances become more distinct, allowing for a detailed analysis of the underlying physics. With advanced fitting techniques based on a physics-informed cost function and a tailored optimization algorithm, we obtain a close agreement between simulations and experimental data across different sample thicknesses. This enhanced resonance visibility, combined with our integrated approach, shows that key parameters such as doping level and effective electron mass, as well as the second viscosity of the electron gas, can be retrieved from a single optical measurement. The spatial dispersion taken into account in the hydrodynamic framework is essential for accurately describing the optical response of plasmonic materials in this frequency range and is likely to become a standard modeling approach.</description>

      <title>Cavity-QED Simulation of a Maser beyond the Mean-Field Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the well-known Tavis-Cummings (TC) model of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED), we introduce a method for quantum-mechanically simulating the dynamics of experimental masers beyond the mean-field approximation (MFA) that takes into account the spatial variation of the a.c. magnetic field of the maser's amplified microwave mode across its gain medium. The distribution in the coupling between the amplified mode and the medium's very large number (typically $10^{17}$) of spatially distributed quantum emitters can be determined straightforwardly for a given geometry and composition using an electromagnetic-field solver. Upon discretising this distribution as a histogram over a small finite number of bins, we assign -- as an approximation -- the same coupling to all emitters that fall within the same bin, where the value of this coupling equals the center value of the bin's range. With our approximate Hamiltonian arranged as a weighted sum over these bins, we generate expressions for expectation values of operators in the Heisenberg picture to second order in cumulant expansion, using the publicly available QuantumCumulants.jl package in Julia. For ten evenly spaced bins, our model, which can be run on a laptop computer, is used to simulate the recorded output from an experimental maser with a pentacene-doped para-terphenyl gain medium. We find that it replicates the quantum-mechanical features of the measured maser's dynamics, in particular its damped collective Rabi oscillations, more closely than the standard TC model under the MFA can, with an $R^2$ value of 0.774, as opposed to 0.265. Our model should thus aid the quantitative engineering of improved, optimised maser designs.</description>

      <title>Optically-Trapped Particle Tracking Velocimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a microflow velocimetry based on particle tracking with the aid of the optical trapping of tracers, namely, optically-trapped particle tracking velocimetry (ot-PTV). The ot-PTV has two phases: a trap phase, in which individual tracers are trapped by an optical force and held at a measurement position; a release phase, in which the tracer is released and advected by the fluid flow, without interference from the optical force. The released tracer is subsequently trapped again by the optical force. By repeating the set of trap and release phases, we can accumulate the sequential images of the tracer that have the same initial position. The advantages of ot-PTV are that (i) the measurement positions can be chosen by experimenters and (ii) the effect of statistical noise inherent in the Brownian motion of small tracers can be evaluated quantitatively. These features are useful for the analysis of extremely slow microflows, such as near-wall creeping flows, and the flows under some external effects acting on tracers, such as thermally-induced microflows. The concept of ot-PTV is validated using a benchmark experiment, i.e., a pressure-driven flow in a straight microchannel with a square cross-section. An application to thermally-induced microflows is also demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Mesoscale tissue properties and electric fields in brain stimulation -- bridging the macroscopic and microscopic scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate simulations of electric fields (E-fields) in brain stimulation depend on tissue conductivity representations that link macroscopic assumptions with underlying microscopic tissue structure. Mesoscale conductivity variations can produce meaningful changes in E-fields and neural activation thresholds but remain largely absent from standard macroscopic models. Recent microscopic models have suggested substantial local E-field perturbations and could, in principle, inform mesoscale conductivity. However, the quantitative validity of microscopic models is limited by fixation-related tissue distortion and incomplete extracellular-space reconstruction. We outline approaches that bridge macro- and microscales to derive consistent mesoscale conductivity distributions, providing a foundation for accurate multiscale models of E-fields and neural activation in brain stimulation.</description>
