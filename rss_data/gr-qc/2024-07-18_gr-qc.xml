      <title>Complex structures of boson stars and anisotropic distribution of satellite galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct and explore the complex structures of boson stars, drawing inspiration from similar configurations of non-topological solitons in Minkowski space. These "molecular states" of boson stars have a multipolar structure and both positive and negative Noether charges within one star, and the opposite charges swap with time. Thanks to the gravitational attraction, they exist even in the case of a free scalar field. We also explore the effects of scalar self-interactions on these complex structures. We propose to use galactic-scale charge-swapping boson stars as a potential solution to the problem of the observed anisotropic distribution of satellite galaxies.</description>

      <title>Black holes in effective loop quantum gravity: Covariant holonomy modifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emergent modified gravity provides a covariant, effective framework for obtaining spherically symmetric black hole solutions in models of loop quantum gravity with scale-dependent holonomy modifications. Exact solutions for vacuum black holes in the presence of a cosmological constant are derived here and analyzed in four different gauges, explicitly related to one another by standard coordinate transformations. The global structure is obtained by gluing space-time regions corresponding to the gauge choices, reconstructing a non-singular wormhole space-time for an arbitrary scale-dependent holonomy parameter. This outcome demonstrates the robustness of black-hole models with covariant holonomy modifications under quantization ambiguities. Compared with previous constructions, full covariance of the resulting space-time models as derived here implies subtle new effects and leads to a novel understanding of the parameters in holonomy modifications, distinguishing a constant holonomy length from a possibly scale-dependent function that may change coefficients of holonomy terms. New physical results are obtained for instance in the context of a non-trivial zero-mass limit of holonomy-modified space-times. The existence of a consistent effective space-time structure implies various novel aspects of a net gravitational stress-energy and related thermodynamical properties.</description>

      <title>On the stability of electrovacuum space-times in scalar-tensor gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the behavior of static, spherically symmetric solutions to the field equations of the scalar-tensor theories (STT) of gravity belonging to the Bergmann-Wagoner-Nordtvedt class, in the presence of an electric and/or magnetic charge. The study is restricted to canonical (nonphantom) versions of the theories and scalar fields without a self-interaction potential. Only radial (monopole) perturbations are considered as the most likely ones to cause an instability. The static background solutions contain naked singularities, but we formulate the boundary conditions in such a way that would preserve their meaning if a singularity is smoothed, for example, due to quantum gravity effects. Since the solutions of all STT under study are related by conformal transformations, the stability problem for all of them reduces to the same wave equation, but the boundary conditions for perturbations are different in different STT, which affects the stability results. The stability or instability conclusions are obtained for different branches of the solutions in the Brans-Dicke, Barker and Schwinger STT as well as for nonminimally coupled scalar fields with an arbitrary parameter $\xi$ in the GR framework.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Theories after GW170817</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study the inflationary framework of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theories which produce a primordial gravitational wave speed that respects the constraint imposed by the GW170817 event, namely $\left| c_T^2 - 1 \right| &lt; 6 \times 10^{-15}$ in natural units. For these theories in general, the scalar Gauss-Bonnet coupling function $\xi (\phi)$ is arbitrary and unrelated to the scalar potential. We develop the inflationary formalism of this theory, and present analytic forms for the slow-roll indices, the observational indices and the $e$-foldings number, assuming solely a slow-roll era and also that the constraints imposed by the GW170817 event hold true. We present in detail an interesting class of models that produces a viable inflationary era. Finally, we investigate the behavior of the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet coupling function during the reheating era, in which case the evolution of the Hubble rate satisfies a constant-roll-like relation $\dot{H}=\delta H^2$. As we show, the behavior of the scalar Gauss-Bonnet coupling during the reheating is different from that of the inflationary era. This is due to the fact that the evolution governing the reheating is different compared to the inflationary era.</description>

      <title>Cosmological constraints on dynamical dark energy model in $F(Q)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extended teleparallel gravity, characterized by $F(Q)$ function where $Q$ is the non-metricity scalar, is one of the most promising approaches to general relativity. In this paper, we reexamine a specific dynamical dark energy model, which is indistinguishable from the $\Lambda$CDM model at present time and exhibits a special event in the future, within $F(Q)$ gravity. To constrain the free parameters of the model, we perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, using the last data from Pantheon$^{+}$ and the latest measurements of the H(z) parameter combined. On the basis of this analysis, we have find that our dynamical dark energy model, in the context of F(Q) gravity, lies in the quintessence regime rather than in the phantom regime as in the case of general relativity. Furthermore, this behaviour affects the future expansion of the Universe as it becomes decelerating at $1\sigma$ confidence level for $z&lt;-0.5$ and showing a bounce at $z_{\text{B}}\approx -0.835$. Finally, we have support our conclusion with a cosmographic analysis.</description>

      <title>Charged Particles Capture Cross-Section by a Weakly Charged Schwarzschild Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the capture cross-section of charged particles by a weakly charged Schwarzschild black hole. The dependence of the maximum impact parameter for capture on the particle's energy is investigated numerically for different values of the electromagnetic coupling strength between the particle and the black hole. The capture cross-section is then calculated. We show that the capture cross-section is independent of the electromagnetic coupling for ultra-relativistic particles. The astrophysical implications of our results are discussed.</description>

      <title>Forecast Analysis of Astrophysical Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background beyond general relativity: A Case Study on Brans-Dicke Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalar-tensor gravity, exemplified by Brans-Dicke (BD) gravity, introduces additional scalar polarization modes that contribute scalar radiation alongside tensor modes. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of how gravitational wave generation and propagation effects under Brans-Dicke gravity are encoded into the astrophysical stochastic gravitational wave background (AGWB). We perform end-to-end analyses of realistic populations of simulated coalescing binary systems to generate AGWB mock data with third-generation gravitational wave detectors and conducted a complete Bayesian analysis for the first time. We find the uncertainties in the population properties of binary black holes (BBH) significantly affect the ability to constrain BD gravity. Under the most favorable conditions, the upper limit may suggest $\omega_{\rm BD} &gt; 816$. Furthermore, we explore the detectability of potential scalar backgrounds arising from binary neutron star (BNS) mergers, setting upper limits on scalar backgrounds expected to be two orders of magnitude lower than the total background contributed by both BBH and BNS in one year of observational data. We conclude that for ambiguous populations, employing waveform matching with individual sources provides a more robust approach to constrain Brans-Dicke gravity. However, the future detection of a potential scalar background within the AGWB could provide significant support for gravity theories beyond General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Modified gravity in the presence of matter creation in the late Universe: alleviation of the Hubble tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a dynamic scenario for characterizing the late Universe evolution, aiming to mitigate the Hubble tension. Specifically, we consider a metric $f(R)$ gravity in the Jordan frame which is implemented to the dynamics of a flat isotropic Universe. This cosmological model incorporates a matter creation process due to the time variation of the cosmological gravitational field. We model particle creation by representing the isotropic Universe (specifically, a given fiducial volume) as an open thermodynamic system. The resulting dynamical model involves four unknowns: the Hubble parameter, the non-minimally coupled scalar field, its potential, and the energy density of the matter component. We impose suitable conditions to derive a closed system for these functions of the redshift. In this model, the vacuum energy density of the present Universe is determined by the scalar field potential, in line with the modified gravity scenario. Hence, we construct a viable model, determining the form of the $f(R)$ theory a posteriori and appropriately constraining the phenomenological parameters of the matter creation process to eliminate tachyon modes. Finally, by analyzing the allowed parameter space, we demonstrate that the Planck evolution of the Hubble parameter can be reconciled with the late Universe dynamics, thus alleviating the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Affine Connection and Quantum Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a few recent manuscripts, we used the affine connection to introduce two massless scalar fields in the Einstein-Palatini action. These fields lead to non-metricity. In this article, we will discuss the significance of these fields in inflation and dark energy. We will construct a Lagrangian formalism to include these scalar fields in a theory of gravity coupled with ordinary matter and radiation. We will find that these fields need not to be included in the actions of interacting gauge theories coupled with conserved fermionic vector currents as a part of the connection. The same remains valid for ordinary scalar fields. We can couple the connection-scalars with ordinary matter by adding suitable interaction terms. In this context, we will find that Stokes' theorem leads us to include the right-handed neutrinos in the electroweak theory in curved spacetime even with the Levi-Civita connection. This is required to obtain consistent equations of motion and anomaly-free conserved vector current for the neutrinos. Axial vector currents for different Dirac fields may remain anomalous. The right-handed neutrinos can be useful to explain neutrino oscillation and dark matter. We will also discuss the possibility of introducing massless finite integer spin particles using second rank symmetric traceless tensors with reference to the corresponding little group in flat spacetime. We will show that we can use massless (A,A) type fields in Minkowski space to introduce massless finite integer spin particles.</description>

      <title>Quadrupolar power radiation by a binary system in a hyperbolic encounter on de Sitter background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present cosmological model and the surveys favor the universe with a small but positive cosmological constant $\Lambda$, which accounts for dark energy and causes an exponential expansion. This can have observational consequences in the current detection of gravitational waves, as most of the waveforms for gravitational radiation are computed assuming a flat (Minkowski) background. In this work, we compute gravitational radiation within the quadrupole approximation on positive $\Lambda$ (de Sitter) background for a binary system interacting gravitationally through a hyperbolic encounter.
  We quantify the influence of the cosmological constant on the radiated energy as small corrections to the leading order Minkowski background results. The first order de Sitter background correction is of the order $\sqrt{\Lambda}$, and is thus extremely small.
  Therefore, the cosmological constant influence on the gravitational radiation is negligible and may not be detected with the existing or planned gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Prospect of unraveling the first-order phase transition in neutron stars with $f$ and $p_1$ modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-normal modes of NSs are an exciting prospect for analyzing the internal composition of NSs and studying matter at high densities. In this work, we focus on studying the $f$- and $p$- quadrupolar oscillation modes, which couple with gravitational waves. We construct two different EOS ensembles, one without and one with a first-order phase transition, and examine how $f$- and $p$-modes might help us differentiate them. We find ensemble specific exclusion regions in the $65\%$ and $95\%$ confidence contours of the frequency-damping time relations. The exclusion regions become more prominent for the higher-order oscillation modes. However, these modes have higher frequencies, which are beyond the detection capabilities of present gravitational wave detectors. The quasi-universal relations of dimensionless quantities prove to be ineffective in differentiating the EOS ensembles, as they obscure the details of the EOS.</description>

Abstract: We construct integrable chiral cosmological models with two scalar fields and potentials represented in terms of hyperbolic functions. Using the conformal transformation of the metric and the corresponding models with induced gravity terms, we obtain the general solutions in the spatially flat, open and closed Friedmann universes and the corresponding integrals of motion. The obtained general solutions can be written in terms of the Jacobi elliptic functions of the conformal time.</description>

      <title>Isospectrality in Effective Field Theory Extensions of General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two universal predictions of general relativity are the propagation of gravitational waves of large momentum along null geodesics and the isospectrality of quasinormal modes in many families of black holes. In extensions of general relativity, these properties are typically lost: quasinormal modes are no longer isospectral and gravitational wave propagation is no longer geodesic and it exhibits birefringence -- polarization-dependent speed. We study these effects in an effective-field-theory extension of general relativity with up to eight-derivative terms and show that there is a unique Lagrangian that has a non-birefringent dispersion relation for gravitational waves and isospectral quasinormal modes in the eikonal limit. We argue that both properties are related through a generalized correspondence between eikonal quasinormal modes and unstable photon-sphere orbits. These properties define a special class of theories that we denote as isospectral effective field theories. We note that the lowest-order isospectral correction to general relativity coincides with the quartic-curvature correction arising from type II string theory, suggesting that isospectrality might be a key feature of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Crossing the desert: Towards predictions for SMEFT coefficients from quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The SMEFT provides a general framework to search for new physics beyond the current reach of direct detection. One such form of new physics is quantum gravity. Based on dimensional analysis, one would expect the prediction that the quantum-gravity contribution to the SMEFT coefficients is unmeasurably tiny at LHC scales. In this paper, we test this expectation in a specific framework for quantum gravity, namely the asymptotic safety framework. In this framework, Wilson coefficients can be calculated in relatively straightforward manner, making a connection between quantum gravity and LHC tests of the SMEFT achievable. We work in a toy model of the Standard Model fermion sector to investigate four-fermion couplings. We find three scenarios in this toy model, based on three distinct fixed points of the Renormalization Group flow. In the first scenario, the expectation from dimensional analysis is borne out and Wilson coefficients are Planck-scale suppressed. In the second and third scenarios, the Wilson coefficients are significantly larger than expected by dimensional analysis, due to interacting fixed points which generate an effective new-physics scale that lies between the LHC scale and the Planck scale. We comment on the implications of these results for the testability of asymptotically safe gravity within the SMEFT framework at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Time-convolutionless cosmological master equations: Late-time resummations and decoherence for non-local kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit a simple toy model of two scalar fields in de Sitter space, playing the roles of "system" and "environment" degrees of freedom, which interact with each other. We show that there are secular divergences in physically relevant observables which arise solely from the non-Markovian part of the memory kernel, contrary to popular belief that secular growth typically comes from local terms in evolution equations. Nevertheless, we show that these terms can still be non-perturbatively resummed, using the time-convolutionless master equation formalism, which improves upon previous approximations. At the same time, there are other physical quantities in the same model that are dominated by local terms in the memory kernel. Therefore, we conclude that, for cosmological backgrounds, either the dissipation or the noise kernel can end up being dominated by non-local terms depending on the nature of the system-environment coupling.</description>

      <title>Influences of modified Chaplygin dark fluid around a black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study a static, spherically charged AdS black hole within a modified cosmological Chaplygin gas (MCG), adhering to the calorific equation of state, as a unified dark fluid model of dark energy and dark matter. We explore the influence of model parameters on several characteristics of the MCG-motivated charged AdS black hole (MCGMBH), including the geodesic structure and some astrophysical phenomena such as null trajectories, shadow silhouettes, light deflection angles, and the determination of greybody bounds. We then discuss how the model parameters affect the Hawking temperature, remnant radius, and evaporation process of the MCGMBH. Quasinormal modes are also investigated using the eikonal approximation method. Constraints on the MCGMBH parameters are derived from EHT observations of M87* and Sgr A*, suggesting that MCGMBH could be strong candidates for astrophysical BH.</description>

      <title>Testing the cosmic distance duality relation with Type Ia supernova and transverse BAO measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we test the cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR) by comparing the angular diameter distance (ADD) derived from the transverse Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) data with the luminosity distance (LD) from the Pantheon type Ia supernova (SNIa) sample. The binning method and Gaussian process are employed to match ADD data with LD data at the same redshift. First, we use nonparametric and parametric methods to investigate the impact of the specific prior values of the absolute magnitude $M_{\rm B}$ from SNIa observations and the sound horizon scale $r_{\rm s}$ from transverse BAO measurements on the CDDR tests. The results obtained from the parametric and non-parametric methods indicate that specific prior values of $M_{\rm B}$ and $r_{\rm s}$ lead to significant biases on the CDDR test. Then, to avoid these biases, we propose a method independent of $M_{\rm B}$ and $r_{\rm s}$ to test CDDR by considering the fiducial value of $\kappa\equiv10^{M_{\rm B} \over 5}r_{\rm s}$ as a nuisance parameter and then marginalizing its influence with a flat prior in the analysis. No violation of the CDDR is found, and the transverse BAO measurement can be used as a powerful tool to verify the validity of CDDR in the cosmological-model-independent method.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative Lightcones from Quantum SO(2,1) Conformal Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Five new families of noncommutative lightcones in 2+1 dimensions are presented as the quantizations of the inequivalent Poisson homogeneous structures that emerge when the lightcone is constructed as a homogeneous space of the SO(2,1) conformal group. Each of these noncommutative lightcones maintains covariance under the action of the respective quantum deformation of the SO(2,1) conformal group. We discuss the role played by SO(2,1) automorphisms in the classification of inequivalent Poisson homogeneous lightcones, as well as the geometric aspects of this construction. The localization properties of the novel quantum lightcones are analyzed and shown to be deeply connected with the geometric features of the Poisson homogeneous spaces.</description>

      <title>Exploring Milky Way rotation curves with Gaia DR3: a comparison between $\Lambda$CDM, MOND, and General Relativistic approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the release of Gaia DR3, we extend the comparison between dynamical models for the Milky Way rotation curve initiated in the previous work. Utilising astrometric and spectro-photometric data for 719143 young disc stars within $|z|&lt;1$ kpc and up to $R \simeq 19$ kpc, we investigate the accuracy of MOND and $\Lambda$CDM frameworks in addition to previously studied models, such as the classical one with a Navarro-Frenk-White dark matter halo and a general relativistic model. We find that all models, including MOND and $\Lambda$CDM, are statistically equivalent in representing the observed rotational velocities. However, $\Lambda$CDM, characterized by an Einasto density profile and cosmological constraints on its parameters, assigns more dark matter than the model featuring a Navarro-Frenk-White profile, with the virial mass estimated at $1.5\text{-}2.5 \times 10^{12} \, {\rm M}_{\odot}$ - a value significantly higher than recent literature estimates. Beyond $10\text{-}15$ kpc, non-Newtonian/non-baryonic contributions to the rotation curve are found to become dominant for all models consistently. Our results suggest the need for further exploration into the role of General Relativity, dark matter, and alternative theories of gravitational dynamics in shaping Milky Way's rotation curve.</description>

      <title>Appearances are deceptive: Can graviton have a mass?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of linear gravitational perturbations on cosmological backgrounds of massive fermionic fields. We observe that, when gravitational and matter action are expanded to quadratic order in gravitational perturbations on cosmological backgrounds, the graviton appears to have an off-shell mass. We derive a consistent set of two equations for the evolution of linear classical and quantum gravitational perturbations on general cosmological backgrounds, and demonstrate that the graviton mass disappears at the level of equations of motion (on-shell). In the case we consider the expansion of the Universe is driven by the one-loop backreaction of fermions, and the dynamical gravitons evolve on the same background. These equations govern the evolution of linear gravitational perturbations on general cosmological matter backgrounds. A concrete one-loop calculation is performed for the simple case of massive Dirac fermions when the temperature of the cosmological fluid changes adiabatically when compared with the expansion rate of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Consistency conditions for O-plane unsmearing from second-order perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scale-separated AdS compactifications of string theory can be constructed at the two-derivative supergravity level in the presence of smeared orientifold planes. The unsmearing corrections are known to leading order in the large volume, weak coupling limit. However, first-order perturbative approximations of non-linear problems can often produce spurious solutions, which are only weeded out by additional consistency conditions imposed at higher orders. In this work, we revisit the unsmearing procedure and present consistency conditions obtained from the second order warp factor and dilaton equations. This requires proper treatment of the near-source singularities. The resulting conditions appear as integral constraints on various non-linear combinations of the first order corrections, which we argue can generally be satisfied by appropriate choice of integration constants of the leading-order solutions. This provides a non-trivial consistency check for the perturbative unsmearing procedure and supports the existence of scale-separated AdS vacua in string theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1909.09952v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present paper we argue that a special case of the Bach-Weyl metric describing a static configuration of two Schwarzschild black holes gives rise, after extending its parameter space to complex values, to a very simple 2-parameter model for the gravitational field of a static deformed mass. We compare this model, which has no restrictions on the quadrupole parameter, with the well-known Zipoy-Voorhees $\delta$-metric and show in particular that the mass quadrupole moment in the latter solution cannot take arbitrary negative values. We subsequently add an arbitrary angular momentum to our static model and study some properties of the resulting 3-parameter stationary solitonic spacetime, which permits us to introduce the notion of the Fodor-Hoenselaers-Perj\'es relativistic multipole moments.</description>

      <title>Detection of Gravitational Wave Signals from Precessing Binary Black Hole Systems using Convolutional Neural Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.12673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current searches for gravitational waves (GWs) from black hole binaries using the LIGO and Virgo observatories are limited to analytical models for systems with black hole spins aligned (or anti-aligned) with the orbital angular momentum of the binary. Detecting black hole binaries with precessing spinsis crucial for gaining unique astrophysical insights into the formation of these sources. Therefore, it is essential to develop a search strategy capable of identifying compact binaries with precessing spins. Aligned-spin waveform models are inadequate for detecting compact binaries with high precessing spins. While several efforts have been made to construct template banks for detecting precessing binaries using matched filtering, this approach requires many templates to cover the entire search parameter space, significantly increasing the computational cost. This work explores the detection of GW signals from binary black holes(BBH) with both aligned and precessing spins using a convolutional neural network (CNN). We frame the detection of GW signals from aligned or precessing BBH systems as a hierarchical binary classification problem. The first CNN model classifies strain data as either pure noise or noisy signals (GWs from BBH). A second CNN model then classifies the detected noisy signal data as originating from either precessing or non-precessing (aligned/anti-aligned) systems. Using simulated data, the trained classifier distinguishes between noise and noisy GW signals with more than 99% accuracy. The second classifier further differentiates between aligned and highly precessing signals with around 95% accuracy. We extended our analysis to a multi-detector framework by performing a coincident test. Additionally, we tested the performance of our trained architecture on data from the first three observation runs of LIGO to identify detected BBH events as either aligned or precessing.</description>

      <title>Naked Singularity as a Possible Source of Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.16590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The source of Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs) remains one of the greatest mysteries in astrophysics. Their possible source can be the galactic nuclei, where the ultra-high gravity region plays a crucial role. Cosmic rays are extremely energetic particles that travel through space with energies exceeding $10^{20}eV$, but their origin is still a mystery despite years of studies and observations. In view of this, in this work, we studied the Joshi-Malafarina-Narayan (JMN-1) naked singularity as a natural particle accelerator. We derived the necessary expressions to find center of mass energy when two particles collide. We have obtained results showing that center of mass energy of the two particles will reach to Planck energy scale. This will form a microscopic black hole which will decay in Hawking radiation, having energy on the order of $10^{26} eV$ from the ultra-high gravity region of Sgr A*. These outgoing highly energetic particles from the naked singularity could be the possible sources of UHECRs.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Perturbation Theory in Metric-Affine Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate cosmological perturbation theory around the spatially curved FLRW background in the context of metric-affine gauge theory of gravity which includes torsion and nonmetricity. Performing scalar-vector-tensor decomposition of the spatial perturbations, we find that the theory displays a rich perturbation spectrum with helicities 0, 1, 2 and 3, on top of the usual scalar, vector and tensor metric perturbations arising from Riemannian geometry. Accordingly, the theory provides a diverse phenomenology, e.g. the helicity-2 modes of the torsion and/or nonmetricity tensors source helicity-2 metric tensor perturbation at the linear level leading to the production of gravitational waves. As an immediate application, we study linear perturbation of the nonmetricity helicity-3 modes for a general parity-preserving action of metric-affine gravity which includes quadratic terms in curvature, torsion, and nonmetricity. We then find the conditions to avoid possible instabilities in the helicity-3 modes of the spin-3 field.</description>

      <title>Low evidence for ringdown overtone in GW150914 when marginalizing over time and sky location uncertainty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14118v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tests of the no-hair theorem using astrophysical black holes involve the detection of at least two quasi-normal modes (QNMs) in the gravitational wave emitted by a perturbed black hole. A detection of two modes -- the dominant, $(\ell, m, n) = (2,2,0)$, mode and its first overtone, the $(2,2,1)$ mode -- in the post-merger signal of the binary black hole merger GW150914 was claimed in Isi et al. [arXiv:1905.00869], with further evidence provided in Isi &amp; Farr [arXiv:2202.02941]. However, Cotesta et al. [arXiv:2201.00822] disputed this claim, finding that evidence for the overtone only appeared if the signal was analyzed before merger, when a QNM description of the signal is not valid. Due to technical challenges, both of these analyses fixed the merger time and sky location of GW150914 when estimating the evidence for the overtone. At least some of the contention can be attributed to fixing these parameters. Here, we surmount this difficulty and fully marginalize over merger time and sky-location uncertainty while doing a post-merger QNM analysis of GW150914. We find that marginalizing over all parameters yields low evidence for the presence of the overtone, with a Bayes factor of $1.10\pm 0.03$ in favor of a QNM model with the overtone versus one without. The arrival time uncertainty of GW150914 is too large to definitively claim detection of the $(2,2,1)$ mode.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direct observation of gravitational waves from binary black hole (BBH) mergers has made it possible to test the laws of black-hole thermodynamics using real astrophysical sources. These tests rely on accurate and unbiased parameter estimates from the pre- and post-merger portions of a signal. Due to numerical complications, previous analyses have fixed the sky location and coalescence time when independently estimating the parameters of the pre- and post-merger signal. Here we overcome the numerical complications and present a novel method of marginalizing over sky location and coalescence time. Doing so, we find that it is not possible to model only the pre- or post-merger portions of the signal while marginalizing over timing uncertainty. We surmount this problem by simultaneously yet independently modelling the pre- and post-merger signal, with only the sky location and coalescence time being shared between the models. This allows us to marginalize over all parameters. We use our method to measure the change in area $\Delta A_{\rm measured} = A_f - A_i$ between the final and initial black holes in the BBH merger GW150914. To measure the final black hole's area $A_f$ we do an analysis using quasi-normal modes (QNMs) to model the post-merger signal, and another analysis using the post-merger portion of an inspiral-merger-ringdown (IMR) template. We find excellent agreement with expectations from General Relativity. The Hawking area theorem (which states that $A_f \geq A_i$) is confirmed to $95.4\%$ and $99.5\%$ confidence using the QNM and IMR post-merger models, respectively. Both models yield $\Delta A_{\rm measured} / \Delta A_{\rm expected} \sim 1$, where $\Delta A_{\rm expected}$ is the expected change in area derived from fits to numerical relativity simulations.</description>

Abstract: Our study applies the Two-State Formalism alongside weak measurements within a spatially homogeneous and isotropic cosmological framework, wherein Dirac spinors are intricately coupled to classical gravity. To elucidate this, we provide detailed formulations for computing the weak values of the energy-momentum tensors, the Z component of spin, and the characterization of pure states. Weak measurements appear to be a generalization and extension of the computation already made by Finster an Hainzl, in A spatially homogeneous and isotropic Einstein-Dirac cosmology. Our analysis reveals that the acceleration of the Universe expansion can be understood as an outcome of postselection, underscoring the effectiveness of weak measurement as a discerning approach for gauging cosmic acceleration.</description>

      <title>Observability of spin precession in the presence of a black-hole remnant kick</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Remnants of binary black-hole mergers can gain significant recoil or kick velocities when the binaries are asymmetric. The kick is the consequence of anisotropic emission of gravitational waves, which may leave a characteristic imprint in the observed signal. So far, only one gravitational-wave event supports a non-zero kick velocity: GW200129_065458. This signal is also the first to show evidence for spin-precession. For most other gravitational-wave observations, spin orientations are poorly constrained as this would require large signal-to-noise ratios, unequal mass ratios or inclined systems. Here we investigate whether the imprint of the kick can help to extract more information about the spins. We perform an injection and recovery study comparing binary black-hole signals with significantly different kick magnitudes, but the same spin magnitudes and spin tilts. To exclude the impact of higher signal harmonics in parameter estimation, we focus on equal-mass binaries that are oriented face-on. We generate signals with PhenomXO4a, which includes mode asymmetries. These asymmetries are the main cause for the kick in precessing binaries. For comparison with an equivalent model without asymmetries, we repeat the same injections with PhenomXPHM. We find that signals with large kicks necessarily include large asymmetries, and these give more structure to the signal, leading to more informative measurements of the spins and mass ratio. Our results also complement previous findings that argued precession in equal-mass, face-on or face-away binaries is nearly impossible to identify. In contrast, we find that in the presence of a remnant kick, even those signals become more informative and allow determining precession with signal-to-noise ratios observable already by current gravitational-wave detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The relationship between gravitational anomalies and Hawking radiation of black holes was revealed by Wilczek and Robinson. In this study, we apply their method to an analogue de Sitter spacetime in the quantum Hall system with an expanding edge. Because this system is chiral, there is no need to impose the condition of ingoing modes near the horizon, which was assumed in the original method. Moreover, this system is structured so that the de Sitter space is sandwiched between two flat spaces, and although the effects of the anomaly would not appear in an ordinal de Sitter spacetime, they manifest themselves as boundary conditions between the de Sitter and the flat regions. By performing calculations under these boundary conditions, we obtain the flux of Hawking radiation in the outer flat region with the Gibbons-Hawking temperature of the de Sitter horizon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective field theory methods allow us to modify general relativity through higher-curvature corrections to the Einstein-Hilbert action, while preserving Lorentz invariance and the number of gravitational degrees of freedom. We here construct an approximate inspiral-merger-ringdown waveform model within the cubic, parity-preserving class of effective-field-theory extensions to Einstein's theory for the gravitational waves emitted by quasi-circular binary black holes with aligned/anti-aligned spins. Using this waveform model, we first explore the detectability of non-Einsteinian effective-field-theory effects through an extended version of effective cycles to illustrate the need to include non-Einsteinian amplitude corrections. We then use this model to analyze the GW170608 event in a full Bayesian framework, and we place new improved and more robust constraints on the coupling constants of the effective field theory. Our Bayesian model selection study disfavors the non-Einsteinian theory with a (log) Bayes factor of $\log \mathcal{B}^{\text{EFT}}_{\text{GR}} = -2.81$. Our Bayesian parameter estimation study places the constraints $\bar{\alpha}_1=0.87^{+1.95}_{-1.03}$ and $ \bar{\alpha}_2=-0.35^{+4.12}_{-2.92}$ at $90\%$ confidence on the coupling parameters of the effective-field theory. These constraints are $3.5$ stronger than previous constraints, informative relative to the prior, and independent of the choice of prior on the coupling parameters of the modified theory.</description>

      <title>Perturbative quantum evolution of the gravitational state and dressing in general backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.06836v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper sets up a perturbative treatment of the evolving quantum state of a gravitational system, in a Schr\"odinger-like picture, working about a general background. This connects gauge symmetry, the constraints, gravitational dressing, and evolution. Starting with a general time slicing, we give a simple derivation of the relation between the constraints, the hamiltonian, and its well-known boundary term. Among different approaches to quantization with constraints, we focus on a "gauge-invariant canonical quantization," which is developed perturbatively in the gravitational coupling. The leading-order solution of the constraints (including the Wheeler-DeWitt equation) for perturbations about the background is given in terms of an explicit construction of gravitational dressings built using certain generalized Green functions; different such dressings corresponding to adding propagating gravitational waves to a particular solution of the constraints. Dressed operators commute with the constraints, expressing their gauge invariance, and have an algebraic structure differing significantly from the undressed operators of the underlying field theory. These operators can act on the vacuum to create dressed states, and evolution of general such states is then generated by the boundary hamiltonian, and alternately may be characterized using other relational observables. This provides a concrete approach to studying perturbative time evolution, including the leading gravitational backreaction, of quantum states of black holes with flat or anti de Sitter asymptotics, for example on horizon-crossing slices. This description of evolution in turn provides a starting point for investigating possibly important corrections to quantum evolution, that go beyond quantized general relativity.</description>

      <title>A cosmic microwave background search for fine-structure constant evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In some extensions of the standard model of particle physics, the values of the fundamental coupling constants vary in space and time. Some observations of quasars hint at time and spatial variation of the fine structure constant $\alpha$. Here, the Bekenstein-Sandvik-Barrow-Magueijo (BSBM) model (which posits the existence of a scalar field driving evolution in the fundamental electric charge $e$) is tested against quasar and Planck satellite cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. In this model, variations in $e$ are coupled to the matter density through a factor $\zeta_{\rm m}/{\omega}$, which is related to electromagnetic contributions to nucleon masses, and {the energy} scale of new physics. Simulations conducted here do not support claims that the electrostatic contribution to $\zeta_{m}$ is completely shielded. Other common approximations used in BSBM field evolution are found to be adequate. Principal components of the CMB data with respect to variations in $\alpha$ are used to obtain constraints of $\zeta_{\rm m}/{\omega}\lesssim 9.3 \times 10^{-9}$ for a massless field. A forecast anticipating the promise of the Simons Observatory (SO) CMB experiment shows that SO will be sensitive to values of $\zeta_{\rm m}/{\omega}\geq 2.2 \times 10^{-9}$.</description>

      <title>Curved graphene: a possible answer to the problem of graphene's diverging magnetic susceptibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A study of strongly curved graphene magnetization and magnetic susceptibility is carried out. Through a Dirac model complemented with a tight-binding model analysis, we are able to show that mechanical deformations solve the long-standing problem of graphene's theoretically calculated diamagnetic divergence at low temperatures. This suggests that corrugations and mechanical defects in graphene are the cause of finite experimentally measurable magnetic susceptibility. Furthermore, a mechanical effect is also found due to an electronic contribution, which produces a pseudo-de Haas van Alphen (dHvA) effect. This effect is related to oscillating (electronic) forces that oppose deformations; these forces are divergent in flat graphene, indicating that graphene (without substrate) achieves mechanical equilibrium by corrugations. In addition, paramagnetism is predicted for graphene with negative curvature under strong magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Localized chaos due to rotating shock waves in Kerr-AdS black holes and their ultraspinning version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14535v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The butterfly velocity of four-dimensional rotating charged asymptotically AdS black hole is calculated to probe chaos using localized rotating shock waves. In this work, we obtain the angular momentum dependence of the butterfly velocity due to rotation in the shock wave probes. In general, the angular momentum $\mathcal{L}$ of the shock waves increases the butterfly velocity. The localized shocks also generate butterfly velocities which vanish when we approach extremality, indicating no entanglement spread near extremality. One of the butterfly velocity modes is well bounded by both the speed of light and the Schwarzschild-AdS result, while the other may become superluminal. Aside from the logarithmic behavior of the scrambling time which indicates chaos, the Lyapunov exponent is also positive and bounded by $\kappa=2\pi T_H/(1-\mu\mathcal{L})$. The Kerr-NUT-AdS and Kerr-Sen-AdS solutions and their ultraspinning versions are used as examples to attain a better understanding of the chaotic phenomena in rotating black holes, especially those with extra conserved charges.</description>

      <title>Constraining dark energy with the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, by now detectable at $\sim 5\sigma$ within the context of $\Lambda{}$CDM cosmologies, to place strong constraints on dynamical dark energy theories. Working within an effective field theory framework for dark energy we find that including ISW constraints from galaxy-CMB cross-correlations significantly strengthens existing large-scale structure constraints, yielding bounds consistent with $\Lambda{}$CDM and approximately reducing the viable parameter space by $\sim 70\%$. This is a direct consequence of ${\cal O}(1)$ changes induced in these cross-correlations by otherwise viable dark energy models, which we discuss in detail. We compute constraints by adapting the $\Lambda{}$CDM ISW likelihood from [1] for dynamical dark energy models using galaxy data from 2MASS, WISE $\times$ SuperCOSMOS, SDSS-DR12, QSOs and NVSS, CMB data from Planck 18, and BAO and RSD large scale structure measurements from BOSS and 6dF. We show constraints both in terms of EFT-inspired $\alpha_i$ and phenomenological $\mu/\Sigma$ parametrisations. Furthermore we discuss the approximations involved and related aspects of bias modelling in detail and highlight what these constraints imply for the underlying dark energy theories.</description>

      <title>Negative cosmological constant in the dark energy sector: tests from JWST photometric and spectroscopic observations of high-redshift galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Early observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed the existence of an unexpectedly large abundance of extremely massive galaxies at redshifts $z \gtrsim 5$: these observations are in tension with the predictions not only of the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, but also with those of a wide class of dynamical dark energy (DE) models, and are generally in better agreement with models characterized by a phantom behaviour. Here we consider a model, inspired by string theory and the ubiquity of anti-de Sitter vacua therein, featuring an evolving DE component with positive energy density on top of a negative cosmological constant, argued in an earlier exploratory analysis to potentially be able to explain the JWST observations. We perform a robust comparison of this model against JWST data, considering both photometric observations from the CEERS program, and spectroscopic observations from the FRESCO survey. We show that the model is able to accommodate the JWST observations, with a consistency probability of up to $98\%$, even in the presence of an evolving component with a quintessence-like behaviour (easier to accommodate theoretically compared to phantom DE), while remaining consistent with standard low-redshift probes. Our results showcase the tremendous potential of measurements of high-redshift galaxy abundances in tests of fundamental physics, and their valuable complementarity with standard cosmological probes.</description>

      <title>Exact black holes in string-inspired Euler-Heisenberg theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider higher-order derivative gauge field corrections that arise in the fundamental context of dimensional reduction of String Theory and Lovelock-inspired gravities and obtain an exact and asymptotically flat black-hole solution, in the presence of non-trivial dilaton configurations. Specifically, by considering the gravitational theory of Euler-Heisenberg non-linear electrodynamics coupled to a dilaton field with specific coupling functions, we perform an extensive analysis of the characteristics of the black hole, including its geodesics for massive particles, the energy conditions, thermodynamical and stability analysis. The inclusion of a dilaton scalar potential in the action can also give rise to asymptotically (A)dS spacetimes and an effective cosmological constant. Moreover, we find that the black hole can be thermodynamically favored when compared to the Gibbons-Maeda-Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger (GMGHS) black hole for those parameters of the model that lead to a larger black-hole horizon for the same mass. Finally, it is observed that the energy conditions of the obtained black hole are indeed satisfied, further validating the robustness of the solution within the theoretical framework, but also implying that this self-gravitating dilaton-non-linear-electrodynamics system constitutes another explicit example of bypassing modern versions of the no-hair theorem without any violation of the energy conditions.</description>

      <title>Infinite Order Hydrodynamics: An Analytical Example</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a kinetic model for matter-radiation interactions whose hydrodynamic gradient expansion can be computed analytically up to infinite order in derivatives, in the fully nonlinear regime, and for arbitrary flows. The frequency dependence of the opacity of matter is chosen to mimic the relaxation time of a self-interacting scalar field. In this way, the transient sector simulates that of a realistic quantum field theory. The gradient series is found to diverge for most flows, in agreement with previous findings. We identify, for the model at hand, the mechanism at the origin of the divergence, and we provide a successful regularization scheme. Additionally, we propose a universal qualitative framework for predicting the breakdown of the gradient expansion of an arbitrary microscopic system undergoing a given flow. This framework correctly recovers all previously known instances of gradient expansion divergence. As a new prediction, we show that the gradient expansion diverges when the energy-dependent mean free path is unbounded above.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03821v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The EHT has captured a series of images of black holes. These images could provide valuable information about the gravitational environment near the event horizon. However, accurate detection and parameter estimation for candidate black holes are necessary. This paper explores the potential for identifying black holes in the ultraviolet band using space telescopes. We establish a data pipeline for generating simulated observations and present an ensemble neural network model for black hole detection and parameter estimation. The model achieves mean average precision [0.5] values of 0.9176 even when reaching the imaging FWHM ($\theta_c$) and maintains the detection ability until $0.54\theta_c$. The parameter estimation is also accurate. These results indicate that our methodology enables super-resolution recognition. Moreover, the model successfully detects the shadow of M87* from background noise and other celestial bodies and estimates its inclination and positional angle. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of detecting black holes in the ultraviolet band and provides a new method for black hole detection and further parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>The semi-classical saddles in three-dimensional gravity via holography and mini-superspace approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine the complex geometries dual to the semi-classical saddles in three-dimensional gravity with positive or negative cosmological constant. We examine the semi-classical saddles in Liouville field theory and interpret them in terms of gravity theory. For this, we describe the gravity theory by Chern Simons theory and classify the possible saddles based on homotopy group argument. We further realize the semi-classical saddles using the mini-superspace model of quantum gravity and explicitly determine the integral contour. In the case of positive cosmological constant, we recovered the geometry used for no-boundary proposal of Hartle and Hawking. In the case of negative cosmological constant, the geometry can be identified with Euclidean anti-de Sitter space attached with imaginary radius spheres. The geometry should be unphysical and several arguments on this issue are provided. Partial results were already presented in our earlier letter, and more detailed derivations and explanations on the results are given along with additional results. In particular, we reproduce the classical Liouville action from the Chern-Simons formulation of dual gravity theory.</description>

      <title>Casimir energy on the sphere and 6D CFT trace anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15561v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We elucidate the dependence of the Casimir energy on the trace anomaly coefficients for a six-dimensional CFT on $R\times S^5$. This extends the universal dependence on the central charge in 2D and the relation by Cappelli and Coste in 4D, unveiling the role of the trivial total derivatives in the anomaly that renders the Casimir energy scheme dependent. We obtain
  $$E_o=-\frac{15}{8}\,a_6 -\frac{5}{12}\,\left(g_5+\frac{1}{4}\,g_7+\frac{1}{2}\,g_8-10\, g_9+g_{10}\right),$$ with $a_6$ being the type A central charge and the $g$'s, the coefficients of five out of six terms that form a basis for trivial total derivatives. The derivation is based on the Polyakov formulas (conformal primitive) resulting from the integration of the trace anomaly.
  Alternatively, on a 6D conformally flat background the above basis is redundant and one can simplify further to get, in terms of the Schouten scalar $J$ and the Schouten tensor $V$, Branson's basis for trivial total derivatives $\nabla^2\nabla^2 J$, $\nabla^2J^2$ and $\nabla^2|V|^2+2\nabla\cdot(V\cdot\nabla\,J)$ with coefficients $\gamma_1, \gamma_2$ and $\gamma_3$, respectively, \begin{equation} \nonumber
  E_o=-\frac{15}{8}a_6-\frac{1}{24}\left(\gamma_1-\gamma_2 -\frac{1}{8}\gamma_3\right)~. \end{equation}</description>

Abstract: We recently introduced a particular nonlinear generalization of quantum mechanics which has the property that it is exactly solvable in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian of the usual linear quantum mechanics problem. In this paper we suggest that the two components of the wave function represent the system described by the Hamiltonian H in two different asymptotic regions of spacetime and we show that the non-linear terms can be viewed as giving rise to gravitational effects.</description>

      <title>Discrete $Z_4$ symmetry in quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00718v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the discrete $Z_4$ symmetry ${\hat {\bf i}}$, which takes place in the scenario of quantum gravity where the gravitational tetrads emerge as the order parameter. Under this symmetry operation $\hat {\bf i}$, the emerging tetrads are multiplied by the imaginary unit, $\hat {\bf i}\,e^a_\mu = - i e^a_\mu$. The existence of such symmetry and the spontaneous breaking of this symmetry are also supported by the consideration of the symmetry breaking scheme in the topological superfluid $^3$He-B. The order parameter $^3$He-B is the analogue of the tetrad field, but it has complex values. The $\hat {\bf i}$-symmetry operation changes the phase of the complex order parameter by $\pi/2$, which corresponds to the $Z_4$ discrete symmetry in quantum gravity. We also considered the alternative scenario of the breaking of this $Z_4$ symmetry, in which the $\hat {\bf i}$-operation changes sign of the scalar curvature, $\hat {\bf i} \,{\cal R} = - {\cal R}$, and thus the Einstein-Hilbert action violates the $\hat {\bf i}$-symmetry. In the alternative scenario of symmetry breaking, the gravitational coupling $K=1/16\pi G$ plays the role of the order parameter, which changes sign under $\hat {\bf i}$-transformation.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we investigate the scattering amplitudes of spin-2 Kaluza-Klein (KK) states in Randall-Sundrum models with brane-localized curvature terms. We show that the presence of brane-localized curvature interactions modifies the properties of (4D) scalar fluctuations of the metric, resulting in scattering amplitudes of the massive spin-2 KK states which grow as ${\cal O}(s^3)$ instead of ${\cal O}(s)$. We discuss the constraints on the size of the brane-localized curvature interactions based on the consistency of the Sturm-Liouville mode systems of the spin-2 and spin-0 metric fluctuations. We connect the properties of the scattering amplitudes to the diffeomorphism invariance of the compactified KK theory with brane-localized curvature interactions. We verify that the scattering amplitudes involving brane-localized external sources (matter) are diffeomorphism-invariant, but show that those for matter localized at an arbitrary point in the bulk are not. We demonstrate that, in Feynman gauge, the spin-0 Goldstone bosons corresponding to helicity-0 states of the massive spin-2 KK bosons behave as a tower of Galileons, and that it is their interactions that produce the high-energy behavior of the scattering amplitudes. We also outline the correspondence between our results and those in the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) model. In an appendix we discuss the analogous issue in extra-dimensional gauge theory, and show that the presence of a brane-localized gauge kinetic-energy term does not change the high-energy behavior of corresponding KK vector boson scattering amplitudes.</description>
