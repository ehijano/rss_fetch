      <title>Temperature-Dependent Characterization of Large-Area Superconducting Microwire Array with Single-Photon Sensitivity in the Near-Infrared</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs) are a leading detector technology for time-resolved single-photon counting from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared regime. The recent advancement in single-photon sensitivity in micrometer-scale superconducting wires opens up promising opportunities to develop large area SNSPDs with applications in low background dark matter detection experiments. We present the first detailed temperature-dependent study of a 4-channel $1\times1$ mm$^{2}$ WSi superconducting microwire single photon detector (SMSPD) array, including the internal detection efficiency, dark count rate, and importantly the coincident dark counts across pixels. The detector shows saturated internal detection efficiency for photon wavelengths ranging from 635 nm to 1650 nm, time jitter of about 160 ps for 1060 nm photons, and a low dark count rate of about $10^{-2}$ Hz. Additionally, the coincidences of dark count rate across pixels are studied for the first time in detail, where we observed an excess of correlated dark counts, which has important implications for low background dark matter experiments. The results presented is the first step towards characterizing and developing SMSPD array systems and associated background for low background dark matter detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Multipurpose in situ cell design for 3D X-ray imaging of electrochemical processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the design of a modular multipurpose cell for monitoring the degradation of materials in extreme environments. This cell decouples the reference electrode from the working and counter electrodes, permitting precise electrochemical control and measurement reliability. The design is compatible with 4th generation synchrotron light sources, and its emphasis on modularity facilitates adaptation to different beamlines, where there may be variations in sample stage requirements and X-ray imaging techniques. Experimental tests with the novel design demonstrate its support of real-time corrosion and hydrogen embrittlement measurements under both Bragg Coherent Diffraction Imaging (BCDI) and Dark Field X-ray Microscopy (DFXM) configurations.</description>

      <title>X-ray Irradiation Studies on the Monopix DMAPS in 150$\,$nm and 180$\,$nm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monolithic active pixel sensors with depleted substrates present a promising option for pixel detectors in high-radiation environments. High-resistivity silicon substrates and high bias voltage capabilities in commercial CMOS technologies facilitate depletion of the charge sensitive volume. TJ-Monopix2 and LF-Monopix2 are the most recent large-scale chips in their respective development line, aiming for the ATLAS Inner Tracker outer layer requirements. Those include a tolerance to ionizing radiation of up to 100$\,$Mrad. It was evaluated by irradiating both devices with X-rays to the corresponding ionization dose, showing no significant degradation of the performance at 100$\,$Mrad and continuous operability throughout the irradiation campaign.</description>

      <title>A high-sensitivity frequency counter for free-induction-decay signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time frequency readout of time-dependent pulsed signals with a high sensitivity are key elements in many applications using atomic devices, such as FID atomic magnetometers. In this paper, we propose a frequency measurement algorithm based on the Hilbert transform and implement such a scheme in a FPGA-based frequency counter. By testing pulsed exponential-decay oscillation signals in the frequency range of 10 to 500 kHz, this frequency counter shows a frequency sensitivity better than 0.1 mHz/Hz^(1/2) at 10 Hz, with an output rate of 200 Hz. When the output rate is increased to 1000 Hz, the sensitivity remains better than 0.4 mHz/Hz^(1/2) at 10 Hz. The performance on frequency sensitivity is comparable with results obtained by off-line nonlinear fitting processes. In addition, this frequency counter does not require the pre-knowledge of the analytic expression of the input signals. The realization of such a device paves the way for practical applications of highly-sensitive FID atomic magnetometers.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the Hamamatsu R12699-406-M4 Photomultiplier Tube in Cold Xenon Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hamamatsu R12699-406-M2 is a $2\times2$ multi-anode 2-inch photomultiplier tube that offers a compact form factor, low intrinsic radioactivity, and high photocathode coverage. These characteristics make it a promising candidate for next-generation xenon-based direct detection dark matter experiments, such as XLZD and PandaX-xT. We present a detailed characterization of this photosensor operated in cold xenon environments, focusing on its single photoelectron response, dark count rate, light emission, and afterpulsing behavior. The device demonstrated a gain exceeding $2\cdot 10^6$ at the nominal voltage of -1.0 kV, along with a low dark count rate of $(0.4\pm0.2)\;\text{Hz/cm}^2$. Due to the compact design, afterpulses exhibited short delay times, resulting in some cases in an overlap with the light-induced signal. To evaluate its applicability in a realistic detector environment, two R12699-406-M2 units were deployed in a small-scale dual-phase xenon time projection chamber. The segmented $2\times2$ anode structure enabled lateral position reconstruction using a single photomultiplier tube, highlighting the potential of the sensor for effective event localization in future detectors.</description>

      <title>High-linearity power amplifier based on GaAs HBT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a power amplifier designed for Wi-Fi 6E using the 2 um gallium arsenide (GaAs) heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) process. By employing third-order inter-modulation signal cancellation, harmonic suppression, and an adaptive biasing scheme, the linearity performance of the circuit is improved. To achieve broadband performance, the power amplifier also incorporates gain distribution and multi-stage LC matching techniques. The measurement results indicate that, under a 5V supply voltage, it can achieve S21 greater than 31dB, delta G of 0.723dB, and P1dB of 30.6dB within the 5.125GHz-7.125GHz frequency band. The maximum linear output power, which satisfies AM-AM &lt; 0.2dB and AM-PM &lt; 1{\deg}, is 26.5dBm, and the layout area is 2.34mm2.</description>

      <title>Bayesian network 3D event reconstruction in the Cygno optical TPC for dark matter direct detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CYGNO experiment is developing a high-resolution gaseous Time Projection Chamber with optical readout for directional dark matter searches. The detector uses a helium-tetrafluoromethane (He:CF$_4$ 60:40) gas mixture at atmospheric pressure and a triple Gas Electron Multiplier amplification stage, coupled with a scientific camera for high-resolution 2D imaging and fast photomultipliers for time-resolved scintillation light detection. This setup enables 3D event reconstruction: photomultipliers signals provide depth information, while the camera delivers high-precision transverse resolution. In this work, we present a Bayesian Network-based algorithm designed to reconstruct the events using only the photomultipliers signals, yielding a full 3D description of the particle trajectories. The algorithm models the light collection process probabilistically and estimates spatial and intensity parameters on the Gas Electron Multiplier plane, where light emission occurs. It is implemented within the Bayesian Analysis Toolkit and uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling for posterior inference. Validation using data from the CYGNO LIME prototype shows accurate reconstruction of localized and extended tracks. Results demonstrate that the Bayesian approach enables robust 3D description and, when combined with camera data, further improves the precision of track reconstruction. This methodology represents a significant step forward in directional dark matter detection, enhancing the identification of nuclear recoil tracks with high spatial resolution.</description>

      <title>Polarized Neutrons at ISIS: Recent Developments And Highlights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two recent projects which aim to improve the performance of polarized neutron scattering experiments using hyperpolarized $^{3}He$ spin filters at ISIS. The first is the optimization of a new compact magnetostatic cavity ("Magic Box") to house the $^{3}He$ spin filters based on an existing design. With a length of only 380 mm, it provides a field gradient relaxation time for the $^{3}He$ cell of 421 h in ambient conditions. It also contains a radiofrequency coil for adiabatic fast passage flipping. The second project is dedicated to the improvement of the $^{3}He$ relaxation time inside the spin filter cell. We have developed a chamber which allows for the deposition of alkali metal coatings on the surface of substrates. This emulates the spin filter cell walls, as well as subsequent heat treatment, thus mimicking the preparation of a new spin filter cell. The chamber is air-tight and has transparent windows, so that the structure resulting from the deposition of alkali metal on the surface of the wafer can be studied by X-ray or neutron reflectometry. We plan to continue this work by performing a systematic study at various conditions, which should help to shed light on the long-standing mystery of how alkali metal coatings help to improve relaxation time of $^{3}He$ cells. The first results are discussed in the text.</description>

Abstract: This article describes the development of an active Thomson Parabola ion spectrometer designed to measure the energy spectra of different multi-MeV ion species generated in laser-plasmas interactions. To do so, GEANT4 optical simulations were carried out in order to design and build a spectrometer based on scintillator detectors capable of operating at rates comparable with the highest achievable at any existing or upcoming high intensity laser facilities.

      <title>Chronoamperometry with Room-Temperature Ionic Liquids: Sub-Second Inference Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chronoamperometry (CA) is a fundamental electrochemical technique used for quantifying redox-active species. However, in room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs), the high viscosity and slow mass transport often lead to extended measurement durations. This paper presents a novel mathematical regression approach that reduces CA measurement windows to under 1 second, significantly faster than previously reported methods, which typically require 1-4 seconds or longer. By applying an inference algorithm to the initial transient current response, this method accurately predicts steady-state electrochemical parameters without requiring additional hardware modifications. The approach is validated through comparison with standard chronoamperometric techniques and is demonstrated to maintain reasonable accuracy while dramatically reducing data acquisition time. The implications of this technique are explored in analytical chemistry, sensor technology, and battery science, where rapid electrochemical quantification is critical. Our technique is focused on enabling faster multiplexing of chronoamperometric measurements for rapid olfactory and electrochemical analysis.</description>

      <title>DELight: a Direct search Experiment for Light dark matter with superfluid helium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.10950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To reach ultra-low detection thresholds necessary to probe unprecedentedly low Dark Matter masses, target material alternatives and novel detector designs are essential. One such target material is superfluid $^4$He which has the potential to probe so far uncharted light Dark Matter parameter space at sub-GeV masses. The new ``Direct search Experiment for Light dark matter'', DELight, will be using superfluid helium as active target, instrumented with magnetic micro-calorimeters. It is being designed to reach sensitivity to masses well below 100\,MeV in Dark Matter-nucleus scattering interactions.</description>
