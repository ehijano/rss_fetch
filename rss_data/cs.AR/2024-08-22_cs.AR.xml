      <title>HiMA: Hierarchical Quantum Microarchitecture for Qubit-Scaling and Quantum Process-Level Parallelism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing holds immense potential for addressing a myriad of intricate challenges, which is significantly amplified when scaled to thousands of qubits. However, a major challenge lies in developing an efficient and scalable quantum control system. To address this, we propose a novel Hierarchical MicroArchitecture (HiMA) designed to facilitate qubit scaling and exploit quantum process-level parallelism. This microarchitecture is based on three core elements: (i) discrete qubit-level drive and readout, (ii) a process-based hierarchical trigger mechanism, and (iii) multiprocessing with a staggered triggering technique to enable efficient quantum process-level parallelism. We implement HiMA as a control system for a 72-qubit tunable superconducting quantum processing unit, serving a public quantum cloud computing platform, which is capable of expanding to 6144 qubits through three-layer cascading. In our benchmarking tests, HiMA achieves up to a 4.89x speedup under a 5-process parallel configuration. Consequently, to the best of our knowledge, we have achieved the highest CLOPS (Circuit Layer Operations Per Second), reaching up to 43,680, across all publicly available platforms.</description>

      <title>In-Memory Computing Architecture for Efficient Hardware Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an innovative approach utilizing in-memory computing (IMC) for the development and integration of AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) cipher technique. Our research aims to enhance cybersecurity measures for a wide range of applications for IoT, such as robotic self-driving and several uses contexts. Memristor (MR) design optimized for in-memory processing is introduced. Our work highlights the development of a 4-bit state memristor device tailored for various range of arithmetic functions in a hardware prototype of AES system. Additionally, we propose a pipeline AES design aimed at harnessing extensive parallelism and ensuring compatibility with MR devices. This approach enhances hardware performance by by managing larger data amounts, accelerating computational, and achieving greater precision demands. Compared to traditional AES hardware, AES-IMC demonstrates an approximate 30 % improvement in power with a comparable throughput rate. Compared with the latest AES-based NVM engines, AES-IMC achieves an impressive 62 % improvement in throughput at similar power dissipation levels. The IMC-developed design will protect against unintentional incidents involving unmanned devices, reducing the risks associated with hostile assaults such as hijacking and illegal control of robots. This helps to reduce the possible economic and financial losses caused by incidents</description>

      <title>Anteumbler: Non-Invasive Antenna Orientation Error Measurement for WiFi APs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of WiFi-based localization systems is affected by the spatial accuracy of WiFi AP. Compared with the imprecision of AP location and antenna separation, the imprecision of AP's or antenna's orientation is more important in real scenarios, including AP rotation and antenna irregular tilt. In this paper, we propose Anteumbler that non-invasively, accurately and efficiently measures the orientation of each antenna in physical space. Based on the fact that the received power is maximized when a Tx-Rx antenna pair is perfectly aligned, we construct a spatial angle model that can obtain the antennas' orientations without prior knowledge. However, the sampling points of traversing the spatial angle need to cover the entire space. We use the orthogonality of antenna directivity and polarization and adopt an iterative algorithm to reduce the sampling points by hundreds of times, which greatly improves the efficiency. To achieve the required antenna orientation accuracy, we eliminate the influence of propagation distance using a dual plane intersection model and filter out ambient noise. Our real-world experiments with six antenna types, two antenna layouts and two antenna separations show that Anteumbler achieves median errors below 6 degree for both elevation and azimuth angles, and is robust to NLoS and dynamic environments. Last but not least, for the reverse localization system, we deploy Anteumbler over LocAP and reduce the antenna separation error by 10 mm, while for the user localization system, we deploy Anteumbler over SpotFi and reduce the user localization error by more than 1 m.</description>

      <title>Confidential Computing on Heterogeneous Systems: Survey and Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the widespread informatization and rapid data explosion have increased the demand for high-performance heterogeneous systems that integrate multiple computing cores such as CPUs, Graphics Processing Units (GPU s), Application Specific Integrated Circuits ( ASICs), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), and Neural Processing Units (NPU s). The combination of CPU and GPU is particularly popular due to its versatility. However, these heterogeneous systems face significant security and privacy risks. Advances in privacy-preserving techniques, especially hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments ( TEE s), offer effective protection for GPU applications. Nonetheless, the potential security risks involved in extending TEE s to GPUs in heterogeneous systems remain uncertain and need further investigation. To investigate these risks in depth, we study the existing popular GPU TEE designs and summarize and compare their key implications. Additionally, we review existing powerful attacks on GPUs and traditional TEE s deployed on CPUs, along with the efforts to mitigate these threats. We identify potential attack surfaces introduced by GPU TEE s and provide insights into key considerations for designing secure GPU TEEs. This survey is timely as new TEE s for heterogeneous systems, particularly GPUs, are being developed, highlighting the need to understand potential security threats and build both efficient and secure systems.</description>

      <title>Carbon Connect: An Ecosystem for Sustainable Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computing is at a moment of profound opportunity. Emerging applications -- such as capable artificial intelligence, immersive virtual realities, and pervasive sensor systems -- drive unprecedented demand for computer. Despite recent advances toward net zero carbon emissions, the computing industry's gross energy usage continues to rise at an alarming rate, outpacing the growth of new energy installations and renewable energy deployments. A shift towards sustainability is needed to spark a transformation in how computer systems are manufactured, allocated, and consumed. Carbon Connect envisions coordinated research thrusts that produce design and management strategies for sustainable, next-generation computer systems. These strategies must flatten and then reverse growth trajectories for computing power and carbon for society's most rapidly growing applications such as artificial intelligence and virtual spaces. We will require accurate models for carbon accounting in computing technology. For embodied carbon, we must re-think conventional design strategies -- over-provisioned monolithic servers, frequent hardware refresh cycles, custom silicon -- and adopt life-cycle design strategies that more effectively reduce, reuse and recycle hardware at scale. For operational carbon, we must not only embrace renewable energy but also design systems to use that energy more efficiently. Finally, new hardware design and management strategies must be cognizant of economic policy and regulatory landscape, aligning private initiatives with societal goals. Many of these broader goals will require computer scientists to develop deep, enduring collaborations with researchers in economics, law, and industrial ecology to spark change in broader practice.</description>
