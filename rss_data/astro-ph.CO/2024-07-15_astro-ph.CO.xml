      <title>Mass Modeling and Kinematics of Galaxy Clusters in Modified Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chameleon screening mechanism has been constrained many a time using dynamic and kinematic galaxy cluster observables. Current constraints are, however, insensitive to different mass components within galaxy clusters and have been mainly focused on a single mass density profile, the Navarro-Frenk-While mass density model. In this work, we extend the study of the Chameleon screening mechanism in galaxy clusters by considering a series of mass density models, namely: generalized-Navarro-Frenk-While, b-Navarro-Frenk-While, Burket, Isothermal and Einasto. The coupling strength ($\beta$) and asymptotic value of the chameleon field ($\phi_\infty$) are constrained by using kinematics analyses of simulated galaxy clusters, generated both assuming General Relativity and a strong chameleon scenario. By implementing a Bayesian analysis we comprehensively show that the biases introduced due to an incorrect assumption of the mass model are minimal. Similarly, we also demonstrate that a spurious detection of evidence for modifications to gravity is highly unlikely when utilizing the kinematics of galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>Testing screened modified gravity with SDSS-IV-MaNGA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fifth forces are ubiquitous in modified gravity theories, and must be screened to evade stringent local tests. This can introduce unusual behaviour in galaxy phenomenology by affecting galaxies' components differently. Here we use the SDSS-IV-MaNGA dataset to search for a systematic excess of gas circular velocity over stellar circular velocity, expected in thin-shell-screened theories in the partially screened regime. Accounting for asymmetric drift and calibrating our model on screened subsamples, we find no significant evidence for a screened fifth force. We bound the fifth-force strength to $\Delta G/G_\text{N} &lt; 0.1$ for all astrophysical ranges, strengthening to $\sim$0.01 at Compton wavelength of 3 Mpc for the Hu-Sawicki model, for instance. This implies a stringent constraint on scalar-tensor theories, for example $f_{\mathcal{R}0} \lesssim 10^{-8}$ in Hu-Sawicki $f(\mathcal{R})$ gravity.</description>

      <title>Constraining $f(Q, L_m)$ gravity with bulk viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of bulk viscosity on late-time cosmic acceleration within an extended $f(Q, L_m)$ gravity framework, where the non-metricity $Q$ is non-minimally coupled with the matter Lagrangian $L_m$. Analyzing the function $f(Q, L_m) = \alpha Q + \beta L_m$, we derive exact solutions under non-relativistic matter domination. Using observational datasets ($H(z)$, Pantheon supernovae, and their combination), we constrain the model parameters $H_0$, $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\zeta$. The deceleration parameter transitions from positive to negative values around redshifts $z_t \approx 0.80$ to $0.99 $, indicating current accelerated expansion. Moreover, the effective equation of state parameter, $\omega_{eff}$, resembles quintessence dark energy ($-1 &lt; \omega_{eff} &lt; -\frac{1}{3}$), with corresponding values from respective datasets. Finally, we use the $Om(z)$ diagnostic, which confirms that our model demonstrates quintessence-like behavior. Our findings underscore the significant role of bulk viscosity in understanding accelerated expansion in the universe within alternative gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Unified description of corpuscular and fuzzy bosonic dark matter II: Dissipation and stochastic forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend our previous work (Proukakis {\em et al.}, Phys.~Rev.~D~108,~083513 (2023)) on the dynamics of bosonic, non-relativistic and self-interacting dark matter that simultaneously contains both a ``fuzzy'' low-momentum component and one with higher momenta that may be well approximated as a collection of distinct particles and described by a corresponding phase-space distribution. Starting from the non-relativistic Schwinger-Keldysh action and working beyond leading-order in the Keldysh basis fields, encoding stochastic fluctuations of the slow modes and all fluctuations of the fast modes, we obtain stochastic self-consistently coupled Gross-Pitaevskii, collisional Boltzmann kinetic and Poisson equations. Our final set of equations, which feature various collisional (dissipative and scattering) contributions and two corresponding independent stochastic force terms, are consistent with generalized fluctuation-dissipation type relations in the limit of thermal equilibrium between the particles.</description>

      <title>Prospect of Precision Cosmology and Testing General Relativity using Binary Black Holes- Galaxies Cross-correlation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modified theories of gravity predict deviations from General Relativity (GR) in the propagation of gravitational waves (GW) across cosmological distances. A key prediction is that the GW luminosity distance will vary with redshift, differing from the electromagnetic (EM) luminosity distance due to varying effective Planck mass. We introduce a model-independent, data-driven approach to explore these deviations using multi-messenger observations of dark standard sirens (Binary Black Holes, BBH). By combining GW luminosity distance measurements from dark sirens with Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements, BBH redshifts inferred from cross-correlation with spectroscopic or photometric galaxy surveys, and sound horizon measurements from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), we can make a data-driven test of GR (jointly with the Hubble constant) as a function of redshift. Using the multi-messenger technique with the spectroscopic DESI galaxy survey, we achieve precise measurements of deviations in the effective Planck mass variation with redshift. For the Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope (CEET), the best precision is approximately 3.6\%, and for LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK), it is 7.4\% at a redshift of $\rm{z = 0.425}$. Additionally, we can measure the Hubble constant with a precision of about 1.1\% from CEET and 7\% from LVK over five years of observation with a 75\% duty cycle. We also explore the potential of cross-correlation with photometric galaxy surveys from the Rubin Observatory, extending measurements up to a redshift of $\rm{z \sim 2.5}$. This approach can reveal potential deviations from models affecting GW propagation using numerous dark standard sirens in synergy with DESI and the Rubin Observatory.</description>

      <title>Secondary bias through cosmic time II: Reconstructing halo properties using clustering information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When constructing galaxy mock catalogs based on suits of dark matter halo catalogs generated with approximated, calibrated or machine-learning approaches, the assignment of intrinsic properties for such tracers is a step of paramount relevance, given that these can shape the abundance of mock galaxy cluster and the spatial distribution of mock galaxies. We explore the possibility to assign properties of dark matter halos within the context of calibrated/learning approaches, explicitly using clustering information. The goal is to retrieve the correct signal of primary and secondary large-effective bias as a function of properties reconstructed solely based on phase-space properties of the halo distribution and dark matter density field. The algorithm reconstructs a set halo properties (such as virial mass, maximum circular velocity, concentration and spin) constraint to reproduce both primary and secondary (or assembly) bias. The key ingredients of the algorithm are the implementation of individually-assigned large-scale effective bias, a multi-scale approach to account for halo exclusion and a hierarchical assignment of halo properties. The method facilitates the assignment of halo properties aiming at replicating the large-scale effective bias, both primary and secondary. This improves over over previous methods found in the literature, especially at the high mass population. We have designed an strategy to reconstruct the main properties of dark matter halos obtained by calibrated/learning algorithms, in a way that the expected one and two-point statistics (on large scales) replicates the signal from detailed N-body simulations. We encourage the application of this strategy (or the implementation of our algorithm) for the generation of mock catalogs of dark matter halos based on approximated methods.</description>

      <title>Cosmic topology. Part IIIa. Microwave background parity violation without parity-violating microphysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard cosmological model, which assumes statistical isotropy and parity invariance, predicts the absence of correlations between even-parity and odd-parity observables of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Contrary to these predictions, large-angle CMB temperature anomalies generically involve correlations between even-$\ell$ and odd-$\ell$ angular power spectrum $C_\ell$, while recent analyses of CMB polarization have revealed non-zero equal-$\ell$ $EB$ correlations. These findings challenge the conventional understanding, suggesting deviations from statistical isotropy, violations of parity, or both. Cosmic topology, which involves changing only the boundary conditions of space relative to standard cosmology, offers a compelling framework to potentially account for such parity-violating observations. Topology inherently breaks statistical isotropy, and can also break homogeneity and parity, providing a natural paradigm for explaining observations of parity-breaking observables without the need to add parity violation to the underlying microphysics. Our investigation delves into the harmonic space implications of topology for CMB correlations, using as an illustrative example $EB$ correlations generated by tensor perturbations under both parity-preserving and parity-violating scenarios. Consequently, these findings not only challenge the foundational assumptions of the standard cosmological model but also open new avenues for exploring the topological structure of the Universe through CMB observations.</description>

      <title>Inflationary Initial Conditions for the Cosmological Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The initial conditions on the anisotropies of the stochastic gravitational-wave background of cosmological origin (CGWB) largely depend on the mechanism that generates the gravitational waves. Since the CGWB is expected to be non-thermal, the computation of the initial conditions could be more challenging w.r.t. the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), whose interactions with other particles in the early Universe lead to a blackbody spectrum. In this paper, we show that the initial conditions for the cosmological background generated by quantum fluctuations of the metric during inflation deviate from adiabaticity. These primordial gravitational waves are indeed generated by quantum fluctuations of two independent degrees of freedom (the two polarization states of the gravitons). Furthermore, the CGWB plays a negligible role in the Einstein's equations, because its energy density is subdominant w.r.t. ordinary matter. Therefore, the only possible way to compute the initial conditions for inflationary gravitons is to perturb the energy-momentum tensor of the gravitational field defined in terms of the small-scale tensor perturbation of the metric. This new and self-consistent approach shows that a large, non-adiabatic initial condition is present even during the single-field inflation. Such a contribution enhances the total angular power spectrum of the CGWB compared to the standard adiabatic case, increasing also the sensitivity of the anisotropies to the presence of relativistic and decoupled particles in the early Universe. In this work we have also proved that our findings are quite general and apply to both single-field inflation and other scenarios in which the CGWB is generated by the quantum fluctuations of the metric, like the curvaton.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological emergent dark energy in the light of DESI Data Release 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This manuscript revisits the phenomenological emergent dark energy model (PEDE) by confronting it with recent cosmological data from early and late times. In particular we analyze PEDE model by using the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements coming from both Dark Energy Spectroscopy Instrument (DESI) data release 1 and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Additionally, the measurements from cosmic chronometers, supernovae type Ia (Pantheon+), quasars, hydrogen II galaxies and cosmic background radiation distance priors are considered. By performing a Bayesian analysis based on Monte Carlo Markov Chain, we find consistent results on the constraints when SDSS and DESI are considered. However, we find higher values on the Hubble constant than Supernova $H_0$ for the Equation of State (SH0ES) does although it is still in agreement, within $1\sigma$ confidence level, when BAO measurements are added. Furthermore, we estimate the age of the Universe younger $\sim3\%$ than the one predicted by the standard cosmology. Additionally, we report values of $q_0 = -0.771^{+0.007}_{-0.007}$, $z_T = 0.764^{+0.011}_{-0.011}$ for the deceleration parameter today and the deceleration-acceleration transition redshift, respectively.</description>

      <title>LANSCE-mQ: Dedicated search for milli/fractionally charged particles at LANL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an experiment, LANSCE-mQ, aiming to detect fractionally charged and millicharged particles (mCP) using an 800 MeV proton beam fixed target at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE) facility. This search can shed new light on numerous fundamental questions, including charge quantization, the predictions of string theories and grand unification theories, the gauge symmetry of the Standard Model, dark sector models, and the tests of cosmic reheating. We propose to install two-layer scintillation detectors made of plastic (such as EJ-200) or CeBr3 to search for mCPs. Dedicated Geant4 detector simulations and in situ measurements have been conducted to obtain a preliminary determination of the background rate. The dominant backgrounds are beam-induced neutrons and coincident dark current signals from the photomultiplier tubes, while beam-induced gammas and cosmic muons are subdominant. We determined that LANSCE-mQ, the dedicated mCP experiment, has the leading mCP sensitivity for mass between ~ 1 MeV to 300 MeV.</description>

      <title>Reviving QFT in $2+1$ de Sitter Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a conformally coupled scalar QFT on $2+1$ dimensional static Einstein universe $R \times S^2$, and write down the free theory Hilbert space. We explain that this theory is secretly a QFT in $2+1$ de Sitter space because all the quantum observables experience {\it quantum revivals}, which naturally restricts the timelike $R$ to the appropriate de Sitter time range. Our construction circumvents the causal obstruction to formulating QFT in de Sitter due to event horizons. There aren't any in static Einstein. The `unitary gauge' description of the theory is realized by the zonal harmonics $P_\ell(\hat n \cdot \hat n')$. We verify that interactions with conformally invariant external sources are mediated only by these modes. Hence these modes comprise the complete basis of the "bulk" theory. When the theory is cut off in the UV the basis dimension scales as the Bekenstein-Hawking formula.</description>

      <title>Dark matter limits from the tip of the red giant branch of globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Capture and annihilation of WIMP-like dark matter in red giant stars can lead to faster-than-expected ignition of the helium core, and thus a lower tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) luminosity. We use Gaia data to place constraints on the dark matter-nucleon cross section using 22 globular clusters with measured TRGB luminosities, and place projections on the sensitivity resulting from 161 clusters with full phase space distributions observed by Gaia. Although limits remain weaker than those from Earth-based direct detection experiments, they represent a constraint that is fully independent of dark matter properties in the Solar neighbourhood, probing its properties across the entire Milky Way galaxy. Based on our findings, it is likely that the use of the TRGB as a standard candle in $H_0$ measurements is very robust against the effects of dark matter.</description>

      <title>TCC in the interior of moduli space and its implications for the string landscape and cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the classical Friedmann-Robertson-Walker solutions that describe a universe undergoing a transition from an accelerating expansion phase in the past to an eternal decelerating expansion phase in the future, driven by a scalar field evolving in a potential energy landscape. We show that any solution for which the accelerating phase violates the Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture (TCC), even in the interior of moduli space, never approaches the asymptotic vacuum with zero particles. Based on the assumption that the effective field theory must be valid for the vacuum on the asymptotic boundary, as motivated by holography and string theory, we argue that (multi-field) scalar potentials with such solutions are disallowed, thus strengthening the case for TCC. In particular, the results imply a new set of complex and highly-nonlinear constraints across the entire string landscape which may make realizing inflation impossible.</description>

      <title>Compact stars in $f(Q) = Q +\xi Q^2$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General Relativity (GR) is not the only way gravity can be geometrised. Instead of curvature, the Teleparallel Theory attributes gravity to torsion $T$, which is related to the antysimmetric part of connection, and the Symmetric Teleparallel theory no longer preserves metricity, describing gravity through the non-metricity tensor $Q_{\alpha\mu\nu}\equiv \nabla_\alpha g_{\mu\nu}.$ These descriptions give form to what is known as geometrical trinity of gravity. Recently, the extensions of GR have been intensively investigated in order to solve the theoretical impasses which have arisen. In this sense, it is also useful to investigate the extensions of alternative descriptions of gravity, which leads us to the so-called $f(T)$ and $f(Q)$ gravities. In this paper, we consider a family of $f(Q)$ models and obtain their corresponding Tolman-Oppenheimer-{Volkoff} equations applied to {polytropic} stars. Using numerical integration, it is possible to solve a system of differential equations and calculate, among other things, the maximum mass and mass-radius relation allowed. In addition, we explicitly show the non-metricity behavior inside and outside the star.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we test a possible redshift variation of the electron-to-proton mass ratio, $\mu = m_e/m_p$, directly from galaxy cluster gas mass fraction measurements and type Ia Supernovae observations. Our analysis is completely independent of any cosmological model. Our result reveals no variation of $\mu$ within 1 $\sigma$ confidence level. From the point of view of Particle Physics, we can use the precision on these results to constrain the parameter space of models beyond the Standard Model of electroweak interactions. We exemplify this by focusing in a specific Two Higgs Doublet model (2HDM), where the second scalar doublet couples exclusively to leptons. An important parameter in the model concerns the ratio between its vacuum expectation values, defined by $\tan\beta$. In our approach we can constrain the inverse parameter (cot$\beta$) to an optimal value, (tan$\beta)^{-1}=$ 0.02127 $\pm$ 0.0029, with the largest vacuum expectation value for 2HDM, $v_2$, estimated at around 240.033 $\pm$ 0.21~GeV. Also, by taking into account the $(g-2)_\mu$ discrepancy found between theory and experiment, we can reduce the validity region for this model and establish bounds on the scalar masses, in the light of our findings from galaxy clusters data for $\mu$. This study contributes valuable insights to the understanding of Particle Physics and Astrophysics interface, establishing a new interplay between data from large scale structure of the Universe and subatomic Physics.</description>

      <title>Measuring the anisotropies in astrophysical and cosmological gravitational-wave backgrounds with Taiji and LISA networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the capabilities of space-based gravitational-wave detector networks, specifically Taiji and LISA, to measure the anisotropies in stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds (SGWBs), which are characterized by the angular power spectrum. We find that a detector network can improve the measurement precision of anisotropies by at most fourteen orders of magnitude, depending on the angular multipoles. By doing so, we can enhance our understanding of the physical origins of SGWB, both in astrophysical and cosmological contexts. We assess the prospects of the detector networks for measuring the parameters of angular power spectrum. We further find an inevitable effect of cosmic variance, which strengthens the importance of configuring detector networks. Our findings also suggest a potential detection of the kinematic dipole due to Doppler boosting of SGWB.</description>

      <title>Induced Domain Walls of QCD Axion, and Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that heavy axion domain walls induce domain walls of the QCD axion through a mixing between the heavy axion and the QCD axion, even when the pre-inflationary initial condition is assumed for the QCD axion. The induced domain walls arise because the effective $\theta$ parameter changes across the heavy axion domain walls, shifting the potential minimum of the QCD axion. When the heavy axion domain walls collapse, the induced QCD axion domain walls collapse as well. This novel mechanism for producing the QCD axions can explain dark matter even with the axion decay constant as small as ${\cal O}(10^{9})$ GeV. In particular, this scenario requires domain wall collapse near the QCD crossover, potentially accounting for the stochastic gravitational wave background suggested by recent pulsar timing array observations, including NANOGrav. Using this mechanism, it is also possible to easily create induced domain walls for string axions or axions with a large decay constant, which would otherwise be challenging. We also comment on the implications for cosmic birefringence using induced axion domain walls.</description>

      <title>Euclid: Constraining linearly scale-independent modifications of gravity with the spectroscopic and photometric primary probes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The future Euclid space satellite mission will offer an invaluable opportunity to constrain modifications to Einstein's general relativity at cosmic scales. We focus on modified gravity models characterised, at linear scales, by a scale-independent growth of perturbations while featuring different testable types of derivative screening mechanisms at smaller non-linear scales. We considered three specific models, namely JBD, a scalar-tensor theory with a flat potential, the nDGP gravity, a braneworld model in which our Universe is a four-dimensional brane embedded in a five-dimensional Minkowski space-time, and $k$-mouflage (KM) gravity, an extension of $k$-essence scenarios with a universal coupling of the scalar field to matter. In preparation for real data, we provide forecasts from spectroscopic and photometric primary probes by Euclid on the cosmological parameters and the additional parameters of the models, respectively, $\omega_{\rm BD}$, $\Omega_{\rm rc}$ and $\epsilon_{2,0}$. The forecast analysis employs the Fisher matrix method applied to weak lensing (WL); photometric galaxy clustering (GCph), spectroscopic galaxy clustering (GCsp) and the cross-correlation (XC) between GCph and WL. In an optimistic setting at 68.3\% confidence interval, we find the following percentage relative errors with Euclid alone: for $\log_{10}{\omega_{\rm BD}}$, with a fiducial value of $\omega_{\rm BD}=800$, 27.1\% using GCsp alone, 3.6\% using GCph+WL+XC and 3.2\% using GCph+WL+XC+GCsp; for $\log_{10}{\Omega_{\rm rc}}$, with a fiducial value of $\Omega_{\rm rc}=0.25$, we find 93.4\%, 20\% and 15\% respectively; and finally, for $\epsilon_{2,0}=-0.04$, we find 3.4\%, 0.15\%, and 0.14\%.

      <title>Robustness of direct measurements of the mean free path of ionizing photons in the epoch of reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measurements of the mean free path of Lyman-continuum photons in the intergalactic medium during the epoch of reionization can help constrain the nature of the sources as well as sinks of hydrogen-ionizing radiation. A recent approach to this measurement has been to utilize composite spectra of multiple quasars at $z\sim 6$, and infer the mean free path after correcting the spectra for the presence of quasar proximity zones. This has revealed not only a steep drop in the mean free path from $z=5$ to $z=6$, but also potentially a mild tension with reionization simulations. We critically examine such direct measurements of the mean free path for biases due to quasar environment, incomplete reionization, and quasar proximity zones. Using cosmological radiative transfer simulations of reionization combined with one-dimensional radiative transfer calculations of quasar proximity zones, we find that the bias in the mean free path due to overdensities around quasars is minimal at $z\sim 6$. Patchiness of reionization at this redshift also does not affect the measurements significantly. Fitting our model to the data results in a mean free path of $\lambda_{\mathrm{mfp}}=1.49^{+0.47}_{-0.52}$~pMpc at $z=6$, which is consistent with the recent measurements in the literature, indicating robustness with respect to the modelling of quasar proximity zones. We also compare various ways in which the mean free path has been defined in simulations before the end of reionization. Overall, our finding is that recent measurements of the mean free path appear to be robust relative to several sources of potential bias.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive data-driven odyssey to explore the equation of state of dark energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the first time, we reconstruct the dark energy equation of the state parameter $w$ from the combination of background and perturbation observations, specifically combining the Hubble parameter data from cosmic chronometer observations and the logarithmic growth rate data from the growth rate observations. We do this analysis using posterior Gaussian process regression without considering any specific cosmological model or parametrization. However there are three main assumptions: (I) a flat Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric is considered for the cosmological background, (II) there is no interaction between dark energy and matter sectors, and (III) for the growth of inhomogeneity, sub-Hubble approximation and linear perturbations are considered. This study is unique in the sense that the reconstruction of $w$ is independent of any derived parameters such as the present values of the matter-energy density parameter and Hubble parameter. From the reconstruction, we look at how the dark energy equation of state evolves between redshifts 0 and 1.5, finding a slight hint of dynamical behavior in dark energy. However, the evidence is not significant. We also find a leaning towards non-phantom behavior over phantom behavior. We observe that the $\Lambda$CDM model ($w=-1$) nearly touches the lower boundary of the 1$\sigma$ confidence region in the redshift range $0.6 \lesssim z \lesssim 0.85$. However, it comfortably resides within the 2$\sigma$ confidence region in the whole redshift range under investigation, $0\leq z \leq 1.5$. Consequently, the non-parametric, model-independent reconstruction of dark energy provides no compelling evidence to deviate from the $\Lambda$CDM model when considering cosmic chronometer and growth rate observations.</description>

      <title>Accelerating universe at early and late times in extended Jordan-Brans-Dicke gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a scenario that can explain the early-time inflation and the late-time dark energy within a unified framework. A scalar potential combining power-law and exponential type in a context of extended Jordan-Brans-Dicke gravity is critically important for this realization. A realistic scenario can be achieved in a two-field model in which one directional motion in field space realizes the slow-roll inflation. The inflaton ends up with oscillatory period and turns its direction to another direction that is identified as the quintessence field, giving rise to the dark energy at late times. The inflaton oscillation is expected to realize efficient heating if parametric amplification works. Along the quintessence direction, the present universe is on the way to reach the asymptotic fixed point. We search for successful parameter region, taking potential function in the form of low-order field powers times decreasing exponential in two dimensional field space.</description>

      <title>Impact of LRG1 and LRG2 in DESI 2024 BAO data on dark energy evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) suggest a preference for a dynamic dark energy model over a cosmological constant. This conclusion emerges from the combination of DESI's BAO data with observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and various type Ia supernova (SN Ia) catalogues. The deviation observed in the cosmological constant ($\Lambda$) reflects a departure from the standard cosmological model. Testing this deviation involves examining the consistency between cosmological parameters derived from early and late-time observations. Specifically, we focus on the matter density parameter $\omega_m = \Omega_mh^2$ and introduce ${\rm ratio}(\omega_m)$ to assess consistency, which is defined as the ratio of $\omega_m$ values constrained by high and low-redshift measurements. This ratio serves as a metric for quantifying deviations from the $\Lambda$CDM model. In this paper, we find that the DESI BAO+CMB yields ${\rm ratio}(\omega_m)=1.0171\pm0.0066$. Upon excluding the LRG1 and LRG2 data in DESI BAO, this ratio adjusts to ${\rm ratio}(\omega_m)=1.0100\pm0.0082$. This shift, corresponding to a change from $2.6\sigma$ to $1.2\sigma$, indicates that the deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model is predominantly driven by these two samples from the DESI BAO measurements. To substantiate this conclusion, we utilized two cosmological model-independent methods to reconstruct the cosmic expansion history. Both reconstructions of the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ indicate that the evolving features of dark energy are determined by the combined LRG1 and LRG2 data. Therefore, different methods have reached the same conclusion, namely the importance of accurately measuring the BAO feature in LRG1 and LRG2 data.</description>

      <title>Cosmological constraints from the full-shape galaxy power spectrum in SDSS-III BOSS using the BACCO hybrid Lagrangian bias emulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel analysis of the redshift-space power spectrum of galaxies in the SDSS-III BOSS survey. Our methodology improves upon previous analyses by using a theoretical model based on cosmological simulations coupled with a perturbative description of the galaxy-matter connection and a phenomenological prescription of Fingers of God. This enables a very robust analysis down to mildly non-linear scales, $k\sim 0.4\,h\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. We carried out a number of tests on mock data, different subsets of BOSS, and using model variations, all of which support the robustness of our analysis. Our results provide constraints on $\sigma_8$, $\Omega_m$, $h$, and $S_8 \equiv \sigma_8 \sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3}$. Specifically, we measure $\Omega_m=0.301\pm 0.011$, $\sigma_8=0.745^{+0.028}_{-0.035}$, $h=0.705\pm 0.015$, and $ S_8 = 0.747^{+0.032}_{-0.039}$ when all the nuisance parameters of our model are left free. By adopting relationships among bias parameters measured in galaxy formation simulations, the value of $S_8$ remains consistent whereas uncertainties are reduced by $\sim20\%$. Our cosmological constraints are some of the strongest obtained with the BOSS power spectrum alone: they exhibit a $2.5-3.5\sigma$ tension with the results of the {\it Planck\/} satellite, agreeing with the lower values of $S_8$ derived from gravitational lensing. However, the cosmological model preferred by {\it Planck\/} is still a good fit to the BOSS data, assuming small departures from physical bias priors and, therefore, cannot be excluded at high significance. We conclude that, at the present, the BOSS data alone does not show strong evidence for a tension between the predictions of $\Lambda$CDM for the high- and low-redshift Universe.</description>

Abstract: We present a stacked lensing analysis of 96 galaxy clusters selected by the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect in maps of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We select foreground galaxy clusters with a $5\sigma$-level SZ threshold in CMB observations from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, while we define background source galaxies for the lensing analysis with secure photometric redshift cuts in Year 3 data of the Subaru Hyper Suprime Cam survey. We detect the stacked lensing signal in the range of $0.1 &lt; R\, [h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}] &lt; 100$ in each of three cluster redshift bins, $0.092&lt;z\le0.445$, $0.445&lt;z\le0.695$, and $0.695&lt;z\le1.180$, with 32 galaxy clusters in each bin. The cumulative signal-to-noise ratios of the lensing signal are $14.6$, $12.0$, and $6.6$, respectively. Using a halo-based forward model, we then constrain statistical relationships between the mass inferred from the SZ observation (i.e. SZ mass) and the total mass derived from our stacked lensing measurements. At the average SZ mass in the cluster sample ($2.1-2.4\times10^{14}\, h^{-1}M_\odot$), our likelihood analysis shows that the average total mass differs from the SZ counterpart by a factor of $1.3 \pm 0.2$, $1.6 \pm 0.2$, and $1.6 \pm 0.3$ ($68\%$) in the aforementioned redshift ranges, respectively. Our limits are consistent with previous lensing measurements, and we find that the cluster modeling choices can introduce a $1\sigma$-level difference in our parameter inferences.</description>

      <title>Violent starbursts and quiescence induced by FUV radiation feedback in metal-poor galaxies at high-redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: JWST observations of galaxies at $z\gtrsim 8$ suggest that they are more luminous and clumpier than predicted by most models, prompting several proposals on the physics of star formation and feedback in the first galaxies. In this paper, we focus on the role of ultraviolet (UV) radiation in regulating star formation by performing a set of cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulations of one galaxy at sub-pc resolution with different radiative feedback models. We find that the suppression of cooling by far UV (FUV) radiation (i.e., $\mathrm{H_2}$ dissociating radiation) from Pop II stars is the main physical process triggering the formation of compact and massive star clusters and is responsible for the bursty star formation observed in metal-poor galaxies at $z\gtrsim 10$. Indeed, artificially suppressing FUV radiation leads to a less intense continuous mode of star formation distributed into numerous, but low-mass open star clusters. Due to the intense FUV field, low-metallicity clouds remain warm ($\sim 10^4\,\mathrm{K}$) until they reach a relatively high density ($\gtrsim 10^3\,\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$), before becoming self-shielded and transitioning to a colder ($\sim 100\,\mathrm{K}$), partially molecular phase. As a result, star formation is delayed until the clouds accumulate enough mass to become gravitationally unstable. At this point, the clouds undergo rapid star formation converting gas into stars with high efficiency. We, therefore, observe exceptionally bright galaxies (ten times brighter than for continuous star formation) and subsequent quenched "dead" galaxies that did not form stars for tens of Myrs.</description>
