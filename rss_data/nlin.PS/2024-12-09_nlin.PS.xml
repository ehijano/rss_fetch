      <title>Obliquely interacting solitary waves and wave wakes in free-surface flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the weakly nonlinear isotropic bi-directional Benney--Luke (BL) equation, which is used to describe oceanic surface and internal waves in shallow water, with a particular focus on soliton dynamics. Using the Whitham modulation theory, we derive the modulation equations associated with the BL equation that describe the evolution of soliton amplitude and slope. By analyzing rarefaction waves and shock waves within these modulation equations, we derive the Riemann invariants and modified Rankine--Hugoniot conditions. These expressions help characterize the Mach expansion and Mach reflection phenomena of bent and reverse bent solitons. We also derive analytical formulas for the critical angle and the Mach stem amplitude, showing that as the soliton speed is in the vicinity of unity, the results from the BL equation align closely with those of the Kadomtsev--Petviashvili (KP) equation. Corresponding numerical results are obtained and show excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. Furthermore, as a far-field approximation for the forced BL equation -- which models wave and flow interactions with local topography -- the modulation equations yield a slowly varying similarity solution. This solution indicates that the precursor wavefronts created by topography moving at subcritical or critical speeds take the shape of a circular arc, in contrast to the parabolic wavefronts observed in the forced KP equation.</description>

      <title>Chimera states in a system of stationary and flying-through deterministic particles with an internal degree of freedom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the effect of the emergence of chimera states in a system of coexisting stationary and flying-through in potential particles with an internal degree of freedom determined by the phase. All particles tend to an equilibrium state with a small number of potential wells, which leads to the emergence of a stationary chimera. An increase in the number of potential wells leads to the emergence of particles flying-through along the medium, the phases of which form a moving chimera. Further, these two structures coexist and interact with each other. In this case, an increase in the local synchronization degree of the chimera is observed in the areas of the synchronous cluster location.</description>
