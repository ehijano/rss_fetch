      <title>Finite-Temperature Study of the Hubbard Model via Enhanced Exponential Tensor Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two-dimensional (2D) Hubbard model has long attracted interest for its rich phase diagram and its relevance to high-$T_c$ superconductivity. However, reliable finite-temperature studies remain challenging due to the exponential complexity of many-body interactions. Here, we introduce an enhanced $1\text{s}^+$ eXponential Tensor Renormalization Group algorithm that enables efficient finite-temperature simulations of the 2D Hubbard model. By exploring an expanded space, our approach achieves two-site update accuracy at the computational cost of a one-site update, and delivers up to 50% acceleration for Hubbard-like systems, which enables simulations down to $T\!\approx\!0.004t$. This advance permits a direct investigation of superconducting order over a wide temperature range and facilitates a comparison with zero-temperature infinite Projected Entangled Pair State simulations. Finally, we compile a comprehensive dataset of snapshots spanning the relevant region of the phase diagram, providing a valuable reference for Artificial Intelligence-driven analyses of the Hubbard model and a comparison with cold-atom experiments.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo study on critical exponents of the classical Heisenberg model in ferromagnetic icosahedral quasicrystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasicrystals (QCs) lack three-dimensional periodicity of atomic arrangement but possess long-range structural order, which are distinct from periodic crystals and random systems. Here, we show how the ferromagnetic (FM) order arises in the icosahedral QC (i-QC) on the basis of the Monte Carlo simulation of the Heisenberg model on the Yb lattice of Cd$_{5.7}$Yb composed of regular icosahedrons. By finite-size scaling of the Monte Carlo data, we identified the critical exponents of the magnetization, magnetic susceptibility, and spin correlation length, $\beta=0.508(30)$, $\gamma=1.361(59)$, and $\nu=0.792(17)$, respectively. We confirmed that our data satisfy the hyperscaling relation and estimated the other critical exponents $\alpha=-0.376(51)$, $\delta=3.68(23)$, and $\eta=0.282(65)$. These results show a new universality class inherent in the i-QC, which is different from those in periodic magnets and spin glasses. In the i-QC, each Yb site at vertices of the regular icosahedrons is classified into 8 classes with respect to the coordination numbers of the nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor bonds. We revealed the FM-transition mechanism by showing that the difference in the local environment of each site is governed by cooperative evolution of spin correlations upon cooling, giving rise to the critical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Linear and isotropic magnetoresistance of Co$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$Si at x=0.2; 0.4; 0.65</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied the magnetoresistance (MR) of well-characterized samples of Co$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$Si at x=0.2, 0.4, and 0.65 at temperatures between 1.8 and 100~K and magnetic fields of 9~T. The quasilinear dependence of MR on the magnetic field at low temperatures and the practically isotropic properties of MR in these compounds are tentatively attributed to the specifics of Weyl electron spectra and general disorder of the materials.</description>

      <title>Immobile and mobile excitations of three-spin interactions on the diamond chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a solvable one-dimensional spin-1/2 model on the diamond chain featuring three-spin interactions, which displays both, mobile excitations driving a second-order phase transition between an ordered and a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetry broken phase, as well as non-trivial fully immobile excitations. The model is motivated by the physics of fracton excitations, which only possess mobility in a reduced dimension compared to the full model. We provide an exact mapping of this model to an arbitrary number of independent transverse-field Ising chain segments with open boundary conditions. The number and lengths of these segments correspond directly to the number of immobile excitations and their respective distances from one another. Furthermore, we demonstrate that multiple immobile excitations exhibit Casimir-like forces between them, resulting in a non-trivial spectrum.</description>

      <title>Quantum Spin Liquids Stabilized by Disorder in Non-Kramers Pyrochlores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the emergence of quantum spin liquid phases in pyrochlore oxides with non-Kramers ions, driven by structural randomness that effectively acts as a transverse field, introducing quantum fluctuations on top of the spin ice manifold. This is contrary to the naive expectation that disorder favors phases with short-range entanglement by adjusting the spins with their local environment. Given this unusual situation, it is essential to assess the stability of the spin-liquid phase with respect to the disorder. To perform this study, a minimal model for disordered quantum spin ice, the transverse-field Ising model, is analyzed using a formulation of gauge mean-field theory (GMFT) directly in real space. This approach allows the inclusion of disorder effects exactly and provides access to non-perturbative effects. The analysis shows that the quantum spin ice remains remarkably stable with respect to disorder up to the transition to the polarized phase at high fields, indicating that it can occur in real materials. Moreover, the Griffiths region of enhanced disorder-induced fluctuations appears tiny and restricted to the immediate vicinity of this transition due to the uniqueness of the low-energy excitations of the problem. For most of the phase diagram, an average description of the disorder captures the physical behavior well, indicating that the inhomogeneous quantum spin ice behaves closely to its homogeneous counterpart.</description>

      <title>How to Build Anomalous (3+1)d Topological Quantum Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a systematic framework for constructing (3+1)-dimensional topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) that realize specified anomalies of finite symmetries, as encountered in gauge theories with fermions or fermionic lattice systems. Our approach generalizes the Wang-Wen-Witten symmetry-extension construction to the fermionic setting, building on two recent advances in the study of fermionic TQFTs and related homotopy theory. The first is the categorical classification of anomalous TQFTs in (3+1)d. The second, which we develop further in a planned sequel to this paper, is a hastened Adams spectral sequence for computing supercohomology groups, closely paralleling techniques from cobordism theory. By integrating supercohomology and cobordism methods within the recently developed categorical framework of fusion 2-categories, we provide a concrete and systematic route to constructing fermionic TQFTs with specified anomalies, thereby establishing a conceptual bridge between anomaly realization, cobordism, and higher-categorical structures.</description>

      <title>A Universal Scaling Law for $T_c$ in Unconventional Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the pairing mechanism of unconventional superconductors remains a core challenge in condensed matter physics, particularly the ongoing debate over whether the related effects caused by electron-electron interactions unify various unconventional superconductors (UcSs). To address this challenge, it is necessary to establish a universal quantitative relationship for the superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$), which can be directly obtained from experiments and correlated with microscopic parameters of different material systems. In this work, we establish a relation: $N_{\text{CP}}\cdot k_{B}T_{c}^\star = \alpha\cdot U $, where $\alpha = 1/(16\pi)$ is a universal constant, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T_{c}^\star$ is the maximal $T_{c}$, $U$ is the on-site Coulomb interaction, and $N_{\text{CP}}$($\propto(\xi_0/a)^D$) quantifies the spatial extent of Cooper pairs ($\xi_0$) relative to lattice parameter ($a$) in $D$ dimensions. The validity of this scaling relationship is empirically demonstrated, across a four order-of-magnitude $T_c^\star$ range (0.08--133 K), by database from 173 different compounds spanning 13 different UcS families in over 500 experiments. The fact that the unified relationship is satisfied by different materials of different UcS families reveals that they may share superconducting mechanisms. In addition, the scaling relationship indicates the existence of a maximum $T_{c}^\star$ determined by the minimum $N_{\text{CP}}$, providing a benchmark for theoretical and experimental exploration of high-temperature superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Contactless cavity sensing of superfluid stiffness in atomically thin 4Hb-TaS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exceptional tunability of two-dimensional van der Waals materials offers unique opportunities for exploring novel superconducting phases. However, in such systems, the measurement of superfluid phase stiffness, a fundamental property of a superconductor, is challenging because of the mesoscopic sample size. Here, we introduce a contact-free technique for probing the electrodynamic response, and thereby the phase stiffness, of atomically thin superconductors using on-chip superconducting microwave resonators. We demonstrate this technique on 4Hb-TaS$_2$, a van der Waals superconductor whose gap structure under broken mirror symmetry is under debate. In our cleanest few-layer device, we observe a superconducting critical temperature comparable to that of the bulk. The temperature evolution of the phase stiffness features nodeless behavior in the presence of broken mirror symmetry, inconsistent with the scenario of nodal surface superconductivity. With minimal fabrication requirements, our technique enables microwave measurements across wide ranges of two-dimensional superconductors.</description>

      <title>Spin Seebeck Effect in Correlated Antiferromagnetic V2O3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spin Seebeck effect is useful for probing the spin correlations and magnetic order in magnetic insulators. Here, we report a strong longitudinal spin Seebeck effect (LSSE) in antiferromagnetic V2O3 thin films. The LSSE response at cryogenic temperatures increases as a function of the external magnetic field until it approaches saturation. The response at given power and field exhibits a non-monotonic temperature dependence, with a pronounced peak that shifts toward higher temperatures as the field increases. Furthermore, the magnitude of the LSSE signal decreases consistently with increasing thickness, implying that the bulk SSE dominates any interfacial contribution. This negative correlation between the SSE and the thickness implies that the magnon energy relaxation length in V2O3 is shorter than the thickness of our thinnest film, 50 nm, consistent with the strong spin-lattice coupling in this material.</description>

      <title>Spatially Inhomogeneous Triplet Pairing Order and Josephson Diode Effect Induced by Frustrated Spin Textures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that frustrated spin textures can generate anisotropic Josephson couplings between $d$-vectors that can stabilize spatially varying pairing orders in spin triplet superconductors. These couplings depend on the relative orientation of $d$-vectors, analogous to Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and $\Gamma$-type interactions in magnetism, leading to an effective "pliability" of the pairing order that competes with superfluid stiffness. Such couplings cannot originate from spin-orbit coupling; rather, they can arise, for example, when itinerant electrons are coupled to a local exchange field composed of frustrated spin moments. Using a $T$-matrix expansion, we show that coupling to a local exchange field leads to an effective tunneling of itinerant electrons that is dependent on the underlying spin configurations at the barrier between superconducting grains. Furthermore, Josephson tunneling through frustrated spin textures can produce a Josephson diode effect. The diode effect originates either from nonvanishing spin chirality in the barrier, or from antisymmetric Josephson coupling between noncollinear $d$-vectors, both of which break inversion and time-reversal symmetries.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in overdoped cuprates can be understood from a BCS perspective!</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We summarize key experimental studies of the low energy properties of overdoped cuprate high temperature superconductors and conclude that a theoretical understanding of the "essential physics" is achievable in terms of a conventional Fermi-liquid treatment of the normal state, and a BCS mean-field treatment of the (d-wave) superconducting state. For this perspective to be consistent, it is necessary to posit that there is a crossover from a strongly correlated underdoped regime (where a different theoretical perspective is necessary) to the more weakly correlated overdoped regime. It is also necessary to argue that the various observed features of the overdoped materials that are inconsistent with this perspective can be attributed to the expected effects of the intrinsic disorder associated with most of the materials being solid state solutions (alloys). As a test of this idea, we make a series of falsifiable predictions concerning the expected behavior of "ideal" (disorder free) overdoped cuprates.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field-temperature competition and quantum criticality in a strange metal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11914v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strange metals defy the quasiparticle description of conventional metals, exhibiting a linear in temperature ($T$-linear) resistivity in a broad temperature range. It has become increasingly clear that, together with $T$-linear resistivity, strange metals exhibit a characteristic response in strong magnetic fields, which might point to the quantum critical origin of the strange metal behavior. To explore the effects of strong magnetic fields on the dynamics of quantum fluctuations in a strange metal, here we report the thermodynamic study of electronic density of states on the Fermi surface in CeCoIn$_5$. Using ultrafast nanocalorimeters, we access the electronic density of states at low temperatures and high magnetic fields through two independent thermodynamic probes -- the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate and the electronic specific heat -- measured simultaneously on the same crystal. Both thermodynamic probes exhibit magnetic field and temperature competition, characteristic of quantum criticality, indicating that magnetic field acts as a cutoff for the dynamics of quantum critical fluctuations in CeCoIn$_5$. However, at low temperatures and high magnetic fields, the electronic specific heat and the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate cannot be understood solely in terms of a critical enhancement of the electronic density of states at the Fermi surface. This indicates that quantum criticality in CeCoIn$_5$ involves both local and itinerant fluctuating critical modes.</description>

      <title>Numerical demonstration of Abelian fractional statistics of composite fermions in the spherical geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14880v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall (FQH) fluids host quasiparticle excitations that carry a fraction of the electronic charge. Moreover, in contrast to bosons and fermions that carry exchange statistics of $0$ and $\pi$ respectively, these quasiparticles of FQH fluids, when braided around one another, can accumulate a Berry phase, which is a fractional multiple of $\pi$. Deploying the spherical geometry, we numerically demonstrate that composite fermion particle (CFP) excitations in the Jain FQH states carry Abelian fractional statistics. Previously, the exchange statistics of CFPs were studied in the disk geometry, where the statistics get obscured due to a shift in the phase arising from the addition of another CFP, making its determination cumbersome without prior knowledge of the shift. We show that on the sphere this technical issue can be circumvented and the statistics of CFPs can be obtained more transparently. The ideas we present can be extended to determine the statistics of quasiparticles arising in certain non-Abelian partonic FQH states.</description>

      <title>Non-Fermi-Liquid Transport Phenomena in Infinite-Layer Nickelates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently discovered superconducting infinite-layer nickelates $R$NiO$_2$ ($R$=Nd, La, Pr) attract increasing attention due to their similarities to cuprates. Both $R$NiO$_2$ and YBCO cuprates exhibit the non-Fermi-liquid transport behavior, characterized by resistivity proportional to temperature near the quantum critical point of the charge or spin density wave. In this study, we analyze the resistivity of infinite-layer nickelate Nd$_{0.85}$Sr$_{0.15}$NiO$_2$ based on a three-dimensional tight-binding model within the framework of the quasi-particle picture by applying linear response theory. We take account of the self-energy by the fluctuation-exchange approximation for the Ni orbital and the T-matrix approximation for an impurity effect on the Nd orbitals. We find that (i) the $T$-linear resistivity at low temperatures is derived from the spin fluctuations, and (ii) a negative and $T$-linear Seebeck coefficient is obtained. Therefore, NdNiO$_2$ behaves as a quasi-two-dimensional electron system, similar to CeCoIn$_5$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17291v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutron diffraction experiments of TmFeO$_3$ single crystals were performed in the external magnetic fields. The field along $c$-axis increases temperature of spin-reorientation transition TSR from phase ${\Gamma}4$ to ${\Gamma}2$. Application of the field along $b$-axis led to the decrease of TSR and to the formation of new phases. Based on the temperature and field dependence of the Bragg reflection intensity, the configuration of magnetically induced phases was proposed. The magneto-structural effects were observed.</description>

      <title>Fragility of local moments against hybridization with flat bands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kondo screening of a localized magnetic moment crucially depends on the spectral properties of the electronic bath to which it is coupled. Unlike textbook examples, realistic systems as well as dynamical mean-field theory of correlated lattice models force us to explicitly consider sharp features in the hybridization function near the Fermi energy. A case currently under the spotlight is twisted bilayer graphene, where the hybridization function of the heavy-fermion-like bands to the itinerant ones displays a divergence. We clarify how this impacts the screening mechanisms by means of a toy model with a tunable $\delta$-peak in the hybridization function, superimposed to a regular part. Our analysis unveils an unexpectedly big impact on the Kondo screening already for a parametrically small weight of the flat band in the bath.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review quantum tunneling provoked by external field driving, focusing on the role of geometric effects. The discussion begins with an overview of tunneling phenomena, including the Landau-Zener model and the Schwinger effect, both of which are essential frameworks to describe the generation of elementary excitation of the system. We also refer to the relation between the modern theory of polarization and the geometry of the system, and introduce the shift vector via adiabatic perturbation theory. Then we introduce the twisted Landau-Zener model and shown how the shift vector modulates tunneling probability, followed by several illustrative applications of this model. We also explain the Keldysh crossover, which is the crossover from a quantum tunneling regime to photon absorption regime in driven systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report dielectric and magnetoelectric studies of single-crystalline \ce{CeMgAl11O19}, a Kramers triangular magnet embedded in a polarizable hexaaluminate lattice. In zero magnetic field, the permittivity $\varepsilon'(T)$ follows the Barrett law of a quantum paraelectric down to 25 K, below which a broad minimum develops near 3 K without evidence of static ferroelectric or magnetic order. Application of magnetic fields up to \SI{9}{\tesla} shifts this minimum to higher temperatures and broadens it, evidencing a tunable magnetoelectric response.The magnetoelectric coupling was characterized using results from magnetization measurements. The anomaly temperature $T^*$, extracted from the local minimum of $\varepsilon'(T)$, exhibits a linear dependence on the squared magnetization $M^2$, consistent with the biquadratic magnetoelectric coupling allowed in centrosymmetric systems. This magnetoelectric effect, mediated by spin-orbit-entangled Kramers doublets interacting with a frustrated antipolar liquid, establishes \ce{CeMgAl11O19} as a prototype for exploring quantum magnetoelectricity in frustrated systems.</description>

      <title>Yamaji effect in models of underdoped cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent angle-dependent magnetoresistance measurements in underdoped cuprates have revealed compelling evidence for small hole pockets in the pseudogap regime, including observation of the Yamaji effect in HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$ (Chan et al., Nature Physics 10.1038/s41567-025-03032-2 (2025)). A key distinction between theories is their predicted Fermi volumes, measured as fractions of the square lattice Brillouin zone: $p/4$ per pocket for spin density wave (SDW) versus $p/8$ for fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*), where $p$ is the hole doping. We calculate the $c$-axis magnetoresistance $\rho_{zz}(\theta, \phi)$ within the semiclassical Boltzmann formalism for both states, and using the ancilla layer model (ALM) for FL* in a single-band Hamiltonian. The results from the $\text{FL}^*$ phase show good consistency with current experimental data. Conversely, the results for the SDW phase are highly sensitive to the ordering momentum along the $z$-direction. An ordering vector of $Q = (\pi, \pi, \pi)$ yields predictions that starkly disagree with the experiment. The only possibility for agreement within the SDW scenario is to assume an ordering momentum of $Q = (\pi, \pi, 0)$. However, even in this specific case, the SDW scenario predicts a marginally smaller Yamaji angle at $\phi=0$ than the FL* theory, and a second Yamaji peak near in-plane angle $\phi = 45^\circ$, which was not observed in the experiment. In reality, the N\'eel ordering vector is likely uncorrelated between adjacent layers, so that there is no coherent interlayer transport of hole-pocket quasiparticles in the SDW scenario, and consequently no Yamaji effect. Our results support the FL* interpretation of Fermi arcs in the pseudogap phase, and establish Yamaji angle measurements as a discriminatory tool between theoretical models.</description>

Abstract: The study of quasiparticle dynamics is central to understanding non-equilibrium phenomena in quantum many-body systems. Direct simulation of such dynamics on quantum hardware has been limited by circuit depth and noise constraints. In this work, we use a recently developed constant-depth circuit algorithm to examine the real-time evolution of site-resolved magnetization in a transverse-field Ising chain on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. By representing each spin as a pair of Majorana fermions, we identify two distinct dynamical regimes governed by the relative strength of spin interaction. Furthermore, we show how local impurities can serve as probes of Majorana modes, acting as dynamical barriers in the weak coupling regime. These results demonstrate that constant-depth quantum circuits provide a viable route for studying quasiparticle propagation and for probing Majorana signatures on currently available quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of the phase transition of the massive Thirring model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in quantum computing technology have enabled the study of fermionic systems at finite temperature via quantum simulations. This presents a novel approach to investigating the chiral phase transition in such systems. Among these, the quantum minimally entangled typical thermal states~(QMETTS) algorithm has recently attracted considerable interest. The massive Thirring model, which exhibits a variety of phenomena at low temperatures, includes both a chiral phase transition and a topologically non-trivial ground state. It therefore raises the intriguing question of whether its phase transition can be studied using a quantum simulation approach. In this study, the chiral phase transition of the massive Thirring model and its dual topological phase transition are studied using the QMETTS algorithm. Numerical results are obtained on a classical computer simulating circuit-based quantum computations. The results show that QMETTS is able to accurately reproduce the phase transition and thermodynamic properties of the massive Thirring model.</description>

      <title>Many-body localization and particle multioccupancy in the disordered Bose-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the potential influence of the particle multi-occupations on the stability of many-body localization in the disordered Bose-Hubbard model. Within the higher-energy section of the dynamical phase diagram, we find that there is no apparent finite-size boundary drift between the thermal phase and the many-body localized regime. We substantiate this observation by introducing the Van Vleck perturbation theory into the field of many-body localization. The appropriateness of this method rests largely on the peculiar Hilbert-space structure enabled by the particles' Bose statistics. The situation is reversed in the lower-energy section of the dynamical phase diagram, where the significant finite-size boundary drift pushes the putative many-body localized regime up to the greater disorder strengths. We utilize the algebraic projection method to make a connection linking the disordered Bose-Hubbard model in the lower-energy section to an intricate disordered spin chain model. This issue of the finite-size drift could hence be analogous to what happens in the disordered Heisenberg chain. Both trends might be traced back to the particles' intrinsic or emergent single-occupancy constraint like the spin-$1/2$, hard-core boson, or spinless fermion degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Neuralized Fermionic Tensor Networks for Quantum Many-Body Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08329v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a class of neuralized fermionic tensor network states (NN-fTNS) that introduce non-linearity into fermionic tensor networks through configuration-dependent neural network transformations of the local tensors. The construction uses the fTNS algebra to implement a natural fermionic sign structure and is compatible with standard tensor network algorithms, but gains enhanced expressivity through the neural network parametrization. Using the 1D and 2D Fermi-Hubbard models as benchmarks, we demonstrate that NN-fTNS achieve order of magnitude improvements in the ground-state energy compared to pure fTNS with the same bond dimension, and can be systematically improved through both the tensor network bond dimension and the neural network parametrization. Compared to existing fermionic neural quantum states (NQS) based on Slater determinants and Pfaffians, NN-fTNS offer a physically motivated alternative fermionic structure. Furthermore, compared to such states, NN-fTNS naturally exhibit improved computational scaling and we demonstrate a construction that achieves linear scaling with the lattice size.</description>

      <title>Expansion dynamics of strongly correlated lattice bosons: A selfconsistent density-matrix approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the spatio-temporal dynamics of interacting bosons on a two-dimensional Hubbard lattice in the strongly interacting regime, taking into account the dynamics of condensate amplitude as well as the direct transport of non-condensed fluctuations. To that end we develop a selfconsistent density-matrix approach which goes beyond the standard Gutzwiller mean-field theory. Starting from the Liouville-von-Neumann equation we derive a quantum master equation for the time evolution of the system's local density matrix at each lattice site, with a dynamical bath that represents the rest of the system. We apply this method to the expansion dynamics of an initially prepared cloud of interacting bosons in an optical lattice. We observe a ballistic expansion of the condensate, as expected, followed by slow, diffusive transport of the normal bosons. We discuss, in particular, the robustness of the Mott insulator phase as well as its melting due to incoherent transport. The method should be applicable to various models of lattice bosons in the strongly correlated regime.</description>

      <title>Simulating the interplay of dipolar and quadrupolar interactions in NMR by spin dynamic mean-field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17720v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The simulation of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments is a notoriously difficult task, if many spins participate in the dynamics. The recently established dynamic mean-field theory for high-temperature spin systems (spinDMFT) represents an efficient yet accurate method to deal with this scenario. SpinDMFT reduces a complex lattice system to a time-dependent single-site problem, which can be solved numerically with small computational effort. Since the approach retains local quantum degrees of freedom, a quadrupolar term can be exactly incorporated. This allows us to study the interplay of dipolar and quadrupolar interactions for any parameter range, i.e., without the need for a perturbative treatment. We highlight the relevance of local quantum effects by a comparison with the classical analogue system.</description>

      <title>The effect of dephasing and spin-lattice relaxation during the switching processes in quantum antiferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The control of antiferromagnetic order can pave the way to large storage capacity as well as fast manipulation of stored data. Here achieving a steady-state of sublattice magnetization after switching is crucial to prevent loss of stored data. The present theoretical approach aims to obtain instantaneous stable states of the order after reorienting the N\'eel vector in open quantum antiferromagnets using time-dependent Schwinger boson mean-field theory. The Lindblad formalism is employed to couple the system to the environment. The quantum theoretical approach comprises differences in the effects of dephasing, originating from destructive interference of different wave vectors, and spin-lattice relaxation. We show that the spin-lattice relaxation results in an exponentially fast convergence to the steady-state after full ultrafast switching.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological Noise Models and Optimal Thresholds of the 3D Toric Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) topological codes offer the advantage of supporting fault-tolerant implementations of non-Clifford gates, yet their performance against realistic noise remains largely unexplored. In this work, we focus on the paradigmatic 3D toric code and investigate its fault-tolerance thresholds in the presence of both Pauli and measurement errors. Two randomly coupled lattice gauge models that describe the code's correctability are derived, including a random 2-form $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory. By exploiting a generalized duality technique, we show that the 3D toric code exhibits optimal thresholds of $p^{X,M}_{th} \approx 11\%$ and $p^{Z,M}_{th} \approx 2\%$ against bit-flip and phase-flip errors, respectively. These threshold values show modest reductions compared to the case of perfect measurements, establishing the robustness of the 3D toric code against measurement errors. Our results constitute a substantial advance towards assessing the practical performance of 3D topological codes. This contribution is timely and in high demand, as rapid hardware advancements are bringing complex codes into experimental reach. Moreover, our work highlights the interdisciplinary nature of fault-tolerant quantum computation and holds significant interest for quantum information science, high-energy physics, and condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Distinct Types of Parent Hamiltonians for Quantum States: Insights from the $W$ State as a Quantum Many-Body Scar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The construction of parent Hamiltonians that possess a given state as their ground state is a well-studied problem. In this work, we generalize this notion by considering simple quantum states and examining the local Hamiltonians that have these states as exact eigenstates. These states often correspond to Quantum Many-Body Scars (QMBS) of their respective parent Hamiltonians. Motivated by earlier works on Hamiltonians with QMBS, in this work we formalize the differences between three distinct types of parent Hamiltonians, which differ in their decompositions into strictly local terms with the same eigenstates. We illustrate this classification using the $W$ state as the primary example, for which we rigorously derive the complete set of local parent Hamiltonians, which also allows us to establish general results such as the existence of asymptotic QMBS, and distinct dynamical signatures associated with the different parent Hamiltonian types. Finally, we derive more general results on the parent Hamiltonian types that allow us to obtain some immediate results for simple quantum states such as product states, where only a single type exists, and for short-range-entangled states, for which we identify constraints on the admissible types. Altogether, our work opens the door to classifying the rich structures and dynamical properties of parent Hamiltonians that arise from the interplay between locality and QMBS.</description>
