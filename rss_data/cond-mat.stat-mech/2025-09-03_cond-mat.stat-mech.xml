      <title>Statistical Mechanics of Paraparticles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics broadly classifies the particles into two categories: $(1)$ fermions and $(2)$ bosons. Fermions are half-integer spin particles, obeying Pauli's exclusion principle and Fermi-Dirac statistics. Whereas bosons are integer spin particles, not obeying Pauli's exclusion principle, and obeying Bose-Einstein statistics. However, there are two exceptions to this standard case: first, anyons, which exist in 2-dimensional systems, and secondly, paraparticles, which can exist in any dimension. Paraparticles follow their non-trivial parastatistics, obeying their generalised exclusion principle. In this paper, we provide a detailed review of the foundations of paraparticle statistics established in \cite{wang2025particle}. We extend this work further and then derive an important expression for the heat capacity of paraparticles for a specific case, which would provide a handle for the experimental detection of paraparticles in appropriate systems.</description>

      <title>Pattern formation in a coupled driven diffusive system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate pattern formation in a driven mixture of two repulsive particles by introducing a Field-based Lattice Model (FLM), a hybrid model that combines aspects of the driven Widom-Rowlison lattice gas (DWRLG) and its statistical field theory \cite{DWRLG1,DWRLG2}. We find that the FLM effectively captures the bulk behavior of the DWRLG in both low- and high-density phases, suggesting that phase transitions in these models may share a universality class. Under the effect of the drive, the FLM additionally reveals an intermediate regime, not reported in the previous DWRLG studies, characterized by ``irregular stripes" with widely fluctuating widths, contrasting with the ``regular", well-ordered stripes found at higher densities. In this intermediate phase, the system exhibits long-range order, predominantly perpendicular to the drive direction. To construct a continuum description, we derive two coupled partial differential equations via a gradient expansion of the FLM mean mass-transfer equations, supplemented with additive noise. Designing a numerical solver using the pseudospectral method with dealiasing and stochastic time differencing, we reproduce the low-density microemulsion phase (characterized by a non-zero characteristic wavenumber $q^*$) and perpendicular stripes at high density. We identify the non-zero difference in the characteristic velocities of the fields as a necessary condition for perpendicular stripe formation in the high-density phase. The continuum model also uncovers novel behaviors not previously observed in the FLM, such as stripes aligned parallel to the drive and chaotic patterns. This work highlights how the interplay of external drive, particle interactions, and noise can lead to a rich phenomenology in strongly driven binary mixtures.</description>

      <title>Impact of periodic thermal driving on heat fluctuations in a harmonic system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermodynamics of mesoscopic systems driven by time-varying temperatures is crucial for understanding biological systems, designing nanoscale engines, and performing micro-particle cooling. In this work, we analyze an underdamped Brownian particle in a harmonic trap under a sinusoidal thermal protocol. Through analytical methods and numerical simulations, we analyze the system's dynamics and heat statistics. We report the emergence of resonant position-velocity correlations and a non-Gaussian, asymmetric heat distribution consistent with the Fluctuation Theorem. We demonstrate that inertia is a key parameter, damping the system's response and slowing its relaxation to a periodic non-equilibrium steady state. Our results show that oscillatory thermal driving is a powerful tool for controlling nanoscale energy flow.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Two-temperature Nonequilibrium Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nonequilibrium stationary state (NESS) of the two-dimensional Ising model under a stochastic dichotomous modulation of temperature, which alternates between $T_c \pm \delta$ around the critical temperature $T_c$ at a rate $\gamma$. Both magnetization and energy exhibit non-monotonic dependence on $\gamma$, explained by a renewal approach in the slow-switching limit, while for small $\delta$ dynamical response theory quantitatively captures the $\gamma$-dependence of the observables. In the fast-switching regime, the NESS appears Boltzmann-like with a $\gamma$-dependent effective temperature. However, a finite energy current flowing through the system from hot to cold reservoir confirms the intrinsic nonequilibrium nature of the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Infinite-temperature quantum phases and phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we reveal nontrivial quantum physics in an infinite-temperature system. By performing an unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we study a hybrid model composed of hard-core bosons, whose hopping amplitude is mediated by the density of another type of soft-core bond bosons that can absorb entropy indefinitely. It is shown that the Bose-Einstein condensate can persist in three dimensions even when the temperature approaches the infinite-temperature limit. In contrast, in two dimensions, the quasi-superfluid is depleted by the fluctuations of the bond bosons, which, on the other hand, enhance the conductivity of the hard-core bosons in the normal phase. A generalization to the fermionic model has also been discussed.</description>

      <title>Effective diffusion of Brownian motion in spatially quasi-periodic noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effective diffusion of Brownian particles in periodic potential has been a central topic in nonequilibrium statistical physcis. A classical result is the Lifson formula which provides the effective diffusion constant in periodic potentials. Extending beyong periodicity, our recent work [arXiv:2504.16527] has demonstrated that a modified Lifson expression remains valid for Brownian motion in quasi-periodic potentials. In this work, we extend our previous results by incorporating spatial quasi-periodic noise and examining different stochastic interpretations, $\alpha\in[0,1]$. The proposed framework is simple, computationally efficient, and unifies the treatment of diffusion in both periodic and quasi-periodic systems.</description>

      <title>Short-time blowup statistics of a Brownian particle in repulsive potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of an overdamped Brownian particle in a repulsive scale-invariant potential $V(x) \sim -x^{n+1}$. For $n &gt; 1$, a particle starting at position $x$ reaches infinity in a finite, randomly distributed time. We focus on the short-time tail $T \to 0$ of the probability distribution $P(T, x, n)$ of the blowup time $T$ for integer $n &gt; 1$. Krapivsky and Meerson [Phys. Rev. E \textbf{112}, 024128 (2025)] recently evaluated the leading-order asymptotics of this tail, which exhibits an $n$-dependent essential singularity at $T = 0$. Here we provide a more accurate description of the $T \to 0$ tail by calculating, for all $n = 2, 3, \dots$, the previously unknown large pre-exponential factor of the blowup-time probability distribution. To this end, we apply a WKB approximation -- at both leading and subleading orders -- to the Laplace-transformed backward Fokker--Planck equation governing $P(T, x, n)$. For even $n$, the WKB solution alone suffices. For odd $n$, however, the WKB solution breaks down in a narrow boundary layer around $x = 0$. In this case, it must be supplemented by an ``internal'' solution and a matching procedure between the two solutions in their common region of validity.</description>

      <title>The non-perturbative sides of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation is a celebrated non-linear stochastic equation yielding non-equilibrium universal scaling. It exhibits notorious non-perturbative aspects. The KPZ fixed point is strong-coupling, all the more in $d&gt;1$. Strikingly, another, even stronger-coupling fixed point of the KPZ equation, called inviscid Burgers fixed point, has been recently unveiled. These non-pertubative features can be theoretically accessed and studied in a controlled way in all dimensions using the functional renormalisation group. We propose an overview of the related results, which provide the full picture of the fixed-point structure and associated scaling regimes of the KPZ equation in $d=1$ and in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Loschmidt echoes from operator growth in noisy quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of Loschmidt echoes in noisy quantum many-body systems without conservation laws. We first show that the operator Loschmidt echo in noisy unitary dynamics is equivalent to the operator norm of the corresponding dissipative dynamics upon noise averaging. We then analyze this quantity in two complementary ways, revealing universal dynamical behavior. First, we develop a heuristic picture for generic Floquet systems that connects Loschmidt echoes, out-of-time-order correlators, and operator growth, which is valid at any dissipation strength. We assert that the Loschmidt echo has two dynamical regimes depending on the time $t$ and the strength of the noise $p$: Gaussian decay for $pt\ll1$ and exponential decay (with a noise-independent decay rate) for $pt\gg1$. Lastly, we rigorously prove all our results for a solvable chaotic many-body quantum circuit, the dissipative random phase model -- thus providing exact insight into dissipative quantum chaos.</description>

      <title>Disorder-aided Early Warning Signals: Predicting Catastrophic Shifts in Athermal Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The early prediction of tipping points, distinguished by sudden and catastrophic shifts from stable states, poses a challenging task that would enable us to assess the impending threat across natural and engineered systems. This threat becomes particularly acute in low-fluctuation environments, where tipping occurs through saddle-node bifurcation without prior warning in noise dynamics. In this study, we investigate the tipping point dynamics of avalanche catastrophes in low-fluctuation domain, employing model system like the zero temperature random field Ising model and thermally deposited cobalt films. As the system approaches the tipping point, avalanche activity reveals pronounced critical behaviour, including critical slowing down, variance enhancement, and a growing spatial correlation length--hallmarks that may serve as early warning signals of impending collapse. Crucially, we demonstrate that increasing disorder in the system reduces its vulnerability to catastrophic failure. In highly disorder regimes, these early warning signals emerge well before the transition, thereby providing a large margin for anticipation and mitigation. This key finding suggests a protective role of disorder offering a novel perspective on resilience in complex systems. Our results not only deepen the understanding of tipping phenomena in disorder materials but also have broader implications for forecasting regime shift in diverse real-world systems.</description>

      <title>Reduced fidelities for free fermions out of equilibrium: From dynamical quantum phase transitions to Mpemba effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the out-of-equilibrium dynamics after a quantum quench of the reduced fidelities between the states of a subregion $A$ at different times. Precisely, we consider the fidelity between the time-dependent state of $A$ and its initial value, as well as with the state at infinite time. We denote these fidelities as the reduced Loschmidt echo (RLE) and the final-state fidelity (FSF), respectively. If region $A$ is the full systems, the RLE coincide with the standard Loschmidt echo. We focus on quenches from Gaussian states in several instances of the XY spin chain. In the hydrodynamic limit of long times and large sizes of $A$, with their ratio fixed, the reduced fidelities admit a quasiparticle picture interpretation. Interestingly, for some quenches in the hydrodynamic regime the RLE features a complicated structure with an infinite sequence of nested lightcones, corresponding to quasiparticles with arbitrary large group velocities. This leads to a ''staircase'' of cusp-like singularities in the time-derivative of the fidelity. At the sub-hydrodynamic regime for some quenches the RLE exhibits cusp-like singularities, similar to the so-called dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPT). We conjecture a criterion for the occurrence of the DQPT and for the ''critical'' times at which the singularities occur. Finally, we discuss the hydrodynamic limit of the FSF. In particular, we show that it provides a valuable tool to detect the so-called quantum Mpemba effect.</description>

      <title>Generalized R\'enyi Entropy Production Rate in Non-equilibrium Systems: From Markov Processes to Chaotic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A generalization of the entropy production rate is proposed $\Pi_q$ in non-equilibrium systems by extending the formalism of classical stochastic thermodynamics to regimes with non-Gaussian fluctuations. Through the R\'enyi entropy $S_q$ , where entropic parameter $q$ modulates critical fluctuations, it is defined $\Pi_q$ and the postulated generalized $q$-affinity ${\cal A}_q$ for Markov processes, where it is demonstrated that $\Pi_q \geq 0$, generalizing the second thermodynamics law.The derived formal framework was applied to the R\"ossler model, a nonlinear dynamical system exhibiting chaos. Numerical simulations show that the entropy production rate $\Pi_q$ can be used as an index of robustness and complexity by quantitatively corroborating the greater robustness of funnel-type chaos compared to spiral-type chaos. Our results reveal limitations of Gibbs-Shannon entropy in capturing non-Gaussian fluctuations induced by nonlinearity. On the contrary, it is found that $\Pi_q$ it can be a suitable magnitude to measure the intensity of chaotic dynamics through the entropy parameter $q$ , indicating a plausible link with Lyapunov exponents. The proposed formal framework extends the scope of stochastic thermodynamics to complex systems, integrating chaotic dynamics and the role of the entropic index q as a source of irreversibility and in capturing non-Gaussian contributions to entropy production.</description>

      <title>The Crooks relationship in single molecule pulling simulations of coupled harmonic oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose two models of coupled harmonic oscillators under Brownian motion to computationally study the applications of fluctuation theorems. This paper also illustrates how to analytically calculate free energy differences for these systems. The computational results clearly show that Crooks relation is able to predict free energy differences between initial and final canonical ensembles with around $1\%$ accuracy by using probability distributions of cumulative work done during nonequilibrium protocols carried out with velocities up to three orders of magnitude larger than the quasi-stationary evolution velocity. The curves of instantaneous force and cumulative work for the second model resemble those obtained experimentally on the unfolding of ARN molecules. Hence, the proposed systems are not just useful to illustrate the performance and conceptual significance of the fluctuation theorems, but also they could be studied as simplified models for biophysical systems.</description>

      <title>Intermittent localization and fast spatial learning by non-Markov random walks with decaying memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01806v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random walks on lattices with preferential relocation to previously visited sites provide a simple modeling of the displacements of animals and humans. When the lattice contains a single impurity or resource site where the walker spends more time on average at each visit than on the other sites, the long range memory can suppress diffusion and induce by reinforcement a steady state localized around the resource. This phenomenon can be identified with a spatial learning process by the walker. Here we study theoretically and numerically how the decay of memory impacts learning in these models. If memory decays as $1/\tau$ or slower, where $\tau$ is the time backward into the past, the localized solutions are the same as with perfect, non-decaying memory and they are linearly stable. If forgetting is faster than $1/\tau$, for instance exponential, an unusual regime of intermittent localization is observed, where well localized periods of exponentially distributed duration are interspersed with intervals of diffusive motion. At the transition between the two regimes, for a kernel in $1/\tau$, the approach to the stable localized state is the fastest, opposite to the expected critical slowing down effect. Hence forgetting can allow the walker to save memory without compromising learning and to achieve a faster learning. These findings agree with biological evidence on the benefits of forgetting.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic uncertainty relation for generalized time-reversal observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-reversal symmetry plays an essential role in the thermodynamic uncertainty relation, which bound the fluctuations of observables in terms of the associated dissipation. In fact, thermodynamic uncertainty relations are typically derived under the assumption that the observable of interest is antisymmetric under time reversal. This also suggests that existing thermodynamic uncertainty relations are restricted to a limited class of observables. In this paper, we mitigate this restriction by introducing a new class of observables that do not exhibit the exact antisymmetry but only change the sign under time reversal. We call it generalized time reversal and derive a broadly applicable thermodynamic uncertainty relation for observables with this condition. The generalization is achieved by direct statistical arguments on the probability distributions of dissipation and the observable, and holds for both deterministic and stochastic dynamics. We demonstrate the derived thermodynamic uncertainty relation in a quantum refrigeration model, showing that the precision of generalized observables remains expressible in terms of the heat-dissipation cost. The result extends the scope of thermodynamic uncertainty relations beyond what was reached by frameworks relying on strong symmetries imposed by fluctuation theorems.</description>

      <title>Boundary Renormalization Group Flow of Entanglement Entropy at a (2+1)-Dimensional Quantum Critical Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the second order R\'enyi entanglement entropy at the quantum critical point of spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a columnar dimerized square lattice. The universal constant $\gamma$ in the area-law scaling $S_{2}(\ell) = \alpha\ell - \gamma$ is found to be sensitive to the entangling surface configurations, with $\gamma_{\text{sp}} &gt; 0$ for strong-bond-cut (special) surfaces and $\gamma_{\text{ord}} &lt; 0$ for weak-bond-cut (ordinary) surfaces, which is attributed to the distinct conformal boundary conditions. Introducing boundary dimerization drives a renormalization group (RG) flow from the special to the ordinary boundary criticality, and the constant $\gamma$ decreases monotonically with increasing dimerization strength, demonstrating irreversible evolution under the boundary RG flow. These results provide strong numerical evidence for a higher-dimensional analog of the $g$-theorem, and suggest $\gamma$ as a characteristic function for boundary RG flow in (2+1)-dimensional conformal field theory.</description>

      <title>Hybrid quantum-classical systems: statistics, entropy, microcanonical ensemble and its connection to the canonical ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe in detail a mathematical framework in which statistical ensembles of hybrid classical- quantum systems can be properly described. We show how a maximum entropy principle can be applied to derive the microcanonical ensemble of hybrid systems. We investigate its properties, and in particular how the microcanonical ensemble and its marginal classical and quantum ensembles can be defined for arbitrarily small range of energies for the whole system. We show how, in this situations, the ensembles are well defined for a continuum of energy values, unlike the purely quantum microcanonical ensemble, thus proving that hybrid systems translate properties of classical systems to the quantum realm. We also analyze the relation with the hybrid canonical ensemble by considering the microcanonical ensemble of a compound system composed of a hybrid subsystem weakly coupled to a reservoir and computing the marginal ensemble of the hybrid subsystem. Lastly, we apply the theory to the statistics of a toy model, which gives some insight on the different properties presented along the article.</description>

      <title>Percolation transition in entangled granular networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00216v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Highly nonconvex granular particles, such as staples and metal shavings, can form solid-like cohesive structures through geometric entanglement (interlocking). The network structure formed by this entanglement, however, remains largely unexplored. Here we utilize network science to investigate the entanglement networks of C-shaped granular particles under vibration through experiments and simulations. By analyzing key network properties, we demonstrate that these networks undergo a percolation transition as the number of links increases logarithmically over time; the entangled particles form a giant cluster when the number of links exceeds a critical threshold. We propose a continuum percolation model of rings that effectively describes the observed transition. Additionally, we find that particle's opening angle significantly affects mechanical bonding and, consequently, the network structure. This work highlights the potential of network-based approaches to study entangled materials, paving the way for advancements in applications ranging from mechanical metamaterials to entangled robot swarms.</description>

      <title>Hawking-R\'enyi thermodynamics of rotating black holes from locally Kiselev-type behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hawking-R\'enyi model requires the R\'enyi entropy thermodynamic temperature of a black hole to be identical with the surface gravity defined-, Hawking temperature. We investigate this approach for stationary black hole space-times, and show that a locally Kiselev-type behavior around the horizon with a coupled anisotropic fluid is sufficient to provide a solution to the problem. In addition, due to the rotating motion, an extra shift has also to be present in the effective mass of the black hole, which is determined by the rotation parameter, $a$, and the R\'enyi parameter, $\lambda$. We consider space-times with and without electric charge, and show that the functional form of the solution is the same for both cases. A full thermodynamic analysis of the model falls beyond the scope of this Letter, the main achievements are the derivation and interpretation of the solution.</description>

      <title>Extreme dynamics and relaxation of quantum gases: A hydrodynamic approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of quantum gases, released from traps, are studied through hydrodynamics, both analytically and numerically, in one and two dimensions. In particular, we demonstrate the existence of long time self-similar solutions of the Euler equations, for the density and velocity fields, and derive the scaling exponents as well as the scaling functions. We find that the expanding gas develops a shock front and the size of the cloud grows in time as a powerlaw. We relate the associated exponent to that appearing in the corresponding equation of state of the quantum gas. Furthermore, we study the relaxation dynamics of a trapped quantum gas and show that the resulting steady state is in excellent agreement with that derived analytically. Our hydrodynamic approach is versatile and can be used to unravel several other far-from-equilibrium collective phenomenon of extreme nature, relevant to the growing experimental interests in quantum gases.</description>

      <title>From diamond to BC8 to simple cubic and back: kinetic pathways to post-diamond carbon phases from metadynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The experimental observation of elusive post-diamond carbon phases at extreme pressures remains a major challenge in high-pressure science. Using metadynamics with coordination-number-based collective variables and SNAP machine-learned interatomic potential, we uncover atomistic mechanisms governing the transformation of cubic and hexagonal diamond into post-diamond phases above 1.5 TPa. The transition initiates via homogeneous nucleation of nanoscale liquid droplets, which rapidly crystallize into either BC8 (below 1.8 TPa) or simple cubic phases (above 2.1 TPa), once the liquid nucleus surpasses a critical size. Favorable conditions for synthesizing BC8 are identified near 1.8 TPa and 3500--5000 K. Decompression pathways from simple cubic and BC8 phases were also simulated to study possible experimental recovery of post-diamond carbon allotropes at ambient conditions. We also find a new metastable low-enthalpy structure with four-coordinated carbon atoms and space group P222. Our insights provide a theoretical foundation for experimental discovery of ultra-dense carbon phases under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>A noncommutative Ruelle's Theorem for a normalized potential taking values on positivity-improving operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let \(\mathcal{A}\) be a finite-dimensional real (or complex) C*-algebra, \(\Omega_{A}\) an aperiodic subshift of finite type, and \(\mathcal{C}(\Omega_{A}; \mathcal{A})\) the set of continuous functions from \(\Omega_{A}\) to \(\mathcal{A}\). The shift $\sigma$ provides dynamics. Given a real Lipschitz potential $\varphi\in \mathcal{C}(\Omega_{A}; \mathfrak{L}(\mathcal{A}))$, where $\mathfrak{L}(\mathcal{A})$ is the set of linear operators acting on a real $\mathcal{A}$, we introduce a noncommutative analogue of Ruelle's operator, which acts on \(\mathcal{C}(\Omega_{A}; \mathcal{A})\). Assuming the positivity-improving hypothesis, we prove a version of Ruelle's Theorem whenever the operator is normalized. An eigenstate (a linear functional) invariant for the action of the noncommutative Ruelle's operator will play the role of the Gibbs probability of Thermodynamic Formalism; to be called a Gibbs eigenstate. We introduce the concept of entropy for a Gibbs eigenstate (obtained from a certain family of potentials $\varphi$) - generalizing the classical one. In our setting, there is currently no direct relationship with cocycles and Lyapunov exponents. We present examples illustrating the novelty of the cases that can be considered, ranging from topics related to quantum channels to Pauli matrices. Interesting cases: $\mathcal{A}=M_{N \times N}(\mathbb{R})$ and $\mathcal{A}= \mathbb{R}^{N}$.</description>

      <title>Dynamically generated correlations in a trapped bosonic gas via frequency quenches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a system of $N$ noninteracting bosons in a harmonic trap subjected to repeated quantum quenches, where the trap frequency is switched from one value to another after a random time duration drawn from an exponential distribution. Each cycle contains two steps: (i) changing the trap frequency to enable unitary evolution under a Hamiltonian, and (ii) reapplying the original trap at stochastic times to cool the gas back to its initial state. This protocol effectively makes it an open quantum system and drives it into a unique nonequilibrium steady state (NESS). We analytically and numerically characterize the NESS, uncovering a conditionally independent and identically distributed (CIID) structure in the joint probability density function (JPDF) of the positions. The JPDF in the CIID structure is a product of Gaussians with a common random variance, which is then averaged with respect to its distribution, making the JPDF non-factorizable, giving rise to long-range emergent dynamical correlations. The average density profile of the gas shows significant deviations from the initial Gaussian shape. We further compute the order and the gap statistics, revealing universal scaling in both bulk and edge regimes. We also analyze the full counting statistics, exposing rich parameter-dependent structure. Our results demonstrate how stochastic quenches can generate nontrivial correlations in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum-group-invariant $D^{(2)}_{n+1}$ models: Bethe ansatz and finite-size spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the quantum integrable spin chain models associated with the Jimbo R-matrix based on the quantum affine algebra $D^{(2)}_{n+1}$, subject to quantum-group-invariant boundary conditions parameterized by two discrete variables $p=0,\dots, n$ and $\varepsilon = 0, 1$. We develop the analytical Bethe ansatz for the previously unexplored case $\varepsilon = 1$ with any $n$, and use it to investigate the effects of different boundary conditions on the finite-size spectrum of the quantum spin chain based on the rank-$2$ algebra $D^{(2)}_3$. Previous work on this model with periodic boundary conditions has shown that it is critical for the range of anisotropy parameters $0&lt;\gamma&lt;\pi/4$, where its scaling limit is described by a non-compact CFT with continuous degrees of freedom related to two copies of the 2D black hole sigma model. The scaling limit of the model with quantum-group-invariant boundary conditions depends on the parameter $\varepsilon$: similarly as in the rank-$1$ $D^{(2)}_2$ chain, we find that the symmetry of the lattice model is spontaneously broken, and the spectrum of conformal weights has both discrete and continuous components, for $\varepsilon=1$. For $p=1$, the latter coincides with that of the $D^{(2)}_2$ chain, which should correspond to a non-compact brane related to one black hole CFT in the presence of boundaries. For $\varepsilon=0$, the spectrum of conformal weights is purely discrete.</description>

      <title>Entropy Flow at the Quantum Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal management is a key challenge, both globally and microscopically in integrated circuits and quantum technologies. The associated heat flow $I_Q$ has been understood since the advent of thermodynamics by a process of elimination, $I_Q{=}I_E{-}\mu I_N$, subtracting from the energy flow $I_E$ its convective contribution. However, in the quantum limit, this formula implies the paradoxical result that the entropy entrained by heat flow is unbounded even though the entropy itself tends to zero. We resolve this conundrum by recognizing that the traditional formula for heat is missing a quantum term. The correct quantum formula predicts that the heat produced in quantum processes is vastly smaller than previously believed, with correspondingly beneficial consequences for the efficiency of quantum machines.</description>

      <title>Response function as a quantitative measure of consciousness in brain dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the neural correlates of consciousness remains a central challenge in neuroscience. In this study, we investigate the relationship between consciousness and neural responsiveness by analyzing intracranial ECoG recordings from non-human primates across three distinct states: wakefulness, anesthesia, and recovery. Using a nonequilibrium recurrent neural network (RNN) model, we fit state-dependent cortical dynamics to extract the neural response function as a dynamics complexity indicator. Our findings demonstrate that the amplitude of the neural response function serves as a robust dynamical indicator of conscious state, consistent with the role of a linear response function in statistical physics. Notably, this aligns with our previous theoretical results showing that the response function in RNNs peaks near the transition between ordered and chaotic regimes -- highlighting criticality as a potential principle for sustaining flexible and responsive cortical dynamics. Empirically, we find that during wakefulness, neural responsiveness is strong, widely distributed, and consistent with rich nonequilibrium fluctuations. Under anesthesia, response amplitudes are significantly suppressed, and the network dynamics become more chaotic, indicating a loss of dynamical sensitivity. During recovery, the neural response function is elevated, supporting the gradual re-establishment of flexible and responsive activity that parallels the restoration of conscious processing. Our work suggests that a robust, brain-state-dependent neural response function may be a necessary dynamical condition for consciousness, providing a principled framework for quantifying levels of consciousness in terms of nonequilibrium responsiveness in the brain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the multispecies totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (mTASEP) with long-range swap, a new interacting particle system combining the backward-push rule with the forward-jump rule. Although governed by local dynamics, the model induces effective long-range particle exchanges. We establish its integrability by proving two-particle reducibility and showing that the associated scattering matrix satisfies the Yang-Baxter equation. In addition, we derive explicit contour integral formulas for transition probabilities. These results position the long-range swap model as a novel exactly solvable multispecies process, characterized by distinctive algebraic features and opening new directions for further study in integrable probability and statistical mechanics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A compromise process describes the evolution of opinions through binary interactions. Opinions are real numbers, and in each step, two randomly selected agents reach a compromise, namely, they acquire the average of their pre-interaction opinions. We prove that if the number $N$ of agents is a power of two, the consensus emerges after a finite number of compromise events with probability one; otherwise, the consensus cannot be reached in a finite number of steps (if initial opinions are in a general position). The number of steps required to reach consensus is random for $N=2^k$ with $k\geq 2$. We prove that typically, the smallest number of steps to reach consensus is equal to $k\cdot 2^{k-1}$. For $N=4$, we determine the distribution of the number of steps, e.g., we show that it has a purely exponential tail and compute all cumulants.</description>

      <title>Emergent Rotational Order and Re-entrant Global Order of Vicsek Agents in a Complex Noise Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noisy pursuit in complex environments drives emergent collective behaviors in active matter systems. A compelling platform to study the impact of environment cues is provided by the standard Vicsek model for studying flocking and swarming phenomena. In this study, we explore the collective dynamics of Vicsek agents in a complex noise environment, featuring a noiseless circular region ($\eta_{\text{c}} = 0.0$) surrounded by a noisy outer region ($\eta_{\text{b}} = 1.0$, tunable), with a mutually repelling interactions. By varying the outer noise intensity, we observe an emergent rotational order ($\phi_r$) that peaks at higher noise levels ($\eta_{\text{b}}\sim 1$), as revealed by phase and susceptibility plots. Global order follows ($\phi$) follows a `U' shaped curve, $\phi \sim 0.965$ at $\eta_b=0$, dies down to $\phi \sim 0.57$ at $\eta_b=0.9$ and re-enters at $\eta_b &gt; 1$ and peaks $\phi \sim 0.960$ at $\eta_b=1.5$. The latter rise attributing to $\phi_r$ increase. Higher particle velocities enhance escape rates ($\kappa$) from the circular region, with slower-moving agents exhibiting greater virtual confinement. We quantify escape dynamics through time-averaged and first-passage escape rates, demonstrating velocity-dependent retention on the probability of finding the bi-motility agent flocks at a give time resulting in segregation and trapping. Introducing a gradual noise increase from the circle's center to the outer region reduces both global ($\phi$) and rotational ($\phi_r$) order, underscoring the impact of environmental heterogeneity and sudden annealing over gradual change. These findings offer insights into predicting and manipulating active agent dynamics in heterogeneous environments, with applications in biological and synthetic swarming systems.</description>

      <title>Testing maximum entropy models with e-values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: E-values have recently emerged as a robust and flexible alternative to p-values for hypothesis testing, especially under optional continuation, i.e., when additional data from further experiments are collected. In this work, we define optimal e-values for testing between maximum entropy models, both in the microcanonical (hard constraints) and canonical (soft constraints) settings. We show that, when testing between two hypotheses that are both microcanonical, the so-called growth-rate optimal e-variable admits an exact analytical expression, which also serves as a valid e-variable in the canonical case. For canonical tests, where exact solutions are typically unavailable, we introduce a microcanonical approximation and verify its excellent performance via both theoretical arguments and numerical simulations. We then consider constrained binary models, focusing on $2 \times k$ contingency tables -- an essential framework in statistics and a natural representation for various models of complex systems. Our microcanonical optimal e-variable performs well in both settings, constituting a new tool that remains effective even in the challenging case when the number $k$ of groups grows with the sample size, as in models with growing features used for the analysis of real-world heterogeneous networks and time-series.</description>

Abstract: The Kramers-Wannier duality introduces a well-known non-invertible symmetry in the critical transverse-field Ising model. In this work, we extend this concept to a broad class of quantum lattice models induced from integrability, providing explicit expressions for the Kramers-Wannier operators that can be systematically computed.</description>

      <title>Inference of epidemic networks: the effect of different data types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how the properties of epidemic networks change depending on the availability of different types of data on a disease outbreak. This is achieved by introducing mathematical and computational methods that estimate the probability of transmission trees by combining generative models that jointly determine the number of infected hosts, the probability of infection between them depending on location and genetic information, and their time of infection and sampling. We introduce a suitable Markov Chain Monte Carlo method that we show to sample trees according to their probability. Statistics performed over the sampled trees lead to probabilistic estimations of network properties and other quantities of interest, such as the number of unobserved hosts and the depth of the infection tree. We confirm the validity of our approach by comparing the numerical results with analytically solvable examples. Finally, we apply our methodology to data from COVID-19 in Australia. We find that network properties that are important for the management of the outbreak depend sensitively on the type of data used in the inference.</description>

      <title>Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis with Projective Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) provides a sufficient condition for thermalization of isolated quantum systems. While the standard ETH is formulated in the absence of degeneracy, physical systems often possess symmetries that induce degenerate energy eigenstates. In this paper, we investigate ETH in the presence of nontrivial projective representations of Abelian symmetries, which arise naturally from 't Hooft anomalies. We argue that such projective structures can lead to degenerate excited states, and how the ETH can be formulated under such degeneracies. In the presence of projective charges supplied by symmetry operators, our projective-representation ETH indicates that the stationary values of the operators are described by the generalized Gibbs ensemble instead of the standard Gibbs ensemble. Our findings elucidate the role of symmetry and degeneracy in quantum thermalization and pave the way for further exploration of the ETH in anomalous symmetry settings.</description>

      <title>Quantum Pontus-Mpemba Effects in Real and Imaginary-time Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum Pontus-Mpemba effect (QPME) is a counterintuitive phenomenon wherein a quantum system relaxes more rapidly through a two-step evolution protocol than through direct evolution under a symmetric Hamiltonian alone. In this protocol, the system first evolves under a symmetry-breaking Hamiltonian and then switches to a symmetric one. We demonstrate that QPME occurs under both real-time and imaginary-time dynamics with respect to $U(1)$-symmetry. Using tilted ferromagnetic initial states, we demonstrate that a transient asymmetric evolution significantly accelerates thermalization or convergence to the ground state for both real-time and imaginary-time evolutions, respectively. The effect is pronounced for small tilt angles, while larger tilts or antiferromagnetic initial states suppress it. Numerical evidence across different system sizes confirms the robustness of QPME, demonstrating its stability in the thermodynamic limit. This finding not only deepens our fundamental understanding of non-equilibrium quantum phenomena but also opens new possibilities for accelerating quantum simulation and computation.</description>

      <title>Analysing contrarian behaviour using nonlinear biased $q$-voter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of contrarians in a recently proposed weighted-influence variant of the $q$-voter model. In this framework, non-unanimous influence groups affect the focal agent through weighted contributions governed by a bias parameter $p$. We extend this setting by introducing a fraction $\alpha$ ($\alpha&gt; 0$) of contrarians, defined as agents who systematically oppose the prevailing influence irrespective of whether the group is unanimous or divided. Analytical mean-field calculations and Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the final states of the system are governed by simple phase boundaries: regions of positive and negative majority separated by the lines $p=1/2$ and $\alpha=1/2$, with equally-mixed states confined to these boundaries. While low contrarian densities are insufficient to overturn the bias, higher values of $\alpha$ systematically drive the system closer to a balanced coexistence of opinions, though exact parity is prevented by the presence of bias $p$. We further analyze the temporal relaxation of opinions and extract the characteristic timescales of convergence. Our findings highlight how contrarians, acting as structured non-conformists, can suppress consensus and maintain opinion diversity, while internal biases ultimately hinder a perfectly even split.</description>

      <title>Inference in Spreading Processes with Neural-Network Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic processes on graphs are a powerful tool for modelling complex dynamical systems such as epidemics. A recent line of work focused on the inference problem where one aims to estimate the state of every node at every time, starting from partial observation of a subset of nodes at a subset of times. In these works, the initial state of the process was assumed to be random i.i.d. over nodes. Such an assumption may not be realistic in practice, where one may have access to a set of covariate variables for every node that influence the initial state of the system. In this work, we will assume that the initial state of a node is an unknown function of such covariate variables. Given that functions can be represented by neural networks, we will study a model where the initial state is given by a simple neural network -- notably the single-layer perceptron acting on the known node-wise covariate variables.
  Within a Bayesian framework, we study how such neural-network prior information enhances the recovery of initial states and spreading trajectories. We derive a hybrid belief propagation and approximate message passing (BP-AMP) algorithm that handles both the spreading dynamics and the information included in the node covariates, and we assess its performance against the estimators that either use only the spreading information or use only the information from the covariate variables.
  We show that in some regimes, the model can exhibit first-order phase transitions when using a Rademacher distribution for the neural-network weights. These transitions create a statistical-to-computational gap where even the BP-AMP algorithm, despite the theoretical possibility of perfect recovery, fails to achieve it.</description>

      <title>Optimizing digital quantum simulation of open quantum lattice models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many-body systems arising in condensed matter physics and quantum optics inevitably couple to the environment and need to be modelled as open quantum systems. While near-optimal algorithms have been developed for simulating many-body quantum dynamics, algorithms for their open system counterparts remain less well investigated. We address the problem of simulating geometrically local many-body open quantum systems interacting with a stationary Gaussian environment. Under a smoothness assumption on the system-environment interaction, we develop near-optimal algorithms that, for a model with $N$ spins and evolution time $t$, attain a simulation error $\delta$ in the system-state with $\mathcal{O}(Nt(Nt/\delta)^{1 + o(1)})$ gates, $\mathcal{O}(t(Nt/\delta)^{1 + o(1)})$ parallelized circuit depth and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(N(Nt/\delta)^{1 + o(1)})$ ancillas. We additionally show that, if only simulating local observables is of interest, then the circuit depth of the digital algorithm can be chosen to be independent of the system size $N$. This provides theoretical evidence for the utility of these algorithms for simulating physically relevant models, where typically local observables are of interest, on pre-fault tolerant devices. Finally, for the limiting case of Markovian dynamics with commuting jump operators, we propose two algorithms based on sampling a Wiener process and on a locally dilated Hamiltonian construction, respectively. These algorithms reduce the asymptotic gate complexity on $N$ compared to currently available algorithms in terms of the required number of geometrically local gates.</description>

Abstract: We derive some rather general, but complicated, formulae to compute the survival function and the first passage time distribution of the $n^\text{th}$ coordinate of a many-body stochastic process in the presence of a killing barrier. First we will study the case of two coordinates and then we will generalize the results to three or more coordinates. Even if the results are difficult to implement, we will provide examples of their use applying them to a physical system, the single file diffusion, and to the financial problem of pricing a $n^\text{th}$-to-default credit default swap ($n^\text{th}$-CDS)</description>

Abstract: We present steps towards an ab initio derivation of generalised hydrodynamics in quantum integrable models, starting from the Bethe wave functions, and explained on the example of the repulsive Lieb-Liniger model. This includes an identification of the generalised hydrodynamics quasi-particles as wave packets in the quantum model. These wave packets evolve according to a classical particle model and collect two-particle scattering shifts similar to solitons in integrable PDEs. We then discuss potential routes to obtain the generalised hydrodynamics equation for average conserved densities in long-wavelength states from this description. As part of this, we provide an explicit formula for the action of the spectral phase-space density operator on Bethe wave functions, and show that it generates local conserved densities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14646v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phases manifesting topological patterns in functional systems, like ferroelectric and ferromagnetic vortex superlattices, can manifest intricate and apparently ungovernable behavior, typical of frustrated non-ergodic states with high-dimensional energy landscapes. This is also the case for potassium-tantalate-niobate (KTN) crystals. These transparent ferroelectrics manifest remarkable but little-understood metastable domain patterns at optical (micrometer and above) scales near the cubic-to-tetragonal structural phase transition. Here, we formulate the Topological Breakdown Model based on the competition between intrinsic scales of domain-domain collinear and non-collinear interactions associated with polarization-charge screening. The model is able to explain observed KTN mesoscopic domain patterns and phase diagram as a function of temperature and external electric field. Findings include a precise set of sharp and broad percolative transitions that are experimentally verified, validating the model. Our study identifies the central role played by competing topologically protected states, identifying a fundamental link between topological protection and frustration that supports a hitherto unexplored functional non-ergodic arena.</description>

Abstract: We show how the effects of large numbers of measurements on many-body quantum ground and thermal states can be studied using Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC). Density matrices generated by measurement in this setting feature products of many local nonunitary operators, and by expanding these density matrices as sums over operator strings we arrive at a generalized stochastic series expansion (SSE). Our 'post-measurement SSE' is based on importance sampling of operator strings contributing to a measured thermal density matrix. We demonstrate our algorithm by probing the effects of measurements on the spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the square lattice. Thermal states of this system have SU(2) symmetry, and at first we preserve this symmetry by measuring SU(2) symmetric observables. We identify classes of post-measurement states for which correlations can be calculated efficiently, as well as states for which SU(2) symmetric measurements generate a QMC sign problem when working in any site-local basis. For the first class, we show how deterministic loop updates can be leveraged. Using our algorithm we demonstrate the creation of long-range Bell pairs and symmetry-protected topological order, as well as the measurement-induced enhancement of antiferromagnetic correlations. We then study the effects of measuring the system in a basis where the standard (unmeasured) SSE is sign-free: For measurement schemes with this property, we can calculate correlations in all post-measurement states without a sign problem. The method developed in this work opens the door to scalable experimental probes of measurement-induced collective phenomena, which require numerical estimates for the effects of measurements.</description>

Abstract: The great power of EQuilibrium (EQ) statistical physics comes from its principled foundations: its First Law (conservation), Second Law (variational tendency principle), and its Legendre Transforms from observables $(U, V, N)$ to their driving forces $(T, p, \mu)$. Here, we generalize this structure to Non-EQuilibria (NEQ) in \textit{Caliber Force Theory} (CFT), replacing state entropies with path entropies; and $(U, V, N)$ with dynamic observables (node probabilities, edge traffics, and cycle fluxes). CFT derives dynamical forces and a complete set of conjugate relations: (i) It yields generalized Maxwell-Onsager relations, applicable far from equilibrium; (ii) It constructs dynamical models from mixed force-observable constraints; and (iii) It reveals new relationships -- including an ``equal-traffic'' rule for optimizing molecular motors, and a ``third Kirchhoff's law'' of stochastic transport -- and can resolve some dynamical paradoxes.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic inference in molecular motors: a Martingale approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular motors are in charge of almost every process in the life cycle of cells, such as protein synthesis, DNA replication, and cell locomotion, hence being of crucial importance for understanding the cellular dynamics. However, given their size scales on the order of nanometers, direct measurements are rather challenging, and the information that can be extracted from them is limited. In this work, we propose strategies based on martingale theory in stochastic thermodynamics to infer thermodynamic properties of molecular motors using a limited amount of available information. In particular, we use two recent theoretical results valid for systems arbitrary far of equilibrium: the integral fluctuation theorem (IFT) at stopping times, and a family of bounds to the maximal excursions of entropy production. The potential of these strategies is illustrated with a simple model for the F1-ATPase rotary molecular motor, where our approach is able to estimate several quantities determining the thermodynamics of the motor, such as the rotational work of the motor performed against an externally applied force, or the effective environmental temperature.</description>

Abstract: We consider a generic class of stochastic particle-based models whose state at an instant in time is described by a set of continuous degrees of freedom (e.g. positions), and the length of this set changes stochastically in time due to birth-death processes. Using a master equation formalism, we write down the dynamics of the corresponding (infinite) set of probability distributions: this takes the form of coupled Fokker-Planck equations with model-dependent source and sink terms. We derive the general expression of entropy production rate for this class of models in terms of path irreversibility. To demonstrate the practical use of this framework, we analyze a biologically motivated model incorporating division, death, and diffusion, where spatial correlations arise through the division process. By systematically integrating out excess degrees of freedom, we obtain the marginal probability distribution, enabling exact calculations of key statistical properties such as average density and correlation functions. We validate our analytical results through numerical Brownian dynamics simulations, finding excellent agreement between theory and simulation. Our method thus provides a powerful tool for tackling previously unsolved problems in stochastic birth-death dynamics.</description>

      <title>Towards data analysis with diagrammatics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Systems with many interacting stochastic constituents are fully characterized by their free energy. Computing this quantity is therefore the objective of various approaches, notably perturbative expansions, which are applied in problems ranging from high-dimensional statistics to complex systems. However, a lot of these techniques are complicated to apply in practice because they lack a sufficient organization of the terms of the perturbative series. In this manuscript, we tackle this problem by using Feynman diagrams, extending a framework introduced earlier to the case of free energies at fixed variances. This diagrammatics do not require the theory to expand around to be Gaussian, which allows its application to the free energy of a spin system studied to derive message-passing algorithms by Maillard et al. 2019. We complete their perturbative derivation of the free energy in the thermodynamic limit. Furthermore, we derive resummations to estimate the entropies of poorly sampled systems requiring only limited statistics and we revisit earlier approaches to compute the free energy of the Ising model, revealing new insights due to the extension of our framework to the free energy at fixed variances. We expect our approach to be particularly useful for problems of high-dimensional statistics, like matrix factorization, and the study of complex networks.</description>

      <title>Coupling an elastic string to an active bath: the emergence of inverse damping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a slow elastic string with Klein-Gordon dynamics coupled to a bath of run-and-tumble particles. We derive and solve the induced Langevin-Klein-Gordon string dynamics with explicit expressions for the streaming term, friction coefficient, and noise variance. These parameters are computed exactly in a weak coupling expansion. The induced friction is a sum of two terms: one entropic, proportional to the noise variance as in the Einstein relation for a thermal equilibrium bath, and a frenetic contribution that can take both signs. The frenetic part wins for higher bath persistence, making the total friction negative, and hence creating a wave instability akin to inverse Landau damping. However, this acceleration decreases and eventually disappears when the propulsion speed of the active particles becomes much higher. Detailed simulations confirm the initial growth driven by this anti-damping.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22166v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate bond percolation on the Song-Havlin-Makse (SHM) network, a scale-free tree with a tunable degree exponent and dimensionality. Using a generating function approach, we analytically derive the average size and the fractal exponent of the root cluster for deterministic cases. Our analysis reveals that bond percolation on the SHM network remains in a nonpercolating phase for all $p &lt; 1$ when the network is fractal (i.e., finite-dimensional), whereas it exhibits a critical phase, where the cluster size distribution follows a power-law with a $p$-dependent exponent, throughout the entire range of $p$ when the network is small-world (i.e., infinite-dimensional), regardless of the specific dimensionality or degree exponent. The analytical results are in excellent agreement with Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Temperature-Noise Interplay in a Coupled Model of Opinion Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07680v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a coupled system mimicking opinion formation under the influence of a group of $q$ neighbors ($q$-lobby) that consists of an Ising part governed by temperature-like parameter $T$ and a voter dynamics parameterized by noise probability $p$ (independence of choice). Using rigorous analytical calculations backed by extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we examine the interplay between these two quantities. Based on the theory of phase transitions, we derive the relation between $T$ and $p$ at the critical line dividing the ordered and disordered phases, which takes a very simple and generic form $T(p-a)=b$ in the high temperature limit. For specific lobby sizes, we show where the temperature and noise are balanced, and we hint that for large $q$, the temperature-like dynamics prevails.</description>

Abstract: Collective longitudinal and transverse propagating modes in molten Carbon at $T=5500$~K and pressure range $10$-$40$ GPa are reported from {\it ab initio} based as well as machine learned molecular dynamics. A striking exotic feature in collective dynamics is the two-peak shape of the current spectral functions of the single-component liquid, which makes evidence of a second branch of longitudinal propagating modes in the wave number range $k&gt;1$\AA$^{-1}$. It is shown that time correlation functions reflecting the out-of-phase motion of particles and their cages of nearest neighbors results in the same frequencies of the exotic low-frequency branch of vibrations. A theoretical framework of generalized collective modes is applied to recover the time dependence of density-density, imaginary part of susceptibility and longitudinal current-current correlations.</description>

      <title>An effective potential for generative modelling with active matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Score-based diffusion models generate samples from a complex underlying data distribution by time-reversal of a diffusion process and represent the state-of-the-art in many generative AI applications. Here, I show how a generative diffusion model can be implemented based on an underlying active particle process with finite correlation time. Time reversal is achieved by imposing an effective time-dependent potential on the position coordinate, which can be readily implemented in simulations and experiments to generate new synthetic data samples driven by active fluctuations. The effective potential is valid to first order in the persistence time and leads to a force field that is fully determined by the standard score function and its derivatives up to 2nd order. Numerical experiments for artificial data distributions confirm the validity of the effective potential, which opens up new avenues to exploit fluctuations in active and living systems for generative AI purposes.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity detection algorithms: Scaling of ergodicity in random symbolic dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mathematical definitions of distinct concepts that are needed in building an ergodicity detection algorithm are introduced in a framework. This algorithmic framework is expressed in a discrete setting in an accessible manner for broader quantitative practitioners without loss of generality. At the same time, the common misconceptions of the requirement of visiting all available states in the time-averaged quantities for physical systems and non-existence of an ergodic process are resolved by introducing the distinction between Gibbs-Boltzmann and von Neumann-Birkhoff ergodic regimes. For this purpose, we introduce a new concept which is called sufficiency of sparse visit. We use finite symbolic random sequences as a pedagogical tool in establishing the different approaches for the detection of ergodic regimes of dynamical systems with vector patterns. The simple example system conveys the different attitudes in ergodicity regimes and offers guidance for building computational tools for its algorithmic detection.</description>

      <title>Quantifying time in Monte Carlo simulations: application to relaxation processes and AC susceptibilities of magnetic nanoparticles assemblies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of the response of magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) assemblies to an external alternating magnetic field is of great interest for applications such as hyperthermia. The key quantity here is the complex susceptibility and its behavior in terms of temperature and frequency. From a theoretical point of view it can be obtained by Monte Carlo (MC) simulation with the time quantified Monte Carlo (TQMC) method if a physical time is associated with the MC step. Here we revisit this method by showing that the time unit can be derived from the MC stochastic process of the isolated particle. We first obtain a MC unit of time from the relaxation of the system at fixed temperature. Then this unit of time is used to compute complex susceptibilities. We show that it is now possible to match the TQMC results with actual experimental results regarding frequency dependent in phase susceptibilities and quantify the unit of time in seconds. Finally we show that the time unit obtained for the isolated particle remains valid when considering interacting particles such as the Heisenberg coupling or dipole dipole interactions.</description>

Abstract: The general, multidimensional barrier crossing problem for diffusive processes under the action of conservative forces is studied with the goal of developing tractable approximations. Particular attention is given to the effect of different statistical interpretations of the stochastic differential equation and to the relation between the approximations and the known, exact solutions to the one-dimensional problem. Beginning with a reasonable, but heuristic, simplifying assumption, a one-dimensional solution to the problem is developed. This is then simplified by introducing further approximations resulting in a sequence of increasingly simple expressions culminating in the classic result of Langer(Ann. Phys. 54, 258 (1969)) and others. The various approximations are tested on two dimensional problems by comparison to simulation results and it is found that the one-dimensional approximations capture most of the non-Arrhenius dependence on the energy barrier which is lost in the Langer approximation while still converging to the latter in the large-barrier limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09021v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been argued that a finite effective temperature emerges and characterizes the thermal property of double-scaled SYK model in the infinite temperature limit. Meanwhile, in the static patch of de Sitter, the maximally entangled state satisfies a KMS condition at infinite temperature, suggesting the Type II$_1$ nature of the observable algebra gravitationally dressed to the observer. In this work, we analyze the double-scaled algebra generated by chord operators in the double-scaled SYK model and demonstrate that it exhibits features reflecting both perspectives. Specifically, we prove that the algebra is a Type II$_1$ factor, and that the empty state with no chord satisfies the tracial property, in agreement with expectations from earlier work. We further show that this state is cyclic and separating for the double-scaled algebra, based on which we explore its modular structure. We then explore various physical limits of the theory, drawing connections to JT gravity, the Hilbert space of baby universes, and Brownian double-scaled SYK. We also present analytic solutions to the energy spectrum in both the zero- and one-particle sectors of the left/right chord Hamiltonian.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic behavior of open quantum systems through the Hamiltonian of Mean Force, focusing on two models: a two-qubit system interacting with a thermal bath and a Jaynes-Cummings Model without the rotating wave approximation. By analyzing both weak and strong coupling regimes, we uncover the impact of environmental interactions on quantum thermodynamic quantities, including specific heat capacity, internal energy, and entropy. Further, the ergotropy and entropy production are computed. We also explore the energy-temperature uncertainty relation, which sets an upper bound on the signal-to-noise ratio.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00826v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In quantum systems, purification can map mixed states into pure states and a non-unitary evolution into a unitary one by enlarging the Hilbert space. We establish a connection between the complexities of mixed quantum states and their purification, proposing new inequalities among these complexities. By examining single qubits, two-qubit Werner states, 8-dimensional Gaussian random unitary ensemble, and infinite-dimensional systems, we demonstrate how these relationships manifest across a broad class of systems. We find that the spread complexity of purification of a vacuum state evolving into a thermal state equals the average number of Rindler particles. This complexity is also shown to adhere to the Lloyd-like bound, indicating a further relation to the quantum speed limit. Finally, using mutual Krylov complexity, we observe subadditivity of the Krylov complexities, which contrasts with known results from holographic volume complexity. We put forward Krylov mutual complexity as a diagnosis of a potential gravity dual of Krylov complexities.</description>

      <title>Dispersion of first sound in a weakly interacting ultracold Fermi liquid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10099v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At low temperature, a normal gas of unpaired spin-1/2 fermions is one of the cleanest realizations of a Fermi liquid. It is described by Landau's theory, where no phenomenological parameters are needed as the quasiparticle interaction function can be computed perturbatively in powers of the scattering length $a$, the sole parameter of the short-range interparticle interactions. Obtaining an accurate solution of the transport equation nevertheless requires a careful treatment of the collision kernel, {as the uncontrolled error made by the relaxation time approximations increases when the temperature $T$ drops below the Fermi temperature}. Here, we study sound waves in the hydrodynamic regime up to second order in the Chapman-Enskog's expansion. We find that the frequency $\omega_q$ of the sound wave is shifted above its linear departure as $\omega_q=c_1 q(1+\alpha q^2\tau^2)$ where $c_1$ and $q$ are the speed and wavenumber of the sound wave and the typical collision time $\tau$ scales as $1/a^2T^2$. Besides the shear viscosity, the coefficient $\alpha$ is described by a single second-order collision time which we compute exactly from an analytical solution of the transport equation, resulting in a positive dispersion $\alpha&gt;0$. Our results suggest that ultracold atomic Fermi gases are an ideal experimental system for quantitative tests of second-order hydrodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis to derive a quantum master equation for a system weakly coupled to a chaotic finite-sized bath prepared in a pure state. We show that the emergence of Markovianity is controlled by the spectral function of the ETH and that local detailed balance emerges in the Markovian regime for a broad class of pure bath states. We numerically verify this result by comparing the master equation to dynamics computed using exact diagonalization of a chaotic Hamiltonian. We also compare the master equation to exact dynamics for an integrable bath and find that at finite size they strongly disagree. Our work puts forward eigenstate thermalization as a foundation for open quantum systems theory, thus extending it beyond ensemble bath preparations to chaotic many-body environments in generic pure states.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the relation between p-adic numbers and kernels in view of a recent large deviation theory for mean-field spin glasses. As an application we show several fundamental properties of numerical bases in kernel language. In particular, we show that the Derrida's Generalized Random Energy Model can be interpreted as a (random) numerical base. We also show an application to the Primon gas and the Riemann Zeta Function.</description>

      <title>Subsystem Thermalization Hypothesis in Quantum Spin Chains with Conserved Charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the thermalization hypothesis of pure states in quantum Ising chain with $Z_2$ symmetry, XXZ chain with $U(1)$ symmetry, and XXX chain with $SU(2)$ symmetries. Two kinds of pure states are considered: the energy eigenstates and the typical states evolved unitarily from the random product states for a long enough period. We further group the typical states by their expectation values of the conserved charges and consider the fine-grained thermalization hypothesis. We compare the locally (subsystem) reduced states of typical states/eigenstates with the ones of the corresponding thermal ensemble states. Besides the usual thermal ensembles such as the (micro-)canonical ensemble without conserved charges and the generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE) with all conserved charges included, we also consider the so-called partial-GGEs (p-GGEs), which include only part of the conserved charges in the thermal ensemble. Moreover, in the framework of p-GGE, the Hamiltonian and other conserved charges are on an equal footing. The introduction of p-GGEs extends quantum thermalization to a more general scope. The validity of the subsystem thermalization hypothesis can be quantified by the smallness of the relative entropy of the reduced states obtained from the GGE/p-GGE and the typical states/eigenstates. We examine the validity of the thermalization hypothesis by numerically studying the relative entropy demographics. We show that the thermalization hypothesis holds generically for the small enough subsystems for various p-GGEs. Thus, our framework extends the universality of quantum thermalization.</description>

      <title>Nonstabilizerness in the unitary and monitored quantum dynamics of XXZ-staggered and SYK models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01431v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the quantum-state-diffusion dynamics of the XXZ-staggered spin chain, also focusing on its noninteracting XX-staggered limit, and of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. We describe the process through quantum trajectories and evaluate the nonstabilizerness (also known as ``magic'') along the trajectories, quantified through the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy (SRE). In the absence of measurements, we find that the SYK model is the only one in which the time-averaged SRE saturates the random state bound and has a scaling with the system size that is well described by the theoretical prediction for quantum chaotic systems. In the presence of measurements, we numerically find that the steady-state SRE versus the coupling strength to the environment is well fitted by a generalized Lorentzian function. The scaling of the fitting parameters with the system size suggests that the steady-state} SRE linearly increases with the system size in all the considered cases, and displays no measurement-induced quantum transition, as confirmed by the curves of the steady-state SRE versus the system size.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the $\phi^6$ Theory in Three Dimensions at Large $N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the $O(N)$--symmetric $\phi^6$ theory in three spacetime dimensions using dimensional regularisation and minimal subtraction. The predictions of other methods are scrutinised in a large-$N$ expansion. We show how the tricritical line of fixed point emerges in a strict $N\to\infty$ limit but argue that it is not a physical manifestation. For the first time in this explicit manner, we compute the effective potential at next-to-leading order in the $1/N$-expansion and discuss its stability. The Bardeen-Moshe-Bander phenomenon is also analysed at next-to-leading order, and we demonstrate that it disappears without breaking the scale invariance spontaneously. Our findings indicate that the UV fixed point found by Pisarski persists at large $N$.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Boltzmann equation for weakly coupled quantum fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the kinetic theory of a weakly interacting quantum field. Assuming a state that is close to homogeneous and stationary, we derive a closed kinetic equation for the rate of change of the occupation numbers, perturbatively in the coupling. For a dilute gas, this reproduces the quantum Boltzmann equation, which only accounts for two-to-two scattering processes. Our expression goes beyond this, with terms accounting for multi-particle scattering processes, which are higher order in the density.</description>

      <title>A geometric one-fluid model of superfluid helium-4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10680v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A standard description of superfluid helium-4 is based on the concept of two components (superfluid and normal), which leads to the so called two-fluid models. However, as there are no two kinds of atoms in helium-4, the two components can not be separated. Superfluid helium-4 is not a mixture of two components, being rather a single fluid with two motions. Here, we present a geometric one-fluid model of superfluid helium-4, which is based on the Hamiltonian formulation of fluid mechanics. The model is derived from the kinetic theory of excitations (treated as an ideal Bose gas under the temperature $1.3K$) and average particle motions. It can be simplified to the Hall-Vinen-Bekharevich-Khalatnikov (HVBK) two-fluid model, where it removes one fitting parameter from the HVBK model, but it also gives extra terms beyond the HVBK model. Actually, we show that the two-fluid models are problematic in case of higher counter-flow velocities, where the usual splitting of total momentum to the superfluid and normal component becomes impossible. Finally, we show how vortex line density may be added to the state variables. The one-fluid model can be seen as a generalization of the two-fluid models that is geometrically consistent, fully compressible, with non-zero superfluid vorticity, and compatible with classical experiments.</description>

      <title>Boundary criticality for the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the boundary criticality for the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa (GNY) models. Employing interacting Dirac fermions on a honeycomb lattice with armchair boundaries, we use determinate quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) simulation to uncover rich boundary criticalities at the quantum phase transition to a charge-density-wave (CDW) insulator, including the ordinary, special, and extraordinary transitions. The Dirac fermions satisfy a Dirichlet boundary condition, while the boson field, representing the CDW order, obeys Dirichlet and Neumann conditions at the ordinary and special transitions, respectively, thereby enriching the critical GNY model. We develop a perturbative $4-\epsilon$ renormalization group approach to compute the boundary critical exponents. Our framework generalizes to other GNY universality class variants and provides theoretical predictions for experiments.</description>

      <title>Noise equals control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15670v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic systems have a control-theoretic interpretation in which noise plays the role of control. In the weak-noise limit, relevant at low temperatures or in large populations, this leads to a precise mathematical mapping: the most probable trajectory between two states minimizes an action functional and corresponds to an optimal control strategy. In Langevin dynamics, the noise term itself serves as the control. For general Markov jump processes, such as chemical reaction networks or electronic circuits, we use the Doi-Peliti formalism to identify the `response' (or `momentum') field $\pi$ as the control variable. This resolves a long-standing interpretational problem in the field-theoretic description of stochastic systems: although $\pi$ evolves backward in time, it has a clear physical role as the control that steers the system along rare trajectories. This implies that Nature is constantly sampling control strategies. We illustrate the mapping on multistable chemical reaction networks, systems with unstable fixed points, and specifically on stochastic resonance and Brownian ratchets. The noise-control mapping justifies agential descriptions of these phenomena, and builds intuition for otherwise puzzling phenomena of stochastic systems: why probabilities are generically non-smooth functions of state out of thermal equilibrium; why biological mechanisms can work better in the presence of noise; and how agential behavior emerges naturally without recourse to mysticism.</description>

      <title>A mesoscopic model for the rheology of dilute and semidilute solutions of wormlike micelles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of a `persistent worm' is introduced, representing the smallest possible length of a wormlike micelle, and modelled by a bead-spring chain with sticky beads at the ends. Persistent worms are allowed to combine with each other at their sticky ends to form wormlike micelles with a distribution of lengths, and the semiflexibility of a wormlike micelle is captured with a bending potential between springs, both within and across persistent worms that stick to each other. Multi-particle Brownian dynamics simulations of such polydisperse and `polyflexible' wormlike micelles, with hydrodynamic interactions included and coupled with reversible scission/fusion of persistent worms, are used to investigate the static and dynamic properties of wormlike micellar solutions in the dilute and unentangled semidilute concentration regimes. The influence of the sticker energy and persistent worm concentration are examined and simulations are shown to validate theoretical mean-field predictions of the universal scaling with concentration of the chain length distribution of linear wormlike micelles, independent of the sticker energy. The presence of wormlike micelles that form rings is shown not to affect the static properties of linear wormlike micelles and mean-field predictions of ring length distributions are validated. Linear viscoelastic storage and loss moduli are computed and the unique features in the intermediate frequency regime compared to those of homopolymer solutions are highlighted. The inclusion of hydrodynamic interactions (HI) enables the distinction between Rouse and Zimm dynamics in wormlike micelle solutions to be elucidated. While the neglect of HI is justified in the case of entangled wormlike micelle solutions, here the concentration at which the onset of the screening of hydrodynamic interactions occurs is clearly identified.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Sectors in Chord Space and Relational Holography in the DSSYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21447v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In holography, gauging symmetries of the boundary theory leads to important modifications in the bulk. In this work, we study constraints to gauge symmetry sectors in the chord Hilbert space of the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) with matter, and we connect them to different proposals of its bulk dual. These sectors include chord parity symmetry, corresponding to End-Of-The-World (ETW) branes and Euclidean wormholes in sine dilaton gravity; and relative time-translations in a doubled DSSYK model (resulting from a single DSSYK with an infinitely heavy matter chord) used in de Sitter holography. We define and evaluate partition functions and thermal correlation functions of the ETW brane and Euclidean wormhole systems in the boundary theory. We deduce the holographic dictionary by matching geodesic lengths in the bulk with the spread complexity of the parity-gauged DSSYK. The Euclidean wormholes of fixed size are perturbatively stable, and their baby universe Hilbert space is non-trivial only when matter is added. We conclude studying the constraints in the path integral of the doubled DSSYK. We derive the gauge invariant operator algebra of one of the DSSYKs dressed to the other one and discuss its holographic interpretation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study one dimensional stochastic particle systems with exclusion interaction that each site can be occupied by at most one particle, and homogeneous jumping rates. Alimohammadi and Ahmadi previously classified 28 Yang-Baxter integrable two-particle interaction rules for the two species models with homogeneous rates. In this work, we show that 7 of these 28 cases can be naturally extended to integrable models with an arbitrary number of species $N \geq 2$. Moreover, we discover new integrable models with one or two parameters that generalize these 7 cases. For 8 of the remaining 21 cases, we propose an alternative extension scheme that yields integrable $N$ species models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a computational framework based on the Gaussian formalism and symplectic circuit representation to explore cosmological perturbations during inflation. These tools offer an efficient means to study entanglement generation and particle production, particularly when analytical methods become insufficient and numerical simulations are essential. By evolving an initial Bunch-Davies vacuum through a two-mode squeezer, we simulate the behavior of the von Neumann entropy and logarithmic negativity across a wide range of cosmological backgrounds, each characterized by a distinct equation of state. The von Neumann entropy obtained via QuGIT simulations is compared with analytic R\'enyi entropy bounds, thereby validating the accuracy of our circuit implementation of the cosmological squeezing Hamiltonian in both accelerating and decelerating scenarios. We further investigate the role of thermal noise and demonstrate how the von Neumann entropy and logarithmic negativity are affected by its presence.</description>

      <title>Coupling of radial multiple SLE with Gaussian free field, and the hydrodynamic limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Schramm--Loewner evolution (SLE) has been one of the central topics in the probabilistic study of two-dimensional critical systems. It is a random curve in two dimensions to which a cluster interface in a critical lattice system is supposed, or has been proved, to converge. The most archetypical setting for SLE is called chordal, where a random curve evolves in a simply-connected domain from a boundary point to another, whereas in its variant called radial, a random curve evolves from a boundary point to a distinguished interior point. Multiple SLE is a variant to another direction; it deals with multiple random curves, and it is a natural direction as there are certainly multiple cluster interfaces found in critical lattice systems. In this paper, we study multiple SLE in the radial setting, namely, radial multiple SLE.
  We report two main results. One is regarding coupling between radial multiple SLE and Gaussian free field (GFF). Coupling between SLE and GFF has been extensively studied in the chordal setting, and serves as a foundation for many recent developments. We show that coupling between radial multiple SLE and GFF occurs if and only if the radial multiple SLE is driven by the circular Dyson Brownian motions.
  The circular Dyson Brownian motions are a typical example of stochastic log-gases. This fact motivates us to study the hydrodynamic limit of the corresponding radial multiple SLE, which refers to the dynamical law of large numbers, when the number of curves tends to infinity. In our other main result, we provide explicit description of the hydrodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Analytical phase boundary of a quantum driven-dissipative Kerr oscillator from classical stochastic instantons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The framework of Keldysh path integral concisely describes quantum systems driven away from thermal equilibrium, such as the two-photon driven Kerr oscillator. Within the thermodynamic limit of diverging photon occupation, we map it to a Martin-Siggia-Rose-Janssen-de Dominicis path integral, and obtain a purely classical, stochastic equivalent where photon self-interaction plays the role of temperature. This perspective sheds light on the difficulties encountered in the search for an effective thermodynamic potential to describe the bistability of the model. It allows us to estimate the bistable tunneling rates using a real-time instanton technique leading to an analytical expression of the phase boundary, the first to our knowledge. It opens the way to powerful semi-analytical techniques to be applied to various quantum optics models displaying bistability.</description>

      <title>Correlated decoherence and thermometry with mobile impurities in a 1D Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the correlated decoherence dynamics of two mobile impurities trapped within a gas of ultracold fermionic atoms. We use a mean-field approximation to self-consistently describe the effect of impurity-gas collisions on impurity motion, while decoherence of the impurities' internal state is computed exactly within a functional determinant approach. At equilibrium, we find that the impurities undergo bath-induced localisation as the impurity-gas interaction strength is increased. We then study the non-equilibrium dynamics induced by a sudden change of the impurities' internal state, which can be experimentally probed by Ramsey interferometry. Our theoretical approach allows us to investigate the effect of impurity motion on decoherence dynamics, finding strong deviations from the universal behaviour associated with Anderson's orthogonality catastrophe when the mass imbalance between impurity and gas atoms is small. Finally, we show that mobile impurities can be used as thermometers of their environment and that bath-mediated correlations can be beneficial for thermometric performance at low temperatures, even in the presence of non-trivial impurity motion. Our results showcase the interesting open quantum dynamics of mobile impurities dephasing in a common environment, and could help provide more precise temperature estimates of ultracold fermionic mixtures.</description>

Abstract: Living systems often function with regulatory interactions, but the question of how activity, stochasticity and regulations work together for achieving different goals still remains puzzling. We propose the model of an active tracking particle with information processing, based on which the entropy production, information flow, and generalised fluctuation theorem are derived. Moreover, the system performance, in terms of the first passage steps and the total energy consumption, are analysed in the variable space of (measurement error, control field), leading to discussions on the optimal control of the system. Not only elucidating the basic concepts involved in a stochastic active system with information processing, this prototypical model could also inspire more elaborated modelings of natural smart organisms and industrial designs of controllable active systems with desired physical performances in the future.</description>
