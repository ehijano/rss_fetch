      <title>Dark Branches of Immortal Stars at the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that stars in the inner parsec of the Milky Way can be significantly affected by dark matter annihilation, producing population-level effects that are visible in a Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram. We establish the dark HR diagram, where stars lie on a new stable $\textit{dark main sequence}$ with similar luminosities, but lower temperatures, than the standard main sequence. The dark matter density in these stars continuously replenishes, granting these stars immortality and solving multiple stellar anomalies. Upcoming telescopes could detect the dark main sequence, offering a new dark matter discovery avenue.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Tertiary-induced Binary Black Hole Mergers: the Role of Superthermal Wide Tertiary Eccentricity Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies show that the eccentricity distribution of wide binaries (semimajor axis $\gtrsim10^3\;\mathrm{AU}$) observed by \emph{Gaia} tends to favor large eccentricities more strongly than the canonical thermal distribution ($P(e) \propto e$) -- such distributions are termed ``superthermal''. Motivated by this observation, we revisit the formation channel of black hole (BH) binary mergers in triple stellar systems and study the impact of superthermal eccentricity distributions in the outer binaries. We explore the persistence of the highly eccentric outer orbits after each component in a stellar triple has undergone mass loss due to supernova explosions. We find that the outer eccentricity distribution can remain significantly superthermal for modestly hierarchical BH triples satisfying $a_{\rm in}/a_{\rm out}\gtrsim 0.005$ (where $a_{\rm in}$ and $a_{\rm out}$ are the semimajor axes of the inner and outer orbits), and are otherwise shaped by mass-loss induced kicks and dynamical instability. We then study the impact of these different outer eccentricity distributions of the remaining BH triples on mergers via the tertiary-induced channel. Of interest, we find that mergers can sometimes be produced even when the initial stellar orbits are near alignment (not subject to the von-Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai effect; ZLK effect) as long as the system is sufficiently hierarchical. On the other hand, although the impact of the octupole-order ZLK effect is much greater when the outer binary is more eccentric, we find that the merger fraction only changes modestly for extreme outer eccentricity distributions, as the largest eccentricities tend to lead to dynamical instability.</description>

      <title>Force-free wave interaction in magnetar magnetospheres: Computational modeling in axisymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crustal quakes of highly magnetized neutron stars can disrupt their magnetospheres, triggering energetic phenomena like X-ray and fast radio bursts (FRBs). Understanding plasma wave dynamics in these extreme environments is vital for predicting energy transport across scales to the radiation length. This study models relativistic plasma wave interaction in magnetar magnetospheres with force-free electrodynamics simulations. For propagation along curved magnetic field lines, we observe the continuous conversion of Alfv\'en waves (AWs) to fast magnetosonic (FMS) waves. The conversion efficiency can be up to three times higher when counter-propagating AWs interact in the equatorial region. Alfv\'en waves generate FMS waves of twice their frequency during their first crossing of the magnetosphere. After the initial transient burst of FMS waves, AWs convert to FMS waves periodically, generating variations on timescales of the magnetospheric AW crossing time. This decaying FMS wave tail carries a significant portion (half) of the total energy emitted. Plastic damping of `bouncing' AWs by the magnetar crust has minimal impact on the FMS efficiency. We discuss the implications of the identified wave phenomena for magnetar observations. Outgoing FMS waves can develop electric zones, potential sources of coherent radiation. Long wavelength FMS waves could generate FRBs through reconnection beyond the light cylinder.</description>

      <title>Swift J1727.8-1613 has the Largest Resolved Continuous Jet Ever Seen in an X-ray Binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-wavelength polarimetry and radio observations of Swift J1727.8-1613 at the beginning of its recent 2023 outburst suggested the presence of a bright compact jet aligned in the north-south direction, which could not be confirmed without high angular resolution images. Using the Very Long Baseline Array and the Long Baseline Array, we imaged Swift J1727.8-1613, during the hard/hard-intermediate state, revealing a bright core and a large, two-sided, asymmetrical, resolved jet. The jet extends in the north-south direction, at a position angle of $-0.60\pm0.07\deg$ East of North. At 8.4 GHz, the entire resolved jet structure is $\sim110 (d/2.7\,\text{kpc})/\sin i$ AU long, with the southern approaching jet extending $\sim80 (d/2.7\,\text{kpc})/\sin i$ AU from the core, where $d$ is the distance to the source and $i$ is the inclination of the jet axis to the line of sight. These images reveal the most resolved continuous X-ray binary jet, and possibly the most physically extended continuous X-ray binary jet ever observed. Based on the brightness ratio of the approaching and receding jets, we put a lower limit on the intrinsic jet speed of $\beta\geq0.27$ and an upper limit on the jet inclination of $i\leq74\deg$. In our first observation we also detected a rapidly fading discrete jet knot $66.89\pm0.04$ mas south of the core, with a proper motion of $0.66\pm0.05$ mas hour$^{-1}$, which we interpret as the result of a downstream internal shock or a jet-ISM interaction, as opposed to a transient relativistic jet launched at the beginning of the outburst.</description>

      <title>Searching for gravitational wave optical counterparts with the Zwicky Transient Facility: summary of O4a</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the first half of the fourth observing run (O4a) of the International Gravitational Wave Network (IGWN), the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) conducted a systematic search for kilonova (KN) counterparts to binary neutron star (BNS) and neutron star-black hole (NSBH) merger candidates. Here, we present a comprehensive study of the five high-significance (FAR &lt; 1 per year) BNS and NSBH candidates in O4a. Our follow-up campaigns relied on both target-of-opportunity observations (ToO) and re-weighting of the nominal survey schedule to maximize coverage. We describe the toolkit we have been developing, Fritz, an instance of SkyPortal, instrumental in coordinating and managing our telescope scheduling, candidate vetting, and follow-up observations through a user-friendly interface. ZTF covered a total of 2841 deg$^2$ within the skymaps of the high-significance GW events, reaching a median depth of g~20.2 mag. We circulated 15 candidates, but found no viable KN counterpart to any of the GW events. Based on the ZTF non-detections of the high-significance events in O4a, we used a Bayesian approach, nimbus, to quantify the posterior probability of KN model parameters that are consistent with our non-detections. Our analysis favors KNe with initial absolute magnitude fainter than -16 mag. The joint posterior probability of a GW170817-like KN associated with all our O4a follow-ups was 64%. Additionally, we use a survey simulation software, simsurvey, to determine that our combined filtered efficiency to detect a GW170817-like KN is 36%, when considering the 5 confirmed astrophysical events in O3 (1 BNS and 4 NSBH), along with our O4a follow-ups. Following Kasliwal et al. (2020), we derived joint constraints on the underlying KN luminosity function based on our O3 and O4a follow-ups, determining that no more than 76% of KNe fading at 1 mag/day can peak at a magnitude brighter than -17.5 mag.</description>

      <title>Studying magnetic reconnection with synchrotron polarization statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is a fundamental process for releasing magnetic energy in space physics and astrophysics. At present, the usual way to investigate the reconnection process is through analytical studies or first-principles numerical simulations. This paper is the first to understand the turbulent magnetic reconnection process by exploring the nature of magnetic turbulence. From the perspective of radio synchrotron polarization statistics, we study how to recover the properties of the turbulent magnetic field by considering the line of sight along different directions of the reconnection layer. We find that polarization intensity statistics can reveal the spectral properties of reconnection turbulence. This work opens up a new way of understanding turbulent magnetic reconnection.</description>

      <title>SN 2019tua : A Type IIb Supernova with Multiple Bumps in the Light Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present photometric and spectroscopic observations and analysis of the type IIb supernova (SN) SN 2019tua, which exhibits multiple bumps in its declining light curves between 40 and 65 days after discovery. SN 2019tua shows a time to peak of about 25 days similar to other type IIb SNe. Our observations indicate a decrease in its brightness of about 1 magnitude in the 60 days after the peak. At about days 50, and 60, its multiband light curves exhibit bumpy behavior. The complex luminosity evolution of SN 2019tua could not be well modeled with a single currently popular energy source model, e.g., radioactive decay of $^{56}$Ni, magnetar, interaction between the ejecta and a circumstellar shell. Even though the magnetar model has a smaller \( \chi^2 / \text{dof} \) value, the complex changes in SN 2019tua's brightness suggest that more than one physical process might be involved. We propose a hybrid CSM interaction plus $^{56}$Ni model to explain the bolometric light curve (LC) of SN 2019tua. The fitting results show that the ejecta mass $M_{\rm ej} \approx 2.4~M_\odot$, the total CSM mass $M_{\rm CSM} \approx 1.0~M_\odot$, and the $^{56}$Ni mass $M_{\rm Ni} \approx 0.4~M_\odot$. The total kinetic energy of the ejecta is $E_k\approx 0.5 \times 10^{51}\rm~erg$. Pre-existing multiple shells suggest that the progenitor of SN 2019tua experienced mass ejections within approximately $\sim6 - 44$ years prior to the explosion.</description>

      <title>Thermally emitting isolated neutron star candidates from the SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS) allows for the creation of a complete sample of X-ray dim isolated neutron stars (XDINSs), which will significantly facilitate the study of their population properties, evolution, and connection to other families of isolated neutron stars (INSs). In this work, we conduct a systematic search for XDINSs on the western Galactic hemisphere and discuss the resulting candidate sample. Consistently with the properties of the known XDINSs, we selected all eRASS sources possessing a soft X-ray spectral distribution and that are unlikely to be associated with optical or infrared sources. Our selection criteria allowed us to recover all known XDINSs and previously proposed candidates. In addition, we put forward 33 new candidate members for dedicated follow-up identification campaigns. We found the resulting candidate sample to be about 30-50% complete, mainly due to source confusion and the stringent cross-matching criteria adopted. The candidates of the sample presented here can be divided into two groups: 13 soft and 20 somewhat hard X-ray emitters. Interestingly, the thermal nature, spatial distribution, lack of known counterparts, and absence of significant flux variability of the candidates in the first group agree well with the properties of other confirmed thermally emitting INSs. For the candidates in the second group, the current observational data do not allow one to discern between rotation-powered or recycled pulsars, cataclysmic variables, or quiescent neutron stars in binary systems or even to rule out an extragalactic nature. On the basis of population synthesis and the estimated source completeness of the search, we expect that between one and three new XDINSs are among the already singled-out list of XDINS candidates - a long-sought increase in the proposed number of members of this elusive class of X-ray emitters.</description>

      <title>Revisiting short-plateau SN 2018gj</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an alternative model of unusual type-IIP SN 2018gj. Despite the short plateau and early gamma-rays escape seeming to favor low-mass ejecta, our hydrodynamic model requires a large ejected mass (about 23 Msun). The high ejecta velocity, we find from hydrogen lines in early spectra, is among crucial constraints on the hydrodynamic model. We recover the wind density that rules out a notable contribution of the circumstellar interaction to the bolometric luminosity. The early radioactive gamma-rays escape is found to be due to the high velocity of Ni-56, whereas the asymmetry of the H-alpha emission is attributed to the asymmetry of the Ni-56 ejecta. The available sample of type-IIP supernovae studied hydrodynamically in a uniform way indicates that the asymmetry of the Ni-56 ejecta is probably their intrinsic property. Hydrogen lines in the early spectra of SN 2018gi and SN 2020jfo are found to imply a clumpy structure of the outer ejecta. With two already known similar cases of SN 2008in and SN 2012A we speculate that the clumpiness of the outer ejecta is inherent to type-IIP supernovae related to the red supergiant explosion.</description>

      <title>Measuring Hawking Radiation from Black Hole Morsels in Astrophysical Black Hole Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that it is possible to observe the Hawking radiation emitted by small black holes assumed to form in catastrophic astrophysical events such as black hole mergers. Gamma ray bursts in the TeV range are unique footprints of these asteroid-mass black hole morsels ejected during the merger. The time delay of the gamma ray bursts from the gravitational wave event is correlated to the mass distribution of the morsels. The integrated mass of the morsels allowed by the unaccounted merger mass leads to a Hawking induced radiation in photons that is above the sensitivity of atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes such as HESS, LHAASO and HAWC.</description>

      <title>Impact of inhomogeneous diffusion on secondary cosmic ray and antiproton local spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent $\gamma$-ray and neutrino observations seem to favor the consideration of non-uniform diffusion of cosmic rays (CRs) throughout the Galaxy. In this study, we investigate the consequences of spatially-dependent inhomogeneous propagation of CRs on the fluxes of secondary CRs and antiprotons detected at Earth. A comparison is made among different scenarios in search of potential features that may guide us toward favoring one over another in the near future. We also examine both the influence of inhomogeneous propagation in the production of secondary CRs from interactions with the gas, and the effects of this scenario on the local fluxes of antiprotons and light antinuclei produced as final products of dark matter annihilation. Our results indicate that the consideration of an inhomogeneous diffusion model could improve the compatibility of the predicted local antiproton flux with that of B, Be and Li, assuming only secondary origin of these particles. In addition, our model predicts a slightly harder local antiproton spectrum, making it more compatible with the high energy measurements of AMS-02. Finally, no significant changes are expected in the predicted local flux of antiprotons and antinuclei produced from dark matter among the different considered propagation scenarios.</description>

      <title>Implication of jet physics from MeV line emission of GRB 221009A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-relativistic jets are believed to play important role in producing prompt emission and afterglow of Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB), but the nature of the jet is poorly known owing to the lacking of decisive features observed in the prompt emission. A series of bright, narrow and temporally evolving MeV emission line detected in the brightest-of-all-time GRB 221009A provide a chance to probe GRB jet physics. The evolution of the central energy of the line with power-law index $-1$ is naturally explained by high-latitude curvature effect. Under the assumption that the line emission is generated in the prompt emission by $e^\pm$ pair production, cooling and annihilation in the jet, we can strictly constrain jet physics with observed line emission properties. We find the radius of the emission region is $r\sim10^{16}$cm. The narrow line width of $10\%$ implies that pairs cool fast down to non-relativistic state within a time of tenth of the dynamical time. This requires a magnetic-field energy density much larger than the prompt gamma-ray energy density in the jet, implying a magnetic field dominated jet. The temporal behavior of line flux suggests some angle dependence of line emission. We also discuss the difficulties of other scenarios to interpret the observed emission line.</description>

      <title>The Kohn-Luttinger Effect in Dense Matter and its Implications for Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Repulsive short-range interactions can induce p-wave attraction between fermions in dense matter and lead to Cooper pairing at the Fermi surface. We investigate this phenomenon, well-known as the Kohn-Luttinger effect in condensed matter physics, in dense matter with strong short-range repulsive interactions. We find that repulsive interactions required to stabilize massive neutron stars can induce p-wave pairing in neutron and quark matter. When massive vector bosons mediate the interaction between fermions, the induced interaction favors Cooper pairing in the 3P2 channel. For the typical strength of the interaction favored by massive neutron stars, the associated pairing gaps in neutrons can be in the range of 10 keV to 10 MeV. Strong and attractive spin-orbit and tensor forces between neutrons can result in repulsive induced interactions that greatly suppress the 3P2 pairing gap in neutron matter. In quark matter, the induced interaction is too small to result in pairing gaps of phenomenological relevance.</description>

      <title>Ringing out General Relativity: Quasi-normal mode frequencies for black holes of any spin in modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After black holes collide, the remnant settles to a stationary state by emitting gravitational waves. Once non-linearities subside, these ringdown waves are dominated by exponentially-damped sinusoids, or quasinormal modes. We develop a general method using perturbative spectral expansions to calculate the quasinormal-mode frequencies and damping times in a wide class of modified gravity theories for black holes with any subextremal spin. We apply this method to scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity to show its accuracy, thus enabling robust ringdown tests with gravitational wave data.</description>

      <title>Hushing black holes: tails in dynamical spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stationary, asymptotically flat, black hole solutions of the vacuum field equations of General Relativity belong to the Kerr family. But how does one approach this state, dynamically? Linearized fluctuations decay at late times, at fixed spatial position, as a Price power law for generic initial conditions. However, little attention was paid to forced and nonlinear spacetimes, where matter and nonlinearities play a role. We uncover a new, source-driven tail governing waves generated by pointlike matter and nonlinearities, which can dominate over Price's decay.</description>

      <title>The Schwarzian Approach in Sturm-Liouville Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel method for finding the eigenvalues of a Sturm-Liouville problem is developed. Following the minimalist approach the problem is transformed to a single first-order differential equation with appropriate boundary conditions. Although the resulting equation is nonlinear, its form allows to find the general solution by adding a second part to a particular solution. This splitting of the general solution in two parts involves the Schwarzian derivative, hence the name of the approach. The eigenvalues that correspond to acceptable solutions asymptotically can be found by requiring the second part to correct the diverging behavior of the particular solution. The method can be applied to many different areas of physics, such as the Schr\"odinger equation in quantum mechanics and stability problems in fluid dynamics. Examples are presented.</description>

      <title>Cosmic rays from annihilation of heavy dark matter particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of the ultra high energy cosmic rays via annihilation of heavy stable, fermions "f", of the cosmological dark matter (DM) is studied. The particles in question are supposed to be created by the scalaron decays in $R^2$ modified gravity. Novel part of our approach is the assumption that the mass of these carriers of DM is slightly below than a half of the scalaron mass. In such a case the phase space volume becomes tiny. It leads to sufficiently low probability of "f" production, so their average cosmological energy density could be equal to the observed energy density of dark matter. Several regions of the universe, where the annihilation could take place, are studied. They include the whole universe under assumption of homogeneous energy density, the high density DM clump in the galactic centre, the cloud of DM in the Galaxy with realistic density distribution, and high density clusters of DM in the Galaxy. Possible resonance annihilation of $f \bar f$ into energetic light particle is considered. We have shown that the proposed scenario can successfully explain the origin of the ultrahigh energy flux of cosmic rays where the canonical astrophysical mechanisms are not operative.</description>

      <title>Constraining the stochastic gravitational wave background using the future lunar seismometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the old idea of using the moon as a resonant gravitational-wave (GW) detector, as well as the recent updates in modeling the lunar response to GWs, } we re-evaluate the feasibility of using a network of lunar seismometers to constrain the stochastic GW background (SGWB). In particular, using the updated model of the lunar response, we derive the pattern functions for the two polarizations of GW. With these pattern functions, we further calculate the overlap reduction functions for a network of lunar seismometers, where we have relaxed the conventional assumption that lunar seismometers are perfectly leveled to measure only the vertical acceleration. We apply our calculation to two future lunar projects, namely, Chang'e and the Lunar Gravitational-Wave Antenna (LGWA). We find that the two projects could constrain the SGWB to a level of $\Omega_{\text{GW}}^{\text{Chang'e}} &lt; 79$ and $\Omega_{\text{GW}}^{\text{LGWA}} &lt; 6.7 \times 10^{-11}$, respectively. These results are better than the constraints placed previously on the SGWB in the mid-frequency band (around $10^{-3}- 10~\text{Hz}$) by various types of experiments.</description>

      <title>Influence of quantum correction on the Schwarzschild black hole polarized image</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a model of an accretion disk around a Schwarzschild black hole, the analytic estimates for image polarization were derived by Narayan $et~al.$. [Astrophys. J, 102, 912 (2021)]. Recently, the EHT team also obtained polarization images of the Sgr A$^{*}$ and measured both linear and circular polarization [Astrophys. J. Lett, 964, L25 (2024)]. We find that quantum correction effects can also influence polarization information. Considering the quantum corrected Schwarzschild black hole (Kazakov-Solodukhin black hole), we derive the polarization intensity of the target black hole and investigate polarization images under different parameters. It is found that a larger quantum deformation leads to an expansion of the polarization region, while the polarization intensity value decrease. Under different observation angles, magnetic fields, fluid direction angles, and fluid velocity conditions, we also derive polarization images of corrected black holes. These key indicators not only affect the intensity of polarization but also the direction of polarization. We establish the relationship between polarization intensity and quantum correction deformation parameters, revealing a gradual decline in polarization intensity with reduced radius and an anti-polarization behavior induced by the progressive increase in deformation parameters at a constant radius. Our analysis may provide observational evidence for quantum effect of general relativity.</description>

      <title>Free Energy of Anisotropic Strangeon Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.19687v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Can pulsar-like compact objects release further huge free energy besides the kinematic energy of rotation? This is actually relevant to the equation of state of cold supra-nuclear matter, which is still under hot debate. Enormous energy is surely needed to understand various observations, such as $\gamma-$ray bursts, fast radio bursts and soft $\gamma-$ray repeaters. In this paper, the elastic/gravitational free energy of solid strangeon star is revisited for strangeon stars, with two anisotropic models to calculate in general relativity. It is found that huge free energy (&gt; $10^{46}$ erg) could be released via starquakes, given an extremely small anisotropy ($(p_{\rm t}-p_{\rm r})/p_{\rm r} \sim 10^{-4}$, with $p_{\rm t}$/$p_{\rm r}$ the tangential/radial pressure), implying pulsar-like stars could have great potential of free energy release without extremely strong magnetic fields in solid strangeon star model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These notes are self-contained, with the first 7 chapters used in a one-semester course with recommended texts by Wald, by Misner, Thorne and Wheeler, and by Schutz. In its treatment of topics covered in these standard texts, the presentation here typically includes steps skipped in Wald or MTW. Treatments of gravitational waves, particle orbits in black-hole backgrounds, the Teukolsky equation, and the initial value equations are motivated in part by the discoveries of gravitational waves from the inspiral and coalescence of binary black holes and neutron stars, advances in numerical relativity, and the expected LISA space-based observatory. The notes begin with a detailed presentation of special relativity with a geometrical orientation, starting with with time dilation and length contraction and including relativistic particles, fluids, electromagnetism, and curvilinear coordinates. Chaps. 2-5 cover curvature, the Einstein equation, relativistic stars, and black holes. Chap. 6, on gravitational waves, includes a discussion of detection and noise. Chap. 7 is a brief introduction to cosmology, deriving the metrics of homogeneous isotropic space, the equations governing a universe with matter, radiation and vacuum energy, and their solutions, and discussions of the cosmological redshift and on using gravitational waves to measure the Hubble constant.
  Chap. 8, on the initial value problem, has a section on the form of the equations used in numerical relativity. The Newman-Penrose formalism and the Teukolsky equation are covered in Chap. 9. Following that is a chapter on black-hole thermodynamics and a final chapter on the gravitational action and on conserved quantities for asymptotically flat spacetimes, using Noether's theorem. An appendix covers forms, densities, integration, and Cartan calculus.</description>

      <title>VLBI Detection of an Active Radio Source Potentially Driving 100-kpc Scale Emission in the Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxy IRAS F01004$-$2237</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG) IRAS F01004$-$2237 exhibits 100-kpc scale continuum emission at radio wavelengths. The absence of extended X-ray emission in IRAS F01004$-$2237 has suggested an active galactic nucleus (AGN) origin for the extended radio emission, whose properties and role in merging systems still need to be better understood. We present the results of multi-frequency observations of IRAS F01004$-$2237 conducted by the Very Long Baseline Array at 2.3 and 8.4 GHz. Compact 8.4-GHz continuum emission was detected on a 1-pc scale in the nuclear region with an intrinsic brightness temperature of $10^{8.1}$ K suggesting that the radio source is originated from an AGN, potentially driving the extended emission. In contrast, no significant emission was observed at 2.3 GHz, indicating the presence of low-frequency absorption. This absorption cannot be attributed solely to synchrotron self-absorption; alternatively, free-free absorption due to thermal plasma is mainly at work in the spectrum. From combined perspectives, including mid-infrared and X-ray data, the AGN is obscured in a dense environment. The kinetic power of the nonthermal jet, as inferred from the extended emission, can play a more important role in dispersing the surrounding medium than the thermal outflow in IRAS F01004$-$2237. These findings hint that jet activities in ULIRGs may contribute to AGN feedback during galaxy evolution induced by merger events.</description>

      <title>Particle shells from relativistic bubble walls</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relativistic bubble walls from cosmological phase transitions (PT) necessarily accumulate expanding shells of particles. We systematically characterize shell properties, and identify and calculate the processes that prevent them from free streaming: phase-space saturation effects, out-of-equilibrium $2\to2$ and $3\to2$ shell-shell and shell-bath interactions, and shell interactions with bubble walls. We find that shells do not free stream in scenarios widely studied in the literature, where standard predictions will need to be reevaluated, including those of bubble wall velocities, gravitational waves (GW) and particle production. Our results support the use of bulk-flow GW predictions in all regions where shells free stream, irrespectively of whether or not the latent heat is mostly converted in the scalar field gradient.</description>

      <title>Imaging a semi-classical horizonless compact object with strong redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent advancements in black hole imaging have opened a new era of probing horizon-scale physics with electromagnetic radiation. However, a feature of the observed images, a bright ring encircling a relatively dark region, has not sufficiently proved the existence of event horizons. It thus requires extreme care when studying the possibility of using such image features to examine quantum effects that may change the classical picture of black holes slightly or drastically. In this work, we investigate the image of a horizonless compact object, whose interior metric satisfies the 4D semi-classical Einstein equation non-perturbatively for the Planck constant, and whose entropy agrees with the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. Although the absence of an event horizon allows light rays to pass through the dense interior, the extremely strong redshift significantly darkens the image, making it almost identical to the classical black-hole image. In particular, if there is light emission a bit inside the surface of the object, the intensity around the inner shadow is slightly enhanced, which could be a future observable prediction to characterize the object. We also find through a phenomenological parameter that the image is further darkened due to interactions inside. Thus, the image is consistent with current observations, and the object could be a candidate for black holes in quantum theory.</description>

      <title>SPHINCS_BSSN: Numerical Relativity with Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this book chapter we describe the {\em Lagrangian} numerical relativity code \sphi. This code evolves spacetimes in full General Relativity by integrating the BSSN equations on structured meshes with a simple dynamical mesh refinement strategy. The fluid is evolved by means of freely moving Lagrangian particles, that are evolved using a modern Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) formulation. To robustly and accurately capture shocks, our code uses artificial dissipation terms, but, similar to Finite Volume schemes, we apply a slope-limited reconstruction within the dissipative terms and we use in addition time-dependent dissipation parameters, so that dissipation is only applied where needed. The technically most complicated, but absolutely crucial part of the methodology, is the coupling between the particles and the mesh. For the mapping of the energy-momentum tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$ from the particles to the mesh, we use a sophisticated combination of "Local Regression Estimate" (LRE) method and a "multi-dimensional optimal order detection" (MOOD) approach which we describe in some detail. The mapping of the metric quantities from the grid to the particles is achieved by a quintic Hermite interpolation. Apart from giving an introduction to our numerical methods, we demonstrate the accurate working of our code by presenting a set of representative relativistic hydrodynamics tests. We begin with a relativistic shock tube test, then compare the frequencies of a fully relativistic neutron star with reference values from the literature and, finally, we present full-blown merger simulations of irrotational binary systems, one case where a central remnant survives and another where a black hole forms, and of a binary where only one of the stars is rapidly spinning.</description>
