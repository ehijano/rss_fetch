      <title>The Redundancy of Non-Singular Channel Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel simulation is an alternative to quantization and entropy coding for performing lossy source coding. Recently, channel simulation has gained significant traction in both the machine learning and information theory communities, as it integrates better with machine learning-based data compression algorithms and has better rate-distortion-perception properties than quantization. As the practical importance of channel simulation increases, it is vital to understand its fundamental limitations. Recently, Sriramu and Wagner provided an almost complete characterisation of the redundancy of channel simulation algorithms. In this paper, we complete this characterisation. First, we significantly extend a result of Li and El Gamal, and show that the redundancy of any instance of a channel simulation problem is lower bounded by the channel simulation divergence. Second, we give two proofs that the asymptotic redundancy of simulating iid non-singular channels is lower-bounded by $1/2$: one using a direct approach based on the asymptotic expansion of the channel simulation divergence and one using large deviations theory.</description>

      <title>Switched Feedback for the Multiple-Access Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A mechanism called switched feedback is introduced; under switched feedback, each channel output goes forward to the receiver(s) or backwards to the transmitter(s) but never both. By studying the capacity of the Multiple Access Channel (MAC) with switched feedback, this work investigates the potential benefits of feedback in the MAC and explores strategies for maximizing that benefit under reliable and unreliable feedback scenarios. The study is motivated by an exploration of the tradeoffs between cooperation and transmission in the context of communication systems. Results include upper and lower bounds on the capacity region of the MAC with switched feedback.</description>

      <title>Single-Letter Characterization of the Mismatched Distortion-Rate Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mismatched distortion-rate problem has remained open since its formulation by Lapidoth in 1997. In this paper, we characterize the mismatched distortion-rate function. Our single-letter solution highlights the adequate conditional distributions for the encoder and the decoder. The achievability result relies on a time-sharing argument that allows to convexify the upper bound of Lapidoth. We show that it is sufficient to consider two regimes, one with a large rate and another one with a small rate. Our main contribution is the converse proof. Suppose that the encoder selects a single-letter conditional distribution distinct from the one in the solution, we construct an encoding strategy that leads to the same expected cost for both encoder and decoder. This ensures that the encoder cannot gain by changing the single-letter conditional distribution. This argument relies on a careful identification of the sequence of auxiliary random variables. By building on Caratheodory's Theorem we show that the cardinality of the auxiliary random variables is equal to the one of the source alphabet plus three.</description>

      <title>Max-Min Fairness for IRS-Assisted Secure Two-Way Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates an intelligent reflective surface (IRS) assisted secure multi-user two-way communication system. The aim of this paper is to enhance the physical layer security by optimizing the minimum secrecy-rate among all user-pairs in the presence of a malicious user. The optimization problem is converted into an alternating optimization problem consisting of two sub-problems. Transmit power optimization is handled using a fractional programming method, whereas IRS phase shift optimization is handled with semi-definite programming. The convergence of the proposed algorithm is investigated numerically. The performance gain in minimum secrecy-rate is quantified for four different user configurations in comparison to the baseline scheme. Results indicate a 3.6-fold gain in minimum secrecy rate over the baseline scheme when the IRS is positioned near a legitimate user, even when the malicious user is located close to the same legitimate user.</description>

      <title>Between Close Enough to Reveal and Far Enough to Protect: a New Privacy Region for Correlated Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When users make personal privacy choices, correlation between their data can cause inadvertent leakage about users who do not want to share their data by other users sharing their data. As a solution, we consider local redaction mechanisms. As prior works proposed data-independent privatization mechanisms, we study the family of data-independent local redaction mechanisms and upper-bound their utility when data correlation is modeled by a stationary Markov process. In contrast, we derive a novel data-dependent mechanism, which improves the utility by leveraging a data-dependent leakage measure.</description>

      <title>On the Rate-Exponent Region of Integrated Sensing and Communications With Variable-Length Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the achievable rate-exponent region of integrated sensing and communication systems in the presence of variable-length coding with feedback. This scheme is fundamentally different from earlier studies, as the coding methods that utilize feedback impose different constraints on the codewords. The focus herein is specifically on the Gaussian channel, where three achievable regions are analytically derived and numerically evaluated. In contrast to a setting without feedback, we show that a trade-off exists between the operations of sensing and communications.</description>

      <title>Information Age and Correctness for Energy Harvesting Devices with Random Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a large network of energy-harvesting devices that monitor two-state Markov processes and send status updates to a gateway using the slotted ALOHA protocol without feedback. We let the devices adjust their transmission probabilities according to their process state transitions and current battery levels. Using a Markovian framework, we analyze the average value of a generic state-dependent penalty function that grows whenever there is a state estimation error. The age of incorrect information (AoII) is an example of such penalty function. We propose an accurate and easy-to-compute approximation for the average penalty. Numerical results demonstrate the benefits of optimizing the transmission probabilities to minimize the average penalty. The average-AoII-minimizing strategy can be highly suboptimal in terms of average penalty when one of the process states is critical, i.e., entails a high penalty if wrongly estimated. Furthermore, minimizing the average penalty does not guarantee a low probability of misdetecting a critical state period.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Past works on remote lossy source coding studied the rate under average distortion and the error exponent of excess distortion probability. In this work, we look into how fast the excess distortion probability converges to 1 at small rates, also known as exponential strong converse. We characterize its exponent by establishing matched upper and lower bounds. From the exponent, we also recover two previous results on lossy source coding and biometric authentication.</description>

      <title>Channel Independent Precoder for OFDM-based Systems over Fading Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose an independent channel precoder for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems over fading channels. The design of the precoder is based on the information redistribution of the input modulated symbols amongst the output precoded symbols. The proposed precoder decreases the variance of the instantaneous noise power at the receiver produced by the channel variability. The employment of an interleaver together with a precoding matrix whose size does not depend on the number of data carriers in an OFDM symbol allows different configurations of time-frequency diversity which can be easily adapted to the channel conditions. The precoder is evaluated with a modified Zero Forcing (ZF) equalizer whose maximum gain is constrained by means of a clipping factor. Thus, the clipping factor limits the noise power transfer in the receiver deprecoding block in low SNR conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This dissertation addresses the challenge of ensuring transactional integrity and reducing costs in corporate governance through blockchain technology. We propose an on-chain methodology for certifying, registering, and querying institutional transactional status. Our decentralized governance approach utilizes consensus mechanisms and smart contracts to automate and enforce business rules. The framework aims to reduce the transaction costs associated with contractual measurement reports and enhance overall transactional integrity. We provide a detailed exploration of how blockchain technology can be effectively harnessed to offer a robust solution to these challenges, setting the stage for our proposed solution and its potential impact on corporate governance. The application of the methodology resulted in as average of 2% overbilling reduction.</description>

      <title>5G LDPC Linear Transformer for Channel Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel, fully differentiable linear-time complexity transformer decoder and a transformer decoder to correct 5G New Radio (NR) LDPC. We propose a scalable approach to decode linear block codes with $O(n)$ complexity rather than $O(n^2)$ for regular transformers. The architectures' performances are compared to Belief Propagation (BP), the production-level decoding algorithm used for 5G New Radio (NR) LDPC codes. We achieve bit error rate performance that matches a regular Transformer decoder and surpases one iteration BP, also achieving competitive time performance against BP, even for larger block codes. We utilize Sionna, Nvidia's 5G &amp; 6G physical layer research software, for reproducible results.</description>

      <title>WaveMax: Radar Waveform Design via Convex Maximization of FrFT Phase Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ambiguity function (AF) is a critical tool in radar waveform design, representing the two-dimensional correlation between a transmitted signal and its time-delayed, frequency-shifted version. Obtaining a radar signal to match a specified AF magnitude is a bi-variate variant of the well-known phase retrieval problem. Prior approaches to this problem were either limited to a few classes of waveforms or lacked a computable procedure to estimate the signal. Our recent work provided a framework for solving this problem for both band- and time-limited signals using non-convex optimization. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach WaveMax that formulates waveform recovery as a convex optimization problem by relying on the fractional Fourier transform (FrFT)-based AF. We exploit the fact that AF of the FrFT of the original signal is equivalent to a rotation of the original AF. In particular, we reconstruct the radar signal by solving a low-rank minimization problem, which approximates the waveform using the leading eigenvector of a matrix derived from the AF. Our theoretical analysis shows that unique waveform reconstruction is achievable with a sample size no more than three times the signal frequencies or time samples. Numerical experiments validate the efficacy of WaveMax in recovering signals from noiseless and noisy AF, including scenarios with randomly and uniformly sampled sparse data.</description>

      <title>Tight Sample Complexity Bounds for Parameter Estimation Under Quantum Differential Privacy for Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This short note provides tight upper and lower bounds for minimal number of samples (copies of quantum states) required to attain a prescribed accuracy (measured by error variance) for scalar parameters using unbiased estimators under quantum local differential privacy for qubits. In the small privacy budget $\epsilon$ regime, i.e., $\epsilon\ll 1$, the sample complexity scales as $\Theta(\epsilon^{-2})$. This bound matches that of classical parameter estimation under differential privacy. The lower bound loosens (converges to zero) in the large privacy budget regime, i.e., $\epsilon\gg 1$, but that case is not particularly interesting as tight bounds for parameter estimation in the noiseless case are widely known. That being said, extensions to systems with higher dimensions and tightening the bounds for the large privacy budget regime are interesting avenues for future research.</description>

      <title>STAR-RIS-Enabled Multi-Path Beam Routing with Passive Beam Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can be densely deployed in the environment to create multi-reflection line-of-sight (LoS) links for signal coverage enhancement. However, conventional reflection-only RISs can only achieve half-space reflection, which limits the LoS path diversity. In contrast, simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RISs (STAR-RISs) can achieve full-space reflection and transmission, thereby creating more LoS paths. Hence, in this paper, we study a new multi-STAR-RIS-aided communication system, where a multi-antenna base station (BS) transmits to multiple single-antenna users by exploiting the signal beam routing over a set of cascaded LoS paths each formed by multiple STAR-RISs. To reveal essential insights, we first consider a simplified single-user case, aiming to maximize its received signal power by jointly optimizing the active beamforming at the BS, the BS's power allocation over different paths, the number of selected beam-routing paths, the selected STAR-RISs for each path, as well as their amplitude and phase shifts for transmission/reflection. However, this problem is difficult to be optimally solved as different paths may be intricately coupled at their shared STAR-RISs. To tackle this difficulty, we first derive the optimal solution to this problem in closed-form for a given set of paths. The clique-based approach in graph theory is then applied to solve the remaining multi-path selection problem efficiently. Next, we extend the proposed clique-based method to the multi-user case to maximize the minimum received signal power among all users, subject to additional constraints on the disjointness of the selected paths for different users. Simulation results show that our proposed STAR-RIS-enabled beam routing outperforms the conventional beam routing with reflection-only RISs in both single- and multi-user cases.</description>

      <title>From Classical to Quantum: Explicit Classical Distributions Achieving Maximal Quantum $f$-Divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explicit classical states achieving maximal $f$-divergence are given, allowing for a simple proof of Matsumoto's Theorem, and the systematic extension of any inequality between classical $f$-divergences to quantum $f$-divergences. Our methodology is particularly simple as it does not require any elaborate matrix analysis machinery but only basic linear algebra. It is also effective, as illustrated by two examples improving existing bounds: (i)~an improved quantum Pinsker inequality is derived between $\chi^2$ and trace norm, and leveraged to improve a bound in decoherence theory; (ii)~a new reverse quantum Pinsker inequality is derived for any quantum $f$-divergence, and compared to previous (Audenaert-Eisert and Hirche-Tomamichel) bounds.</description>

      <title>CSI-Free Low-Complexity Remote State Estimation over Wireless MIMO Fading Channels using Semantic Analog Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate low-complexity remote system state estimation over wireless multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) channels without requiring prior knowledge of channel state information (CSI). We start by reviewing the conventional Kalman filtering-based state estimation algorithm, which typically relies on perfect CSI and incurs considerable computational complexity. To overcome the need for CSI, we introduce a novel semantic aggregation method, in which sensors transmit semantic measurement discrepancies to the remote state estimator through analog aggregation. To further reduce computational complexity, we introduce a constant-gain-based filtering algorithm that can be optimized offline using the constrained stochastic successive convex approximation (CSSCA) method. We derive a closed-form sufficient condition for the estimation stability of our proposed scheme via Lyapunov drift analysis. Numerical results showcase significant performance gains using the proposed scheme compared to several widely used methods.</description>

      <title>CAMEO: Autocorrelation-Preserving Line Simplification for Lossy Time Series Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series data from a variety of sensors and IoT devices need effective compression to reduce storage and I/O bandwidth requirements. While most time series databases and systems rely on lossless compression, lossy techniques offer even greater space-saving with a small loss in precision. However, the unknown impact on downstream analytics applications requires a semi-manual trial-and-error exploration. We initiate work on lossy compression that provides guarantees on complex statistical features (which are strongly correlated with the accuracy of the downstream analytics). Specifically, we propose a new lossy compression method that provides guarantees on the autocorrelation and partial-autocorrelation functions (ACF/PACF) of a time series. Our method leverages line simplification techniques as well as incremental maintenance of aggregates, blocking, and parallelization strategies for effective and efficient compression. The results show that our method improves compression ratios by 2x on average and up to 54x on selected datasets, compared to previous lossy and lossless compression methods. Moreover, we maintain -- and sometimes even improve -- the forecasting accuracy by preserving the autocorrelation properties of the time series. Our framework is extensible to multivariate time series and other statistical features of the time series.</description>

      <title>Destructive and constructive RIS beamforming in an ISAC-multi-user MIMO network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11314v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has already established itself as a promising solution to the spectrum scarcity problem, even more so when paired with a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), as RISs can shape the propagation environment by adjusting their phase-shift coefficients. Albeit the potential performance gain, a RIS is also a potential security threat to the system. In this paper, we explore both the positive and negative sides of having a RIS in a multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) ISAC network. We first develop an alternating optimization algorithm, obtaining the active and passive beamforming vectors that maximize the sensing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) under minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints for the communication users and finite power budget. We also investigate the destructive potential of the RIS by devising a RIS phase-shift optimization algorithm that minimizes the sensing SNR while preserving the same minimum communication SINR previously guaranteed by the system. We further investigate the impact of the RIS's individual element failures on the system performance. The simulation results show that the RIS performance-boosting potential is as good as its destructive one and that both of our optimization strategies are hindered by the investigated impairments.</description>

      <title>Divergence Inequalities with Applications in Ergodic Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The data processing inequality is central to information theory and motivates the study of monotonic divergences. However, it is not clear operationally we need to consider all such divergences. We establish a simple method for Pinsker inequalities as well as general bounds in terms of $\chi^{2}$-divergences for twice-differentiable $f$-divergences. These tools imply new relations for input-dependent contraction coefficients. We use these relations to show for many $f$-divergences the rate of contraction of a time homogeneous Markov chain is characterized by the input-dependent contraction coefficient of the $\chi^{2}$-divergence. This is efficient to compute and the fastest it could converge for a class of divergences. We show similar ideas hold for mixing times. Moreover, we extend these results to the Petz $f$-divergences in quantum information theory, albeit without any guarantee of efficient computation. These tools may have applications in other settings where iterative data processing is relevant.</description>

      <title>Sequence Reconstruction for the Single-Deletion Single-Substitution Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03833v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The central problem in sequence reconstruction is to find the minimum number of distinct channel outputs required to uniquely reconstruct the transmitted sequence. According to Levenshtein's work in 2001, this number is determined by the size of the maximum intersection between the error balls of any two distinct input sequences of the channel. In this work, we study the sequence reconstruction problem for single-deletion single-substitution channel, assuming that the transmitted sequence belongs to a $q$-ary code with minimum Hamming distance at least $2$, where $q\geq 2$ is any fixed integer. Specifically, we prove that for any two $q$-ary sequences of length $n$ and with Hamming distance $d\geq 2$, the size of the intersection of their error balls is upper bounded by $2qn-3q-2-\delta_{q,2}$, where $\delta_{i,j}$ is the Kronecker delta. We also prove the tightness of this bound by constructing two sequences the intersection size of whose error balls achieves this bound.</description>

      <title>Convexity of Mutual Information along the Fokker-Planck Flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05094v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the convexity of mutual information as a function of time along the Fokker-Planck flow. The results are generalizations of that along heat flow and Ornstein-Ulenbeck flow, which were established by A. Wibisono and V. Jog. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the classical solutions to a class of Fokker-Planck equations and then we obtain the second derivative of mutual information along the Fokker-Planck equation. If the initial distribution is sufficiently strongly log-concave compared to the steady state, then mutual information always preserves convexity under suitable conditions. In particular, if there exists some time point at which the distribution is sufficiently strongly log-concave, then mutual information will preserve convexity after that time.</description>

      <title>A Revisit to Rate-distortion Theory via Optimal Weak Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09362v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper revisits the rate-distortion theory from the perspective of optimal weak transport, as recently introduced by Gozlan et al. While the conditions for optimality and the existence of solutions are well-understood in the case of discrete alphabets, the extension to abstract alphabets requires more intricate analysis. Within the framework of weak transport problems, we derive a parametric representation of the rate-distortion function, thereby connecting the rate-distortion function with the Schr\"odinger bridge problem, and establish necessary conditions for its optimality. As a byproduct of our analysis, we reproduce K. Rose's conclusions regarding the achievability of Shannon lower bound concisely, without reliance on variational calculus.</description>

      <title>PIR Over Wireless Channels: Achieving Privacy With Public Responses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of Private Information Retrieval (PIR) over a public Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel. In such a setup, the server's responses are visible to other servers. Thus, a curious server can listen to the other responses, compromising the user's privacy. Indeed, previous works on PIR over a shared medium assumed the servers cannot instantaneously listen to other responses. To address this gap, we present a novel randomized lattice -- PIR coding scheme that jointly codes for privacy, channel noise, and curious servers which may listen to other responses. We demonstrate that a positive PIR rate is achievable even in cases where the channel to the curious server is stronger than the channel to the user.</description>

Abstract: We study the channel resolvability problem, which is used to prove strong converse of identification via channel. Channel resolvability has been solved by only random coding in the literature. We prove channel resolvability using the multiplicative weight update algorithm. This is the first approach to channel resolvability using non-random coding.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limits of Non-Adaptive Group Testing with Markovian Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12588v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a correlated group testing model where items are infected according to a Markov chain, which creates bursty binfection patterns. Focusing on a very sparse infections regime, we propose a non adaptive testing strategy with an efficient decoding scheme that is nearly optimal. Specifically, it achieves asymptotically vanishing error with a number of tests that is within a $1/\ln(2) \approx 1.44$ multiplicative factor of the fundamental entropy bound a result that parallels the independent group testing setting. We show that the number of tests reduces with an increase in the expected burst length of infected items, quantifying the advantage of exploiting correlation in test design.</description>

Abstract: Graph code is a linear code obtained from linear codes $C$ and a certain bipartite graph G. In this paper, I propose an expansion of the definition of graph code to general $l$-partite, and give its lower bound of minimum distance. I also give an example of generalized graph code and calculate its parameters $[n, k, d]$.</description>
