      <title>Completeness in the Polynomial Hierarchy and PSPACE for many natural problems derived from NP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many natural optimization problems derived from $\sf NP$ admit bilevel and multilevel extensions in which decisions are made sequentially by multiple players with conflicting objectives, as in interdiction, adversarial selection, and adjustable robust optimization. Such problems are naturally modeled by alternating quantifiers and, therefore, lie beyond $\sf NP$, typically in the polynomial hierarchy or $\sf PSPACE$. Despite extensive study of these problem classes, relatively few natural completeness results are known at these higher levels. We introduce a general framework for proving completeness in the polynomial hierarchy and $\sf PSPACE$ for problems derived from $\sf NP$. Our approach is based on a refinement of $\sf NP$, which we call $\sf NP$ with solutions ($\sf NP$-$\sf S$), in which solutions are explicit combinatorial objects, together with a restricted class of reductions -- solution-embedding reductions -- that preserve solution structure. We define $\sf NP$-$\sf S$-completeness and show that a large collection of classical $\sf NP$-complete problems, including Clique, Vertex Cover, Knapsack, and Traveling Salesman, are $\sf NP$-$\sf S$-complete.
  Using this framework, we establish general meta-theorems showing that if a problem is $\sf NP$-$\sf S$-complete, then its natural two-level extensions are $\Sigma_2^p$-complete, its three-level extensions are $\Sigma_3^p$-complete, and its $k$-level extensions are $\Sigma_k^p$-complete. When the number of levels is unbounded, the resulting problems are $\sf PSPACE$-complete. Our results subsume nearly all previously known completeness results for multilevel optimization problems derived from $\sf NP$ and yield many new ones simultaneously, demonstrating that high computational complexity is a generic feature of multilevel extensions of $\sf NP$-complete problems.</description>

      <title>Limits of Kernelization and Parametrization for Phylogenetic Diversity with Dependencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Maximize Phylogenetic Diversity problem, we are given a phylogenetic tree that represents the genetic proximity of species, and we are asked to select a subset of species of maximum phylogenetic diversity to be preserved through conservation efforts, subject to budgetary constraints that allow only k species to be saved. This neglects that it is futile to preserve a predatory species if we do not also preserve at least a subset of the prey it feeds on. Thus, in the Optimizing PD with Dependencies ($\epsilon$-PDD) problem, we are additionally given a food web that represents the predator-prey relationships between species. The goal is to save a set of k species of maximum phylogenetic diversity such that for every saved species, at least one of its prey is also saved. This problem is NP-hard even when the phylogenetic tree is a star. The $\alpha$-PDD problem alters PDD by requiring that at least some fraction $\alpha$ of the prey of every saved species are also saved. In this paper, we study the parameterized complexity of $\alpha$-PDD. We prove that the problem is W[1]-hard and in XP when parameterized by the solution size k, the diversity threshold D, or their complements. When parameterized by the vertex cover number of the food web, $\alpha$-PDD is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT). A key measure of the computational difficulty of a problem that is FPT is the size of the smallest kernel that can be obtained. We prove that, when parameterized by the distance to clique, 1-PDD admits a linear kernel. Our main contribution is to prove that $\alpha$-PDD does not admit a polynomial kernel when parameterized by the vertex cover number plus the diversity threshold D, even if the phylogenetic tree is a star. This implies the non-existence of a polynomial kernel for $\alpha$-PDD also when parameterized by a range of structural parameters of the food web, such as its dist[...]</description>

      <title>Polynomial-Time Solutions for Longest Common Subsequence Related Problems Between a Sequence and a Pangenome Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A pangenome captures the genetic diversity across multiple individuals simultaneously, providing a more comprehensive reference for genome analysis than a single linear genome, which may introduce allele bias. A widely adopted pangenome representation is a node-labeled directed graph, wherein the paths correspond to plausible genomic sequences within a species. Consequently, evaluating sequence-to-pangenome graph similarity constitutes a fundamental task in pangenome construction and analysis. This study explores the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem and three of its variants involving a sequence and a pangenome graph. We present four polynomial-time reductions that transform these LCS-related problems into the longest path problem in a directed acyclic graph (DAG). These reductions demonstrate that all four problems can be solved in polynomial time, establishing their membership in the complexity class P.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear methods for tensors: determinantal equations for secant varieties beyond cactus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a family of flattening methods of tensors which we call Kronecker-Koszul flattenings, generalizing the famous Koszul flattenings and further equations of secant varieties studied among others by Landsberg, Manivel, Ottaviani and Strassen. We establish new border rank criteria given by vanishing of minors of Kronecker-Koszul flattenings. We obtain the first explicit polynomial equations -- tangency flattenings -- vanishing on secant varieties of Segre variety, but not vanishing on cactus varieties. Additionally, our polynomials have simple determinantal expressions. As another application, we provide a new, computer-free proof that the border rank of the $2\times2$ matrix multiplication tensor is $7$.</description>

      <title>Between proper and square coloring of planar graphs, hardness and extremal graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $(1^a, 2^b)$-coloring is the problem of partitioning the vertex set of a graph into $a$ independent sets and $b$ 2-independent sets. This problem was recently introduced by Choi and Liu. We study the computational complexity and extremal properties of $(1^a, 2^b)$-coloring. We prove that this problem is NP-Complete even when restricted to certain classes of planar graphs, and we also investigate the extremal values of $b$ when $a$ is fixed and in some $(a + 1)$-colorable classes of graphs. In particular, we prove that $k$-degenerate graphs are $(1^k, 2^{O(\sqrt{n})})$-colorable, that triangle-free planar graphs are $(1^2, 2^{O(\sqrt{n})})$-colorable and that planar graphs are $(1^3, 2^{O(\sqrt{n})})$-colorable. All upper bounds obtained are tight up to a constant factor.</description>

      <title>Classification of Local Optimization Problems in Directed Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a complete classification of the distributed computational complexity of local optimization problems in directed cycles for both the deterministic and the randomized LOCAL model. We show that for any local optimization problem $\Pi$ (that can be of the form min-sum, max-sum, min-max, or max-min, for any local cost or utility function over some finite alphabet), and for any \emph{constant} approximation ratio $\alpha$, the task of finding an $\alpha$-approximation of $\Pi$ in directed cycles has one of the following complexities:
  1. $O(1)$ rounds in deterministic LOCAL, $O(1)$ rounds in randomized LOCAL,
  2. $\Theta(\log^* n)$ rounds in deterministic LOCAL, $O(1)$ rounds in randomized LOCAL,
  3. $\Theta(\log^* n)$ rounds in deterministic LOCAL, $\Theta(\log^* n)$ rounds in randomized LOCAL,
  4. $\Theta(n)$ rounds in deterministic LOCAL, $\Theta(n)$ rounds in randomized LOCAL.
  Moreover, for any given $\Pi$ and $\alpha$, we can determine the complexity class automatically, with an efficient (centralized, sequential) meta-algorithm, and we can also efficiently synthesize an asymptotically optimal distributed algorithm.
  Before this work, similar results were only known for local search problems (e.g., locally checkable labeling problems). The family of local optimization problems is a strict generalization of local search problems, and it contains numerous commonly studied distributed tasks, such as the problems of finding approximations of the maximum independent set, minimum vertex cover, minimum dominating set, and minimum vertex coloring.</description>

      <title>Complex to Rational Fast Matrix Multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast matrix multiplication algorithms are asymptotically faster than the classical cubic-time algorithm, but they are often slower in practice. One important obstacle is the use of complex coefficients, which increases arithmetic overhead and limits practical efficiency. This paper focuses on transforming complex-coefficient matrix multiplication schemes into equivalent real- or rational-coefficient ones. We present a systematic method that, given a complex-coefficient scheme, either constructs a family of equivalent rational algorithms or proves that no equivalent rational scheme exists. Our approach relies only on basic linear-algebraic properties of similarity transformations of complex matrices. This method recovers the previously known ad hoc results of Dumas, Pernet, and Sedoglavic (2025) and extends them to more general settings, including algorithms involving rational coefficients and square roots, with $i=\sqrt{-1}$ as a special case.
  Using this framework, we show that no rational scheme is equivalent to Smirnov's $\langle4,4,9,104\rangle$ $\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{161}]$ algorithm (2022) and that no real scheme is equivalent to the $\langle4,4,4,48\rangle$ complex algorithm of Kaporin (2024). More generally, our approach can also be used to prove the non-existence of integer-coefficient schemes.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Sequence-to-Graph Alignment with Co-Linear Chaining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequence alignment is a cornerstone technique in computational biology for assessing similarities and differences among biological sequences. A key variant, sequence-to-graph alignment, plays a crucial role in effectively capturing genetic variations. In this work, we introduce two novel formulations within this framework: the Gap-sensitive Co-Linear Chaining (Gap-CLC) problem and the Co-Linear Chaining with Errors based on Edit Distance (Edit-CLC) problem, and we investigate their computational complexity. We show that solving the Gap-CLC problem in sub-quadratic time is highly unlikely unless the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis fails -- even when restricted to binary alphabets. Furthermore, we establish that the Edit-CLC problem is NP-hard in the presence of errors within the pan-genome graph. These findings emphasize that incorporating co-linear structures into sequence-to-graph alignment models fails to reduce computational complexity, highlighting that these models remain at least as computationally challenging to solve as those lacking such prior information.</description>

      <title>Online Locality Meets Distributed Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01903v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We connect three distinct lines of research that have recently explored extensions of the classical LOCAL model of distributed computing: A. distributed quantum computing and non-signaling distributions [e.g. STOC 2024], B. finitely-dependent processes [e.g. Forum Math. Pi 2016], and C. locality in online graph algorithms and dynamic graph algorithms [e.g. ICALP 2023].
  We prove new results on the capabilities and limitations of all of these models of computing, for locally checkable labeling problems (LCLs). We show that all these settings can be sandwiched between the classical LOCAL model and what we call the randomized online-LOCAL model. Our work implies limitations on the quantum advantage in the distributed setting, and we also exhibit a new barrier for proving tighter bounds. Our main technical results are these: 1. All LCL problems solvable with locality $O(\log^\star n)$ in the classical deterministic LOCAL model admit a finitely-dependent distribution with locality $O(1)$. This answers an open question by Holroyd [2024], and also presents a new barrier for proving bounds on distributed quantum advantage using causality-based arguments. 2. In rooted trees, if we can solve an LCL problem with locality $o(\log \log \log n)$ in the randomized online-LOCAL model (or any of the weaker models, such as quantum-LOCAL), we can solve it with locality $O(\log^\star n)$ in the classical deterministic LOCAL model. One of many implications is that in rooted trees, $O(\log^\star n)$ locality in quantum-LOCAL is not stronger than $O(\log^\star n)$ locality in classical LOCAL.</description>
