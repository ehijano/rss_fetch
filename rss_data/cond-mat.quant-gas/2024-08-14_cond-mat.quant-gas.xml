      <title>Vortices in the Many-Body Excited States of Interacting Bosons in Two Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum vortices play an important role in the physics of two-dimensional quantum many-body systems, though they usually are understood in the single-particle framework like the mean-field approach. Inspired by the study on the relations between solitons and yrast states, we investigate here the emergence of vortices from the eigenstates of a N -body Hamiltonian of interacting particles trapped in a disk. We analyse states that appear by consecutively measuring the positions of particles. These states have densities, phases, and energies closely resembling mean-field vortices. We discuss similarities, but also point out purely many-body features, such as vortex smearing due to the quantum fluctuation of their center. The ab initio analysis of the many-body system, and mean-field approaches are supported by the analysis within the Bogoliubov approach.</description>

      <title>Influence of disordered and anisotropic interactions on relaxation dynamics and propagation of correlations in tweezer arrays of Rydberg dipoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of irregular one- and two-dimensional arrays of Rydberg dipoles featuring spatially anisotropic interactions. Starting from a collectively polarized initial state, we map out the dynamical phase diagram and identify a crossover between regimes of regular and anomalously slow relaxation of the initial collective order, that strongly depends on both the degree of interaction disorder and anisotropy. In addition, we find the regime of slow relaxation is characterized by a sub-ballistic propagation of correlations that remained confined to short distances even at long times. To explain our findings we develop an analytic model based on decoupled clusters of interacting dipoles that goes beyond prior theoretical works and enables us to identify multiple relaxation timescales. Our findings can be relevant for a wide variety of quantum science platforms naturally featuring disordered dipolar interactions, including polar molecules, frozen Rydberg gases and NV centers.</description>

      <title>Slow approach to adiabaticity in many-body non-Hermitian systems: the Hatano-Nelson Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the near adiabatic dynamics in a non-Hermitian quantum many-body system by investigating a finite-time ramp of the imaginary vector potential in the interacting Hatano-Nelson model. The excess energy, the Loschmidt echo, and the density imbalance are analyzed using bosonization and exact diagonalization. The energy becomes complex valued, despite the instantaneous Hamiltonian having the same real spectrum throughout. The adiabatic limit is approached very slowly through damped oscillations. The decay scales with $\tau^{-1}$ with $\tau$ the ramp duration, while the oscillation period is $2L/v$ with $v$ the Fermi velocity and $L$ the system length. Yet, without the need for auxiliary controls, a shortcut to adiabaticity is found for ramp times commensurate with the period. Our work highlights the intricate interplay of adiabaticity and non-Hermitian many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Density-Dependent Gauge Field with Raman Lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of the gauge field is an everlasting topic in modern physics. Spin-orbit coupling is a powerful tool in ultracold atomic systems, resulting in an artificial gauge field that can be easily manipulated and observed in a tabletop environment. Combining optical lattices and atom-atom interaction, the artificial gauge field can be made density-dependent. In this work, we investigate a one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model with spin-orbit coupling, where a density-dependent gauge field emerges spontaneously in low-energy physics. First, we focus on the two-body quantum walk dynamics and give an interpretation of the phenomena with resonant tunneling. Then, we calculate the mean-field phase diagram using the two-site Gutzwiller ansatz. Two types of superfluid phase and a Mott insulator phase are found. Finally, we discuss the experimental realization protocol with Raman lattices.</description>

      <title>Ensemble inequivalence in long-range quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensemble inequivalence, i.e. the possibility of observing different thermodynamic properties depending on the statistical ensemble which describes the system, is one of the hallmarks of long-range physics, which has been demonstrated in numerous classical systems. Here, an example of ensemble inequivalence of a long-range quantum ferromagnet is presented. While the $T=0$ microcanonical quantum phase-diagram coincides with that of the canonical ensemble, the phase-diagrams of the two ensembles are different at finite temperature. This is in contrast with the common lore of statistical mechanics of systems with short-range interactions where thermodynamic properties are bound to coincide for macroscopic systems described by different ensembles. The consequences of these findings in the context of atomic, molecular and optical (AMO) setups are delineated.</description>

      <title>Localized dopant motion across the 2D Ising phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11608v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I investigate the motion of a single hole in 2D spin lattices with square and triangular geometries. While the spins have nearest neighbor Ising spin couplings $J$, the hole is allowed to move only in 1D along a single line in the 2D lattice with nearest neighbor hopping amplitude $t$. The non-equilibrium hole dynamics is initialized by suddenly removing a single spin from the thermal Ising spin lattice. I find that for any nonzero spin coupling and temperature, the hole is localized. This is an extension of the thermally induced localization phenomenon [Phys. Rev. Research 6, 023325 (2024)] to the case, where there is a phase transition to a long-range ordered ferromagnetic phase. The dynamics depends only on the ratio of the temperature to the spin coupling, $k_BT / |J|$, and on the ratio of the spin coupling to the hopping $J/t$. I characterize these dependencies in great detail. In particular, I find universal behavior at high temperatures, common features for the square and triangular lattices across the Curie temperatures for ferromagnetic interactions, and highly distinct behaviors for the two geometries in the presence of antiferromagnetic interactions due geometric frustration in the triangular lattice.</description>
