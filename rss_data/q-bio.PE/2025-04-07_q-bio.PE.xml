      <title>Spatially explicit population modeling with habitat preferential movement of Glis glis (Edible dormouse)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present a population dispersal model for Glis glis, a rodent species with a strong preference for forest habitats. The model addresses dispersal processes by incorporating the ecological traits, including habitat preferences of the species, potential growth rate, home range, and carrying capacity. In this model, the landscape is divided into spatial units based on the home range, and the probability of individuals moving from one spatial unit to another is calculated using habitat preference and population density. The movement probability between different spatial locations is determined by the product of two factors: the escape probability based on the relative ratio of population density to carrying capacity and the relative difference in habitat preferences. Both probabilities are calculated using logistic functions. The results indicate that the combination of habitat preference and local density dependence plays a role in shaping the dispersal patterns of G. glis. This highlights the importance of considering habitat preference and density-dependent effects concurrently when forecasting population dispersal under field conditions.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Modeling of Soil-Transmitted Helminth Infection: Human-Animal Dynamics with Environmental Reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections, one of the most prevalent neglected tropical diseases, pose a significant threat to public health in tropical and subtropical areas. These parasites infect humans and animals through direct contact with contaminated soil or accidental ingestion. This study examines the dynamics of STH transmission using a deterministic compartmental model and nonlinear ordinary differential equations. Our model incorporates the roles humans, animals, and the environment play as reservoirs for spreading STH. We derived the basic reproduction number and demonstrate that the disease-free and endemic equilibrium points are asymptotically stable under specific thresholds. We also performed a sensitivity analysis to determine how each parameter affects the model's output. The sensitivity analysis identifies key parameters influencing infection rates, such as ingestion rate, disease progression rate, and shedding rate, all of which increase infection. Conversely, higher clearance and recovery rates decrease infection. The study also highlights the potential for cross-species transmission of STH infections between humans and animals, underscoring the One Health concept, which acknowledges the interdependence of human, animal, and environmental health.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulation of atmospheric transport and dispersion of Phakopsora pachyrhizi urediniospores in South America using the state of Paran\'a-Brazil as a model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phakopsora pachyrhizi is a biotrophic fungus that requires living plant tissue to survive in the wild for extended periods. The fungus causes Asian rust and costs billions of US dollars every year for its control in South American soy production. Despite the regulatory measure that prohibits the cultivation of soybeans in some months of the year (soybean-free period) in Brazil, the presence of soybean production areas in neighboring countries, such as Paraguay and Bolivia, can help the survival of the pathogen between crop seasons. It is known that P. pachyrhizi urediniospores can be spread/transported thousands of kilometres by the wind. In this context, the objective of this work was to develop a mathematical model to simulate the atmospheric transport of P. pachyrhizi urediniospores from the west, Paraguay/Bolivia to Paran\'a Brazil, through storms coming from cold fronts. The transport of urediniospores was modeled by a diffusive-convective-reactive equation. Wind direction and the velocity of cold fronts that crossed Paran\'a state between October 2018 and February 2019 were used. For validation, real cases of rust occurrence in the Paran\'a state informed by the Anti-rust Consortium Portal in the season 2018/19 were used. The results confirm mathematically that urediniospores from infected areas located in a country on the west can be transported and deposited on the east, in the state of Paran\'a. The first case of soybean rust in Paran\'a state/Brazil was registered 10 days after the first cold front, suggesting that the transported and deposited urediniospores were still viable for host infection. This work reinforces the importance of the establishment of the soybean-free period in other soybean-producing countries. It will also provide a better understanding of the fungus dispersion system, potentially enabling the correct use of fungicides.</description>

      <title>Dimensionality reduction for k-means clustering of large-scale influenza mutation datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Viral mutations pose significant threats to public health by increasing infectivity, strengthening vaccine resistance, and altering disease severity. To track these evolving patterns, agencies like the CDC annually evaluate thousands of virus strains, underscoring the urgent need to understand viral mutagenesis and evolution in depth. In this study, we integrate genomic analysis, clustering, and three leading dimensionality reduction approaches, namely, principal component analysis (PCA), t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP)-to investigate the effects of COVID-19 on influenza virus propagation. By applying these methods to extensive pre- and post-pandemic influenza datasets, we reveal how selective pressures during the pandemic have influenced the diversity of influenza genetics. Our findings indicate that combining robust dimension reduction with clustering yields critical insights into the complex dynamics of viral mutation, informing both future research directions and strategies for public health intervention.</description>

      <title>Epicast 2.0: A large-scale, demographically detailed, agent-based model for simulating respiratory pathogen spread in the United States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent history of respiratory pathogen epidemics, including those caused by influenza and SARS-CoV-2, has highlighted the urgent need for advanced modeling approaches that can accurately capture heterogeneous disease dynamics and outcomes at the national scale, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of resource allocation and decision-making. In this paper, we describe Epicast 2.0, an agent-based model that utilizes a highly detailed, synthetic population and high-performance computing techniques to simulate respiratory pathogen transmission across the entire United States. This model replicates the contact patterns of over 320 million agents as they engage in daily activities at school, work, and within their communities. Epicast 2.0 supports vaccination and an array of non-pharmaceutical interventions that can be promoted or relaxed via highly granular, user specified policies. We illustrate the model's capabilities using a wide range of outbreak scenarios, highlighting the model's varied dynamics as well as its extensive support for policy exploration. This model provides a robust platform for conducting what if scenario analysis and providing insights into potential strategies for mitigating the impacts of infectious diseases.</description>

      <title>The Vaccination Game on Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vaccinations are an important tool in the prevention of disease. Vaccinations are generally voluntary for each member of a population and vaccination decisions are influenced by individual risk perceptions and contact structures within populations. In this study, we model vaccination uptake as an evolutionary game where individuals weigh perceived morbidity risks from both vaccination and infection. We incorporate epidemiological dynamics using an SIR model structured on networks, allowing us to determine the evolutionarily stable vaccination level for any given network topology. Our analysis shows that vaccination coverage varies across networks depending on their structure and the relative cost of vaccination (the ratio of vaccine morbidity risk to infection morbidity risk). As this cost increases, vaccination uptake decreases universally, leading to a dominant non-vaccinator strategy when the cost is high. We find that networks with low to moderate degree variability have a relatively low evolutionarily stable vaccination level when this cost is low, as in such populations lower vaccination levels are necessary to achieve equivalent levels of disease prevalence to more heterogeneous networks with high degree variability, which thus show higher vaccination levels at lower relative costs. However, for heterogeneous networks, vaccination levels decline faster as costs rise, eventually falling below the level for the more homogeneous networks. Our findings align with previous studies on vaccination thresholds in structured populations and highlight how network heterogeneity influences vaccination dynamics.</description>

      <title>On discretely structured growth models and their moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The logistic equation is ubiquitous in applied mathematics as a minimal model of saturating growth. Here, we examine a broad generalisation of the logistic growth model to discretely structured populations, motivated by examples that range from the ageing of individuals in a species to immune cell exhaustion by cancerous tissue. Through exploration of a range of concrete examples and a general analysis of polynomial kinetics, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the dependence of the kinetics on structure to result in closed, low-dimensional moment equations that are exact. Further, we showcase how coarse-grained moment information can be used to elucidate the details of structured dynamics, with immediate potential for model selection and hypothesis testing. This paper belongs to the special collection: Problems, Progress and Perspectives in Mathematical and Computational Biology.</description>

      <title>Estimating excess mortality during the Covid-19 pandemic in Aotearoa New Zealand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background. The excess mortality rate in Aotearoa New Zealand during the Covid-19 pandemic is frequently estimated to be among the lowest in the world. However, to facilitate international comparisons, many of the methods that have been used to estimate excess mortality do not use age-stratified data on deaths and population size, which may compromise their accuracy.
  Methods. We used a quasi-Poisson regression model for monthly all-cause deaths among New Zealand residents, controlling for age, sex and seasonality. We fitted the model to deaths data for 2014-19. We estimated monthly excess mortality for 2020-23 as the difference between actual deaths and projected deaths according to the model. We conducted sensitivity analysis on the length of the pre-pandemic period used to fit the model. We benchmarked our results against a simple linear regression on the standardised annual mortality rate.
  Results. We estimated cumulative excess mortality in New Zealand in 2020-23 was 1040 (95% confidence interval [-1134, 2927]), equivalent to 0.7% [-0.8%, 2.0%] of expected mortality. Excess mortality was negative in 2020-21. The magnitude, timing and age-distribution of the positive excess mortality in 2022-23 were closely matched with confirmed Covid-19 deaths.
  Conclusions. Negative excess mortality in 2020-21 reflects very low levels of Covid-19 and major reductions in seasonal respiratory diseases during this period. In 2022-23, Covid-19 deaths were the main contributor to excess mortality and there was little or no net non-Covid-19 excess. Overall, New Zealand experienced one of the lowest rates of pandemic excess mortality in the world.</description>
