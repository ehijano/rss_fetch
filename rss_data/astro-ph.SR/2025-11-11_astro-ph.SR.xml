      <title>Non-linear simulations of the onset and non-linear dynamics of inertial waves in solar and stellar interiors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inertial modes have been recently detected in the Sun via helioseismology, yet their origin, evolution, and role in the dynamics of the solar plasma and magnetic field remain poorly understood. In this study, we employ global numerical simulations to investigate the excitation mechanisms and dynamical consequences of inertial modes in the Sun and stellar interiors. We validate first our numerical setup by analyzing the evolution of sectoral and tesseral perturbations imposed on a rigidly rotating sphere. The results confirm that a perturbation of a given mode can excite neighboring modes with both smaller and larger wavenumbers along the dispersion relation of Rossby waves. Subsequently, we use a physically motivated forcing to impose differential rotation with varying shear amplitudes, and examine the spontaneous onset and nonlinear evolution of inertial modes. The simulations reveal that the growth of velocity perturbations is primarily driven by baroclinic instability. It gives rise to high-latitude inertial modes in the form of retrograde polar vortices whose properties depend on the imposed shear. Equatorial Rossby modes are also excited, albeit with lower intensity than their high-latitude counterpart. Perturbations with arbitrary azimuthal wavenumbers lead to the excitation of Rossby modes for all available wave numbers, sustained by both direct and inverse energy cascades. In simulations with stronger shear, the high latitude modes produce Reynolds stresses able to modify the imposed differential rotation and accelerate the rotation of the poles.</description>

      <title>The Triple System V1371 Tau: An Eclipsing Binary with an Outer Be Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although triple systems are common, their orbital dynamics and stellar evolution remain poorly understood. We investigated the V1371 Tau system using TESS photometry, multi-epoch spectroscopy, and recent interferometric data, confirming it as a rare triple system consisting of an eclipsing binary orbited by a classical Be star, with a spectral classification of (B1V + B0V) + B0Ve. The eclipsing binary exhibits an orbital period of approximately 34 days, and the Be star orbits the inner pair on a timescale of a few years. Weak H$\alpha$ emission lines suggest the presence of a Keplerian disk with variability on a timescale of months around the Be star, and a nearly constant V/R ratio with no detectable asymmetry variations. Besides the eclipses, frequencies at 0.24 and 0.26 c/d dominate the photometric variability. Higher-frequency signals are present which appear associated with non-radial pulsation. The eclipsing pair ($i \approx 90^\circ$) shows projected rotational velocities of 160 and 200 km s$^{-1}$. The Be star's measured $v \sin i \approx 250$ km s$^{-1}$ implies a critical rotation fraction between 0.44 and 0.76 for plausible inclinations, significantly faster than the eclipsing components. The shallower eclipses in the KELT data compared to TESS suggest a variation in orbital inclination, possibly induced by Kozai-Lidov cycles from the outer Be star. The evolution analysis suggests that all components are massive main-sequence stars, with the secondary star in the eclipsing binary being overluminous. This study emphasizes the complexity of triple systems with Be stars and provides a basis for future research on their formation, evolution, and dynamics.</description>

      <title>Asteroseismology and Buoyancy Glitch Inversion with Fourier Spectra of Gravity Mode Period Spacings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the small, quasi-periodic modulations seen in the gravity-mode period spacings of pulsating stars. These ``wiggles'' are produced by buoyancy glitches -- sharp features in the buoyancy frequency ($N$) caused by composition transitions and the convective--radiative interface.
  Our method takes the Fourier transform of the period-spacing series, $FT(\Delta P_k)$ as a function of radial order $k$. We show that $FT(\Delta P_k)$ traces the radial derivative of the normalized glitch profile $\delta N/N$ with respect to the normalized buoyancy radius; peaks in $FT(\Delta P_k)$ therefore pinpoint jump/drop locations in $N$ and measure their sharpness. We also note that the Fourier transform of relative period perturbations (deviations from asymptotic values), $FT(\delta P/P)$, directly recovers the absolute value of the glitch profile $|\delta N/N|$, enabling a straightforward inversion for the internal structure.
  The dominant $FT(\Delta P_k)$ frequency correlates tightly with central hydrogen abundance ($X_c$) and thus with stellar age for slowly pulsating B-stars, with only weak mass dependence. Applying the technique to MESA stellar models and to observed slowly pulsating B-stars and $\gamma$ Dor pulsators, we find typical glitch amplitudes $\delta N/N \lesssim 0.01$ and derivative magnitudes $\lesssim 0.1$, concentrated at chemical gradients and the convective boundary. This approach enables fast, ensemble asteroseismology of g-mode pulsators, constrains internal mixing and ages, and can be extended to other classes of pulsators, with potential links to tidal interactions in binaries.</description>

      <title>Absolute Parameters of the Southern Detached Eclipsing Binary DG Mic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As part of an ongoing programme of observing detached eclipsing binary stars in the southern sky, we present the first analysis of spectroscopic observations of the Algol-type binary system DG Mic. A spectroscopic analysis of mid-resolution spectra allowed us to constrain the effective temperature of the primary component and to test the consistency of the system parameters with its spectral energy distribution (SED). Combined solutions of mid-resolution spectra and TESS, ASAS and WASP light curves imply a system of two almost identical components ($q$ = 0.99) in circular orbits. Our final model shows that the system is a detached binary star. The masses and radii of the primary and secondary components of DG Mic were derived to be 1.65($\pm$0.12) M$_\odot$, 1.64($\pm$0.18) M$_\odot$ and 1.63($\pm$0.10) R$_\odot$, 1.91($\pm$0.13) R$_\odot$, respectively. According to Geneva evolution models, both components of the system are main-sequence stars and their age is approximately 713 Myr.</description>

      <title>Cepheid Metallicity in the Leavitt Law (C--MetaLL) survey: VIII. High-Resolution IGRINS Spectroscopy of 23 Classical Cepheids: Validating NIR Abundances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. While most chemical abundance studies of Cepheids rely on optical spectroscopy, near-infrared (NIR) observations offer advantages in terms of reduced extinction and access to new elemental tracers. Aims. We aim to validate NIR-based abundance determinations against optical results and to explore the diagnostic power of spectral lines inaccessible in the optical domain. The H and K bands allow us to trace elements such as P, K, and Yb, while also probing obscured Galactic regions and more distant Cepheids. Methods. We obtained high-resolution (R=45000) H- and K-band spectra for 21 Galactic and 2 LMC Classical Cepheids using IGRINS. Atmospheric parameters were derived from photometry and line-depth ratios (Teff), empirical calibrations (log g), and spectral fitting. Abundances of 16 elements were determined via LTE full spectral synthesis and compared with optical literature values. Results. We find excellent agreement between NIR and optical abundances, confirming the reliability of IGRINS-based measurements. The Fe, Mg, and Si gradients match previous optical determinations. We provide the first homogeneous NIR-based measurements of P, K, and Yb in Cepheids, consistent with chemical evolution models. The two LMC Cepheids in our sample, also studied optically, serve as extragalactic benchmarks for validating NIR abundances in low-metallicity regimes. Conclusions. High-resolution NIR spectroscopy yields accurate chemical abundances in Cepheids, consistent with optical results, and grants access to additional nucleosynthetic tracers. These results support future large NIR spectroscopic surveys with instruments such as MOONS, ELT, and JWST for Galactic and extragalactic archaeology.</description>

      <title>A TESS View of Post-Eruption Variability in the Novae V1405 Cas,V1716 Sco, and V1674 Her</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyzed TESS archival data of three novae after recent outbursts, searching the orbital and white dwarf (WD) rotation period and possible variations of these periods. In V1405 Cas, we detected a period of $\sim$116.88 seconds, which we identified as due to the WD spin, and measured a rate of increase of 0.001542$\pm0.000009\, {\rm s\, d}^{-1}$, one the fastest spin-down rates ever recorded. The rapid spin-down coupled with an X-ray luminosity several orders of magnitude lower than the available spin-down power, strongly indicates that the system is in a magnetic ``propeller'' state, namely the rotational energy powers the system's X-ray luminosity. We measured a previously unknown orbital period of 1.36 days for V1716 Sco. If the X-ray flux modulation with a period of 77.9 s detected in outburst for this nova is due to the rotation of an strongly magnetized white dwarf as in other novae with similar modulations of the supersoft X-ray source in outburst, the system is in a parameter space that challenges standard models of cataclysmic variable evolution. For V1674 Her, which has already been classified as an intermediate polar (IP), we confirm the known spin period of 501.33$\pm$0.01 s and the orbital period of 0.1529$\pm$0.0001 days, suggesting that the spin modulation was also the root cause of the periodicity in X-rays in outburst, and that the WD atmosphere in the supersoft X-ray phase was not thermally homogeneous. Our results highlight the power of high-cadence, continuous observations in revealing extreme and unexpected characteristics of accreting white dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Multiperiodic pulsations of the unique DAQ white dwarf J0551+4135: insights into a merger remnant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 2MASS J05513444+4135297 (herafter J0551+4135) is the only pulsating DAQ white dwarf known with a carbon and hydrogen atmosphere. Its unusual atmospheric composition and kinematics indicate a white dwarf merger origin. We present time-series photometry of J0551+4135 obtained using the Apache Point Observatory 3.5m, Gemini North 8m, and Gran Telescopio Canarias 10m telescopes. J0551+4135 exhibits variations in pulsation amplitude and frequency over time. We detect ten significant recurring peaks across different subsets of observations, with frequencies ranging from 987 to 1180~$\mu$Hz, consistent with non-radial gravity ($g$)-mode oscillations. We present new evolutionary models suitable for spectroscopic characterization of DAQ white dwarfs, and derive a mass of $1.13 \pm 0.01\,M_\odot$ and a cooling age of $1.7 \pm 0.1$ Gyr for a CO core, and $1.12 \pm 0.01\,M_\odot$ and $1.6 \pm 0.1$\,Gyr for an ONe-core white dwarf, respectively. However, detailed asteroseismology of this unique pulsator has to wait until fully-consistent DAQ evolutionary models are available. Further observations, including multi-site campaigns to reduce daily aliasing and to improve the signal-to-noise ratio would be helpful for identification of additional modes and constraining the internal structure of this unique pulsator.</description>

      <title>Investigating the impact of the dynamic solar wind on the propagation of a coronal mass ejection with two models and multi-spacecraft measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are the main drivers of disturbances in the solar heliosphere because they propagate and interact with the magnetic field of the solar wind. It is crucial to investigate the evolution of CMEs and their deformation for understanding the interaction between the solar wind and CMEs. We quantify the effect of the dynamic solar wind on the propagation of a CME in the heliosphere with a hydrodynamic plasma cloud-cone model and a linear force-free spheromak model at various locations in the heliosphere. We chose a CME event that launched on SOL2021-09-23T04:39:45 and was observed by multiple spacecraft, namely BepiColombo, Parker Solar Probe, Solar Orbiter, Stereo A and ACE. The solar wind was modelled in the steady and dynamic regimes in the Icarus model. The CME parameters were approximated for the selected event, and two CME models (spheromak and cone) were launched from the inner heliosphere boundary. The obtained synthetic in situ measurements were compared to the observed in situ measurements at all spacecraft. The internal magnetic field of the flux rope was better reconstructed by the spheromak model than by the cone CME model. The cone CME model maintained a nearly constant longitudinal angular extension while somewhat contracting in the radial direction. In contrast, the spheromak model contracted in the longitudinal direction while expanding in the radial direction. The CME sheath and magnetic cloud signatures were better reproduced at the four spacecraft clustered around the CME nose by the spheromak CME model. The dynamic solar wind caused a greater deceleration of the modelled CME than the steady-state solar wind solution. Because the background was homogeneous, the modelled CME properties were only mildly affected by the solar wind regime, however.</description>

      <title>Total solar eclipse 2024 modelling with COCONUT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronal modelling is crucial for a better understanding of solar and helio-physics. Due to the strong brightness of the Sun and the lack of white light observations of the solar atmosphere and low corona (1-1.5R$_\odot$), total solar eclipses have become a standard approach for validating the coronal models. In this study, we validate the COCONUT coronal model by predicting the coronal configuration during the total solar eclipse on April 8, 2024. We aim to predict the accurate configuration of the solar corona during the total solar eclipse on April 8, 2024. We utilise the full 3D MHD model to reconstruct the solar corona from the solar surface to $30\;R_\odot$. The upcoming total solar eclipse predictions were conducted in three different regimes: quasi-steady driving of the inner boundary conditions (BCs) with a daily cadence and dynamic driving of the inner BCs with both daily and hourly cadences. The results from all the simulations are compared to the total solar eclipse images. Additionally, the synthetic white-light (WL) images are generated from the STEREO-A field of view and compared to COR2 observed images. Normalised polarised brightness is compared in the COR2 and synthetic WL images. The predicted solar corona does not vary significantly in the first half of the prediction window. The dynamic simulations yielded better results than the quasi-steady predictions. The west limb was reconstructed better in the simulations than the east limb. We have predicted the total solar eclipse coronal configuration 18 days before the total solar eclipse. We can conclude that the dynamic simulations produced more accurate predictions. The availability of comprehensive observations is crucial, as the emergence of the active region on the east limb made it difficult to accurately predict the east limb coronal configuration due to incorrect input of magnetic field data.</description>

      <title>LRPayne: Stellar parameters and abundances from low-resolution spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. This paper introduces LRPayne, a novel algorithm designed for the efficient determination of stellar parameters and chemical abundances from low-resolution optical spectra, with a primary focus on data from large-scale galactic surveys such as WEAVE. Methods. LRPayne employs a model-driven approach, utilising a fully connected artificial neural network (ANN), trained on a library of 70,000 synthetic stellar spectra generated using iSpec with 1D MARCS model atmospheres and the Turbospectrum synthesis code. The network is trained to predict normalized flux given stellar labels (Teff, log(g), [Fe/H], vmic, vmax and v sin i, and 24 individual elemental abundances). Stellar parameters are subsequently derived from observed spectra by finding the best-fit synthetic spectrum from the ANN using a chi-squared minimisation technique. The method operates on spectra degraded to a resolution of R=5000 covering the wavelength range 4200-6900 {\AA}. Results. Internal accuracy tests on synthetic spectra show a median interpolation error of less than 0.13 % for 90 % of the validation sample. The method accurately recovers most input labels from synthetic spectra, even at a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 20, with some expected challenges for elements like Li, K, and N. Validation on observed spectra of 25 Gaia FGK benchmark stars and 42 metal-poor stars reveals good agreement with literature values. For stellar parameters, mean differences are 22+-87 K for Teff , 0.19+-0.23 dex for log(g), and 0.01+-0.17 dex for [Fe/H]. Abundances for elements like Na, Mg, Si, and most Fe-peak elements (Cr, Ni, V, Sc) are well-recovered. Challenges are noted for oxygen, manganese in metal-rich giants, aluminium in metal-poor stars and dwarfs, and for deriving log g in hot metal-poor dwarfs, partly due to non-local thermodynamic equilibrium effects and line characteristics.</description>

      <title>Relevance of Murchison Widefield Array Interplanetary Scintillation Observations to Heliospheric Transient Catalogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have conducted a comprehensive comparison of interplanetary scintillation (IPS) observations taken by the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) with several heliospheric transient event catalogues, over a time period of 7 months during solar minimum. From this analysis we have found that of the 84% of catalogued events that have MWA IPS data available, 68% of them appear in MWA observations. Of the enhancements first identified in IPS observations, only 58% have a potential match with a catalogued event. The majority of enhancements that were identified in the IPS observations were situated greater than 10$^\circ$ from the ecliptic plane. Two such features were selected for detailed analysis, connecting their solar origins to their propagation through the heliosphere. The first of these features was created by a coronal mass ejection (CME), captured over two successive MWA observations and recorded in several catalogues. The second feature has the potential of being a stream interaction region (SIR) travelling out of the ecliptic plane. This particular SIR was not recorded in any catalogue. Thus the MWA shows promise in detecting heliospheric transients that other commonly-used techniques may overlook. These results show the strength of the MWA in having unbridled access to the heliosphere, able to make remote observations of events far out of the ecliptic as it is not restrained to the orbits of spacecraft. We demonstrate how the inclusion of MWA IPS data can potentially boost the number of CME and SIR events that are characterised.</description>

Abstract: We present 17 cataclysmic variables (CVs) obtained from the crossmatch between the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and eROSITA Final Equatorial Depth Survey (eFEDS), including 8 known CVs before eFEDS and 9 identified from eFEDS. The photometric periods of four CVs are derived from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey (CRTS). We focus on two CVs, SDSS J084309.3$-$014858 and SDSS J093555.0+042916, and confirm that their photometric periods correspond to the orbital periods by fitting the radial velocity curves. Furthermore, by the combination of the Gaia distance, the spectral energy distribution, and the variations of $\mathrm{H}\mathrm{\alpha}$ emission lines, the masses of the white dwarf and the visible star can be well constrained.</description>

      <title>Probing spectral line asymmetries due to the propagating transverse waves in the solar corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decades-long studies of asymmetric spectral lines in the solar corona suggest mass and energy transport from lower atmospheric layers to the corona. While slow magnetoacoustic waves and plasma flows are recognized as drivers of these spectral line asymmetries, the role of transverse MHD waves remains largely unexplored. Previous simulations have shown that unidirectionally propagating kink waves, in the presence of perpendicular density inhomogeneities, can produce a turbulence-like phenomenon called ``uniturbulence''. However, the spectroscopic signatures of this effect have not been investigated until now. Due to varying Doppler shifts from the plasma elements with different emissions, we expect to observe signatures of both blueward and redward asymmetries. Past instruments like EIS may have missed these signatures due to resolution limitations, but current instruments like DKIST offer a better opportunity for detection. We conducted 3D MHD simulations of transverse waves in a polar plume with density inhomogeneities and performed forward modeling for the Fe XIII emission line at 10749 \AA. Our findings show that transverse waves and uniturbulence induce alternating red and blueward asymmetries, with magnitudes reaching up to 20\% of peak intensity and secondary peak velocities between 30 and 40 km s$^{-1}$, remaining under 100 km s$^{-1}$. These asymmetries propagate with the transverse waves, and even at DKIST resolution, similar signatures can be detected. Our study suggests that spectral line asymmetries can serve as a diagnostic tool for detecting transverse wave-induced uniturbulence.</description>

Abstract: Neutron captures produce the vast majority of abundances of elements heavier than iron in the Universe. Beyond the classical slow (s) and rapid (r) processes, there is observational evidence for neutron-capture processes that operate at neutron densities in between, at different distances from the valley of $\beta$ stability. Here, we review the main properties of the s process within the general context of neutron-capture processes and the nuclear physics input required to investigate it. We describe massive stars and asymptotic giant branch stars as the s-process astrophysical sites and discuss the related physical uncertainties. We also present current observational evidence for the s process and beyond, which ranges from stellar spectroscopic observations to laboratory analysis of meteorites.</description>

      <title>Flares and superflares on the southern active binary CC Eri</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flares and CMEs are known to be the dominating high-energy phenomena on cool stars. Superflares were thoroughly investigated using broadband photometry predominantly from Kepler, K2, and TESS. Here we present a spectroscopic investigation of superflares on the very active spectroscopic binary CC~Eri. We focus on spectroscopic signatures of (super)-flares and line asymmetries with the goal to characterize superflares spectroscopically. In 70 nights of spectroscopic observations obtained at the ESO~1.52m telescope with the Echelle spectrograph PUCHEROS+ hosted by the PLATOSpec consortium we identified 31 flares from which two are superflares already from the deduced g'-band energies. We also find a broad blue-wing asymmetry occurring in the impulsive phase of another superflare which shows great potential to be a prominence eruption. For the second most luminous flare we find the largest number of excess emissions during the impulsive and gradual flare. We identify the flare to be occurring close to the stellar limb which indicates that the flare was even more energetic than derived from its g'-band and spectral line energies. We identify more than sixty spectral lines in the spectral range of 4100 and 7200\AA{} showing excess emission during this flare. We detect continuum enhancements as well as photospheric line fillings during the flare. Generally we find that depending on the flare energy the number of spectral lines revealing excess emission increases, especially for the more energetic superflares. We therefore conclude that superflares are likely scaled-up versions of less energetic normal flares.</description>

      <title>A catalog of new blue stragglers in open clusters with Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high-precision {\it Gaia} data release 3 (DR3) enables the discovery of numerous open clusters in the Milky Way, providing an excellent opportunity to search for blue straggler stars in open clusters and investigate their formation and evolution in these environments. Using the member stars from literature open cluster catalogs, we visually inspected the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) of each cluster and selected cluster candidates that potentially host blue stragglers. We then reassessed cluster memberships using the {\tt pyUPMASK} algorithm with {\it Gaia} DR3 and performed isochrone fitting to derive physical parameters for each cluster, including age, distance modulus, mean reddening, and metallicity. Finally, we empirically identified straggler stars based on their positions relative to the best-fitting isochrone, zero-age main sequence (ZAMS), and equal-mass binary sequence on the CMD. In total, we identified 272 new straggler stars in 99 open clusters, comprising 153 blue stragglers, 98 probable blue stragglers, and 21 yellow stragglers. Compared to the reported blue straggler catalogs based on earlier {\it Gaia} data, our results increase the number of open clusters with stragglers in the Milky Way by 22.2\%, and the total number of blue stragglers by 11.2\%.</description>

      <title>Rethinking mass transfer: a unified semi-analytical framework for circular and eccentric binaries.II. Orbital evolution due to non-conservative mass transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although mass transfer (MT) has been studied primarily in circular binaries, observations show that it also occurs in eccentric systems. We investigate orbital evolution during non-conservative MT in eccentric orbits, a process especially relevant for binaries containing compact objects (COs). We examine four angular momentum loss (AML) modes; Jeans, isotropic re-emission, orbital-AML and $L_2$ mass loss -- the latter is the most efficient AML mode. For fixed AML mode and accretion efficiency, orbital evolution is correlated: orbits either widen while becoming more eccentric, or shrink while circularizing. Jeans mode generally yields orbital widening and eccentricity pumping, whereas $L_2$ mass loss typically leads to orbital shrinkage and eccentricity damping. Isotropic re-emission and orbital-AML show intermediate behavior. Adopting isotropic re-emission, we demonstrate that eccentric MT produces compact binaries that merge via gravitational waves (GW) within a Hubble time, whereas the same systems would instead merge during MT under traditional modeling. We further show that, in eccentric orbits, the gravitational potential at $L_2$ becomes lower than at $L_1$ across large range of mass ratios and eccentricities, naturally linking eccentricity to $L_2$ mass loss. Since interacting binaries containing COs are frequently eccentric, $L_2$ mass loss offers a new robust pathway to orbital tightening during eccentric MT, contributing to the formation rate of GW sources. This model can treat orbital evolution due to conservative and non-conservative MT in arbitrary eccentricities with applications ranging from MT on the main sequence to GW progenitors.</description>

      <title>Surprisingly Similar: The Mass Function of Gaia Neutron Stars and First-Born Double Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mass distribution of neutron stars encodes information about their formation and binary evolution. We compare the masses of two distinct populations: I) the recently identified Gaia neutron stars in wide orbits with solar-like companions and, II) the assumed first-born recycled pulsar in Galactic double neutron star systems. Naively, one would expect their masses to differ due to both the presumed differences in their evolutionary histories, as well as astrophysical selection effects that can filter out configurations that would merge or be disrupted. Yet, we find that their mass distributions are strikingly similar. Using a two-component Gaussian model, we find that both populations exhibit a narrow component centred near $1.3 \text{ M}_\odot$, accompanied by a broader, higher-mass component that extends the distribution toward larger masses. The highest density regions of their fitted parameter posteriors coincide by over 91.6%. Statistical tests further confirm the agreement between these distributions with a Jensen-Shannon divergence $JS &lt; 0.08$ and an earth mover's distance of $W &lt;0.063 \text{ M}_\odot$ at 90% credibility. This finding seems to imply that both mass functions reflect the natal mass distribution of first-born neutron stars in binary systems, supporting the hypothesis that neutron stars can be born with high masses. Consequently and perhaps surprisingly, binary evolutionary processes need not impart features on the NS mass distribution.</description>

Abstract: Searching for life elsewhere in the universe is one of the most highly prioritized pursuits in astronomy today. However, the ability to observe evidence of Earth-like life through biosignatures is limited by the number of planets in the solar neighborhood with conditions similar to Earth. The occurrence rate of Earth-like planets in the habitable zones of Sun-like stars, $\eta_{\oplus}$, is therefore crucial for addressing the apparent lack of consensus on its value in the literature. Here we present a review of the current understanding of $\eta_{\oplus}$. We first provide definitions for parameters that contribute to $\eta_{\oplus}$. Then, we discuss the previous and current estimated parameter values and the context of the limitations on the analyses that produced these estimates. We compile an extensive list of the factors that go into any calculation of $\eta_{\oplus}$, and how detection techniques and surveys differ in their sensitivity and ability to accurately constrain $\eta_{\oplus}$. Understanding and refining the value of $\eta_{\oplus}$ is crucial for upcoming missions and telescopes, such as the planned Habitable Worlds Observatory and the Large Interferometer for Exoplanets, which aim to search for biosignatures on exoplanets in the solar neighborhood.</description>

      <title>Formation of Binary Millisecond Pulsars with Helium White Dwarfs in a New Magnetic Braking Prescription</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic braking (MB) mechanism plays a vital role throughout the evolution of low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). Considering the standard MB prescription, the initial orbital periods of LMXBs that can evolve into binary millisecond pulsar (MSP) with He white dwarfs (WDs) and short orbital periods ($2-9~\rm hours$) are within an extremely narrow interval, which was named the fine-tuning problem. Employing the detailed binary evolution model, we investigate the evolution of LMXBs in both the standard and convection and rotation boosted (CARB) MB laws. In the standard MB case, it is difficult for donor stars to form a He core and exhaust H envelope through mass transfer at short orbital periods, making them semidetached systems. The CARB MB mechanism can drive LMXBs evolve toward compact detached MSP-WD systems in wide initial orbital periods, over which binary MSPs with long orbital periods will be produced. We obtain the initial parameter space of binary MSPs with He WDs in the initial orbital period and donor-star mass plane, which can be applied to future statistics study by population synthesis simulations. We also discuss a new relation between orbital period and WD mass, formation of persistent ultra-compact X-ray binaries with relatively long orbital periods, and detectability of compact MSP-WD systems as low-frequency gravitational wave sources.</description>

      <title>On the numerical convergence of MRI simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnetorotational instability (MRI) plays a crucial role in the evolution of many types of accretion disks. It is often studied using ideal-MHD numerical simulations. In principle, such simulations should be numerically converged, i.e. their properties should not change with resolution. Convergence is often assessed via the MRI quality factor, $Q$, the ratio of the Alfv\'en length to the grid-cell size. If it is above a certain threshold, the simulation is deemed numerically converged. In this paper we argue that the quality factor is not a good indicator of numerical convergence. First, we test the performance of the quality factor on simulations known to be unconverged, i.e. local ideal-MHD simulations with zero net-flux, and show that their $Q$s are well over the typical convergence threshold. The quality-factor test thus fails in these cases. Second, we take issue with the linear theory underpinning the use of $Q$, which posits a constant vertical field. This is a poor approximation in real nonlinear simulations, where the vertical field can vary rapidly in space and generically exhibits zeros. We calculate the linear MRI modes in such cases and show that the MRI can reach near-maximal growth rates at arbitrarily small scales. Yet, the quality factor assumes a single and well-defined scale, near the Alfv\'en length, below which the MRI cannot grow. We discuss other criticisms and suggest a modified quality factor that addresses some, though not all, of these issues.</description>

      <title>Formation Channels of Magnetars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation channels of magnetars remain an open question. Although core collapse supernovae of isolated massive stars are important, binary interactions -- such as tidal interaction, common envelope evolution, and stellar mergers -- may also play a significant role in making magnetars. Understanding the relative contributions of these channels is crucial for linking magnetars to their observed properties and host environments. In this paper, we investigate potential magnetar formation channels using population synthesis simulations, considering both single-star and isolated binary system evolution. By conducting simulations with different parameters, we compare the effects of various evolution processes on magnetar formation. Additionally, we study the delay times and kick velocities across all formation channels, analyze the orbital properties and companion types of surviving magnetar binaries. We find that the majority of magnetars are observed as single objects ($\geq 90\%$), although a large fraction of them were originally in binary systems and experienced either kick disruption or merger. Surviving binaries are most likely to host main-sequence companions and exhibit different distributions of eccentricities due to different supernova mechanisms. These findings show the critical role of binary evolution in magnetar formation and provide predictions for the properties of magnetar populations that can be tested with future observations.</description>

      <title>APOGEE Chemical Abundances of Stars in the MW Satellites Fornax, Sextans, Draco and Carina</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During its evolution, the Milky Way (MW) incorporated numerous dwarf galaxies, particularly low-mass systems. The surviving dwarf galaxies orbiting the MW serve as exceptional laboratories for studying the unique properties of these systems. Their metal-poor environments and shallow gravitational potentials likely drive significant differences in star formation and star cluster properties compared to those in the MW. Using high-quality near-infrared spectra from the APOGEE survey, we determined abundances of Fe, C, N, O, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Ni, and Ce for 74 stars in four MW satellite dwarf galaxies: Fornax, Sextans, Draco, and Carina. Our analysis reveals that the distribution of $\alpha$ elements (e.g., [Si/Fe]) strongly correlates with galaxy luminosity (and hence mass), underscoring the critical role of galaxy mass in shaping chemical evolution. These dwarf galaxies exhibit [Al/Fe$]\sim -0.5$, which is comparable to those of the metal-poor stars in the MW. Additionally, we identified nitrogen-rich field stars in the Fornax dwarf galaxy, which display distinct metallicities compared to its known globular clusters (GCs). If these stars originated in GCs and subsequently escaped, their presence suggests we are observing relics of destroyed GCs, offering possible evidence of cluster disruption.</description>

      <title>Mock Observations for the CSST Mission: Main Surveys--An Overview of Framework and Simulation Suite</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) is a flagship space-based observatory. Its main survey camera is designed to conduct high spatial resolution near-ultraviolet to near-infrared imaging and low-resolution spectroscopic surveys. To maximize the scientific output of CSST, we have developed a comprehensive, high-fidelity simulation pipeline for reproducing both imaging and spectroscopic observations. This paper presents an overview of the simulation framework, detailing its implementation and components. Built upon the GalSim package and incorporating the latest CSST instrumental specifications, our pipeline generates pixel-level mock observations that closely replicate the expected instrumental and observational conditions. The simulation suite integrates realistic astrophysical object catalogs, instrumental effects, point spread function (PSF) modeling, and observational noises to produce accurate synthetic data. We describe the key processing stages of the simulation, from constructing the input object catalogs to modeling the telescope optics and detector responses. Furthermore, we introduce the most recent release of simulated datasets, which provide a crucial testbed for data processing pipeline developments, calibration strategies, and scientific analyses, ensuring that CSST will meet its stringent requirements. Our pipeline serves as a vital tool for optimizing CSST main survey strategies and ensuring robust cosmological measurements.</description>

      <title>The evolution of accretor stars in binary systems due to accretion of increasingly helium-rich material</title>

Abstract: The recent discovery of examples of intermediate-mass helium stars have offered new insights into interacting binaries. These observations will allow significant improvements in our understanding of helium stars. However, in the creation of these stars their companions may accrete a significant amount of helium-rich stellar material. These creates stars with unusual composition profiles -- stars with helium-rich cores, hydrogen-rich lower envelopes and a helium-rich outer envelope. Thus the mean molecular weight reaches a minimum in the the middle of the star rather than continuously decreasing outwards in mass. To demonstrate this structure we present Cambridge STARS model calculations of an example interacting binary systems where the helium-rich material is transferred, and compare it to one where the composition of the accreted mass is fixed to the companion's surface composition. We show that the helium-rich material leads to the accretor being 0.2 dex hotter and 0.15 dex more luminous than models where the composition is not helium rich. We use a simple BPASS v2.2 population model to estimate that helium-rich mass transfer occurs in 23 per cent of massive binaries that undergo mass transfer. This suggests this is a common process. This binary process has implications for the discrepancy between spectroscopic and gravitational masses of stars, the production of ionizing photons and possibly the modelling of high redshift galaxies.</description>

      <title>Infrared diagnostics of late-time core-collapse supernova spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium radiative transfer calculations of red supergiant and He-star explosions, extending previous work to focus on the infrared emission from atoms and ions in the ejecta during the nebular-phase (i.e., ~200 to ~500d) -- molecules and dust are ignored. We cover non-rotating solar-metallicity progenitors spanning an initial mass between 10 and about 40Msun and exploding as Type II or Ibc supernovae (SNe). Both photometrically and spectroscopically, the SN II models evolve distinctly from the SN Ibc models primarily because of the greater ejecta kinetic-energy-to-mass ratio in the latter, which leads to a greater gamma-ray escape together with a lower density and a higher ionization in our H-deficient ejecta. Type II SN models remain optically luminous at all times, whereas Type Ibc models progressively brighten in the infrared (which holds 80% of their luminosity at 500d), causing strong infrared lines such as [NeII]12.810mic and [NiII]6.634mic to evolve essentially at constant luminosity. The strength of [NeII]12.810mic exhibits a complicated dependence with either He-core or preSN mass because of the additional impact of ejecta ionization -- this line radiates alone up to 20% of the SN luminosity after ~300d in our Type Ibc SN models. The numerous infrared Ni lines are found to be good tracers of the material that underwent explosive nucleosynthesis and can thus be used directly to constrain the level of 56Ni mixing in core-collapse SNe. The evolution of the integrated flux in infrared Fe and Co lines shows a great amount of diversity, which compromises their use as a diagnostic of the 56Ni-decay power source in our models. Future spectroscopic observations of core-collapse SNe by JWST will provide unprecedented information on the emission from atoms and ions in their ejecta, delivering critical constraints on massive star explosions.</description>

      <title>An optical to infrared study of type II SN2024ggi at nebular times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present 0.3-21mic observations at ~275d and ~400d for Type II supernova (SN) 2024ggi, combining ground-based optical and near-infrared data from the Keck I/II telescopes and space-based infrared data from the James Webb Space Telescope. Although the optical regions dominate the observed flux, SN2024ggi is bright at infrared wavelengths (65%/35% falls each side of 1mic). SN2024ggi exhibits a plethora of emission lines from H, He, intermediate-mass elements (O, Na, Mg, S, Ar, Ca), and iron-group elements (IGEs; Fe, Co, and Ni) -- all lines have essentially the same width, suggesting efficient macroscopic chemical mixing of the inner ejecta at &lt;~2000km/s and little mixing of 56Ni at larger velocities. Molecular emission in the infrared range is dominated by the CO fundamental, which radiates about 5% of the total SN luminosity. A molecule-free radiative-transfer model based on a standard red-supergiant star explosion (i.e., ~1e51erg, 0.06Msun of 56Ni from a 15.2Msun progenitor) yields a satisfactory match throughout the optical and infrared at both epochs. The SN2024ggi CO luminosity is comparable to the fractional decay-power absorbed in the model C/O-rich shell -- accounting for CO cooling would likely resolve the model overestimate of the [OI]0.632mic flux. The relative weakness of the molecular emission in SN2024ggi and the good overall match obtained with our molecule-free model suggests negligible microscopic mixing -- about 95% of the SN luminosity is radiated by atoms and ions. Lines from IGEs, which form from explosion ashes at such late times, are ideal diagnostics of the magnitude of 56Ni mixing in core-collapse SN ejecta. Stable Ni, clearly identified in SN2024ggi (e.g., [NiII]6.634mic), is probably a common product of massive-star explosions.</description>

      <title>When Magnetic Field Lines Stretch, Snap, and Expand: A New Look at Solar Flares with L-maps</title>

Abstract: Understanding the three-dimensional evolution of coronal magnetic fields during solar flares remains challenging due to the lack of direct coronal field measurements. Here we combine data-driven MHD simulations of NOAA AR 11158 (Fan et al., 2024) with flare-ribbon and coronal-dimming observations to investigate realistic coronal magnetic-field evolution during an X-class flare. We introduce L-maps, maps of the logarithm of magnetic field line lengths, as a diagnostic tool to track the dynamics of simulated coronal magnetic structures. Variations in L-maps identify flare ribbons through field-line shortening and coronal dimmings through field-line lengthening. Comparison with SDO/AIA observations demonstrates strong morphological and temporal agreement, validating the simulated field evolution. Applying K-means clustering to the L-map temporal profiles, we distinguish three stages of coronal evolution: (1) slow pre-flare rise phase, (2) flare reconnection accompanied by CME rise, and (3) post-reconnection CME expansion. We detect a slow pre-flare rise phase of magnetic field lines rooted in ribbon footpoints and identify a new phenomenon, reconnection dimming, a rapid expansion of reconnected inner flux-rope field lines during the impulsive phase. Our results show that L-maps provide a powerful and physically intuitive framework for bridging simulations and observations and for tracking the full three-dimensional evolution of coronal magnetic fields during flares.</description>

      <title>Regression to the Mean of Extreme Geomagnetic Storms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.02137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extreme space weather events on Earth occur during intervals of strong solar wind driving. The solar wind drives plasma convection and currents in the near-Earth space environment. For low values of the driver, the Earth's response is linear, estimated by parameters such as the polar cap index based on ground magnetometer activity. Curiously, for extreme solar wind driving, the Earth's response appears not to increase beyond a saturation limit. Theorists have advanced a host of explanations for this saturation effect, but there is no consensus. Here, we demonstrate that the saturation is a manifestation of the regression to the mean effect resulting from random uncertainty in the time and magnitude of solar wind measurements. Our results reveal that data analysis underpinning the saturation theories is non-linearly biased; hence, the theories must be validated against the correct solar wind data. Correcting for the uncertainties reveals that the Earth's response to solar wind driving is linear throughout, and the impact of extreme geomagnetic storms can be twice as large as previously thought. We show that regression to the mean is a fundamental property of the relationship between measurement and the truth, where the truth corresponding to the measurement is closer to the mean. This effect is particularly pronounced for uncertain measurements of extreme values and is likely to manifest across various fields, from extreme climate studies to chronic medical pain.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Constraints on Black Hole Formation in M31</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate neutrino signals associated with black hole formation resulting from the gravitational collapse of massive stars, motivated by the candidate failed supernova M31-2014-DS1 in the Andromeda Galaxy (M31). By compiling numerical simulation results for stellar collapse, we predict the expected neutrino emission and compare these predictions with observational limits from Super-Kamiokande (SK). The simulations reveal a characteristic precursor signal consisting of a short, intense burst whose average neutrino energy rises rapidly and then ceases abruptly once the black hole forms. We examine several nuclear equations of state, specifically the Lattimer \&amp; Swesty, Shen, Togashi, and SFHo models, to evaluate how the emission depends on neutron-star properties and nuclear-physics uncertainties. Comparison of the predicted event counts with SK's non-detection of neutrinos coincident with M31-2014-DS1 already rules out part of the model space and highlights the sensitivity of current neutrino detectors to both progenitor mass and the EOS. These findings demonstrate the capability of neutrino astronomy to probe core collapse and black hole formation in failed supernova scenarios.</description>

      <title>Exciting Stellar Eccentricity in Gaia BH3 via a Hidden Black Hole Binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose that the high eccentricity of the stellar orbit in Gaia BH3 system could be excited through a secular resonance effect if the inner dark object is, in effect, a tight and eccentric black hole binary (BHB). During the orbital decay of the inner BHB, the apsidal precession rate of the inner binary matches that of the outer stellar orbit, and this resonance advection can drive the outer eccentricity into some extreme values. For a Gaia BH3-like system, we show that a near equal-mass ($q=0.8$) BHB with an initial semi-major axis of 1--3 au and an initial eccentricity $\gtrsim 0.95$ is able to excite the outer orbit to the observed value, leaving a current BHB with semi-major axis 0.25--0.5 au and eccentricity $\sim 0.8$. The eccentric inner BHB imprints two observable signatures on the outer star: (1) short-term RV modulations with an amplitude $\lesssim 100$ m/s and (2) long-term apsidal precession with a rate $\lesssim 0.1^{\circ}$/yr. Although neither of these is detected in the currently available astrometry and RV data, we show that these signals are detectable with the full Gaia astrometry data and dedicated high-precision and/or long-term RV observations. Our work provides a new perspective on the dynamical formation of Gaia BH3, and the methodology is readily applicable to similar systems such as HD 130298, Gaia BH1, and Gaia BH2.</description>

      <title>Giant Planet Evolution with MESA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The evolution of gaseous planets is a complex process influenced by various physical parameters and processes. In this study, we present critical modifications to the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) code to enhance its applicability to giant planet modelling. We introduce an equation of state specifically tailored for materials at planetary conditions. The equation of state considers the thermodynamic properties of hydrogen-helium mixtures and heavy elements, improving the accuracy of internal structure calculations. We also present modifications to the radiative opacity to allow the modelling of grains, clouds and opacity windows. Furthermore, we refine the treatment of convective mixing processes in MESA to better replicate convective mixing with the presence of composition gradients. Finally, we add a treatment for helium rain and settling. These modifications aim to enhance the predictive capabilities of MESA for giant planet evolution and are publicly available. We hope that these improvements will lead to a deeper understanding of giant planet evolution in the solar system and beyond.</description>

      <title>Spectral Diversity in Type Ibn Supernovae and the Large Host Offset of SN2024acyl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we first present observations of SN~2024acyl, a normal Type Ibn supernova with a large projected offset ($\sim$35~kpc) from its host galaxy. The low star-formation rate measured at the explosion site raises the possibility that the progenitor of SN~2024acyl may not have been a massive star. We then examine, more broadly, the spectral diversity of Type Ibn supernovae around 20--35 days after peak brightness and identify two distinct groups: Group I, which shows bluer rest-frame optical color and narrower He~I emission lines; and Group II, which shows redder rest-frame optical color and broader He~I lines. Group~I also tends to show higher peak luminosities. The diversity we identify appears to be closely connected to the diversity observed around peak and to persist into late phases ($&gt;80$ days after peak). Given its redder color and broader He~I lines, we classify SN~2024acyl as belonging to Group II. Based on the current dataset, we find no clear connection between this spectral diversity and either the host environments of Type Ibn SNe or their pre-explosion activity. The observed diversity in Type Ibn SNe likely reflects differences in circumstellar material properties and/or explosion energetics. These differences could result from a range of progenitor properties, such as different helium star mass, orbital period and companion type if they are in binary systems, and may indicate fundamentally diverse progenitors. Whether a continuous distribution exists between the two groups remains to be determined and will require further data to explore.</description>
