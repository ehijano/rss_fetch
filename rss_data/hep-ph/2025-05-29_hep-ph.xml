      <title>Genesis of Baryon and Dark Matter Asymmetries through Ultraviolet Scattering Freeze-in</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new mechanism for the simultaneous generation of baryon and dark matter asymmetries through ultraviolet-dominated freeze-in scatterings. The mechanism relies on heavy Majorana neutrinos that connect the visible Standard Model sector to a dark sector through the neutrino portal. Following reheating of the visible sector to a temperature well below the heavy neutrino masses, we show that 2-to-2 scattering processes can populate the dark sector and generate both baryon and dark matter asymmetries. In some parameter regions, the dominant source of baryon asymmetry can be charge transfer from the dark sector, a process we call dark wash-in. We also demonstrate that annihilation of the dark matter to massless states within the dark sector can deplete the symmetric population without destroying the net baryon charge to leave only an asymmetric dark matter abundance today. Depending on the specific model parameters, the observed baryon and dark matter abundances can be attained with heavy neutrino masses $M_N \gtrsim 10^{10}$ GeV, and dark matter masses in the range 0.1 GeV $\lesssim m_\chi \lesssim 10^3$ GeV if the dark matter relic abundance is mainly asymmetric and even lower masses if it is symmetric.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical sources of dark particles as a solution to the KM3NeT and IceCube tension over KM3-230213A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We entertain the possibility that transient astrophysical sources can produce a flux of dark particles that induce ultra-high-energy signatures at neutrino telescopes such as IceCube and KM3NeT. We construct scenarios where such ``dark flux" can produce meta-stable dark particles inside the Earth that subsequently decay to muons, inducing through-going tracks in large-volume neutrino detectors. We consider such a scenario in light of the $\mathcal{O}(70)$~PeV ultra-high-energy muon observed by KM3NeT and argue that because of its location in the sky and the strong geometrical dependence of the signal, such events would not necessarily have been observed by IceCube. Our model relies on the upscattering of a new particle $X$ onto new metastable particles that decay to dimuons with decay lengths of $\mathcal{O}(100)$~km. This scenario can explain the observation by KM3NeT without being in conflict with the IceCube data.</description>

      <title>On Pulsar Timing Detection of Ultralight Vector Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultralight vector dark matter induces metric fluctuations that generate timing residuals in the arrival times of pulsar emissions through two distinct modes: a fast mode, sourced by coherent field oscillations, and a slow mode, arising from interference patterns. These modes enable the detection of vector dark matter with masses $m \sim 10^{-24} - 10^{-22}\ \mathrm{eV}$ and $m \sim 10^{-18} - 10^{-16}\ \mathrm{eV}$, respectively, using pulsar timing arrays. While previous studies have explored the fast mode, they neglect the full statistical treatment of the vector field and a precise treatment of its polarization structure. In this work, we investigate the timing residuals from both modes, fully accounting for the statistical properties of ultralight vector dark matter, assuming equipartition among its three polarization states. The two-point correlation functions of timing residuals that we derive serve as direct tools for identifying vector dark matter signatures as a stochastic background in pulsar timing data.</description>

      <title>Explaining the PeV Neutrino Fluxes at KM3NeT and IceCube with Quasi-Extremal Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The KM3NeT experiment has recently observed a neutrino with an energy around 100 PeV, and IceCube has detected five neutrinos with energies above 1 PeV. While there are no known astrophysical sources, exploding primordial black holes could have produced these high-energy neutrinos. For Schwarzschild black holes this interpretation results in tensions between the burst rates inferred from the KM3NeT and IceCube observations, and with indirect constraints from the extragalactic gamma ray background. In this letter we show that if there is a population of primordial black holes charged under a new dark $u(1)$ symmetry which spend most of their time in a quasi-extremal state, the neutrino emission at 1 PeV may be more suppressed than at 100 PeV. The burst rates implied by the KM3NeT and IceCube observations and the indirect constraints can then all be consistent at $1\sigma$. Furthermore, these black holes could constitute all of the observed dark matter in the universe.</description>

      <title>Langer's nucleation rate reproduced on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that Langer's rate of bubble nucleation is quantitatively correct up to small higher-loop corrections, in comparison to lattice simulations. These results are a significant advancement on decades of lattice studies showing only qualitative trends, and the first showing agreement for any conservative system. We confirm that the failure to fully thermalize the metastable phase explains discrepancies with recent lattice studies that found disagreement with Langer's rate. The key theoretical development is the translation of Langer's perturbative definition of a thermal metastable phase into a nonperturbative statement that can be implemented on the lattice. Our statistical and systematic errors are small enough to allow us to measure on the lattice the coefficient of the two-loop contribution, missing from the perturbative prediction. Our conclusions also exclude a possible systematic uncertainty in $^3$He experiments.</description>

      <title>Current-current operator contribution to the decay matrix in $B$-meson mixing at next-to-next-to-leading order of QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute next-to-next-to-leading order perturbative corrections to the decay width difference of mass eigenstates and the charge-parity asymmetry $a_{\rm fs}$ in flavour-specific decays of neutral $B$ mesons. In our calculation we take into account the full dependence on the charm and bottom quark masses for the current-current operator contributions up to three-loop order. Special emphasis is put on the proper construction of the so-called $|\Delta B|=2$ theory such that Fierz symmetry is preserved. We provide updated phenomenological predictions, for $\Delta\Gamma$, $\Delta\Gamma/\Delta M$ and $a_{\rm fs}$ for the $B_d$ and $B_s$ system, including a detailed analysis of the uncertainties of our predictions. The calculated NNLO correction reduce the perturbative uncertainty of the leading term of the $1/m_b$ expansion of the width difference $\dg_s$ in the $B_s$ system to the level of the current experimental error. The uncertainty of our prediction $\dg_s=({0.077}\pm 0.016)\,\mbox{ps}^{-1}$ is dominated by the sub-leading term of this expansion. We further illustrate how better future measurements of $\dg_d$ and $a_{\rm fs}^d$ will help to gain a better understanding of $B_d$-$\bar B_d$ mixing.</description>

      <title>A complex logistic equation for universal energy evolution in hadronic elastic scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a universal evolution equation for elastic scattering of hadrons, derived from Regge field theory (RFT) and solved in closed analytical form. The equation emerges from a complex logistic structure and evolves initial amplitude profiles taken from existing models at fixed energy, reproducing both the differential cross sections and the integrated quantities in a broad energy range. We prove that it admits a unique solution for each initial condition and rigorously satisfies unitarity, the Froissart-Martin bound, and dispersion relations. The dynamics are governed by two physically meaningful parameters: the effective Pomeron mass $\epsilon_{\mathcal{P}}$ and the nonlinear coupling $\lambda$, both fitted at a single energy. Our approach offers a minimal, yet predictive framework for saturation and unitarization in elastic scattering and may provide a useful bridge toward small-$x$ QCD evolution.</description>

      <title>`Dark' Matter Effect as a Novel Solution to the KM3-230213A Puzzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent KM3NeT observation of the ${\cal O}(100~{\rm PeV})$ event KM3-230213A is puzzling because IceCube with much larger effective area times exposure has not found any such events. We propose a novel solution to this conundrum in terms of dark matter (DM) scattering in the Earth's crust. We show that intermediate dark-sector particles that decay into muons are copiously produced when high-energy ($\sim100~\text{PeV}$) DM propagates through a sufficient amount of Earth overburden. The same interactions responsible for DM scattering in Earth also source the boosted DM flux from a high-luminosity blazar. We address the non-observation of similar events at IceCube via two examples of weakly coupled long-lived dark sector scenarios that satisfy all the lab-based constraints. We calculate the corresponding dark sector cross sections, lifetimes and blazar luminosities required to yield one event at KM3NeT, and also predict the number of IceCube events for these parameters that can be tested very soon. Our proposed DM explanation of the event can also be distinguished from a neutrino-induced event in future high-energy neutrino flavor analyses, large-scale DM direct detection experiments, as well as at future colliders.</description>

      <title>Odderon Exchange in Elastic Proton-Proton and Proton-Antiproton Scattering at TeV Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The odderon, a leading crossing-odd $t$-channel exchange, was first proposed by L. Lukaszuk and B. Nicolescu in 1973, but its existence remained elusive for 48 years. Elastic proton-proton scattering measurements at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and elastic proton-antiproton scattering measurements at FNAL's Tevatron, performed at TeV-scale center-of-mass energies ($\sqrt{s}$) and over wide ranges of squared four-momentum transfer ($t$), opened new opportunities to study the physics of elastic hadronic processes which ultimately led to the discovery of odderon exchange in the nonperturbative domain of strong interactions, as detailed in this dissertation. In quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the fundamental theory of strong interactions, the odderon is described in the perturbative regime as a $t$-channel exchange of an odd number of interacting gluons.</description>

Abstract: We examine the idea that our universe began as a baby universe and show that this is feasible in a $U(1)_{B-L}$ extension of the Standard Model with the classically conformal principle. The framework is consistent with current cosmological data and predicts a heavy neutral gauge boson, which could be detected at colliders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this report we discuss the definition of the polarized cross sections of the inclusive $W^+W^-$ production at the LHC. Results at the level of next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD+EW accuracy, published in our recent paper, are presented to highlight the effects of bottom-quark induced processes. Compared to the unpolarized case, the bottom-induced effects after the subtraction of the on-shell top-quark contribution are more sizable for the doubly-longitudinal polarization.</description>

      <title>Kinetically Modified Palatini Inflation Meets ACT Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the coexistence of a non-minimal coupling to gravity fR=1+cR phi^(n/2) with a kinetic mixing of the form fk=fR^m -- where n=2 and 4 and 0.5&lt;m&lt;10 -- reconciles chaotic inflation based on the phi^n potential with the recent ACT results, if we adopt the Palatini formulation of gravity. The attainment of inflation allows for subplanckian inflaton values and energy scales below the cut-off scale of the corresponding effective theory. The model can be also embedded in supergravity by introducing two chiral superfields and a monomial superpotential, linear with respect to the inflaton-accompanying field. Its stabilization is achieved thanks to a compact contribution to the Kaehler potential, whose the inflationary part includes an holomorphic logarithmic term and a real one multiplying a shift-symmetric quadratic polynomial term.</description>

      <title>Dark clouds to silver linings over the hyperchargeless scalar triplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A real scalar triplet with zero hypercharge offers a minimal non-trivial extension of the Standard Model (SM) with a charged Higgs and a possible dark matter or custodial symmetry breaking signature. The $Z_2$-odd inert triplet model (ITM) provides a dark matter, while the non-inert Higgs triplet model (HTM) breaks the custodial symmetry, enabling rich collider signatures. Both these models also promise the viability of a first-order phase transition (FOPT). This letter revisits both models under various theoretical and current experimental constraints, revealing a trade-off between DM and FOPT viability, and explores the resulting gravitational wave signals and collider prospects.</description>

      <title>Neutrinos from Primordial Black Holes in Theories with Extra Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum gravity scale within the dark dimension scenario ($M_* \sim 10^{9}~{\rm GeV}$) roughly coincides with the energy scale of the KM3-230213A neutrino ($E_\nu \sim 10^{8}~{\rm GeV}$). We propose an interpretation for this intriguing coincidence in terms of Hawking evaporation of five-dimensional (5D) primordial black holes (PBHs). 5D PBHs are bigger, colder, and longer-lived than 4D PBHs of the same mass. For brane observers, PBHs decay essentially invisibly (only through gravitationally coupled modes), with a possible hot (temperature $\sim 10^{8}~{\rm GeV}$) flare of Standard Model particles in the final-stage emission. As a consequence, constraints on the density of PBHs relative to that of dark matter from null searches of Hawking evaporation can be avoided. We show that Hawking evaporation of 5D PBHs can accommodate the KM3-230213A neutrino event and remain consistent with IceCube upper limits on the partial decay width of superheavy dark matter particles into neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Pion Phenomenology from the Thermal Soft-Wall Model of Holographic QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the temperature dependence of the electromagnetic form factor of the pion, its generalized parton distribution $H_{\pi}(T)$, effective mass $m_{\pi}(T)$, radius $r_{\pi}(T)$, electromagnetic charge density $\rho_{\pi}(b, T)$, pion-nucleon coupling constant $g_{\pi NN}(T)$ and the pion-$\Delta$ coupling $g_{\pi \Delta \Delta}(T)$ within the thermal soft-wall model of AdS/QCD. The thermal pion form factor is extrapolated from the zero-temperature case, and based on this, the generalized parton distribution, charge density, and radius are studied at finite temperature. These quantities were analyzed using a thermal dilaton field in the five-dimensional action. Moreover, we determine the theoretical expression for the temperature-dependent pion-nucleon, as well as, pion-$\Delta$ coupling, using thermal profile functions of nucleons, $\Delta$ baryons and the pion. Our results show that the values of these quantities decrease with increasing temperature and vanish near the critical temperature. Our results reproduce expected features of low-energy hadron dynamics, thus validating the phenomenological utility of the thermal soft-wall model.</description>

      <title>Factorized QED and QCD Contribution to Deeply Inelastic Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23487</link>

Abstract: We present the first calculation of next-to-leading order (NLO) factorized QED and QCD contributions to the short-distance hard coefficients of inclusive lepton-hadron deep inelastic scattering (DIS) in a joint QED and QCD factorization approach. Unlike the traditional radiative correction approach to handle the collision-induced QED contributions to DIS, QED radiation from all charged leptons and quarks are treated equally, and their collinear sensitivities are systematically factorized into corresponding universal lepton and parton distribution functions. We demonstrate that the NLO factorized QED contribution is completely infrared safe and calculable without the need of any parameters other than the standard factorization scale in the same way as the factorized QCD contribution. We discuss the potential impact of this joint factorization approach on the extraction of partonic information from lepton-hadron DIS.</description>

      <title>Charged particle multiplicity distributions derived from the Principle of Maximal Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent theoretical results renewed the interest in charged particle multiplicity distributions. The Shannon entropy of such distributions is conjectured to be related to the entanglement or von Neumann entropy of partonic quantum system. In this paper, we show that the measured charged particle multiplicities can be derived from the principle of maximum entropy (POME or MAXENT) without any a priori physical assumption. The approach provides a natural explanation for the well-known negative binomial shape of the measured distributions.</description>

      <title>Electroexcitation of Nucleon Resonances and the Emergence of Hadron Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing an understanding of phenomena driven by the emergence of hadron mass (EHM) is one of the most challenging problems in the Standard Model. This discussion focuses on the impact of results on nucleon resonance \texorpdfstring{($N^\ast$)} electroexcitation amplitudes (or \texorpdfstring{$\gamma_vpN^\ast$} electrocouplings) obtained from experiments during the 6-GeV era in Hall~B at Jefferson Lab on understanding EHM. Analyzed using continuum Schwinger function methods (CSMs), these results have revealed new pathways for the elucidation of EHM. A good description of the \texorpdfstring{$\Delta(1232)3/2^+$}, \texorpdfstring{$N(1440)1/2^+$}, and \texorpdfstring{$\Delta(1600)3/2^+$} electrocouplings, achieved by CSM analyses that express a realistic dressed quark mass function, sheds light on the strong interaction dynamics that underlies EHM. Extensions to nucleon resonance studies for higher-mass states are outlined, as well as experimental results anticipated in the 12-GeV era at Jefferson Lab and those that would be enabled by a further increase of the beam energy to 22~GeV.</description>

      <title>On the Probability of the Initial Conditions for Inflation and Slow Contraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some recent studies based on numerical relativity simulations claim that slow contraction/ekpyrosis is strongly preferred over inflation as the smoothing mechanism that brought the universe into the homogeneous, isotropic and flat state we observe today on large scales. In this paper, we evaluate the likelihood of the initial conditions employed in the aforementioned simulations by estimating the probability that a free scalar field dominating the universe at the beginning of inflation or ekpyrosis will be sufficiently homogeneous on scales comparable to the Hubble radius at that time. We explore the space of parameters that characterize the initial power spectrum of the scalar field, finding that either can be more likely than the other for a fixed choice of parameters. On the other hand, when we extremize over these parameters, we find that the maximal probability for inflation is much higher than that of ekpyrosis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The process of electron positron pair annihilation, driven by strong fields (Inverse Schwinger mechanism) and high-frequency waves, is studied using the Dirac Heisenberg Wigner formalism. In an electron positron plasma, the presence of a strong field leads to both pair creation and annihilation. Depending on plasma properties such as non-degeneracy and the momentum distribution, pair annihilation can dominate over pair creation. The energy released from annihilated pairs can lead to an enhancement of the field energy, provided that the plasma effectively blocks the creation of new pairs. Additionally, pair annihilation induced by high-frequency waves is shown to occur when the photon energy matches the energy of the pairs in the plasma.</description>

      <title>Condensates, crystals, and renormalons in the Gross-Neveu model at finite density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the $O(2N)$ symmetric Gross-Neveu model at finite density in the presence of a $U(1)$ chemical potential $h$ for a generic number $a \leq N-2$ of fermion fields. By combining perturbative QFT, semiclassical large $N$, and Bethe ansatz techniques, we show that at finite $N$ two new dynamically generated scales $\Lambda_\mathrm{n}$ and $\Lambda_\mathrm{c}$ appear in the theory, governing the mass gap of neutral and charged fermions, respectively. Above a certain threshold value for $h$, $a$-fermion bound states condense and form an inhomogeneous configuration, which at infinite $N$ is a crystal spontaneously breaking translations. At large $h$, this crystal has mean $\Lambda_\mathrm{n}$ and spatial oscillations of amplitude $2\Lambda_\mathrm{c}$. The two scales also control the nonperturbative corrections to the free energy, resolving a puzzle concerning fractional-power renormalons and predicting new ones.</description>

      <title>Constraining primordial curvature perturbations with present and future GW detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial scalar curvature perturbations ($\zeta$), typically probed on large cosmological scales via CMB and LSS observations, can be significantly enhanced on smaller scales by various early Universe mechanisms, for instance, non-minimal inflationary models. While decoupled at linear order, scalar and tensor perturbations, i.e., Gravitational Waves (GWs), interact at second order. As a consequence, an enhanced primordial scalar power spectrum $P_\zeta(k)$ can source a sizable stochastic GW background (SGWB). In these proceedings, we briefly review the generation mechanism of such signals, typically referred to as scalar-induced GWs (SIGWs), and discuss the prospects of measuring them with present and future Pulsar Timing Arrays datasets and future GW observatories like the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna LISA.</description>

      <title>Neutron Stars in Causal Scalar-Tensor Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study static, spherically symmetric neutron stars in a class of scalar-tensor theories with non-canonical kinetic terms (K-essence) obeying all causality and hyperbolicity conditions. These models have non-trivial dynamics that lead to a type of anti-screening of the scalar. They lead to small corrections in the solar system due to a small coupling, but can lead to large corrections in regimes of high densities, especially neutron stars. We solve the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations numerically using realistic equations of state (SLy4, WFF1, MS1, MPA1). For a given central density, we find that two distinct configurations may exist, forming two separate branches of solutions. We find that above a certain critical central density solutions with the correct asymptotic behavior at spatial infinity cannot be obtained. We obtain precise predictions for the mass-radius relation for neutron stars for different values of the parameters in the model and we compare to data.</description>

Abstract: The electromagnetic transition form factors for the transition between the ground and excited states of nucleons are studied in the framework of the hard-wall model of AdS/QCD. The profile functions of the spinor and vector fields in the bulk of AdS space are presented. Using AdS/CFT correspondence between the generating functions in the bulk and boundary theories an expression for the transition form factors are obtained from the bulk action for the interaction between the photon and nucleon fields. We consider the R(1710, 1535, 1440)\rightarrow N transitions and plot the Dirac and Pauli form factor dependencies on transferred momentum square. Also, the spiral amplitudes for these transitions are presented.</description>

      <title>QCD-Collapsed Domain Walls: QCD Phase Transition and Gravitational Wave Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17160v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a discrete symmetry that is anomalous under QCD, the domain walls produced in the early universe from its spontaneous breaking can naturally annihilate due to QCD instanton effects. The gravitational waves generated from wall annihilation have their amplitude and frequency determined by both the discrete symmetry breaking scale and the QCD scale. The evidence of stochastic gravitational waves at nanohertz observed by pulsar timing array experiments suggests that the discrete-symmetry-breaking scale is around 100 TeV, assuming the domain-wall explanation. The annihilation temperature is about 100 MeV, which could naturally be below the QCD phase transition temperature. We point out that the QCD phase transition within some domains with an effective large QCD $\theta$ angle could be a first-order one. To derive the phase diagram in $\theta$ and temperature, we adopt a phenomenological linear sigma model with three quark flavors. The domain-wall explanation for the NANOGrav, EPTA, PPTA and CPTA results hints at a first-order QCD phase transition, which predicts additional gravitational waves at higher frequencies. If the initial formation of domain walls is also a first-order process, this class of domain-wall models predicts an interesting gravitational wave spectroscopy with frequencies spanning more than ten orders of magnitude, from nanohertz to 100 Hz.</description>

Abstract: Simulations of neutrino interactions are playing an increasingly important role in the pursuit of high-priority measurements for the field of particle physics. A significant technical barrier for efficient development of these simulations is the lack of a standard data format for representing individual neutrino scattering events. We propose and define such a universal format, named NuHepMC, as a common standard for the output of neutrino event generators. The NuHepMC format uses data structures and concepts from the HepMC3 event record library adopted by other subfields of high-energy physics. These are supplemented with an original set of conventions for generically representing neutrino interaction physics within the HepMC3 infrastructure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the post-LHC era, the muon collider represents a frontier project capable of providing high-energy and high-luminosity leptonic collisions among future lepton-lepton particle accelerators. In addition, it provides significantly cleaner final states than those produced in hadron collisions. With this expectation in mind, in this article, we research the sensitivity of the anomalous neutral gauge boson couplings $Z\gamma\gamma\gamma$, $ZZ\gamma \gamma$, and $ZZZ\gamma$ defined by dimension-8 operators, through the $\mu^+\mu^- \to \mu^+\mu^-Z\gamma$ signal, with the $Z$-boson decaying to a neutrino pair. The projections at the future muon collider with a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=10$ TeV, integrated luminosity of ${\cal L}=10$ $\rm ab^{-1}$, and systematic uncertainties of $\delta_{sys}=0\%, 3\%, 5\%$, give an expected sensitivity on the anomalous $f_ {T,j}/\Lambda^4$ couplings at $95\%$ confidence level of the order of ${\cal O}(10^{-3}- 10^{-1})$ $\rm TeV^{-4}$. Compared with the research of the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations on the anomalous quartic gauge couplings, we find that the high-luminosity future muon collider could have better sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Estimating Longitudinal Polarization of $\Lambda$ and $\bar{\Lambda}$ Hyperons at Relativistic Energies using Hydrodynamic and Transport models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15138v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The global and local spin polarization measurements of $\Lambda$ ($\bar{\Lambda}$) hyperons by STAR and ALICE Collaborations open up an immense interest in investigating the spin polarization dynamics in heavy-ion collisions. Recent studies suggest the transverse component of the vorticity field is responsible for the global spin polarization. In contrast, the longitudinal component of the vorticity field accounts for the local spin polarization. The local (longitudinal) spin polarization of $\Lambda$-hyperons arises due to the anisotropic flows in the transverse plane, indicating a quadrupole pattern of the longitudinal vorticity along the beam direction. In this study, we derive a simple solution relating the longitudinal mean spin vector with the second-order anisotropic flow coefficient due to the thermal shear tensor for an ideal uncharged fluid in a longitudinal boost invariant scenario. The present study focuses on the local spin polarization of $\Lambda$ and $\bar{\Lambda}$ in Au$+$Au and Pb$+$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV and 5.02 TeV, respectively. Further, we explore the azimuthal angle, centrality, and transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) dependence study of longitudinal spin polarization using hydrodynamic and transport models. All these models predict a maximum longitudinal spin polarization in mid-central collisions around 30-50 \% centrality at $p_{\rm T} \approx$ 2.0 - 3.0 GeV/c. These findings on longitudinal spin polarization advocate the existence of a thermal medium in non-central heavy-ion collisions.</description>

Abstract: In this study, the transverse momentum spectra of $k ^{\pm }$, $\pi ^{\pm }$ and $p(\bar{p})$ particles in mid-rapidity ($\left | y \right | &lt; 0.1$) for nine centrality classes are investigated in $^{238} U$+$^{238} U$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=193 GeV within the cascade and soft momentum-dependent equation of state (SM-EoS) mode of the UrQMD model. Other extracted observable from $p_{T}$ spectrum includes average transverse momentum ($\left \langle p_{T} \right \rangle$), the yield ($dN/dy$) as well as the ratio of particle type are also shown in function of collision centrality. It is found that the U+U collision process is segmented. Before the collision centrality is $50-60\%$, the experimental data are described well using cascade mode when the $p_{T} &lt; 1.2 GeV/c$. The results are in good agreement with the experimental data using the SM-EoS mode at $p_{T} &gt; 1.2 GeV/c$. For the case of $60-80\%$ centrality, the SM-EoS mode describes the data better. At RHIC energy, pair production is the dominant production mechanism for particles, with the anti-ion to ion yield ratio suggesting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: QCD calculations for collider physics make use of perturbative solutions of renormalisation group equations (RGEs). Ambiguities related to these solutions can contribute significantly to systematic uncertainties of theoretical predictions for physical observables. We propose a general method to estimate these systematic effects using techniques inspired by soft-gluon and transverse-momentum resummation approaches. We first discuss the cases of the evolution of strong coupling $\alpha_s$, collinear parton-distribution functions (PDFs), and transverse-momentum-dependent distributions (TMDs). We then study the implications for precision observables in hadron-collider processes, such as the deep-inelastic scattering structure functions and the transverse-momentum distribution of the lepton pair in Drell-Yan production.</description>

      <title>Is leptogenesis during gravitational reheating flavourful?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the impact of charged lepton Yukawa equilibration on leptogenesis during gravitational reheating. During the post-inflationary era, the inflaton field is assumed to oscillate around the minimum of a monomial potential, leading to the gravitational production of Standard Model (SM) particles, constituting the radiation bath. The heavy right-handed neutrinos (RHN), responsible for generating baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis, are also produced through graviton-mediated scattering of the homogeneous inflaton field and thermal bath, as well as from the the inverse decay of the bath particles. By considering both minimal and non-minimal gravitational contributions to SM, we demonstrate that flavour effects can be safely neglected in the minimal reheating scenario. However, with large non-minimal coupling, these effects may become important, depending on the choice of the RHN mass. We identify the corresponding viable parameter space that satisfies the observed baryon asymmetry in each case.</description>

      <title>Bounds on Axions-Like Particles Shining in the Ultra-Violet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) can decay into two photons with a rest-frame frequency given by half of the ALP mass. This implies that ultra-violet searches can be used to investigate ALPs in the multi-eV mass range. We use archival data from the Hubble Space Telescope between 110 and 170 nm to constrain ALPs with mass between 14.4-22.2 eV. We consider observations of a set of dwarf spheroidal galaxies and galaxy clusters and assume the ALP density in these objects to follow their dark matter density. The derived limit on the ALP-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma}$ excludes values above $10^{-12}~{\rm GeV}^{-1}$ over the whole mass range and surpasses previous limits by over one order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Precise Determination of the Strong Coupling Constant from Dijet Cross Sections up to the Multi-TeV Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine the value of the strong coupling $\alpha_\text{s}$ and study its running over a wide range of scales as probed by the dijet production process at hadron colliders, based on an NNLO QCD analysis of LHC dijet data. From a large subset of these data a value of $\alpha_\text{s} (m_\text{Z}) = 0.1178 \pm 0.0022$ is obtained for the strong coupling at the scale of the Z-boson mass $m_\text{Z}$, using the invariant mass of the dijet system to select the scale where $\alpha_\text{s}$ is probed. The combination of different data sets enhances the reach and precision of the analysis in the mutli-TeV range and allows for the first determination of $\alpha_\text{s}$ up to scales of 7 TeV. Complementing the LHC data with dijet cross sections measured at the HERA electron-proton collider, the kinematic range is extended to test the running of the strong coupling towards smaller scales. Our results exhibit excellent agreement with predictions based on the renormalization group equation of QCD, and represent a comprehensive test of the asymptotic behavior of QCD, spanning more than three orders of magnitude in energy scale.</description>

      <title>Proposal for simplified template cross-sections extension using $\cal{CP}$ observables in $t\overline{t}H$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) offers a unique opportunity to investigate $\cal{CP}$ violation in the Yukawa coupling between the Higgs boson and the top quark by studying Higgs production in association with top quarks; this is of fundamental importance, seeing that the $\cal{CP}$ properties of the Higgs boson are yet to measure with high precision. To address this, the focus of this work has been an extension of the simplified template cross-section (STXS) framework, devised to be sensitive to $\cal{CP}$ effects. Our study focused on $\cal{CP}$-sensitive observables across multiple Higgs decay channels, comparing their performances. The result indicates that the most efficient extension of the current binning used in the STXS framework, which currently uses the Higgs boson's transverse momentum $p_{T,H}$, requires adding one further split using $\cal{CP}$-sensitive observables. Between these observables, one of the best is the Collins-Soper angle $|\cos\theta^*|$, a variable derived from momenta information of the top quarks. We have investigated the improvement brought by our two-dimensional STXS setup and compared it to the currently employed methodologies, finding an increase in performances at an integrated luminosity of $300$ fb$^{-1}$. Moreover, our results highlight that this advantage seems to be present also at $3000$ fb$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Low scale leptogenesis and $TM_1$ mixing in neutrinophillic two Higgs doublet model($\nu$2HDM) with S4 flavor symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04413v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a modified version of the Standard Model that includes a scalar doublet and two right-handed neutrinos, forming the neutrinophillic two higgs doublet ($\nu\text{2HDM}$) framework. For $v_2 &lt;&lt; v_1$, this model operates at a TeV scale, bringing the RHNs within experimental reach. To further enhance its predictive power, we introduce an $S_4 \times Z_4$ flavor symmetry with five flavons, resulting in mass matrices that realize $\text{TM}_1$ mixing. The model effectively explains lepton masses and flavor mixing under the normal ordering of neutrino masses, predicting that the effective neutrino mass in 0$\nu\beta\beta$ decay lies between [4 - 5] meV, significantly lower than the sensitivity limits of current experiments. We also investigate how this framework could support low-scale leptogenesis as a natural way to explain the observed imbalance between matter and antimatter in the Universe. This work explores how neutrino physics, flavor symmetry, and baryon asymmetry are connected, providing a clear framework that links theoretical predictions with experimental possibilities.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entanglement Theory and Its Generic Searches in High Energy Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new formalism for quantum entanglement (QE), and study its generic searches at the colliders. For a general quantum system with $N$ particles, we show that the quantum space (the total spin polarization parameter space) is complex projective space, and the classical space (the spin polarization parameter space for classical theory) is the cartesian product of the complex projective spaces. Thus, the quantum entanglement space is the difference of these two spaces. For the $ff$, $AA$, $Af$, $fff$, and $ffA$ systems, we propose their discriminants $\Delta_i$. The corresponding classical spaces are the discriminant locus $\Delta=0$ for $ff$ system, and intersections of the discriminant loci $\Delta_i=0$ for $AA$, $Af$, $fff$, and $ffA$ systems in the quantum space. In particular, for two fermion $ff$ system, we prove that our discriminant criterion is equivalent to the original Peres-Horodecki criterion and the CHSH criterion. And thus our quantum entanglement space is indeed Bell non-local. With the collider searches, we can reconstruct the discriminants from various measurements, and probe the quantum entanglement spaces via a fundamental approach at exact level. In addition, for the specific approach, we present a comprehensive framework to detect quantum entanglement in high-energy multi-particle systems, spanning fermion pairs ($t\bar{t}$, $\tau^{+}\tau^{-}$), bosonic pairs ($W^{-}W^{+}$), and hybrid or three-body systems ($W^{-}t$, $ttt$, $t\bar{t}W^{-}$), by diverse observables through angular correlations in decay products. These results establish model-independent methodologies for probing QE across collider experiments, bridging quantum information principles with high-energy phenomenology, while offering novel pathways to explore exotic particles and quantum properties in multi-particle systems.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the radiative transitions of predicted triple-charm molecular hexaquarks, which play a significant role in understanding their overall spectroscopic properties. As experimentally measurable quantities, the radiative decay widths provide insights into the internal structures of these triple-charm molecular hexaquarks. Additionally, we calculate their corresponding magnetic moments, which, together with the radiative decay widths, offer a comprehensive picture of the electromagnetic properties of these exotic states. This information is valuable for guiding future experimental searches and advancing our understanding of these unique hadronic systems.</description>

      <title>Ultra-low-frequency gravitational waves from individual supermassive black hole binaries as standard sirens</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.00607v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultra-low-frequency gravitational waves (GWs) generated by individual inspiraling supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) at the centers of galaxies may be detected by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) in the future. These GW signals, which encode absolute cosmic distances, can serve as bright and dark sirens, potentially evolving into a precise cosmological probe. Here, we show that a PTA in the era of the Square Kilometre Array, comprising 100 millisecond pulsars, could potentially detect about 25 bright sirens and 41 dark sirens over a 10-year observation period. The bright sirens, combined with cosmic microwave background data, offer capabilities comparable to current mainstream joint cosmological observations for measuring the equation of state of dark energy. The dark sirens could achieve a measurement precision of the Hubble constant close to that of current distance-ladder observations. Our results suggest that ultra-low-frequency GWs from individual SMBHBs are of great significance in investigating the nature of dark energy and determining the Hubble constant.</description>

      <title>Flow-based Nonperturbative Simulation of First-order Phase Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a flow-based method for simulating and calculating nucleation rates of first-order phase transitions in scalar field theory on a lattice. Motivated by recent advancements in machine learning tools, particularly normalizing flows for lattice field theory, we propose the ``partitioning flow-based Markov chain Monte Carlo (PFMCMC) sampling" method to address two challenges encountered in normalizing flow applications for lattice field theory: the ``mode-collapse" and ``rare-event sampling" problems. Using a (2+1)-dimensional real scalar model as an example, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our PFMCMC method in modeling highly hierarchical order parameter probability distributions and simulating critical bubble configurations. These simulations are then used to facilitate the calculation of nucleation rates. We anticipate the application of this method to (3+1)-dimensional theories for studying realistic cosmological phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Enhanced nuclear Schiff and electric dipole moments in nuclei with an octupole deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deformed nuclei exhibit enhanced moments that violate time-reversal invariance ($T$) and parity ($P$). This paper focuses on the enhanced nuclear electric dipole moment (EDM) and Schiff moment present in nuclei with octupole deformation (pear-shaped nuclei). These moments, which are proportional to the octupole deformation, have a collective nature and are large in the intrinsic frame that rotates with the nucleus. However, in a state with definite angular momentum and parity, $T$ and $P$ conservation forbid their expectation values in the laboratory frame, as nuclear rotation causes them to vanish. In nuclei with octupole deformation, close opposite-parity rotational states with identical spin are mixed by $T$,$P$-violating nuclear forces. This mixing polarises the nuclear axis along the nuclear spin, allowing moments from the intrinsic frame to manifest in the laboratory frame, provided the nuclear spin $I$ is sufficiently large. Using half-life data for $E1$ transitions from the NuDat database, we calculate the intrinsic nuclear EDM $d_{\text{int}}$ for a range of nuclei theorised to exhibit octupole deformation. From these values, we independently estimate the intrinsic nuclear Schiff moment $S_{\text{int}}$ and the octupole deformation parameter $\beta_{3}$. Finally, we compare the magnitude of these collective moments in the laboratory frame with the contributions from valence nucleons, providing an estimate of the nuclear EDM and Schiff moment components unrelated to octupole deformation. The uncertainty of our estimates may exceed a factor of 10.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the problem of constructing a color superconducting phase in bottom-up holography. We introduce a model that describes the five-dimensional dynamics of a scalar field dual to a chiral symmetry breaking condensate, which is coupled to the RR 4-form. The coupling is given by a topological WZ term, which is elegantly responsible both for scalar condensation at high density, and color Higgsing in the condensed phase. This construction realizes both properties at finite density and Higgsing fraction.</description>

      <title>Primordial Gravitational Waves in Quadratic Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03543v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quadratic gravity is a fourth-order (in derivatives) theory that can serve as an attractive upgrade to the standard description of gravity provided by General Relativity, thanks to its renormalizability and its built-in description of primordial inflation. We bring quadratic gravity into a second-order form by introducing an auxiliary tensor field and we consider the primordial tensor fluctuations (gravitational waves) in the theory around a Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker background. After a canonical quantization of the perturbations, we calculate the tensor power spectrum in quasi de Sitter spacetime. We find that the spectral index $n_t$ and the amplitude $A_t$ of the tensor power spectrum are both suppressed by the factor $(1 + 2{\bf H}^2_*/m_\text{gh}^2)^{-1}$, where ${\bf H}_*$ is the Hubble rate at horizon exit and $m_\text{gh}$ is the mass of the spin-two ghost. This restores the slow-roll consistency condition familiar from single-field inflation models, where the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ is equal to $-8n_t$ in the lowest nontrivial order in the slow-roll approximation. We also discuss the well-known issue of the ghost problem in fourth-order theories and how it pertains to the results at hand.</description>

      <title>Searching for Inflationary Physics with the CMB Trispectrum: 1. Primordial Theory &amp; Optimal Estimators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04434v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The primordial four-point function encodes a wealth of information about the inflationary Universe. Despite extensive theoretical work, most models of four-point physics have never been compared to data. In this series, we conduct a detailed analysis of Cosmic Microwave Background temperature and polarization trispectra, searching for a wide variety of phenomena including local effects, self-interactions, curvatons, DBI inflation, gauge fields, solid inflation, scalar field exchange, spinning massive field exchange, chiral physics, point sources, and gravitational lensing. After presenting a suite of separable primordial templates, we derive thirteen quasi-optimal estimators that directly estimate the underlying template amplitudes. These are unbiased, minimum variance, mask-deconvolved, and account for correlations between templates (including with lensing). Each estimator can be efficiently implemented using spherical harmonic transforms, Monte Carlo methods, and optimization techniques, and asymptotes to standard forms in certain limits. In Paper 2, we implement these estimators in public code, and in Paper 3, use them to constrain primordial trispectra with Planck data. This enables a wide variety of tests of inflation, including some of the first direct constraints on cosmological collider physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05258v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To unlock the vast potential of the CMB trispectrum, we require both robust estimators and efficient computational tools. In this work, we introduce the public code PolySpec: a suite of quartic estimators designed to measure the amplitudes of a wide variety of inflationary templates, including local non-Gaussianity, effective field theory models, direction-dependent trispectra, spinning massive particle exchange, and weak gravitational lensing. PolySpec includes a python/cython implementation of each estimator derived in Paper 1 and has been carefully optimized to ensure efficient use of computational resources. We perform a broad range of validation tests, which demonstrate that the estimator is unbiased and minimum-variance, both in Gaussian and non-Gaussian regimes. In addition, we forecast constraints on various types of trispectra; this highlights the utility of CMB polarization and demonstrates that many models of primordial physics are poorly correlated with the simple templates considered in previous studies. This work lays the foundation for the Planck trispectrum analyses performed in Paper 3.</description>

Abstract: Is there new physics hidden in the four-point function of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)? We conduct a detailed analysis of the Planck PR4 temperature and polarization trispectrum for $\ell\in[2,2048]$. Using the theoretical and computational tools developed in Paper 1 and Paper 2, we search for 33 template amplitudes, encoding a variety of effects from inflationary self-interactions to particle exchange. We find no evidence for primordial non-Gaussianity and set stringent constraints on both phenomenological amplitudes and couplings in the inflationary Lagrangian. Due to the use of optimal estimators and polarization data, our constraints are highly competitive. For example, we find $\sigma(g_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc})=4.8\times 10^4$ and $\tau_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc} &lt;1500$ (95\% CL), a factor of two improvement on Effective Field Theory amplitudes, and a $43\sigma$ detection of gravitational lensing. Many templates are analyzed for the first time, such as direction-dependent trispectra and the collapsed limit of the `cosmological collider', across a range of masses and spins. We perform a variety of validation tests; whilst our results are stable, the most relevant systematics are found to be lensing bias, residual foregrounds, and mismatch between simulations and data. The techniques discussed in this series can be extended to future datasets, allowing the primordial Universe to be probed at even higher sensitivity.</description>
