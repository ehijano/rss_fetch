      <title>Discovery of Isolated, Quenched, and Likely Backsplash Dwarf Galaxies near M101</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I report the discovery of three faint, semi-resolved quiescent dwarf galaxies, two of which are strong backsplash candidates associated with the nearby satellite-sparse spiral M101 (D ~ 6.7 Mpc). The galaxies lie within the magnitude range MV ~ -7.70 to -8.2 and half-light radii rh ~ 110 to 204 pc. Shapiro DG-I (Sha DG-I/MAGE1412+5650) is a concurrently discovered and isolated galaxy. Shapiro DG-II (Sha DG-II) is a fainter dwarf and potential companion to the SMC-mass galaxy NGC 5585 (D ~ 6.84 Mpc). Shapiro DG-III (Sha DG-III) is an isolated dwarf on the edge of the ultra-faint regime. Hydrodynamical simulations suggest a backsplash population of galaxies that have been environmentally stripped by interactions with a host and ejected from the system, though they have not yet been definitively observed in the local universe. Considering their quenched stellar populations, indicated by the lack of coincident GALEX emission, relative distances, and fitting models, the galaxies are consistent with a backsplash origin and are pending follow-up. Analysis is performed to test whether the system's population can be explained by standard cosmology. A potential correlation is found between satellite abundances and halo masses calibrated by tidal indices in a sample of nearby MW-like galaxies, suggesting the importance of environmental density in the formation of dark matter subhaloes, though a larger sample is required. M101's sparse satellite system fits well in the relation and is in agreement with {\Lambda}CDM expectations.</description>

      <title>HELM's deep: Highly Extincted Low-Mass galaxies seen by JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dust content of star-forming galaxies is generally positively correlated with their stellar mass. However, some recent JWST studies have shown the existence of a population of dwarf galaxies with an unexpectedly large dust attenuation. Using the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey (CEERS) data, we identified a sample of 1361 highly extincted low-mass (HELM) galaxies, defined as dwarf galaxies ($M_*&lt;10^{8.5}$) with Av&gt;1mag or more massive galaxies with an exceptionally high dust attenuation given their stellar mass (i.e., $Av&gt;1.6log_{10}(M_*/Mo)-12.6$). The selection is performed using the multiparameter distribution obtained through a comprehensive spectral energy distribution fitting analysis, based on optical to near-infrared data. After excluding possible contaminants, like brown dwarfs, little red dots, high-z (z&gt;8.5) and ultra-high-z (z&gt;15) galaxies, the sample mainly includes sources at z&lt;1, with a tail extending up to z=7.2. The sample has a median stellar mass of $10^7$ Mo and a median dust attenuation of Av=2mag. We analysed the morphology, environment and star-formation rate of these sources to investigate the reason of their large dust attenuation. In particular, HELM sources have sizes (effective radii, Re) similar to non-dusty dwarf galaxies and no correlation is visible between the axis ratios (b/a) and the dust attenuation. This findings indicate that it is unlikely that the large dust attenuation is due to projection effects, but a prolate or a disk-on oblate geometry are still possible, at least for a subsample of the sources. We have found that the distribution of HELM sources is slightly skewed toward more clustered environments than non-dusty dwarfs and tend to be slightly less star forming. This finding, if confirmed by spectroscopic follow-up, indicates that HELM sources could be going through some environmental processes, such as galaxy interactions.</description>

      <title>Void Galaxies and AGN Activity in ZOBOV-identified TNG300 Voids Out to z=3.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study void galaxies in the TNG300 simulation between redshifts $z=3$ and $z=0$. Cosmic void catalogs were constructed using a watershed-based void-finding algorithm, and we define four populations of field galaxies for our investigation: [1] galaxies that are members of a watershed void, [2] galaxies that are located within a radius $r \leq 0.8 R_{\rm eff}$ of the center of a void, [3] galaxies interior to spheres centered on void centers that have underdensity contrasts $&lt;-0.8$, and [4] non-void galaxies. We show that population statistics on void galaxy properties can be recovered from watershed-based void catalogs. Differences between galaxy populations are most pronounced interior to the shell-crossing surface (i.e., population [3]) where densities are intermediate to high. Compared to non-void galaxies at all redshifts, the density controlled galaxies are bluer, smaller, more actively star forming, more massive, and less metal enriched. At redshifts $\geq 1$, these differences are less apparent, likely caused by resolution and selection effects incurred by attempting to define a density-controlled sample from a watershed-based void finding algorithm. Further, we investigate the fraction of galaxies with Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and find that our density controlled population has AGN fractions that are significantly higher than those of non-void galaxy population ($79.8 \pm 0.4$\% higher at $z=0.0$ and $61.5\pm 0.7$\% higher at larger redshifts).</description>

      <title>Doubling NIRSpec/IFS capability to calibrate the single epoch black hole mass relation at high redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of a large population of overmassive black holes (BHs) in the early Universe challenges the validity of the BH-host galaxy coevolution framework. However, the reliability of the estimated BH masses (M$_{BH}$) is being questioned, as these are typically derived using single-epoch (SE) relations calibrated locally. Calibrating SE relations at high redshift would therefore enable more accurate M$_{BH}$ estimates and help identify potential biases. In this work, we release a data-reduction technique for JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations that doubles the effective wavelength coverage, enabling detection of otherwise inaccessible emission. Whenever adjacent dispersers are required, observers should carefully evaluate the tradeoff between integrating longer in the bluer configuration alone versus distributing the exposure time across two dispersers. We apply this pipeline to a sample of 5 quasars at z~2 with M$_{BH}$ independently measured through reverberation mapping (RM). This enables a joint analysis of both H$\beta$ and H$\alpha$; the latter lying beyond the nominal wavelength range. We assess the reliability of the most widely adopted SE calibrations, finding that H$\beta$ yields the closest agreement with RM-based M$_{BH}$ estimates, whereas H$\alpha$-based estimators exhibit a larger scatter. For the least massive BH in our sample ($M_{BH,RM}$~$10^{7.5}M_\odot$), which is accreting at a rate close to the Eddington limit ($\lambda_{Edd}=0.8$), all SE calibrators overestimate M$_{\rm BH, RM}$ by one order of magnitude. This may indicate a systematic overestimation of M$_{BH}$ for highly accreting BHs at high redshift. Finally, we provide the first high-redshift SE calibration based on H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$. Although a larger sample is needed to reduce the uncertainties, our calibration can already be applied to the newly discovered BH population in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>GA-NIFS: the highest-redshift ring galaxy candidate from a head-on collision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collisional ring galaxies are a rare class of interacting systems, making up only ~0.01% of galaxies in the local Universe. Their formation is typically attributed to a head-on collision of a massive galaxy with a compact satellite (intruder), triggering density waves that, propagating outward, produce the characteristic ring morphology. Here, we present the discovery and detailed analysis of GS18660, the most distant ring galaxy known to date, at z=3.08, identified in JWST/NIRSpec IFS observations as part of the GA-NIFS programme. This work aims to characterise the physical and dynamical properties of GS18660 and shed light into the formation of its ring. Specifically, we analyse the ionized gas properties, stellar populations, and gas kinematics of the system, and use the observed geometry to constrain the timescale of the collision. Our analysis is based on NIRSpec IFS data, including low-resolution (R~100) spectroscopy covering ~0.2-1.3um rest-frame, and high-resolution (R~2700) spectroscopy covering 0.4-0.8um rest-frame. Multi-wavelength techniques are applied to derive nebular gas conditions and stellar population properties. Gas kinematic analysis reveals that GS18660 exhibits a rotating disk component with an additional radial expansion velocity of ~200 km/s, consistent with a propagating collisional wave. Nebular line diagnostics indicate intense star formation (SFR ~100 Msun/yr) along the ring and in the nucleus. Stellar population analysis shows that the most recent star formation episode, occurring within the last ~50 Myr, predominantly took place in the ring. We also identify a close companion, the intruder galaxy responsible for the collision, moving away with a relative velocity of ~425 km/s. The evidence strongly favours a collisional origin for the ring in GS18660, though the presence of a recently formed bar (and hence a resonance ring) cannot be completely excluded.</description>

      <title>Sparse by the River: Diverse Environments of z &gt; 3 Massive Quiescent Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-redshift ($z &gt; 3$), massive quiescent galaxies (QGs) offer a significant window into early Universe galaxy formation. Previous works have predicted miscellaneous properties for these quiescents, from an overdensity of neighbors to elevated quenched fractions among such neighbors (i.e. galactic conformity). However, due to a scarcity in highly-resolved deep-field observations until recently, these properties have not been closely examined and pose unresolved questions for galaxy evolution. With new photometric-redshift catalogs from JWST data in the COSMOS-Web field, we present the S$\mathrm{\hat{O}}$NG sample, comprising 171 photometrically selected massive ($\geq10^{10}$ M$_\odot$) QGs with $3\leq$ $z\mathrm{_{phot}}$ $&lt;$ 5. We look for low-mass neighbors around our sample and find substantial populations of star-forming galaxies (SFGs), contrasting the conformity effect at low-$z$. Our QGs also exhibit diverse clustering, from having no neighbors to potentially residing in environments no denser than star-forming equivalents, to being accompanied by SFGs with more stellar mass than the QG itself. Using a geometric method, we also report filamentary signals for 4\% of our sample, suggestive of some QGs' rejuvenation via cold gas accretion. We reapply the analysis on seven spectroscopically confirmed QGs in COSMOS-Web (M$_*$ $\sim$ $10^9-10^{11}$ M$_\odot$) and note similar patterns. Lastly, we report on Saigon, the most distant low-mass quiescent galaxy known to date ($z =$ 4.55, M$_*$ $= 1.33 \times10^9$ M$_\odot$); this spectroscopically confirmed QG resides in a protocluster candidate with 11 SFGs. These results pave new paths towards understanding QG environment, while also signaling an opportune era to examine their evolution with JWST.</description>

      <title>Portrait of a Galaxy on FIRE: Is the $\alpha$-bimodality a natural consequence of inside-out disc growth in a hierarchical formation scenario?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chemical dichotomy in the [$\alpha$/Fe]-[Fe/H] plane is a consequence of the complex processes underlying the formation and evolution of disc galaxies such as observed in the stellar Milky Way disc. We determine what can drive an $\alpha$-bimodality of the disc in a zoom-in hydrodynamical simulated galaxy which has had no major mergers and negligible radial migration. Using a Milky Way-mass galaxy from the FIRE-2 suite of simulations, we analyse gas flows in the disc together with its star formation and merger history, as well as the chemical evolution of the hot corona, to investigate their connection to transitions in the chemo-dynamical structure of the stellar disc and its radial distribution. The simulated galaxy exhibits high and low-$\alpha$ sequences without having experienced major mergers nor significant radial migration. A high-$\alpha$ thick disc forms during the early chaotic clustering phase. Afterwards, as the star formation rate declines, a dip in the stellar number density appears, coinciding with the dilution of the galactic corona by a minor merger, which subsequently halts the rise of [Fe/H] in the disc. Later, accreted gas onto the disc from minor mergers, mildly enhances the star formation rate and generates the low-$\alpha$ sequence in the outer disc, with radial inward flows of this material feeding the low-$\alpha$ inner disc. Furthermore, we find that even at fixed radii, newly formed stars retain a sizable spread in their chemical abundances, reflecting chemical differences between the in-situ and the infalling gas from which they formed, further indicating that instantaneous gas mixing is invalid. Understanding the chemical evolution of stellar discs requires accounting for their accretion merger history and interaction with the surrounding hot corona, as well as the vertical and radial gas flows that redistribute metals within the disc.</description>

      <title>The diffusion coefficient in the Large Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is the largest satellite galaxy of the Milky Way and provides a unique laboratory for high-energy astrophysics and dark matter studies. In this work, we develop an end-to-end numerical description of cosmic-ray transport and the associated non-thermal emission in the LMC, extending the public DRAGON and HERMES codes. Within this framework, we compute the diffuse synchrotron radiation produced by cosmic-ray electrons in the LMC and compare our predictions with observed low-frequency radio maps. Because electron diffusion imprints a characteristic morphology on the radio emission, this comparison allows us to infer the effective average diffusion coefficient in the LMC. We find a diffusion coefficient D0 = (3-6) $\times 10^{28} \; \rm{cm}^2 \; \rm{s}^{-1}$ at 1 GeV, comparable to but slightly larger than values typically inferred for the Milky Way. More generally, this work provides a scalable tool for interpreting non-thermal signals in nearby galaxies and constraining their cosmic-ray transport properties.</description>

      <title>A global view on star formation: The GLOSTAR Galactic plane survey XII. Effelsberg's continuum view and data release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extended radio continuum emission and its linear polarization play a key role in probing large-scale structures of synchrotron and free-free emission in the Milky Way. Despite the existence of many radio continuum surveys, sensitive and high-angular-resolution single-dish surveys of extended radio continuum emission remain scarce. As part of the GLObal view of STAR formation (GLOSTAR) survey, we will also crucially complement the existing data from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) by addressing the missing zero-spacing gap. Within the framework of the GLOSTAR Galactic plane survey, we performed large-scale radio continuum imaging observations toward the Galactic plane in the range $-2^{\circ}&lt; \ell &lt;60^{\circ}$ and $|b|&lt;1.1^{\circ}$, as well as the Cygnus X region with the Effelsberg 100-m radio telescope. We present the Effelsberg continuum survey at 4.89GHz and 6.82GHz including linear polarization with angular resolutions of 145$^{\prime\prime}$ and 106$^{\prime\prime}$, respectively. The survey has been corrected for missing large-scale emission using available low-angular-resolution surveys. Comparison with previous single-dish surveys indicates that our continuum survey represents the highest-quality single-dish data collected to date at this frequency. More than 90\% of the flux density missed by the VLA D-array data is effectively recovered by the Effelsberg continuum survey. The improved sensitivity and angular resolution of our survey enable reliable mapping of Galactic magnetic field structures, with polarization data that are less affected by depolarization than in previous surveys. The GLOSTAR single-dish continuum data will be released publicly, offering a valuable resource for studying extended objects including HII regions, supernova remnants, diffuse interstellar medium, and Galactic structure.

      <title>Dark matter in ALFALFA galaxies: Investigating galaxy-halo connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to investigate the galaxy-halo connection using a large sample of individual galaxies with $\mathrm{H\,I}$ integrated spectra. We determine their dark matter content by applying a dynamical method based on $\mathrm{H\,I}$ line widths measured with the curve-of-growth technique, together with inclination corrections inferred from optical images. We build a sample of 2453 gas-rich predominantly late-type galaxies spanning a stellar mass range of $10^{8.7}M_\odot$ to $10^{11.4}M_\odot$ by matching them one-to-one with their counterparts from the ALFALFA survey and the TNG100 simulation, ensuring a direct match of stellar mass and $\mathrm{H\,I}$ radius. We generate mock images and mock $\mathrm{H\,I}$ integrated spectra for TNG100 galaxies, and apply the same dynamical method to both ALFALFA and TNG100 mock galaxies to infer their dark matter masses. Across all stellar mass bins, ALFALFA galaxies exhibit lower median dark matter masses than the mock TNG100 simulation results. In each bin, this offset is driven by a tail of galaxies with comparatively low dark matter content, which becomes more prominent toward higher stellar masses. In the highest mass bin ($M_* &gt; 10^{11} M_\odot$), late-type ALFALFA galaxies show a median dark matter mass that is 23% lower than that of their counterparts in the TNG100 dark-matter-only simulation, with 32% of ALFALFA galaxies having $M_\mathrm{DM}(&lt;R_\mathrm{HI})&lt;10^{11.5} M_\odot$, compared to 17% in the mock TNG100 sample. These results suggest that a larger fraction of massive late-type galaxies reside in relatively less massive dark matter haloes than predicted by the TNG100 simulation.</description>

      <title>Stellar Morphology of Optically Dark or Faint Galaxies at $z&gt;3$ with</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST offers an unprecedented view of optically dark or faint galaxies (OFGs), previously missed by HST. They are likely massive, heavily dust-obscured star-forming galaxies (SFGs) that substantially contribute to the cosmic SFR density at z &gt; 3. To identify drivers of their high dust attenuation and their role in early universe galaxy evolution, we analyse the stellar morphology of 65 OFGs (from 1892 SFGs at 3&lt;z&lt;4) using NIRCAM/F444W imaging from the PRIMER and CEERS fields. We study correlations between dust attenuation ($A_{v}$) and galaxy properties, like stellar mass, size, and orientation, and compare scaling relations between OFGs and typical SFGs. We find that OFGs are ~8-9 times more massive and ~4 times more dust attenuated than the parent sample. Structurally, OFGs resemble parent SFGs in median $R_e$ and median $\Sigma_{R_e}$ but may be slightly rounder on average. While $A_v$ strongly correlates with stellar mass, it does not show significant dependence on stellar mass-normalised effective radius and stellar mass surface density, S\'ersic index, axis ratio, or SFR surface density. The mass-size and mass-surface density relations place OFGs as a higher-mass extension of SFGs, with no concrete proof of evolutionary differences between them. This suggests that OFGs are heavily dust-obscured primarily due to their high stellar masses, which facilitates dust production and retention, with older stellar populations likely contributing as well. Although some OFGs exhibit high $\Sigma_\mathrm{{R_e}}$ and occupy regions of the mass-size plane similar to quiescent galaxies, the overall sample is not representative of this. Their current structures resemble typical SFGs, with no concrete signs of rapid compaction. Diversity in their physical properties shows that OFGs span a range of evolutionary states with few showing reduced star formation, while most remain actively star-forming.</description>

      <title>Dual-coding contrastive learning based on ConvNeXt and ViT models for morphological classification of galaxies in COSMOS-Web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our previous works, we proposed a machine learning framework named \texttt{USmorph} for efficiently classifying galaxy morphology. In this study, we propose a self-supervised method called contrastive learning to upgrade the unsupervised machine learning (UML) part of the \texttt{USmorph} framework, aiming to improve the efficiency of feature extraction in this step. The upgraded UML method primarily consists of the following three aspects. (1) We employ a Convolutional Autoencoder to denoise galaxy images and the Adaptive Polar Coordinate Transformation to enhance the model's rotational invariance. (2) A pre-trained dual-encoder convolutional neural network based on ConvNeXt and ViT is used to encode the image data, while contrastive learning is then applied to reduce the dimension of the features. (3) We adopt a Bagging-based clustering model to cluster galaxies with similar features into distinct groups. By carefully dividing the redshift bins, we apply this model to the rest-frame optical images of galaxies in the COSMOS-Web field within the redshift range of $0.5 &lt; z &lt; 6.0$. Compared to the previous algorithm, the improved UML method successfully classifies 73\% galaxies. Using the GoogleNet algorithm, we classify the morphology of the remaining 27\% galaxies. To validate the reliability of our updated algorithm, we compared our classification results with other galaxy morphological parameters and found a good consistency with galaxy evolution. Benefiting from its higher efficiency, this updated algorithm is well-suited for application in future China Space Station Telescope missions.</description>

      <title>An updated efficient galaxy morphology classification model based on ConvNeXt encoding with UMAP dimensionality reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an enhanced unsupervised machine learning (UML) module within our previous \texttt{USmorph} classification framework featuring two components: (1) hierarchical feature extraction via a pre-trained ConvNeXt convolutional neural network (CNN) with transfer learning, and (2) nonlinear manifold learning using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for topology-aware dimensionality reduction. This dual-stage design enables efficient knowledge transfer from large-scale visual datasets while preserving morphological pattern geometry through UMAP's neighborhood preservation. We apply the upgraded UML on I-band images of 99,806 COSMOS galaxies at redshift $0.2&lt;z&lt;1.2$ (to ensure rest-frame optical morphology) with $I_{\mathrm{mag}}&lt;25$. The predefined cluster number is optimized to 20 (reduced from 50 in the original framework), achieving significant computational savings. The 20 algorithmically identified clusters are merged into five physical morphology types. About 51\% of galaxies (50,056) were successfully classified. To assess classification effectiveness, we tested morphological parameters for massive galaxies with $M_{*}&gt;10^{9}~M_{\odot}$. Our classification results align well with galaxy evolution theory. This improved algorithm significantly enhances galaxy morphology classification efficiency, making it suitable for large-scale sky surveys such as those planned with the China Space Station Telescope (CSST).</description>

      <title>Robustness Analysis of USmorph: I. Generalization Efficiency of Unsupervised Strategies and Supervised Learning in Galaxy Morphological Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct a systematic robustness analysis of the hybrid machine learning framework \texttt{USmorph}, which integrates unsupervised and supervised learning for galaxy morphological classification. Although \texttt{USmorph} has already been applied to nearly 100,000 $I$-band galaxy images in the COSMOS field ($0.2 &lt; z &lt; 1.2$, $I_{\mathrm{mag}} &lt; 25$), the stability of its core modules has not been quantitatively assessed. Our tests show that the convolutional autoencoder (CAE) achieves the best performance in preserving structural information when adopting an intermediate network depth, $5\times5$ convolutional kernels, and a 40-dimensional latent representation. The adaptive polar coordinate transform (APCT) effectively enhances rotational invariance and improves the robustness of downstream tasks. In the unsupervised stage, a bagging clustering number of $K=50$ provides the optimal trade-off between classification granularity and labeling efficiency. For supervised learning, we employ GoogLeNet, which exhibits stable performance without overfitting. We validate the reliability of the final classifications through two independent tests: (1) the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) visualization reveals clear clustering boundaries in the low-dimensional space; and (2) the morphological classifications are consistent with theoretical expectations of galaxy evolution, with both true and false positives showing unbiased distributions in the parameter space. These results demonstrate the strong robustness of the \texttt{USmorph} algorithm, providing guidance for its future application to the China Space Station Telescope (CSST) mission.</description>

      <title>Spin-filament alignments to unravel galaxy evolution and model intrinsic alignments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By the 2040s, several all-sky surveys will have transformed our view of the large-scale structure. However, one of the major outstanding questions in astrophysics will remain: understanding how galaxies acquire and evolve their angular momentum and how this connects to the cosmic web. Measuring the alignments between galaxy spins and cosmic filaments across cosmic time, and understanding what this reveals about galaxy evolution, requires surveys that also characterise intrinsic alignments, i.e. correlations in galaxy shapes produced by the cosmic web itself rather than by lensing. Intrinsic alignments are a major source of systematic error in weak-lensing measurements of the fundamental parameters of the Universe. Addressing both questions together will necessitate new types of MOS surveys that combine kinematic information with high-completeness redshifts down to at least 24-25mag. To achieve our science goals, we require a new generation of wide-field spectroscopic facilities that can obtain spin-filament alignment measurements for millions of galaxies while simultaneously delivering sub-Mpc resolution of the cosmic web and spatially-resolved kinematics required to map the spin-filament connection at the level of individual galaxies within their local cosmic environment. Such a program would provide a unique legacy survey of galaxies and cosmic structures from kiloparsec to megaparsec scales, establishing ESO's leadership in bridging the physics of galaxy evolution with the systematic-control requirements for Stage-IV cosmological surveys.</description>

      <title>First reverberation mapping of a Bowen-fluorescence line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reverberation mapping (RM) is a powerful tool to determine the extent, structure, and kinematics of the broad-line region (BLR) of active galactic nuclei (AGN). So far, RM of the BLR has only been performed for recombination lines responding to the varying ionizing continuum. We tested whether OI 8446, attributed to Bowen fluorescence driven by Ly$\beta$ pumping, varied on short (day- to week-long) timescales during a 2016 HST/STIS campaign of NGC 4593, and examined how it relates to other emission lines and the ionizing UV continuum. We quantified the variability of OI 8446 by calculating its rms amplitude. We then extracted integrated light curves of OI 8446 and other UV and optical emission lines, and compared them with each other and with the UV continuum light curve using correlation analyses. In addition, we used archival near-infrared spectra to assess the dominant excitation mechanism of OI 8446. We detect, for the first time, variability in OI 8446 on day timescales. The fractional rms amplitude is $\sim 4$% over the 4-week campaign. The OI 8446 light curve reverberates with a delay of $\sim 2.5$ days relative to Ly$\alpha$, used as a proxy for Ly$\beta$, detected at a false-alarm probability of 0.6% (significance of $\sim 2.8\sigma$) under our adopted null hypothesis. It closely tracks H$\alpha$ with only a minor additional delay of $\sim0.3$ days, placing its emission region at essentially the same distance as the Balmer-line weighted BLR. Line ratios indicate that Ly$\beta$ pumping is the dominant excitation mechanism for O I 8446. Our results establish OI 8446 as the first Bowen-fluorescence line reverberation-mapped, responding directly to variations in Ly$\beta$ flux. We propose that in future campaigns targeting AGN with larger BLRs, O I could enable dual-driver RM using both the continuum and the pumping line as drivers.</description>

      <title>The impact of bars on the properties of HII regions in the TIMER survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study we perform a comparative analysis of the properties of the HII regions located in different areas of barred galaxies, with the aim of investigating the impact of bars on the physical properties of the ionised gas. Based on integral field spectroscopy data for 17 barred galaxies covering approximately the central 6x6 kpc, we detect a total of 2200 HII regions, of which 331 are located within the nuclear disc (also known as circumnuclear regions), 661 in the bar region, and 1208 in the disc. Among the physical properties of the HII regions, we explore the O/H and N/O abundances, H$\alpha$ luminosity, dust extinction, electron density, and H$\alpha$ equivalent width. We find clear differences in the properties of the HII regions between the nuclear disc, the bar and the disc, that could be explained by an enhancement in the molecular gas concentration in the central parts driven by bar-induced gas flows. As this gas is channelled towards the galaxy centre, the most extreme values in the analysed properties are found for the circumnuclear HII regions. Unlike the bar strength, galaxy mass does seem to affect the properties of the HII regions, with massive galaxies presenting higher values in most of the properties, possibly due to the increased amount of gas in these systems. This study provides evidence that the bar-driven redistribution of material within the galaxy inner parts causes significant differences in the HII region properties depending on their location within the galaxies.</description>

      <title>The longest known tails of ram-pressure stripped star-forming galaxies are caused by an ICM shock in Abell 1367</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The environment plays an important role in shaping the evolution of cluster galaxies through mechanisms such as ram pressure stripping (RPS), whose effect may be enhanced in merging clusters. We investigate a complex of three galaxies UGC 6697, CGCG 097-073 and CGCG 097-079, that are currently undergoing extreme RPS, as evident from their multi-wavelength-detected tails. The galaxies are members of the nearby ($d=92$ Mpc) merging cluster Abell 1367 and are located in proximity to an intracluster medium (ICM) shock that is traced by X-ray observations and the presence of a radio relic. We analyze LOFAR and MeerKAT observations at frequencies of 54, 144, 817 and 1270 MHz to perform a detailed spectral analysis of the tails. We find that all three tails are significantly more extended than in previous radio studies, with lengths $\geq70$ kpc. For UGC 6697, we detected a tail of 300 kpc, making it the longest known RPS tail of a star-forming galaxy at any wavelength. The length and spectral variations of the tail cannot be explained purely by the spectral aging of stripped cosmic rays. We construct a model of the tail that includes compression and re-acceleration due to the encounter with the nearby ICM shock, which can plausibly account for the extreme RPS as well as the length and spectral variation of the tail. We further discover a radio plume at the leading edge of UGC 6697 that connects to a narrow filament. These sources exhibit extremely steep ($\alpha\approx-1.7$) and highly curved spectra. We speculate that this emission arises from cosmic rays re-energized by UGC 6697's rapid infall which propagate along magnetic filaments in the cluster center. Our findings represent direct evidence of a cluster merger shock impacting the evolution of member galaxies. Furthermore, we report the first tentative detection of particle acceleration at the leading edge of an infalling galaxy.</description>

      <title>The Milky Way in motion: gauging stellar trajectories that shape the Galactic thin disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As stars traverse the Milky Way, their orbits evolve through perturbations that alter their orbital radii. These changes arise from two mechanisms: churning, which modifies angular momentum, and blurring, which induces eccentric orbits without major angular momentum change. To assess whether churning or blurring dominates the dynamical evolution of Gaia-ESO stars, we refine Galactic chemical-evolution models by constructing finer grids that span a wider age range. Using a generalised additive model (GAM), we estimate stellar birth radii beyond the limits of binned metallicity models and compare them with dynamical parameters derived from Gaia parallaxes and proper motions, and Galpy. Our metallicity-stratified sample, grouped through hierarchical clustering of 21 chemical abundances, reveals clear migratory signatures: metal-rich stars formed in the inner disc preferentially move outwards, while more metal-poor stars formed at larger radii tend to migrate inwards. About 75% of stars show signs of churning, while the remainder are largely undisturbed or shaped by blurring. These patterns vary among chemical groups, likely reflecting interactions with the Galactic bar and spiral arms.</description>

      <title>The Galactic White Dwarf Population</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ESA Gaia mission has revolutionized our understanding of the white dwarf population, delivering an unprecedented census of these nearby remnants and revealing previously unseen structures in the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram. However, while Gaia has expanded the scope of white dwarf astrophysics, it has also exposed new questions related to atmospheric composition, spectral evolution, crystallization, magnetism, and merger-driven pathways. Many of these open problems are encoded in the detailed morphology of the Gaia HR diagram, where precise spectroscopic characterization is essential for interpreting the underlying physical processes. Spectroscopic characterization, obtainable with current and future ESO facilities, can provide the effective temperatures and surface gravities that are required to derive accurate white dwarf masses, cooling ages, and luminosities. These fundamental parameters not only enable studies of spectral evolution, interior physics, and the origin of magnetic and high-mass white dwarfs, but also guarantee the construction of robust mass distributions and luminosity functions, essential for constraining the initial-to-final mass relation, probing the initial mass function, and reconstructing the star formation history of the local Galaxy, among other applications. Looking toward the 2040s, future multi-fiber spectrographs operating in survey mode on 10--15 meter class telescopes will be able to collect a complete spectroscopic sample of white dwarf, enabling the detailed characterization of their population. Achieving spectroscopic completeness for the nearby Galactic population and securing high signal-to-noise, moderate-to-high resolution spectra across the HR diagram with ESO instrumentation will be critical steps toward resolving these longstanding questions in white dwarf astrophysics.</description>

      <title>White Dwarfs in Wide Binary Systems as Reliable Age Calibrators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deriving precise stellar ages is a challenging task. Consequently, age-dependent relations - such as the age-metallicity and age-velocity dispersion relations of the Milky Way, or the age-rotation-activity relation of low-mass stars - are subject to potentially large uncertainties, despite the well-defined trends observed at the population level. White dwarfs, the most common stellar remnants, follow a relatively simple and well-understood cooling process. When found in wide binary systems with main-sequence companions, they can therefore provide the much-needed precise age estimates. The total age of such systems depends not only on the white dwarf cooling time but also on the lifetime of the main-sequence progenitor. Estimating this lifetime requires knowledge of the progenitor mass, which is typically inferred by adopting an initial-to-final mass relation. However, the observational constraints on this relation are still poorly defined, introducing a source of uncertainty in white dwarf age determinations. To mitigate this issue, we focus on a large sample of massive white dwarfs (&gt;~0.7 Msun), for which the main-sequence progenitor lifetime is negligible. These white dwarfs are intrinsically faint and therefore require specialized facilities for adequate follow-up observations. In this white paper, we outline the instrumentation requirements needed to observe the forthcoming population of massive white dwarfs in our Galaxy.</description>

Abstract: Contrary to popular belief, the interstellar medium (ISM) is not empty; it is filled with atoms, dust particles, and molecules. Some of these molecules may have been the very building blocks of life that, delivered to Earth via comets and meteorites, could have given rise to Life itself. A large-area single-dish telescope with superb sensitivity, field-of-view and multi-band instruments will allow us to explore the limits of chemical complexity in the interstellar medium, across our Galaxy and in external galaxies, determining whether amino acids, sugars, or RNA/DNA nucleobases can form in space.</description>

      <title>Achromatic, spin-odd Kerr EVPA as a null Frenet--Serret torsion integral on the photon ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the achromatic gravitational imprint that Kerr spacetime leaves on linear polarization at the photon ring. Recasting parallel transport in a null Frenet--Serret frame yields a single scalar evolution law for the electric-vector position angle. On the observer's screen, the Kerr-minus-Schwarzschild pattern on the direct critical curve is nonzero, strictly odd under spin reversal after a half-turn azimuth relabelling, and tightly confined to a thin annulus. Using backward-shot, Carter-separated geodesics with midpoint RK2 transport, we achieve second-order convergence and degree-scale amplitudes that grow monotonically with spin and inclination (RMS $\simeq 0.5$--$2^\circ$ for $a/M\gtrsim 0.8$, $i\gtrsim 60^\circ$). Three independent constructions -- Frenet--Serret line integral, explicit Levi--Civita transport of the polarization vector, and the phase of the Walker--Penrose constant -- agree ray by ray. We then define a parity-odd ring estimator that is intrinsically achromatic after standard wavelength-squared regression, symmetry-protected against common even-parity systematics, and compressed into low azimuthal modes. This yields a minimal two-parameter template (spin and inclination) for mm/sub-mm polarimetry of horizon-scale rings in sources such as M87$^\ast$ and Sgr~A$^\ast$. The pipeline enables either a detection of the strong-field parallel-transport phase induced by frame dragging or informative upper limits.</description>

      <title>Sub-millimeter wavelength protostellar accretion rate monitoring with AtLAST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How a star forms is a fundamental question in astrophysics. In the earliest stages of protostellar evolution high extinction prevents a direct study of the accretion processes and their temporal evolution. Monitoring the variations of the accretion luminosity in a large protostar sample over decades is needed to reveal how protostars accrete -- in major bursts or in a quasi-steady fashion. We here argue that a large ground based sub-millimeter single-dish facility with a wide FoV is required to fulfill this task.</description>

      <title>Why the Northern Hemisphere Needs a 30-40m Telescope and the Science at Stake: Shaping Galaxies and Their Stars with Stellar Population Gradients, IMF Variations and Environmental Drivers in Cluster Early-Type Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This white paper highlights how stellar population gradients, chemical abundance patterns, stellar initial mass function (IMF) variations, and structural signatures in early-type galaxies (ETGs), measured at faint and large galactocentric radii, out to $\sim4R_e$, provide powerful diagnostics of their formation and evolutionary histories. These observables encode the combined effects of early dissipative star formation, subsequent accretion and mergers, and internal feedback processes. Achieving such measurements requires high-signal-to-noise, spatially resolved U-band--optical--near-IR spectroscopy at large radii, with enough spatial resolution to study the variation of these properties on $\sim$kpc scales. These capabilities can only be delivered by a 30\,m-class telescope. Disentangling these internal processes from environmental influences further demands observations of galaxies across clusters spanning a wide range of evolutionary stages and local environments. The nearby Virgo, Perseus, and Coma clusters, without any comparable nearby counterparts in the Southern Hemisphere, offer ideal laboratories for this work. Such observations will place stringent constraints on the formation mechanism of ETGs, connecting local cluster ETGs to their high-redshift progenitors. This white paper outlines several key science cases enabled by such a facility: (1) mapping stellar population gradients across environments; (2) tracing IMF variations as a function of evolutionary stage and environment; (3) reconstructing the three-dimensional structure of galaxies through deep integral-field spectroscopy and imaging; and (4) identifying and studying compact and relic systems as progenitors of present-day ETGs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Full sky coverage with 30-40 meter-class telescopes is essential to answer fundamental questions in Astrophysics, Cosmology, and Physics, such as the composition of the Universe and the formation of the first stars and supermassive black holes. An ELT/TMT-like telescope in the Northern Hemisphere is a fundamental and necessary facility to provide multiplexing of observing power, diversity of instrumentation, rapid response, and statistical power required to address the questions and the problems, current and future, unveiled by full sky observatories such as JWST, Euclid, or Roman space telescopes. The Northern ELT/TMT will expedite the study of unique, extreme, rare, transient, and/or high-energy events which will give the most information about fundamental Physics problems in the era of multi-messenger and time-domain Astronomy.</description>

      <title>Why the Northern Hemisphere Needs a 30-40m Telescope and the Science at Stake: Ultra-Low-Mass Dwarf Galaxies Across the Boreal Cosmic Web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dwarf galaxies dominate the galaxy population in the nearby Universe and occupy the regime where feedback, reionization, and environment exert their strongest influence on galaxy formation. Despite their importance, detailed spectroscopic constraints on the faintest dwarfs are currently limited to a handful of systems in the Local Volume, leaving the role of large-scale environment essentially unexplored at ultra-low stellar masses. A northern 30-40m class telescope equipped with a multiplexed optical integral-field spectrograph will enable a systematic, spatially resolved spectroscopic census of dwarf galaxies with $M_\star \sim 10^{5}-10^{7} M_\odot$ across a wide range of environments. A deep survey of the Coma Cluster, combined with targeted observations of dwarfs in clusters, groups, filaments, and low-density regions, will map star formation histories, chemical enrichment, and internal kinematics at unprecedented depth. This program will directly test models of dark-matter physics, early-Universe feedback, and environmental quenching in the lowest-mass galaxies, establishing dwarf galaxies as precision probes of both galaxy formation and fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Why the Northern Hemisphere Needs a 30-40 m Telescope and the Science at Stake: A Low Surface Brightness Science Case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Extragalactic Low Surface Brightness (LSB, $\mu_V\gtrsim 27$ mag/arcsec$^2$) Universe represents a crucial, yet largely unseen, frontier in modern astrophysics. This faint realm holds the keys to completing our understanding of galaxy evolution, hierarchical assembly, and even the fundamental nature of dark matter. Our current theoretical models are inherently incomplete, largely mirroring the properties of the brightest, most easily observed objects. To overcome this critical bias and unlock the secrets of this realm, a transformative leap in observational capability is required. A 30 to 40m class telescope, leveraging unprecedented sensitivity and spatial resolution, especially with adaptive optics, is the essential tool to fundamentally probe these faint, low-density stellar regimes. This white paper details the transformative LSB science that such a facility, strategically positioned in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) to access crucial nearby structures and rich environments, can achieve.</description>

      <title>Why the Northern Hemisphere Needs a 30-40m Telescope and the Science at Stake: from Interstellar Visitors to Planetary Defence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small Solar system Objects (SSOs) preserve the physical, chemical, and dynamical signatures of the Sun's protoplanetary disk. Upcoming surveys will discover vast numbers of new objects, yet their scientific value will depend on follow-up observations requiring far greater sensitivity and resolution than those currently available. A 30-m class telescope like the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) will be transformative, but its Southern location will leave significant regions of the sky poorly covered or even non accessible. A Northern 30-40m telescope is therefore essential to achieve full-sky coverage and fully exploit the small body discoveries of the 2030-2050 era, in particular for targets of opportunity or unexpected discoveries, like those of interstellar objects and potentially hazardous asteroids, as well as for distant trans-Neptunian objects and space mission targets.</description>

      <title>Why the Northern Hemisphere Needs a 30-40 m Telescope and the Science at Stake: Mapping formation pathways of nuclear star clusters across galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nuclear star clusters (NSCs) are dense, compact stellar systems only a few parsecs across, located at galaxy centers. Their small sizes make them difficult to resolve spatially. NSCs often coexist with massive black holes, and both trace the dynamical state and evolution of their host galaxies. Dense stellar environments such as NSCs are also ideal sites for forming intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). To date, spatially resolved NSC properties, crucial for reconstructing dynamical and star-formation histories, have only been obtained for galaxies within 5 Mpc, using the highest-resolution instruments on the current class of very large telescopes. This severely limits spectroscopic studies, and a systematic, unbiased survey has never been accomplished. Because the vast majority of known NSCs are located in the Northern Hemisphere, only a 30-m-class telescope in the North can provide the statistical power needed to study their physical properties and measure the mass of coexisting central black holes. We propose leveraging the capabilities of a 30-m-class Northern telescope to obtain the first comprehensive, spatially resolved survey of NSCs, finally allowing us to unveil their formation pathways and their yet unknown connection with central massive black holes.</description>

      <title>Science Enabled by a 30-Meter-Class Telescope in the Northern Hemisphere: Massive Stars at Low Metallicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive stars are at the core of our observations of the Universe up to the reionization epoch, both through their intense ionizing fluxes and through the energetic end products that release fresh elements into the interstellar medium. Our interpretation of very high redshift galaxies and transient phenomena depends on knowledge derived from massive star populations in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies, with characteristics that only remotely resemble the conditions in the early Universe. However, the models supporting these interpretations have been tested in a narrow range of environments and carry significant uncertainties when extrapolated. Advancing in our understanding of the Universe beyond the Local Volume therefore requires extending massive star studies to conditions representative of the early Universe. The next generation of telescopes has the potential to accomplish this goal.</description>

      <title>Why the Northern Hemisphere Needs a 30-40 m Telescope and the Science at Stake: Resolved Stellar Populations Studies in M31 and its Satellites</title>

Abstract: A 30 m class optical/near-IR telescope in the Northern Hemisphere, equipped for diffraction-limited imaging and high-resolution, multi-object spectroscopy of faint stars, would enable a transformational investigation of the formation and evolution of M31 and its satellite system - on par with what Gaia, the HST, and other major photometric and spectroscopic facilities have achieved for the Milky Way (MW) and its satellites. The unprecedented detail obtained for our home system has reshaped our understanding of the assembly of the MW disk, halo, and bulge, and that of its satellites, which now serve as a benchmark for galaxy formation and evolution models. Extending this level of insight to the M31 system - that of the nearest massive spiral and the only one for which such a comprehensive, resolved stellar population study is feasible - will allow us to address a fundamental question: how representative is the MW and its satellite system within the broader context of galaxy evolution?</description>

      <title>Why the Northern Hemisphere Needs a 30-40 m Telescope and the Science at Stake: Galactic Archaeology from the Northern Sky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By the 2040s--50s, facilities such as \emph{Gaia}, WEAVE, 4MOST, Rubin, \emph{Euclid}, \emph{Roman}, and the ESO ELT will have transformed our global view of the Milky Way. Yet key questions will remain incompletely resolved: a detailed reconstruction of the Galaxy's assembly from its earliest building blocks, and robust tests of dark matter granularity using the fine structure of the stellar halo and outer disk -- particularly in the Galactic anticenter. Addressing these questions requires high-resolution spectroscopy of faint main-sequence stars (typically 1--2 mag below the turnoff) and turnoff stars ($r \sim 21$--23) in low-surface-brightness structures: halo streams and shells, ultra-faint dwarf galaxies, the warped and flared outer disk, and anticenter substructures. We argue that addressing this science case requires a 30\,m-class telescope in the northern hemisphere, equipped with wide-field, highly multiplexed, high-resolution spectroscopic capabilities. Such a facility would enable (i) a Northern Halo Deep Survey of $\sim 10^{5}$--$10^{6}$ faint main-sequence and turnoff stars out to $\sim 150$--200\,kpc, (ii) chemodynamical mapping of dozens of streams to measure perturbations from dark matter subhalos, and (iii) tomographic studies of the anticenter and outer disk to disentangle perturbed disk material from accreted debris. A northern 30\,m telescope would provide the essential complement to ESO's southern ELT, enabling genuinely all-sky Milky Way archaeology and delivering stringent constraints on the small-scale structure of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Why the Northern Hemisphere Needs a 30-40 m Telescope and the Science at Stake: Northern Local Star-forming Dwarf Galaxies. Analogues of the First Galaxies and Probes of the Cosmic Metallicity Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Star-forming dwarf galaxies in the local Universe, especially extremely metal-poor ones, can be considered analogous to early galaxies of the Epoch of Reionization (z &gt;= 6). Currently available telescopes cannot adequately detect and measure heavy element recombination lines and certain faint collisionally excited lines, which are essential for exploring the effects and biases that potential inhomogeneities in electron temperature and density of the ionized gas may have on determining the chemical composition of these galaxies. On the other hand, the origin of very high-ionization lines (e.g. He II, [Ne V], C IV]) measured in the spectra of an important fraction of these objects remains unknown and a challenge to current stellar models, suggesting the presence of Population III-like stars and/or the existence of non-conventional ionizing sources. Obtaining very deep spectra for a selected sample of local star-forming dwarf galaxies would provide unprecedented constraints on their nature, ionization and true chemical abundances, and could change the metallicity scale we assume to understand the chemical evolution of galaxies over cosmic time.</description>

      <title>Why the northern hemisphere needs a 30-40 m telescope and the science at stake: Massive stars in spiral galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This document discusses the three main lines expected to dominate massive-star research in the 2040s, namely: (1) The role of metallicity in stellar evolution, especially in determining the end products such as gravitational-wave progenitors. (2) The initial mass function from the most massive stars to substellar objects. (3) The role of the environment in the different modes of star formation from compact star clusters to born-this-way associations and from massive clusters to small stellar groups. More specifically, we present the contributions to such science that would be enabled by a 30~m type telescope in the northern hemisphere studying spiral galaxies. Those can be grouped in three: our own Galaxy, the Milky Way; the other two spiral galaxies in the Local Group, M31 and M33; and other galaxies within 25 Mpc, such as M101, M51, and NGC~6946. This work is based on the fact that, as of today, no construction of a 30~m telescope has yet started in the northern hemisphere, so even in the best case scenario of such a hypothetical telescope, its full operation would not start until the late 2030s or early 2040s. It makes no assumptions about its location but supposes an instrumentation development similar to that of ELT.</description>

      <title>Super-Eddington Chimneys: On the Cooling Evolution of Tidal Disruption Event Envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of a compact accretion disk following a tidal disruption event (TDE) requires that the shocked stellar debris cool efficiently as it settles toward the black hole. While recent simulations suggest that stream dissipation occurs rapidly, how the weakly bound debris subsequently loses its thermal energy to assemble a compact disk near the circularization radius remains uncertain. We investigate this cooling process using axisymmetric radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of quasi-hydrostatic 'TDE envelopes', initialized with the total mass, angular momentum, and binding energy expected from a complete stellar disruption. The envelopes, supported by radiation pressure on large scales and rotation near the circularization radius, evolve through a combination of radiative diffusion, turbulent mixing, and polar outflows. In our fiducial model, a quasi-steady state is achieved in which a polar outflow radiates and expels matter at several times the Eddington luminosity. This enables the envelope to cool and contract, forming a dense, rotationally supported ring near the circularization radius, but on a timescale roughly ten times shorter than the naive photon-diffusion timescale. Comparative models without radiation transport confirm that cooling, not purely adiabatic evolution, is essential to driving this rapid inflow. Nevertheless, across a range of envelope masses, the effective envelope cooling time scales only weakly with its optical depth, implying that advective and wind-driven energy transport dominate over diffusion. Our results demonstrate the cooling-induced contraction, even absent viscosity and associated black hole accretion, can produce luminosities and large photosphere radii consistent with early UV/optical TDE emission. However, more quantitative light-curve predictions must incorporate self-consistent formation and feeding of the envelope by fall-back accretion.</description>

      <title>Constraining Fifth Forces using the Local Distance Ladder: Implications for the Hubble Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the local distance ladder measurement of the Hubble constant in models where gravity is modified by a fifth force, an additional long-range interaction. In many such theories the force is screened; suppressed in dense environments but potentially active in galaxies used for distance calibration. We model this environmental dependence using three quantities that characterize each galaxy's large-scale gravitational environment: the external gravitational potential $\Phi$, acceleration $a$, and curvature $K$. Our baseline analysis recalibrates the SH0ES-team's Cepheid-supernova distance ladder, incorporating the fifth force via its impact on the Cepheid period-luminosity relation. Across models, a fifth force is strongly constrained, with posteriors concentrated around a null result. The inferred Hubble constant is $H_0 = 73.1 \pm 1.0 \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$, retaining the Hubble tension at $&gt;5 \, \sigma$. As an additional test, we incorporate four independent Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) distance datasets into a joint Cepheid-TRGB-supernova calibration. These combined analyses further constrain the magnitude of fifth-force effects. Taken together, our results show that, across the class of screened fifth-force models we analyze, the calibration of the local distance ladder remains essentially unchanged, leaving the Hubble tension intact.</description>

      <title>Skykatana: a scalable framework to construct sky masks for the Vera Rubin Observatory and large astronomical surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern wide-field surveys require robust spatial masks to excise bright-star halos, bleed trails, poor-quality regions, and user-defined geometry at scale. We present Skykatana, an open source pipeline that builds and combines boolean HEALPix/HEALSparse maps into science-ready masks and engineered for low-memory operation. Skykatana can efficiently construct, visualize multi-order coverage maps and generate random points in high-resolution masks over half of the celestial sphere with very limited resources and leveraging the hierarchical partition of data the HATS/LSDB framework. We demonstrate two end-to-end applications: (1) a Subaru HSC-WISE composite mask; and (2) Rubin star masks generated on demand in the Rubin Science Platform by querying HATS/LSDB Gaia data and assigning radii from empirical fits to Rubin DP1 data. We release full bright-star masks for various regions of the Rubin footprint and describe performance and scaling. The code, documentation, and examples are publicly available at https://github.com/samotracio/skykatana, and the LSST masks can be obtained from https://osf.io/r5vw6</description>

      <title>BASILISK IV. No $S_8$ Tension with Satellite Kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel technique to probe the $S_8$ tension, using information from the smallest scales of galaxy redshift survey data. Specifically, we use Basilisk, a Bayesian hierarchical tool for forward modeling the kinematics and abundance of satellite galaxies extracted from spectroscopic data, to first constrain the galaxy-halo connection precisely and accurately. We then demand self-consistency in that the galaxy-halo connection predicts the correct galaxy luminosity function, which constrains the halo mass function and thereby cosmology. Crucially, the method accounts for baryonic effects and is free of halo assembly bias issues. We validate the method against realistic SDSS-like mock data, demonstrating unbiased recovery of the input cosmology. Applying it to the SDSS-DR7, we infer that $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.324 \pm 0.012$, $\sigma_8 = 0.775 \pm 0.063$ and $S_8 \equiv \sigma_8 \sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3} = 0.81 \pm 0.05$, in perfect agreement with the cosmic microwave background constraints from Planck. The most stringent constraint is with regard to the parameter combination $\sigma_8 (\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3)^2$, which we infer to be $0.91 \pm 0.05$. Hence, unlike many low-redshift analyses of large-scale structure data, we find no indication of $S_8$ tension. We demonstrate that these results are robust to reasonable variation in the implementation of baryonification used to model the host halo's gravitational potentials in response to baryonic processes. We also highlight the importance of correctly modeling the satellite radial profile in any analysis involving small-scale information. Finally, we underscore the hidden potential of this methodology for constraining baryonic physics using data from ongoing and upcoming surveys.</description>

      <title>ALMA Band 7 Observations of Water Lines in the Protoplanetary Disk of V883 Ori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The FU Orionis star V883 Ori provides a unique opportunity to probe the water snowline in a protoplanetary disk. During an accretion burst, the enhanced stellar luminosity heats the disk, sublimating ices and bringing volatile species into the gas-phase. The water snowline, located at $\sim$80 au in the midplane, represents a key boundary for dust growth and volatile delivery to forming planets. We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Band 7 observations of V883 Ori that detect two targeted water isotopologue transitions: para-H$_2$$^{18}$O $5_{1,5}$-$4_{2,2}$ at 322 GHz and HDO $3_{3,1}$-$4_{2,2}$ at 335 GHz. After correcting for Keplerian rotation, we detect HDO and H$_2$$^{18}$O at 23.6$\sigma$ and 9.3$\sigma$, respectively. Rotational-diagram analysis using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach yields $T_\mathrm{rot}=116.89\pm12.81$ K and $N=(4.90\pm1.69)\times10^{15}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ for H$_2$$^{18}$O, and $T_\mathrm{rot}=87.46\pm4.95$ K and $N=(4.47\pm0.62)\times10^{15}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ for HDO. These results imply water vapor abundances of $N_{\mathrm{H_2O}}/N_{\mathrm{H_2}}\sim3\times10^{-7}$-$5\times10^{-6}$ and an HDO/H$_2$O ratio of $(0.4$-$2.0)\times10^{-3}$ just inside the water snowline, broadly consistent with inheritance from protostellar envelopes. The HDO line in Band 7 is significantly weaker than predicted from Band 6 extrapolation, showing only $\sim$26% of the expected strength. This attenuation can be explained by a more compact, hotter emitting region with an effective radius of $\sim$53 au and/or frequency-dependent dust absorption that enlarges the apparent inner cavity at higher frequency. Our results highlight both the diagnostic power of water isotopologue lines and the need for higher angular resolution observations to resolve the water snowline and test these scenarios.</description>

      <title>Time Evolution of Optical Darkness in GRB Afterglow: The Case of GRB 240825A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are believed to occur in star-forming regions. The multiwavelength follow-up observations of the early afterglow of GRB 240825A provided insights into the evolution of the optical-to-X-ray spectral feature of the afterglow. We comprehensively investigate the evolution of X-ray spectral properties through time-resolved spectral analysis and calculate optical darkness ($\beta_\mathrm{OX}$) to reveal the physical properties of the afterglow. The X-ray-to-optical SEDs of afterglow in different time intervals are fitted to derive the extinction curves. The $\beta_\mathrm{OX}$ exhibits a trend of decreasing and then increasing, reaching its minimum value at $\sim1000\mathrm{\,s}$ post-trigger. However, at 11 hours post-trigger, $\beta_\mathrm{OX}$ does not meet the criteria for an optically dark burst. The extinction curves in different time intervals indicate that GRB 240825A occurred in a dust-obscured environment.</description>

      <title>A Characterization of JWST MIRI Detector Persistence and Implications for High-Contrast Imaging</title>

Abstract: The JWST MIRI detector exhibits a flux deficit persistence, but its timescales and impacts remain largely uncharacterized, particularly at the longest imaging wavelengths. In this study, we analyze full-field MIRI imager observations at 21 $\mu$m (F2100W) to quantify detector persistence following a saturation event by a bright (K = 5.65 mag) nearby (8.12 $\pm$ 0.04 pc) mid M-dwarf star, IRAS 21500+5903. Unlike typical persistence that appears as excess flux, this effect presents as a flux deficit in pixels previously illuminated by the saturating or near saturating source. We measure persistence at two post-saturation epochs: shortly after saturation (11.6 minutes) and an hour later (1.39 hours). Immediately after the saturation event, we detect a persistence level of $1.69 \pm 0.10$%. By fitting a Bayesian exponential decay model to the two epochs, we estimate that persistence decreases to one-tenth of its initial value after $5.16^{+1.49}_{-0.94}$ hours. We examine the implications of persistence for MIRI high-contrast imaging using the imager (not coronagraphy). Specifically, we discuss how MIRI detector persistence can produce false-positive exoplanet signals in direct imaging surveys, as well as degrade PSF subtraction, particularly at small inner working angles. We also outline mitigation strategies to avoid these impacts in future observations.</description>

      <title>Extensive Observational Evidence for Massive Star Stellar Wind Variability at Low Metallicities: implications for mass-loss rate determination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mass-loss from massive stars is fundamental to stellar and galactic evolution and enrichment of the interstellar medium. Reliable determination of mass-loss rate is dependent upon unravelling details of massive star outflows, including optical depth structure of the stellar wind. That parameter introduces significant uncertainty due to the nearly ubiquitous presence of large-scale optically thick wind structure. We utilize suitable available ultraviolet spectra of 20 Large and Small Magellanic Cloud (LMC, SMC) OB stars to extend existing Galactic results quantifying uncertainty inherent in individual observations to lower metallicity environments. This is achieved by measuring standard deviations of mean optical depths of multiple observations of suitable wind-formed absorption profiles as a proportion of their mean optical depths. We confirm earlier findings that wind structure is prevalent at low metallicities and demonstrate that quantifying the consequent uncertainty is to some extent possible, despite the near-complete absence of time series UV spectroscopic observations in those environments. We find that the uncertainty inherent in any single observation of stellar wind optical depth at low metallicity is of similar magnitude to that already identified at Galactic metallicity (up to 45% for cooler OB stars). We further demonstrate how the effect of varying narrow absorption components in wind-formed UV spectral profiles is unlikely to be properly accounted for in existing mass-loss models. We present further evidence of a binary companion to the SMC O-type giant star AzV 75. The importance of obtaining high cadence multi-epoch, or genuine time series, UV spectroscopic observations at low metallicities is highlighted.</description>

      <title>Towards ALMA2040: An update from the European community and invitation to contribute</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the last 15 years, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) has revolutionized astrophysics by providing unprecedented resolution and sensitivity in observing the cold universe, including the formation of stars, planets, and galaxies. With groundbreaking discoveries ranging from the first detailed images of protoplanetary disks to the kinematics of galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization, ALMA has showcased the vast discovery potential of the (sub-)mm wavelength regime. However, in another 15 years from now--in the 2040s--the science landscape will have changed dramatically as new major observational facilities will have started their operations or have come towards advanced maturity in their scientific outcome (e.g., JWST, Rubin Observatory, ELT, Euclid, Gaia, Plato, Ariel, Roman Space Telescope, SPHEREx, LiteBIRD, LISA, SKA and others). At the same time, ALMA's current Wideband Sensitivity Upgrade will have been in place for ~10 years, and ALMA itself will have been operational for 30 years. To fully exploit this era, the community needs a next-generation facility operating at (sub-)mm wavelengths with capabilities far beyond those possible within ALMA's current infrastructure.
  To this end, ALMA2040 is a community-driven initiative to define the key scientific questions of the 2040s and translate them into a technical vision for a next-generation transformational (sub-)millimeter facility. Our goal with this document is to summarize the current status of the effort, synthesize outcomes from the 2025 workshops, outline next steps toward a reference design concept, and invite broad participation from the global mm/sub-mm community to help shape this future facility.
  In the following we provide details on the process and scope. We invite everyone who wishes to join the effort and/or contribute to the dedicated White Papers planned for 2026.</description>

      <title>Overview of the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES)</title>

Abstract: We present an overview of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES), an ambitious program of infrared imaging and spectroscopy in the GOODS-S and GOODS-N deep fields, designed to study galaxy evolution from high redshift to cosmic noon. JADES uses about 770 hours of Cycle 1 guaranteed time largely from the Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) instrument teams. In GOODS-S, in and around the Hubble Ultra Deep Field and Chandra Deep Field South, JADES produces a deep imaging region of ~42 arcmin^2 with over 100 hrs of exposure time spread over 9 NIRCam filters, including two medium-band filters. This is extended at medium depth in GOODS-S and GOODS-N with NIRCam imaging of ~167 arcmin^2, averaging 25 hrs of exposure over 8-10 filters. In both fields, we conduct extensive NIRSpec multi-object spectroscopy, including 2 deep pointings of 55 hrs exposure time, 14 medium pointings of ~12 hrs, and 15 shallower pointings of ~4 hrs, targeting over 5000 HST and JWST-detected faint sources with 5 low, medium, and high-resolution dispersers covering 0.6-5.3 um. Finally, JADES extends redward via coordinated parallels with the JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI), featuring ~10 arcmin^2 with 43 hours of exposure at 7.7 um and thrice that area with 1.4-6.8 hours of exposure at 12.8 um and 15 um. For nearly 30 years, the GOODS-S and GOODS-N fields have been developed as the premier deep fields on the sky; JADES is now providing a compelling start on the JWST legacy in these fields.</description>

      <title>Rapid formation of a very massive star &gt;50000 $M_\odot$ and subsequently an IMBH from runaway collisions. Direct N-body and Monte Carlo simulations of dense star clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. We present simulations of a massive young star cluster using \textsc{Nbody6++GPU} and \textsc{MOCCA}. The cluster is initially more compact than previously published models, with one million stars, a total mass of $5.86 \times 10^5~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, and a half-mass radius of $0.1~\mathrm{pc}$.
  Aims. We analyse the formation and growth of a very massive star (VMS) through successive stellar collisions and investigate the subsequent formation of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) in the core of a dense star cluster.
  Methods. We use both direct \textit{N}-body and Monte Carlo simulations, incorporating updated stellar evolution prescriptions (SSE/BSE) tailored to massive stars and VMSs. These include revised treatments of stellar radii, rejuvenation, and mass loss during collisions. While the prescriptions represent reasonable extrapolations into the VMS regime, the internal structure and thermal state of VMSs formed through stellar collisions remain uncertain, and future work may require further refinement.
  Results. We find that runaway stellar collisions in the cluster core produce a VMS exceeding $5 \times 10^4~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ within 5 Myr, which subsequently collapses into an IMBH.
  Conclusions. Our model suggests that dense stellar environments may enable the formation of very massive stars and massive black hole seeds through runaway stellar collisions. These results provide a potential pathway for early black hole growth in star clusters and offer theoretical context for interpreting recent JWST observations of young, compact clusters at high redshift.</description>

      <title>The Milky Way in context: The formation of galactic discs and chemical sequences from a cosmological perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the formation of chemical sequences in the stellar disc of Milky Way (MW)-mass galaxies in a full cosmological context with the auriga simulations. We focus on the conditions giving rise to bi-modal $\alpha$-chemistry in the MW disc and the potential influence of mergers (e.g. Gaia-Enceladus, GSE). We find a wide diversity of chemical sequences, without correlation between the emergence of dichotomous $\alpha$-chemistry and GSE-like mergers. The transition between multiple $\alpha$-sequences is sequential, and is mediated by modulations in the star formation rate (SFR). In some cases, this can be caused by the starburst and subsequent quiescence induced by mergers. In others, by exhaustion or violent disruption of the gas disc. Realisations with singular sequences either lack significant modulations in their SFR, or form too late to have a significant high-$\alpha$ sequence. The metallicity overlap between the high-$\alpha$ and low-$\alpha$ sequences (as seen in the Solar neighbourhood of the MW) arises from accretion of metal-poor gas from the circum-galactic medium. This depends on gas disc thickness, with thinner discs losing their metal-poor extremities. Gas donation from singular gas-rich merger events are incapable of driving long-lived metal dilution ($\Delta\text{[Fe/H]} \gtrsim 0.3$), and we rule-out this scenario for the low-$\alpha$ sequence in the MW. Finally, the shape of $\alpha$-sequences in the [Fe/H] versus [Mg/Fe] plane is related to long-term SFR trends, with a downward slanted locus (as is observed in the low-$\alpha$ sequence of the MW) owing to a sustained or declining SFR.</description>

      <title>RIOJA. A Clumpy Galaxy Assembly at Redshift 6.81 Revealed by JWST</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatially resolved multi-wavelength analysis is essential to study galaxy formation and evolution. A UV-bright galaxy COS-2987030247 at $z = 6.81$ is one of the Rosetta Stones in the epoch of reionization for which JWST NIRSpec Integral Field Spectroscopy, NIRCam imaging, and ALMA data are available thanks to the RIOJA program. We identified the rest-frame optical emission lines from the ionized hydrogen, oxygen, and neon gas. The \OIII\,5008\AA\ line emission and the NIRCam images show a complex kinematical and morphological structure where two bright main and three faint clumps are identified in a 10 kpc extent. The system is not classified as a purely rotation-dominated disk. The multiple clumps are instead consistent with a merger-related origin, including either distinct galaxies in interaction or star-forming clumps formed through tidal gas compression during a merger. The spatially resolved emission line fluxes show that dust attenuation, metal enrichment, and ionization parameter are preferentially enhanced in the star formation peaks. Our SED fitting suggests that the main clumps are in a moderately dust-attenuated star forming phase ($A_{\rm V} = 0.2$--$0.3$ and SFR(H$\alpha$) $\sim 10$\,M$_\odot$\,yr$^{-1}$) with almost zero escape fraction of ionizing photons. In contrast, the sub-clumps are dust-free and lying on or below the main sequence of star-forming galaxies. These sub-clumps may work as a perturber that triggers the clumpy starburst in the surrounding gas through the merger event.</description>

      <title>The GHOSDT Simulations: II. Missing H$_2$ in Simulations of a Self-Regulated Interstellar Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations in the Galaxy and nearby spirals have established that the HI-to-H$_2$ transition at solar metallicity occurs at gas weight of $P_{\rm DE}/k_B\approx 10^4 \ \rm K \ cm ^{-3}$, similar to solar neighbourhood conditions. Even so, state-of-the-art models of a self-regulated interstellar medium underproduce the molecular fraction ($R_{\rm mol} \equiv M_{{\rm H}_2}/M_{HI}$) at solar neighbourhood conditions by a factor of $\approx2-4$. We use the GHOSDT suite of simulations at a mass resolution range of $100-0.25\ M_{\odot}$ (effective spatial resolution range of $\sim 20-0.05\ \rm pc$) run for 500 Myr to show how this problem is affected by modeling choices such as the inclusion of photoionizing radiation, assumed supernova energy, numerical resolution, inclusion of magnetic fields, and including a model for sub-grid clumping. We find that $R_{\rm mol}$ is not converged even at a resolution of 1 $M_{\odot}$, with $R_{\rm mol}$ increasing by a factor of 2 when resolution is improved from 10 to $1\ M_{\odot}$. Models excluding either photoionization or magnetic fields result in a factor 2 reduction in $R_{\rm mol}$. The only model that agrees with the observed value of $R_{\rm mol}$ includes our sub-grid clumping model, which enhances $R_{\rm mol}$ by a factor of $\sim3$ compared with our fiducial model. This increases the time-averaged $R_{\rm mol}$ to $0.25$, in agreement with the Solar circle value, and closer to the observed median value of $0.42$ in regions comparable to the solar neighbourhood in nearby spirals. Our findings show that small-scale clumping in the ISM plays a significant role in H$_2$ formation even in high-resolution numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Formation of methane and cyclohexane through the hydrogenation of toluene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Methylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have been hypothesised to be present in the interstellar medium (ISM) through their 3.4 and 6.9 $\mu$m absorption bands. To investigate the hydrogenation of these methylated PAHs, the simplest, toluene ($\mathrm{CH_3C_6H_5}$), was exposed to H-atoms. This demonstrated how the presence of a methyl group changes the reactivity towards atomic hydrogen as compared to benzene and other PAHs and how this may alter its chemistry in the ISM. Toluene was deposited onto a graphite surface in an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chamber and then exposed to a H-atom beam. Temperature programmed desorption (TPD) measurements were used to investigate the reaction between H-atoms and toluene and the masses of hydrogenation products were measured with a quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS). H-atom exposure of toluene leads to superhydrogenation of toluene and the formation of methyl-cyclohexane ($\mathrm{CH_3C_6H_{11}}$) at long exposure times. The initial cross-section of H-addition is lower than that of other PAHs. Methyl-cyclohexane can be further hydrogenated, leading to the detachment of the methyl group and production of cyclohexane ($\mathrm{C_6H_{12}}$) and methane ($\mathrm{CH_4}$). Toluene may be fully hydrogenated through its interaction with H-atoms, although it has a smaller initial cross-section for H-atom addition compared to other PAHs. This likely reflects it having a smaller geometric cross-section and the low flexibility of the benzene ring when undergoing sp$^3$ hybridization. The removal of the methyl group at high H-atom fluences provides a top down formation route to smaller molecules with the possibility of the formation of a radical cyclohexane combining with other species in an interstellar environment to form prebiotic molecules.</description>

      <title>The abundance of thin dwarf galaxies: a challenge for cosmological simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the prevalence of thin galaxies as a function of stellar mass in the range $10^7 &lt; M_{\star} / \rm{M_\odot} &lt; 10^{11}$ using data from the GAMA, DESI, ALFALFA, and Nearby Galaxy catalogs. We use the distribution of projected axis ratios, $q$, to infer the abundance of intrinsically flat galaxies needed to reproduce the observed abundance of highly elongated systems in projection. We find that as many as $40\%$ of galaxies in the mass range $10^9&lt;M_{\star}/\rm{M_\odot}&lt;10^{10}$ are intrinsically flatter than $1$:$5$ (i.e., $c/a&lt;0.2$), a fraction that rises to $\sim 80\%$ for $c/a&lt;0.3$. Although the incidence of thin galaxies decreases towards lower and higher $M_{\star}$, they are still quite common in dwarfs: $\sim 30\%$ and $\sim 65\%$ of $\sim 10^8 ~ \rm{M_\odot}$ galaxies are inferred to be intrinsically flatter than $c/a=0.2$ and $0.3$, respectively. A comparison of these results with several state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical simulations (TNG50, FIREbox, Romulus25) reveals a distinctive lack of thin simulated dwarfs. In particular, there are no $M_{\star} &lt; 10^9 ~ \rm{M_{\odot}}$ simulated galaxies flatter than $c/a=0.2$, in clear contrast with observational samples. This discrepancy likely reflects limitations in resolution and in the treatment of baryonic physics, suggesting that our understanding of the mechanisms regulating the formation of disk galaxies less massive than the Milky Way is still quite incomplete. Our results present a clear challenge to current numerical models of dwarf galaxy formation, which future models should attempt to meet.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the origin of inter-band continuum time delays in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) to study the structure and properties of their accretion disks. We aim to measure the inter-band continuum time delays through photometric monitoring of Seyfert galaxy Fairall 9 to construct the lag-spectrum. Additionally, we explain the observed features in the Fairall 9 lag-spectrum and discuss the potential drivers behind them, based on our newly collected data from the Obserwatorium Cerro Murphy (OCM) telescope. We initiated a long-term, continuous AGN photometric monitoring program in 2024, titled 'Hubble constant constraints through AGN Light curve Observations' (HALO) using intermediate and broad band filters. Here, we present the first results from HALO, focusing on photometric light curves and continuum time-delay measurements for Fairall 9. To complement these observations and extend the wavelength coverage of the lag-spectrum, we also reanalyzed archival Swift light curves and spectroscopic data available in the literature. Using HALO and Swift light curves, we measured inter-band continuum delays to construct the lag-spectrum of Fairall 9. Excess lags appear in the $u$ and $U$ bands (Balmer continuum contamination) and in the $I$ band (Paschen jump/dust emission from the torus). Overall, the lag-spectrum deviates significantly from standard disk model predictions. We find that inter-band delays deviate from the power-law, $\tau_{\lambda} \propto \lambda^{\beta}$ due to BLR scattering, reprocessing, and dust contributions at longer wavelengths. Power-law fits are therefore not well suited for characterizing the nature of the time delays.</description>

      <title>The PAU Survey: Uncovering the connection between intrinsic and observed galaxy properties using symbolic regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating stellar masses for billions of galaxies in upcoming surveys requires methods that are both accurate and computationally efficient. We present a new approach using symbolic regression trained on a simulation to derive simple, explicit mathematical expressions that estimate galaxy stellar masses from basic observables: photometry and redshift. Using a mock catalogue from the GALFORM semi-analytical model that reproduces the Physics of the Accelerating Universe Survey (PAUS), we show that a linear combination of just four observables -- minimally processed $u$- and $i$- band magnitudes, observed $(g-r)$ colour, and redshift -- can recover stellar masses with accuracy comparable to traditional spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, but with negligible computational cost. Our expressions can be evaluated instantaneously for millions of galaxies, making them ideal for next-generation surveys like LSST and Euclid. When observational errors are included, symbolic regression achieves a similar accuracy to deep neural networks while maintaining transparency. Validation against CIGALE SED fitting on PAUS data shows agreement within 0.13 dex for galaxies with $M_{*} &gt; 10^8 M_{\odot}$. We demonstrate that the stellar mass function can be recovered at $z &lt; 0.5$, though with distortions at the extremes: the high-mass end is overestimated by a factor of $\sim 3$ at $10^{11.5} h^{-1} M_{\odot}$ due to scatter. Our approach offers a fast, transparent alternative to traditional methods without sacrificing accuracy for the bulk of the galaxy population.</description>

      <title>A wide-field, multi-line survey of CO in the Magellanic Clouds at parsec-scale resolution: characterising the molecular gas content with a 50-m single-dish submillimeter telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC, SMC) are nearby dwarf galaxies whose proximity uniquely enables molecular cloud-scale resolution observations across the entire Magellanic system, a capability unmatched in any other external galaxy. Their low metallicities resemble conditions near the peak of cosmic star formation, allowing resolved studies of interstellar medium (ISM) phases, molecular cloud lifecycles, and feedback processes that regulate galaxy evolution. Comprehensive, wide-field spectroscopic mapping of CO and its isotopologues in different transitions, complemented by [CI] observations, and combined with already existing HI and HII surveys, will calibrate star-formation laws and gas-phase partition under low-metallicity conditions and furnish benchmarks for interpreting high-redshift galaxies and cosmological simulations. This science requires a large-aperture, wide-field submillimeter single dish with multi-pixel spectroscopic capabilities, operated from a high, dry site such as Chajnantor, to deliver fast, sensitive, high-resolution, degree-scale mapping with total-power fidelity. We present the case for a full molecular atlas of the Magellanic system, the enabling facility requirements, and the transformative impact on galaxy evolution studies</description>

      <title>The Properties of Little Red Dot Galaxies in the ASTRID Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present simulated counterparts of the ``Little Red Dot'' (LRD) galaxies observed with JWST, using the large cosmological hydrodynamic simulation, ASTRID. We create mock observations of the galaxies ($5 \leq z \leq 8$) in ASTRID, and find seventeen which fit the color and size criteria of LRDs. These LRDs are galaxies with high stellar masses ($\rm log(M_*/M_{\odot}) \geq 9.7$), and massive black holes ($\rm log(M_{BH}/M_{\odot}) \geq 6.8$). The host galaxies are dense, with stellar half mass radii ($\rm 325\,pc \leq r_{{\rm half},*} \leq 620\,pc$), and dust attenuation in the F444W band above 1.25. Their star formation has been recently quenched. They host relatively bright AGN that are dust-obscured and contribute significantly to the rest-frame optical red slope and have relatively low luminosity in the rest-frame ultraviolet, where the host galaxy's stars are more dominant. These LRDs are in an evolutionary phase of miniquenching that is the result of AGN feedback from their massive black holes. The LRDs in ASTRID are bright with F444W magnitudes of $23.5-25.5$. The less massive and fainter galaxies in ASTRID lack the dust concentration necessary to produce the red slope of an LRD, though this could be an effect of limited resolution. Most of the highest Eddington black holes are not LRDs due to insufficient dust attenuation from their host galaxies, which are also experiencing relatively high star formation rates. This results in their spectra being too flat, despite their highly accreting black holes.</description>

      <title>Pre-perihelion evolution of the NiI/FeI abundance ratio in the coma of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. From extreme to normal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emission lines of FeI and NiI are commonly found in the coma of Solar System comets, even at large heliocentric distances. These atoms are most likely released from the surface of the comet's nucleus or from a short-lived parent. These lines were also found in the interstellar comet 2I/Borisov, which has a NiI/FeI abundance ratio similar to that observed in Solar System comets. Here, we report observations of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which were carried out with the ESO Very Large Telescope equipped with the UVES and X-shooter spectrographs. Spectra were obtained at heliocentric distances ranging from 3.14 to 1.85 au. NiI was detected at all epochs. FeI was only detected at heliocentric distances smaller than 2.64 au. We estimated the NiI and FeI production rates by comparing the observed line intensities with those produced by a dedicated fluorescence model. Comet 3I first exhibited extreme and unusual NiI/FeI abundance ratios during the initial stages of its activity. However, as its heliocentric distance decreased, this ratio became indistinguishable from those observed in Solar System comets and in comet 2I/Borisov. Comet 3I was found to be C$_2$-depleted, with a NiI/FeI abundance ratio finally consistent with other C$_2$-depleted comets. Nevertheless, comet 3I remains exceptional due to its high, total production rate of NiI and FeI, which is at least one order of magnitude larger than that of other comets. We interpreted these observations assuming that the NiI and FeI atoms were released through the sublimation of Ni(CO)$_4$ and Fe(CO)$_5$ carbonyls. This scenario provides a straightforward explanation for the asymmetric release of NiI and FeI atoms in the cometary coma and how it depends on the heliocentric distance. It also supports the presence of carbonyls in the cometary material.</description>
