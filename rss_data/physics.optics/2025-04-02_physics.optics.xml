      <title>Soft X-ray high-harmonic generation in an anti-resonant hollow core fiber driven by a 3 $\mu$m ultrafast laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-harmonic upconversion driven by a mid-infrared femtosecond laser can generate coherent soft X-ray beams in a tabletop-scale setup. Here, we report on a compact ytterbium-pumped optical parametric chirped pulse amplifier (OPCPA) laser system seeded by an all-fiber front-end and employing periodically-poled lithium niobate (PPLN) nonlinear media operated near the pulse fluence limits of current commercially available PPLN crystals. The OPCPA delivers 3 $\mu$m wavelength pulses with 775 $\mu$J energy at 1 kHz repetition rate, with transform-limited 120 fs pulse duration, diffraction-limited beam quality, and ultrahigh 0.33% rms energy stability over &gt;18 hours. Using this laser, we generate soft X-ray high harmonics (HHG) in argon gas by focusing into a low-loss, high-pressure gas-filled anti-resonant hollow core fiber (ARHCF), generating coherent light at photon energies up to the argon L-edge (250 eV) and carbon K-edge (284 eV), with high beam quality and ~1% rms energy stability. This work demonstrates soft X-ray HHG in a high-efficiency guided-wave phase matched geometry, overcoming the high losses inherent to mid-IR propagation in unstructured waveguides, or the short interaction lengths of gas cells or jets. The ARHCF can operate long term without damage, and with the repetition rate, stability and robustness required for demanding applications in spectro-microscopy and imaging. Finally, we discuss routes for maximizing the soft X-ray HHG flux by driving He at higher laser intensities using either 1.5 $\mu$m or 3 $\mu$m - the signal and idler wavelengths of the laser.</description>

      <title>Near-energy-free Photonic Fourier Transformation for Convolution Operation Acceler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convolutional operations are computationally intensive in artificial intelligence services, and their overhead in electronic hardware limits machine learning scaling. Here, we introduce a photonic joint transform correlator (pJTC) using a near-energy-free on-chip Fourier transformation to accelerate convolution operations. The pJTC reduces computational complexity for both convolution and cross-correlation from O(N4) to O(N2), where N2 is the input data size. Demonstrating functional Fourier transforms and convolution, this pJTC achieves 98.0% accuracy on an exemplary MNIST inference task. Furthermore, a wavelength-multiplexed pJTC architecture shows potential for high throughput and energy efficiency, reaching 305 TOPS/W and 40.2 TOPS/mm2, based on currently available foundry processes. An efficient, compact, and low-latency convolution accelerator promises to advance next-generation AI capabilities across edge demands, high-performance computing, and cloud services.</description>

      <title>Versatile silicon integrated photonic processor: a reconfigurable solution for netx-generation AI clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Artificial Intelligence models pose serious challenges in intensive computing and high-bandwidth communication for conventional electronic circuit-based computing clusters. Silicon photonic technologies, owing to their high speed, low latency, large bandwidth, and complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor compatibility, have been widely implemented for data transfer and actively explored as photonic neural networks in AI clusters. However, current silicon photonic integrated chips lack adaptability for multifuncional use and hardware-software systematic coordination. Here, we develop a reconfigurable silicon photonic processor with $40$ programmable unit cells integrating over $160$ component, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to realize diverse functions with a chip for AI clusters, from computing acceleration and signal processing to network swtiching and secure encryption. Through a self-developed automated testing, compilation, and tuning framework to the processor without in-network monitoring photodetectors, we implement $4\times4$ dual-direction unitary and $3\times3$ uni-direction non-unitary matrix multiplications, neural networks for image recognition, micro-ring modulator wavelength locking, $4\times4$ photonic channel switching , and silicon photonic physical unclonable functions. This optoelectronic processing system, incorporating the photonic processor and its software stack, paves the way for both advanced photonic system-on-chip design and the construction of photo-electronic AI clusters.</description>

      <title>Cat-Eye Inspired Active-Passive-Composite Aperture-Shared Sub-Terahertz Meta-Imager for Non-Interactive Concealed Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the feline eye, a distinctive tapetum lucidum as a mirror resides posterior to the retina, reflecting the incident rays to simulate light source emission. This secondary emission property enables felines to be highly sensitive to light, possessing remarkable visual capabilities even in dark settings. Drawing inspiration from this natural phenomenon, we propose an active-passive-composite sub-terahertz meta-imager integrated with a bifocus metasurface, a high-sensitivity radiometer, and a low-power signal hidden radiation source. Benefiting from its aperture-shared advantage, this advanced fusion imaging system, enabled to be deployed by a simplified portable hardware platform, allows for the concurrent acquisition of active and passive electromagnetic properties to extend the target detection category and realize multi-mode fusion perception. Notably, it also enables the extraction of radiation and reflection characteristics without additional calibration modules. Experiments demonstrate the multi-target fusion imaging and localized information decoupling with the tailored field of view and emission energy. This compact and multi-mode fusion imaging system may have plenty of potential for airplane navigation positioning, abnormal monitoring, and non-interactive concealed security checks.</description>

      <title>Two-photon microscopy using picosecond pulses from four-wave mixing in a Yb-doped photonic crystal fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-photon microscopy (TPM) enables deep tissue imaging but requires excitation pulses that have a large product of average and peak power, typically supplied by femtosecond solid-state lasers. However, these lasers are bulky and femtosecond pulses require careful dispersion management to avoid pulse broadening, particularly when delivery fibers are used. Here we present a compact, fiber-based picosecond laser source operating at 790 nm for TPM using a ytterbium-doped photonic crystal fiber (Yb-doped PCF). The Yb-doped PCF simultaneously amplifies 1064 nm input pulses and efficiently converts them to 790 nm via four-wave mixing, generating pulses with a peak power of up to ~3.8 kW. The source has a variable repetition rate (1.48 MHz-14.78 MHz), enabling the two-photon excitation fluorescence signal to be maximized in the presence of excitation saturation. We benchmark our picosecond laser source against a femtosecond Ti:Sapphire laser for TPM of stained Convallaria majalis samples and demonstrate comparable fluorescence signal when the two-photon excitation conditions are matched.</description>

      <title>Dataset and Methodology for Material Identification and virtual s-SNOM Using AFM Phase Approach Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic force microscopy (AFM) phase approach-curves have significant potential for nanoscale material characterization, however, the availability of robust datasets and automated analysis tools has been limited. In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology for material identification using a high-dimensional dataset consisting of AFM phase approach-curves collected from five distinct materials: silicon, silicon dioxide, platinum, silver, and gold. Each measurement comprises 50 phase values obtained at progressively increasing tip-sample distances, resulting in 50x50x50 voxel images that represent phase variations at different depths. Using this dataset, we compare k-nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest (RF), and feedforward neural network (FNN) methods for material segmentation. Our results indicate that the FNN provides the highest accuracy and F1 score, outperforming more traditional approaches. Finally, we demonstrate the practical value of these segmented maps by generating virtual scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) images, highlighting how AFM phase approach-curves can be leveraged to produce detailed, predictive tools for nanoscale optical analysis.</description>

      <title>Propagation of space-time optical vortices in multimode fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-intuitive spatiotemporal modal content of space-time optical vortices (STOVs) is calculated in a graded-index fiber supporting a large number of propagating modes. We discuss how a fiber supporting many modes allows to truly couple higher-order STOVs, the number of modes necessary to support a STOV of a certain order, and conversely the truncation effect in a few-mode fiber. Based on the excited modes and their temporal profiles, we show numerical results for the linear and nonlinear propagation of STOVs in multimode fibers, specifically the linear space-time beating at short propagation distances, and the nonlinear trapping effect between modes producing stable states on long propagation distances. Our results underline how STOVs present a rich platform for multimode nonlinear optics and technology.</description>

      <title>Performance and applications of optical pin beams in turbulent long-range free space optical communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical pin beams (OPBs) are a promising candidate for realizing turbulence-resilient long-distance free-space optical communication links spanning hundreds of kilometers. In this work, we introduce a unified theoretical model to describe the propagation of OPBs and present comprehensive simulation results based on many realizations and link-budget analyses for constant turbulence strengths. For reference, we compare the performance of the OPBs to weakly diverging and focusing Gaussian beams. For a 100km long air-to-air link, 10km above sea level, our simulation results show that OPBs offer an improved link budget of up to 8.6dB and enhanced beam wander statistics of up to 3dB compared to the considered Gaussian beams. Additionally, we identified a quadratic relationship between the transmitter aperture diameter and the maximum achievable distances, which is crucial in deciding the suitability of OPBs for a given application scenario.</description>

      <title>Analytical Framework of Orbital Angular Momentum Beam in Misaligned Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work provides an analytical framework to model the detected orbital angular momentum (OAM) spectrum of an optical beam in the presence of tilt and lateral displacement in the impinging beam. We show how both tilt and displacement cause OAM sidebands following the same function, with both having their characteristic adimensional parameter related to the size and wavelength of the beam. We see how an increase in topological charge on the beam causes wider detected OAM distribution. Finally, we show how, in the case of both tilt and lateral displacement, we can tune the amount of OAM mode in the original mode by having a perpendicular direction for the tilt and off-axis displacement, causing the misalignment errors to interfere destructively.</description>

      <title>Brillouin-enhanced four-wave mixing with optical chiral states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brillouin-enhanced four-wave mixing - also known as Brillouin dynamic gratings - is an important nonlinear effect in photonics that couples four light waves by travelling acoustic waves. The effect has received a lot of attention in the last few decades, especially for applications in fiber sensing, signal processing and optical delay lines. Here, we report Brillouin-enhanced four-wave mixing with optical chiral states (i.e. circular polarization and vortex states) in twisted photonic crystal fiber, by leveraging the topology-selective Brillouin effect. Phase-matching has the consequence that the travelling acoustic gratings created by circularly-polarized vortex pump and Stokes in the stimulated Brillouin scattering can be used to modulate a frequency-shifted probe, where the pump/Stokes and probe have different circular polarization or topological charges. We demonstrate cross-frequency selective information transfer and show that the information is transferred only when pump and probe have opposite circular polarization.</description>

      <title>Cyanine-Conjugated Gold Nanospheres for Near-infrared Fluorescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-infrared fluorescence imaging offers improved spatial precision by reducing light scattering and absorption in tissue. Despite this key advantage, the NIR region is limited by the availability of fluorophores, most of which exhibit relatively low quantum yield. In this study, gold nanospheres with absorption peaks in the visible range were used to enhance the fluorescence intensity of the cyanine NIR fluorophore IRdye 800 in the first NIR window of the electromagnetic spectrum. AuNSs with diameters ranging from 5 to 25 nm were chosen to investigate the impact of a nanoparticle size on fluorescence enhancement, functionalized with polyethylene glycol of varying molecular weights to optimize the distance between the fluorophore and the nanoparticle surface. Theoretical analyses using finite-difference time-domain simulations and experimental comparisons with non-metallic nanoparticles were performed to identify the factors contributing to the enhancement of fluorescence. PEGylated AuNSs conjugated with IRdye 800 (AuNDs) exhibited decreased photoisomerization, resulting in increased fluorescence intensity and altered fluorescence lifetimes. The observed enhancement in the fluorescence intensity of the AuNDs was attributed to three primary mechanisms: metal-enhanced fluorescence, altered radiative decay rates, and steric stabilization. Among these three mechanisms, two are attributed to the tail-end absorption spectral overlap of the AuNSs with IRdye 800. This study highlights the potential of AuNSs for improving NIR-I fluorescence imaging and opens up new possibilities for applications in biomedical research.</description>

      <title>Multi-actuator lens systems for turbulence correction in free-space optical communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The implementation of efficient free-space channels is fundamental for both classical and quantum Free-Space Optical (FSO) communication. This can be challenging for fibre-coupled receivers, due to the time variant inhomogeneity of the refractive index that can cause strong fluctuations in the power coupled into the Single-Mode Fiber (SMF), and requires the use of Adaptive Optics (AO) systems to correct the atmospheric induced aberrations. In this work, we present two adaptive optic systems, one using a Fast-Steering Prism (FSP) for the correction of tip-tilt and a second one based on a Multi-Actuator deformable Lens (MAL), capable of correcting up to the third order of Zernike's polynomials. We test both systems at telecom wavelength both with artificial turbulence in the laboratory and on a free-space channel, demonstrating their effectiveness in increasing the fibre coupling efficiency.</description>

      <title>Integrated sub-terahertz cavity electro-optic transduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging communications and computing technologies will rely ever-more on expanding the useful radio frequency (RF) spectrum into the sub-THz and THz frequency range. Both classical and quantum applications would benefit from advancing integration and incorporation of sub-THz and electro-optic technologies into common devices, such as modulators. Here we demonstrate an integrated triply-resonant, superconducting electro-optic transducer. Our design incorporates an on-chip $107$ GHz sub-THz niobium titanium nitride superconducting resonator, modulating a thin-film lithium niobate optical racetrack resonator operating at telecom wavelengths. We observe a maximum photon transduction efficiency of $\eta_{\text{OE}}\approx 0.82\times 10^{-6}$ and an average single-photon electro-optic interaction rate of $g_0/2\pi\approx 0.7$ kHz. We also present a study and analysis of the challenges associated with the design of integrated sub-THz resonators and propose possible solutions to these challenges. Our work paves the way for further advancements in resonant electro-optic technologies operating at sub-THz frequencies.</description>

      <title>Enabling Continuous THz Band Coverage via Precise Electron Beam Tailoring in Free-electron Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-power, continuously tunable narrowband terahertz (THz) sources are essential for advancing nonlinear optics, THz-driven material dynamics, and ultrafast spectroscopy. Conventional techniques typically impose a trade-off between pulse energy and frequency tunability. Here, we introduce a novel free-electron laser approach that overcomes these limitations by pre-modulating a relativistic electron beam with a frequency-beating laser pulse and leveraging bunch compression along with collective effects to enhance microbunching. Experimental results demonstrate that this technique generates narrowband THz emission with continuous frequency tunability from 7.8 to 30.8THz, achieving pulse energies up to 385{\mu}J while maintaining spectral bandwidths between 7.7% and 14.7%. Moreover, the method exhibits exceptional robustness and scalability, highlighting its unique ability to bridge the long-standing THz gap and offering a promising solution for diverse cutting-edge scientific applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum light sources with configurable lifetime leveraging parity-time symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum light sources with configurable photon lifetimes are essential for large-scale quantum circuits, enabling applications in programmable quantum computing, various quantum key distribution protocols, and quantum tomography techniques. However, the fundamental trade-off between efficiency and photon lifetime imposes significant challenges on the design of high-performance large configurable lifetime quantum light sources. Here, we report on such chip-scale quantum light sources by harnessing the unique feature of parity-time (PT) symmetry. The core design centers on employing PT-symmetric coupling between two microresonators of distinct circumferences, enabling broad-range and selective tuning of intracavity photon density of states. By controlling the alignment between resonators, we achieved a 38-fold photon lifetime tuning range (4 ~ 158 ps), with the shortest lifetimes near the exceptional points of the PT-symmetric systems. The device generates energy-time entangled photon pairs with 87.1 +- 1.1% interference visibility and a heralded second-order autocorrelation of g_h^((2) ) (0)= 0.069 +- 0.001. Our work highlights the potential of PT symmetry for advanced quantum applications, including high-speed communication and programmable quantum computing, quantum coherent tomography, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Multi-Marker Similarity enables reduced-reference and interpretable image quality assessment in optical microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical microscopy contributes to the ever-increasing progress in biological and biomedical studies, as it allows the implementation of minimally invasive experimental pipelines to translate the data of measured samples into valuable knowledge. Within these pipelines, reliable quality assessment must be ensured to validate the generated results. Image quality assessment is often applied with full-reference methods to estimate the similarity between the ground truth and the output images. However, current methods often show poor agreement with visual perception and lead to the generation of various full-reference metrics tailored to specific applications. Additionally, they rely on pixel-wise comparisons, emphasizing local intensity similarity while often overlooking comprehensive and interpretable image quality assessment. To address these issues, we have developed a multi-marker similarity method that compares standard quality markers, such as resolution, signal-to-noise ratio, contrast, and high frequency components. The method computes a similarity score between the image and the ground truth for each marker, then combines these scores into an overall similarity estimate. This provides a full-reference estimate of image quality while extracting global quality features and detecting experimental artifacts. Multi-marker similarity provides a reliable and interpretable method for image quality assessment and the generation of quality rankings. By focusing on the comparison of quality markers rather than direct image distances, the method enables reduced reference implementations, where a single field of view is used as a benchmark for multiple measurements. This opens the way for reliable automatic evaluation of big datasets, typical of large biomedical studies, when manual assessment of single images and defining the ground truth for each field of view is not feasible.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary gauge quantisation of light-matter theories with time-dependent constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a general framework for the quantisation of light-matter theories with time-dependent holonomic constraints. Unless time dependence is present from the outset at the Lagrangian level, different gauges generally produce non-equivalent canonical theories. The irrotational gauge is defined as that which also yields a correct theory when time dependence is introduced at the Hamiltonian level. We unify examples of such gauges found in existing literature. In particular, we show that for describing time-dependent light-matter interactions the Coulomb gauge is not generally irrotational, so it does not enjoy any special status, contradicting the conclusions in Phys. Rev. A 107, 013722 (2023) and Phys. Rev. Research 3, 023079 (2021), while reaffirming the prior treatment and conclusions reported in Phys. Rev. Research 3, 013116 (2021).</description>

      <title>High-Yield Assembly of Plasmon-Coupled Nanodiamonds \textit{via} DNA Origami for Tailored Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling the spatial arrangement of optically active elements is crucial for the advancement of engineered photonic systems. Color centers in nanodiamond offer unique advantages for quantum sensing and information processing; however, their integration into complex optical architectures is limited by challenges in precise and reproducible positioning, as well as efficient coupling. DNA origami provides an elegant solution, as demonstrated by recent studies showcasing nanoscale positioning of fluorescent nanodiamonds and plasmonic gold nanoparticles. Here, we present a scalable and robust method for covalently functionalizing nanodiamonds with DNA, enabling high-yield, spatially controlled assembly of diamond and gold nanoparticles onto DNA origami. By precisely controlling the interparticle spacing, we reveal distance-dependent modulation of NV center photoluminescence with a 10-fold increase in the fastest decay pathway at short interparticle distances. Our findings indicate selective plasmon-driven effects and interplay between radiative and non-radiative processes. This work overcomes key limitations in current nanodiamond assembly strategies and provides insights into engineering NV photoluminescence by plasmonic coupling that advance toward quantum photonic and sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Low-power multi-mode fiber projector overcomes shallow neural networks classifiers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.04745v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the domain of disordered photonics, the characterization of optically opaque materials for light manipulation and imaging is a primary aim. Among various complex devices, multi-mode optical fibers stand out as cost-effective and easy-to-handle tools, making them attractive for several tasks. In this context, we cast these fibers into random hardware projectors, transforming an input dataset into a higher dimensional speckled image set. The goal of our study is to demonstrate that using such randomized data for classification by training a single logistic regression layer improves accuracy compared to training on direct raw images. Interestingly, we found that the classification accuracy achieved is higher than that obtained with the standard transmission matrix model, a widely accepted tool for describing light transmission through disordered devices. We conjecture that the reason for such improved performance could be due to the fact that the hardware classifier operates in a flatter region of the loss landscape when trained on fiber data, which aligns with the current theory of deep neural networks. These findings suggest that the class of random projections operated by multi-mode fibers generalize better to previously unseen data, positioning them as promising tools for optically-assisted neural networks. With this study, in fact, we want to contribute to advancing the knowledge and practical utilization of these versatile instruments, which may play a significant role in shaping the future of neuromorphic machine learning.</description>

      <title>Purcell Effect in Epsilon-Near-Zero Microcavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) photonics presents a powerful platform for integrated photonic systems, enabling a range of novel and extraordinary functionalities. However, the practical implementation of ENZ-based systems is often constrained by high material losses and severe impedance mismatch, limiting the efficient interaction of light with ENZ media. To overcome these challenges, we introduce all-dielectric Bragg reflection microcavities operating at their cutoff frequency as a high-figure-of-merit ENZ resonant platform, providing an ultra-low-loss alternative for studying emission processes in ENZ media. While Bragg cavities are well-established, their potential as ENZ resonant microcavities remains largely unexplored. We investigate the Purcell effect and quality factor in these structures, comparing their performance with those of the perfect-electric-conductor and metallic counterparts. Through analytical derivations based on Fermi's golden rule and field quantization in lossless dispersive media, we establish scaling laws that distinguish these ENZ cavities from conventional resonators. Frequency-domain simulations validate our findings, demonstrating that in all-dielectric ENZ Bragg-reflection microcavities, the Purcell and quality factors scale as $L/\lambda_0$ and $(L/\lambda_0)^3$, respectively, where $L$ is the cavity length and $\lambda_0$ is the resonance wavelength. Our results offer key insights into the design of ENZ-based photonic systems, paving the way for enhanced light-matter interactions in nonlinear optics and quantum photonics.</description>

      <title>A Precision Gyroscope from the Helicity of Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a gyroscope that measures rotation based on the effects of the rotation on the polarization of light. Rotation induces a differential phase shift in the propagation of left- and right-circularly polarized light and this phase shift can be measured in suitably designed interferometric setups. The signal in this setup is independent of the frequency of light, unlike various sources of noise such as vibrations, which cause phase shifts that depend on the frequency. Such vibrations are the practical limit on the sensitivity of conventional Sagnac-style optical interferometers that are typically used as gyroscopes. In the proposed setup, one can potentially mitigate this source of noise by simultaneously using two (or more) sources of light that have different frequencies. The signal in this setup scales with the total storage time of the light. Due to its frequency independence, it is thus most optimal to measure the signal using superconducting radio-frequency systems where the high finesse of the available cavities enables considerably longer storage times than is possible in an optical setup.</description>

Abstract: The electromagnetic fields of the hybrid modes of an optical fiber are reformulated using bi-complex mathematics, which leads to simpler expressions relative to those found with the widely used, conventional complex formulation. Generalized expressions for the electromagnetic fields are also found using both formulations for comparative purposes. Furthermore, the feasibility of bi-complex mathematics is investigated for the derivation of the modal powers, orthogonality relations, and the weakly-guided fiber approximation</description>

      <title>Optimal conditions for the generation of moderate-order harmonics of a short-wave field by helium atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that under optimal conditions, the generation of the 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th harmonics of the short-wave, ultraviolet or vacuum ultraviolet, laser field by helium atoms is mainly due to transitions between bound states, and the maximum energy of the harmonics is achieved under conditions of their resonant multiphoton excitation. In this case, the optima for the generation of the 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th harmonics of the field correspond to three-, four-, five-, and six-photon resonances, and the optimal value of the peak field intensity, depending on the harmonic order, varies from 2.5*10^14 W/cm^2 to 1.2*10^15 W/cm^2. The total probability of excitation and ionization of an atom at the end of a laser pulse under corresponding conditions exceeds 1/2. With such intensity and not-too-high frequency of the laser field, the Stark effect turns out to be very significant, which allows it to be tuned in resonance with an arbitrary excited state of the atom by changing the intensity of the field without changing its frequency. It is shown that for the laser field parameters maximizing the energy of the Nth harmonic, N from 3 to 9, this harmonic dominates in the dipole acceleration spectrum. At the same time, the amplitudes of the remaining harmonics increase as the harmonic order approaches N. In particular, under the conditions maximizing the yield of the 9th harmonic, the harmonic amplitudes increase when moving from the 3rd harmonic to the 5th and then to the 7th and 9th harmonics, and the harmonics form an attosecond pulse train. At the same time, under the conditions maximizing the yield of the 3rd harmonic, its amplitude in the dipole acceleration spectrum exceeds not only the amplitudes of the other harmonics, but also the amplitude of the atomic response at the frequency of the driving field.</description>

      <title>3D Heterogeneous Integration of Silicon Nitride and Aluminum Nitride on Sapphire toward Ultra-wideband Photonics Integrated Circuits</title>

Abstract: Extending two-dimensional photonic integrated circuits (PICs) to three-dimensional (3D) configurations promises great potential for scaling up integration, enhancing functionality, and improving performance of PICs. Silicon-based 3D PICs have made substantial progress due to CMOS compatibility. However, the narrow bandgap of silicon (1.1 eV) limits their use in short-wavelength applications, such as chemical and biological sensing, underwater optical communications, and optical atomic clocks. In this work, we developed a 3D photonics platform by heterogeneously integrating silicon nitride (SiN) and aluminum nitride (AlN) PICs on sapphire (Al$_2$O$_3$). The broadband transparency of these materials allow our platform to operate over a multi-octave wavelength ranging from ultraviolet to infrared. Leveraging this platform, we demonstrated efficient optical nonlinearity in an AlN microcavity, low-loss and tunable SiN waveguide-based optical components, and optical linking between AlN and SiN PICs layers in the visible and near-infrared spectrum, hinting at potential applications in integrated quantum systems. Our work presents an ultra-wideband 3D PICs platform, providing new opportunities for broadband and short-wavelength applications of PICs.</description>

Abstract: Heterogeneously-integrated electro-optic modulators (EOM) are demonstrated using the hybrid-mode concept, incorporating thin-film lithium niobate (LN) by bonding with silicon nitride (SiN) passive photonics. At wavelengths near 1550 nm, these EOMs demonstrated greater than 30 dB extinction ratio, 3.8 dB on-chip insertion loss, a low-frequency half-wave voltage-length product ($V_\pi L$) of 3.8 $V.{}cm$, and a 3-dB EO modulation bandwidth exceeding 110 GHz. This work demonstrates the combination of multi-layer low-loss SiN waveguides with high-performance LN EOMs made in a scalable fabrication process using conventional low-resistivity silicon (Si) wafers.</description>

Abstract: Neuromorphic processors improve the efficiency of machine learning algorithms through the implementation of physical artificial neurons to perform computations. However, whilst efficient classical neuromorphic processors have been demonstrated in various forms, practical quantum neuromorphic platforms are still in the early stages of development. Here we propose a fixed optical network for photonic quantum reservoir computing that is enabled by photon number-resolved detection of the output states. This significantly reduces the required complexity of the input quantum states while still accessing a high-dimensional Hilbert space. The approach is implementable with currently available technology and lowers the barrier to entry to quantum machine learning.</description>

Abstract: Modern deep learning relies nearly exclusively on dedicated electronic hardware accelerators. Photonic approaches, with low consumption and high operation speed, are increasingly considered for inference but, to date, remain mostly limited to relatively basic tasks. Simultaneously, the problem of training deep and complex neural networks, overwhelmingly performed through backpropagation, remains a significant limitation to the size and, consequently, the performance of current architectures and a major compute and energy bottleneck. Here, we experimentally implement a versatile and scalable training algorithm, called direct feedback alignment, on a hybrid electronic-photonic platform. An optical processing unit performs large-scale random matrix multiplications, which is the central operation of this algorithm, at speeds up to 1500 TeraOPS under 30 Watts of power. We perform optical training of modern deep learning architectures, including Transformers, with more than 1B parameters, and obtain good performances on language, vision, and diffusion-based generative tasks. We study the scaling of the training time, and demonstrate a potential advantage of our hybrid opto-electronic approach for ultra-deep and wide neural networks, thus opening a promising route to sustain the exponential growth of modern artificial intelligence beyond traditional von Neumann approaches.</description>

      <title>Dissipation-Driven Transition of Particles from Dispersive to Flat Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00796</link>

Abstract: Flat bands (FBs) play a crucial role in condensed matter physics, offering an ideal platform to study strong correlation effects and enabling applications in diffraction-free photonics and quantum devices. However, the study and application of FB properties are susceptible to interference from dispersive bands. Here, we explore the impact of bond dissipation on systems hosting both flat and dispersive bands by calculating the steady-state density matrix. We demonstrate that bond dissipation can drive particles from dispersive bands into FBs and establish the general conditions for this phenomenon to occur. Our results demonstrate that dissipation can facilitate FB preparation, property measurement, and utilization. This opens a new avenue for exploring FB physics in open quantum systems, with potential implications for strongly correlated physics.</description>
