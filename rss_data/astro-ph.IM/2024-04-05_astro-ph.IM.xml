      <title>Report of the Working Group on Strategic Exoplanet Initiatives with HST and JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This STScI Working Group (WG) was charged with soliciting community feedback and evaluating the strategic planning for exoplanet science with JWST and HST given the high quality of exoplanet observations, the significantly lengthened mission lifetime for JWST, and the pronounced expansion of the field over the last decade. We were charged with identifying key science themes, providing recommendations on issues associated with optimal timing and scale of resources, as well as providing a recommended DDT concept achievable with 500 hours of JWST time. We recommend a DDT concept to survey the atmospheres of rocky-M dwarf exoplanets. It is critical to quickly survey a wide sample of such targets to ascertain if they indeed host significant atmospheres, i.e., define the cosmic shoreline, and to identify high priority targets for future follow-up. It is important for this effort to occur early in the mission lifetime. In the context of strategic planning of exoplanet observations, it is useful to estimate the expected exoplanet observational commitment over JWST's lifetime. Given the current usage associated with exoplanets, extended over 20 cycles, it is anticipated that JWST will dedicate $\approx$30,000 hours to exoplanet observations. We recommend efforts to support GO-driven programs that will contribute to this unprecedented data product of JWST. Of the $\approx$30,000 hours of anticipated JWST full-mission time dedicated to exoplanets, we expect that 1/3 of it could, and perhaps inevitably would, form a comprehensive, high S/N, panchromatic, 10$^4$ hour atmospheric survey of planets. Such an observational sample would be a legacy archive that would address a broad range of science questions across various populations of planets. It would also bridge the direct imaging and transit communities and involve a multitude of techniques to detect and characterize exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Random Frequency Sampling for Optical Turbulence Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical turbulence modelling and simulation are crucial for developing astronomical ground-based instruments, laser communication, laser metrology, or any application where light propagates through a turbulent medium. In the context of spectrum-based optical turbulence Monte-Carlo simulations, we present an alternative approach to the methods based on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) using a quasi-random frequency sampling heuristic. This approach provides complete control over the spectral information expressed in the simulated measurable, without the drawbacks encountered with FFT-based methods such as high-frequency aliasing, low-frequency under-sampling, and static sampling statistics. The method's heuristics, implementation, and an application example from the study of differential piston fluctuations are discussed.</description>

      <title>SUSHI: An algorithm for source separation of hyperspectral images with non-stationary spectral variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperspectral images are data cubes with two spatial dimensions and a third spectral dimension, providing a spectrum for each pixel, and thus allow the mapping of extended sources' physical properties. In this article, we present the Semi-blind Unmixing with Sparsity for Hyperspectral Images (SUSHI), an algorithm for non-stationary unmixing of hyperspectral images with spatial regularization of spectral parameters. The method allows for the disentangling of physical components without the assumption of a unique spectrum for each component. Thus, unlike most source separation methods used in astrophysics, all physical components obtained by SUSHI vary in spectral shape and in amplitude across the data cube.
  Non-stationary source separation is an ill-posed inverse problem that needs to be constrained. We achieve this by training a spectral model and applying a spatial regularization constraint on its parameters. For the spectral model, we used an Interpolatory Auto-Encoder, a generative model that can be trained with limited samples. For spatial regularization, we applied a sparsity constraint on the wavelet transform of the model parameter maps.
  We applied SUSHI to a toy model meant to resemble supernova remnants in X-ray astrophysics, though the method may be used on any extended source with any hyperspectral instrument. We compared this result to the one obtained by a classic 1D fit on each individual pixel. We find that SUSHI obtains more accurate results, particularly when it comes to reconstructing physical parameters. We applied SUSHI to real X-ray data from the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A and to the Crab Nebula. The results obtained are realistic and in accordance with past findings but have a much better spatial resolution. Thanks to spatial regularization, SUSHI can obtain reliable physical parameters at fine scales that are out of reach for pixel-by-pixel methods.</description>

      <title>How complex are galaxies? A non-parametric estimation of the intrinsic dimensionality of wide-band photometric data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxies are complex objects, yet the number of independent parameters to describe them remains unknown. We present here a non-parametric method to estimate the intrinsic dimensionality of large datasets. We apply it to wide-band photometric data drawn from the COSMOS2020 catalogue and a comparable mock catalogue from the Horizon-AGN simulation. Our galaxy catalogues are limited in signal-to-noise ratio in all optical and NIR bands. Our results reveal that most of the variance in the wide-band photometry of this galaxy sample can be described with at most $4.3\pm0.5$ independent parameters for star-forming galaxies and $2.9\pm0.2$ for passive ones, both in the observed and simulated catalogues. We identify one of these parameters to be noise-driven, and recover that stellar mass and redshift are two key independent parameters driving the magnitudes. Our findings support the idea that wide-band photometry does not provide more than one additional independent parameter for star-forming galaxies. Although our sample is not mass-limited and may miss some passive galaxies due to our cut in SNR, our work suggests that dimensionality reduction techniques may be effectively used to explore and analyse wide-band photometric data, provided the used latent space is at least four-dimensional.</description>

      <title>Production of Alternate Realizations of DESI Fiber Assignment for Unbiased Clustering Measurement in Data and Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A critical requirement of spectroscopic large scale structure analyses is correcting for selection of which galaxies to observe from an isotropic target list. This selection is often limited by the hardware used to perform the survey which will impose angular constraints of simultaneously observable targets, requiring multiple passes to observe all of them. In SDSS this manifested solely as the collision of physical fibers and plugs placed in plates. In DESI, there is the additional constraint of the robotic positioner which controls each fiber being limited to a finite patrol radius. A number of approximate methods have previously been proposed to correct the galaxy clustering statistics for these effects, but these generally fail on small scales. To accurately correct the clustering we need to upweight pairs of galaxies based on the inverse probability that those pairs would be observed (Bianchi \&amp; Percival 2017). This paper details an implementation of that method to correct the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey for incompleteness. To calculate the required probabilitites, we need a set of alternate realizations of DESI where we vary the relative priority of otherwise identical targets. These realizations take the form of alternate Merged Target Ledgers (AMTL), the files that link DESI observations and targets. We present the method used to generate these alternate realizations and how they are tracked forward in time using the real observational record and hardware status, propagating the survey as though the alternate orderings had been adopted. We detail the first applications of this method to the DESI One-Percent Survey (SV3) and the DESI year 1 data. We include evaluations of the pipeline outputs, estimation of survey completeness from this and other methods, and validation of the method using mock galaxy catalogs.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{globin}$: A spectropolarimetric inversion code for the coupled inference of atomic line parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For many transitions, atomic data, such as the oscillator strength (log(gf)) and the central wavelength of the line, are poorly constrained or even unknown. We present and test a new inversion method that infers atomic line parameters and the height stratification of the atmospheric parameters from spatially resolved spectropolarimetric observations of the Sun. This method is implemented in the new inversion code $\texttt{globin}$. The new method imposes a spatial coupling in inversion parameters common to all pixels, such as the atomic parameters of the observed spectral lines, and infers atmospheric parameters for each spatial pixel individually. The uniqueness of this method lies in its ability to retrieve reliable atomic parameters even for heavily blended spectral lines. We tested the method by applying it to a set of 18 spectral lines between 4015 \r{A} and 4017 \r{A}, synthesized from a 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulation containing a sunspot and the quiet Sun region around it. The results were then compared with a previously used inversion method where atomic parameters were determined for every pixel independently (pixel-by-pixel method). The new method was able to retrieve the log(gf) values of all lines to an accuracy of 0.004 dex, while the pixel-by-pixel method retrieved the same parameter to an accuracy of only 0.025 dex. The largest differences between the two methods are evident for the heavily blended lines, with the former method performing better than the latter. In addition, the new method is also able to infer reliable atmospheric parameters in all the inverted pixels by successfully disentangling the degeneracies between the atomic and atmospheric parameters. The new method is well suited for the reliable determination of both atomic and atmospheric parameters and works well on all spectral lines, including those that are weak and/or severely blended.</description>

      <title>Signal-preserving CMB component separation with machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analysis of microwave sky signals, such as the cosmic microwave background, often requires component separation with multi-frequency methods, where different signals are isolated by their frequency behaviors. Many so-called "blind" methods, such as the internal linear combination (ILC), make minimal assumptions about the spatial distribution of the signal or contaminants, and only assume knowledge of the frequency dependence of the signal. The ILC is a minimum-variance linear combination of the measured frequency maps. In the case of Gaussian, statistically isotropic fields, this is the optimal linear combination, as the variance is the only statistic of interest. However, in many cases the signal we wish to isolate, or the foregrounds we wish to remove, are non-Gaussian and/or statistically anisotropic (in particular for Galactic foregrounds). In such cases, it is possible that machine learning (ML) techniques can be used to exploit the non-Gaussian features of the foregrounds and thereby improve component separation. However, many ML techniques require the use of complex, difficult-to-interpret operations on the data. We propose a hybrid method whereby we train an ML model using only combinations of the data that $\textit{do not contain the signal}$, and combine the resulting ML-predicted foreground estimate with the ILC solution to reduce the error from the ILC. We demonstrate our methods on simulations of extragalactic temperature and Galactic polarization foregrounds, and show that our ML model can exploit non-Gaussian features, such as point sources and spatially-varying spectral indices, to produce lower-variance maps than ILC - eg, reducing the variance of the B-mode residual by factors of up to 5 - while preserving the signal of interest in an unbiased manner. Moreover, we often find improved performance when applying our model to foreground models on which it was not trained.</description>

      <title>The Merian Survey: Design, Construction, and Characterization of a Filter Set Optimized to Find Dwarf Galaxies and Measure their Dark Matter Halo Properties with Weak Lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Merian survey is mapping $\sim$ 850 degrees$^2$ of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Strategic Survey Program (HSC-SSP) wide layer with two medium-band filters on the 4-meter Victor M. Blanco telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory, with the goal of carrying the first high signal-to-noise (S/N) measurements of weak gravitational lensing around dwarf galaxies. This paper presents the design of the Merian filter set: N708 ($\lambda_c = 7080 \unicode{x212B}$, $\Delta\lambda = 275\unicode{x212B}$) and N540 ($\lambda_c = 5400\unicode{x212B}$, $\Delta\lambda = 210\unicode{x212B}$). The central wavelengths and filter widths of N708 and N540 were designed to detect the $\rm H\alpha$ and $\rm [OIII]$ emission lines of galaxies in the mass range $8&lt;\rm \log M_*/M_\odot&lt;9$ by comparing Merian fluxes with HSC broad-band fluxes. Our filter design takes into account the weak lensing S/N and photometric redshift performance. Our simulations predict that Merian will yield a sample of $\sim$ 85,000 star-forming dwarf galaxies with a photometric redshift accuracy of $\sigma_{\Delta z/(1+z)}\sim 0.01$ and an outlier fraction of $\eta=2.8\%$ over the redshift range $0.058&lt;z&lt;0.10$. With 60 full nights on the Blanco/Dark Energy Camera (DECam), the Merian survey is predicted to measure the average weak lensing profile around dwarf galaxies with lensing $\rm S/N \sim 32$ within $r&lt;0.5$ Mpc and lensing $\rm S/N \sim 90$ within $r&lt;1.0$ Mpc. This unprecedented sample of star-forming dwarf galaxies will allow for studies of the interplay between dark matter and stellar feedback and their roles in the evolution of dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric retrievals with petitRADTRANS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: petitRADTRANS (pRT) is a fast radiative transfer code used for computing emission and transmission spectra of exoplanet atmospheres, combining a FORTRAN back end with a Python based user interface. It is widely used in the exoplanet community with 222 references in the literature to date, and has been benchmarked against numerous similar tools. The spectra calculated with pRT can be used as a forward model for fitting spectroscopic data using Monte Carlo techniques, commonly referred to as an atmospheric retrieval. The new retrieval module combines fast forward modelling with nested sampling codes, allowing for atmospheric retrievals on a large range of different types of exoplanet data. Thus it is now possible to use pRT to easily and quickly infer the atmospheric properties of exoplanets in both transmission and thermal emission.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Pulsar Timer for Binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pulsar timing is a powerful tool that, by accounting for every rotation of a pulsar, precisely measures the spin frequency, spin frequency derivatives, astrometric position, binary parameters when applicable, properties of the ISM, and potentially general relativistic effects. Typically, this process demands fairly stringent scheduling requirements for monitoring observations as well as deep domain knowledge to "phase connect" the timing data. We present an algorithm that automates the pulsar timing process for binary pulsars, whose timing solutions have an additional level of complexity, although the algorithm works for isolated pulsars as well. Using the statistical F-test and the quadratic dependence of the reduced $\chi ^2$ near a minimum, the global rotation count of a pulsar can be determined efficiently and systematically. We have used our algorithm to establish timing solutions for two newly discovered binary pulsars, PSRs J1748$-$2446aq and J1748$-$2446at, in the globular cluster Terzan 5, using $\sim$70 Green Bank Telescope observations from the last 13 years.</description>

      <title>Aliasing from Galactic Plane Setting in Widefield Radio Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurements with widefield radio interferometers often include the near-infinite gradient between the sky and the horizon. This causes aliasing inherent to the measurement itself, and is purely a consequence of the Fourier basis. For this reason, the horizon is often attenuated by the instrumental beam down to levels deemed inconsequential. However, this effect is enhanced via our own Galactic plane as it sets over the course of a night. We show all-sky simulations of the Galactic plane setting in a radio interferometer in detail for the first time. We then apply these simulations to the Murchison Widefield Array to show that a beam attenuation of 0.1% is not sufficient in some precision science cases. We determine that the noise statistics of the residual data image are drastically more Gaussian with aliasing removal, and explore consequences in simulation for cataloging of extragalactic sources and 21 cm Epoch of Reionization detection via the power spectrum.</description>

      <title>Seismic and acoustic signals from the 2014 'Interstellar Meteor'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03966v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conduct a thorough analysis of seismic and acoustic data from the so-called `Interstellar Meteor' which entered the Earth's atmosphere off the coast of Papua New Guinea on 2014-01-08. We conclude that both previously-reported seismic signals are spurious -- one has characteristics suggesting a local vehicular-traffic based origin; whilst the other is statistically indistinguishable from the background noise. As such, previously-reported localisations based on this data are spurious. Analysis of acoustic data provides a best fit location estimate which is very far ($\sim$170~km) from the reported fireball location. Accordingly, we conclude that material recovered from the seafloor and purported to be from the meteor is almost certainly unrelated to it, and is likely of more mundane (non-interstellar) origin.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Space Situational Awareness to Mitigate Risk: A Single-Case Study in the Misidentification of a Recently-Launched Starlink Satellite Train as a UAP in Commercial Aviation</title>

Abstract: Over the past several years, the misidentification of SpaceX Starlink satellites as Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) by pilots and laypersons has generated unnecessary aviation risk and confusion. The many deployment and orbital evolution strategies, coupled with changing sun specular reflection angles, contribute to this gap in space situational awareness. In this paper we present a case analysis of an incident that generated multiple, corroborating reports of a UAP from five pilots on two commercial airline flights over the Pacific Ocean on August 10th, 2022. This incident included two cell phone photos and a video of an unrecognizable and possibly anomalous phenomenon. We then use supplemental two-line elements (TLEs) for the Starlink train of satellites launched that same day and Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) data from the flight with the photographs to reconstruct a view of these satellites from the cockpit at the time and place of the sighting. The success of this work demonstrates an approach that could, in principle, warn aviators about satellites that could be visible in unusual or novel illumination configurations, thus increasing space situational awareness and supporting aviation safety. We conclude with recommendations for governments and satellite operators to provide better a-priori data that can be used to create advisories to aviators and the public. The automated simulation of known specular reflection off constellations of satellites could also support researchers investigating sightings of unfamiliar aerial or aerospace objects as likely being from normal versus novel space events.</description>

      <title>Ultrastable lasers: investigations of crystalline mirrors and closed cycle cooling at 124 K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have investigated crystalline AlGaAs/GaAs optical coatings with three ultra-stable cavities operating at 4 K, 16 K, 124 K and 297 K. The response of the resonance frequencies of cavities to variations in optical power indicates effects beyond the photo-thermo-optic effect observed in dielectric coatings. These effects are strongly dependent on the intensity of the intracavity light at 1.5~\textmu m. When the rear side of the mirrors is illuminated with external light, we observe a prominent photo-modified birefringence for photon energies above the GaAs bandgap, which points to a possible mechanism relating our observations to the semiconductor properties of the coatings. Separately, we also present a low maintenance evolution of our 124 K silicon cavity system where the liquid nitrogen based cooling system is replaced with closed cycle cooling from a pulse-tube cryo-cooler.</description>

      <title>An Error-Bounded Lossy Compression Method with Bit-Adaptive Quantization for Particle Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents error-bounded lossy compression tailored for particle datasets from diverse scientific applications in cosmology, fluid dynamics, and fusion energy sciences. As today's high-performance computing capabilities advance, these datasets often reach trillions of points, posing significant visualization, analysis, and storage challenges. While error-bounded lossy compression makes it possible to represent floating-point values with strict pointwise accuracy guarantees, the lack of correlations in particle data's storage ordering often limits the compression ratio. Inspired by quantization-encoding schemes in SZ lossy compressors, we dynamically determine the number of bits to encode particles of the dataset to increase the compression ratio. Specifically, we utilize a k-d tree to partition particles into subregions and generate ``bit boxes'' centered at particles for each subregion to encode their positions. These bit boxes ensure error control while reducing the bit count used for compression. We comprehensively evaluate our method against state-of-the-art compressors on cosmology, fluid dynamics, and fusion plasma datasets.</description>
