      <title>Early massive galaxy formation in the core of a galaxy protocluster 650 million years after the Big Bang</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rest-frame optical observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have uncovered a population of massive galaxies, exceeding $10^{10}$ solar masses, present less than a billion years after the Big Bang. The large stellar masses of these galaxies require an efficient conversion of baryons into stars, which may exceed theoretical expectations. However, the formation process of massive galaxies so early in the Universe's history is perplexing, as observations provide limited information to constrain their evolutionary pathways. Here, we present multi-wavelength observations of a galaxy complex consisting of at least five galaxies within a $\sim10\,{\rm kpc}$ region, referred to as the \quintet, using JWST and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. This system, located in the core of a galaxy protocluster at approximately 650 million years after the Big Bang, reveals the detailed physical processes involved in the formation of massive galaxies. These processes include a dynamic cycles of merger induced gas stripping, leading the temporal termination of star formation, and recycling of the stripped gas, with subsequent enhancement of star formation in other galaxies of the system, which is expected to evolve into massive galaxies that host more than $10^{10}$ solar masses of stars. The new observations represent the first comprehensive evidence of a massive galaxy formation through gas-rich, multiple-galaxy mergers induced by a dense protocluster environment in the $650\,{\rm Myrs}$ after the Big Bang. Our results suggest that the protocluster core is indeed one of the main drivers of efficient galaxy formation and rapid evolution in the early Universe, as predicted by theoretical studies.</description>

      <title>The Blue Jay Survey: Deep JWST Spectroscopy for a Representative Sample of Galaxies at Cosmic Noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Blue Jay survey, a Cycle-1 JWST program aimed at studying the stellar and gas content of galaxies at Cosmic Noon. The survey consists of deep spectroscopy for 153 targets observed over two pointings in the COSMOS field using the NIRSpec micro-shutter assembly (MSA). We employ the three medium-resolution gratings G140M, G235M, and G395M, with exposure times of 13 hours, 3.2 hours, and 1.6 hours, respectively. We thus obtain full coverage of the 1-5 micron range, corresponding to the entire rest-frame optical wavelength range. The sample is carefully selected to provide a census of galaxies over the redshift range 1.7 &lt; z &lt; 3.5 above a redshift-dependent minimum stellar mass that ranges from 10^8.7 Msun to 10^9.3 Msun.The Blue Jay sample is representative of the entire galaxy population at these redshifts, without strong biases in color, star formation rate, or other properties. The sizes of massive galaxies at these redshifts are comparable to the NIRSpec shutters, which requires custom strategies for designing and reducing the observations. Since the standard A-B nod subtraction leads to flux self-subtraction, we construct a master background from empty shutters and subtract it from each of the science spectra. This, in turn, allows for the use of shorter slitlets consisting of only two shutters per galaxy instead of the usual three, with a substantial increase in the multiplexing of the NIRSpec MSA. We measure multi-band photometry using archival JWST and HST observations in two different ways: in a large elliptical aperture encompassing the entire source and from the exact area in the sky where the NIRSpec 1D spectrum is extracted. This enables self-consistent fits of spectroscopic and photometric data. The Blue Jay dataset, which we publicly release, represents the ideal sample for studying the stellar populations, neutral gas, and ionized gas in Cosmic Noon galaxies.</description>

      <title>The PHANGS-MUSE/HST-Halpha Nebulae Catalogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the PHANGS-MUSE/HST-Halpha nebulae catalogue, comprising 5177 spatially resolved nebulae across 19 nearby star-forming galaxies (&lt; 20 Mpc), based on high-resolution Halpha imaging from HST, homogenised to a fixed 10 pc resolution and sensitivity. Combined with MUSE spectroscopy, this enables robust classification of 4882 H II regions and separation of planetary nebulae and supernova remnants. Electron densities for 2544 H II regions are derived using [S II] diagnostics, and nebular sizes measured via circularised radii and second moments yield a median of 20 pc, extending to sub-parsec scales. A structural complexity score traces substructure, showing that about a third of regions are H II complexes, with a higher fraction in galaxy centres. A luminosity-size relation calibrated from the HST sample is applied to 30,790 MUSE nebulae, recovering sizes down to 1 pc. Observed sizes exceed classical Stromgren radii, implying typical volume filling factors of 0.22. We associate 3349 H II regions with stellar populations from PHANGS-HST, finding median ages of 3 Myr and masses of 4-5 log(Msun). The dataset provides a detailed, spatially resolved link between nebular structure and ionising sources, serving as a benchmark for future studies of feedback, diffuse ionised gas, and star formation regulation in the interstellar medium. The full catalogue is made publicly available in machine-readable format.</description>

      <title>Cross-correlation of Luminous Red Galaxies with ML-selected AGN in HSC-SSP III: HOD Parameters for Type I and Type II Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the dark matter (DM) halo environment in which galaxies that host active galactic nuclei (AGN) reside is a window into the nature of supermassive black hole (SMBH) accretion. We apply halo occupation distribution (HOD) modeling tools to interpret the angular cross-correlation functions between $1.5\times10^6$ luminous red galaxies (LRGs) and our $\sim28,500$ Hyper Suprime-Cam + Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer-selected (and $L_{6 \mu m}$-limited) AGN to infer the halo properties of distinct quasar samples at physical scales $s&gt;0.1\,{\rm Mpc}$, for $z\in0.7-1.0$. We find that Type I (unobscured) and Type II (obscured) AGN cluster differently, both on small and large physical scales. The derived HODs imply that Type I AGN reside, on average, in substantially ($\sim3\times$) more massive halos ($M_h \sim 10^{13.4} M_\odot$) than Type II AGN ($M_h \sim 10^{12.9} M_\odot$) at $&gt;5\sigma$ significance. While Type II AGN show one-halo correlations similar to that of galaxies of their average halo mass, the Type I AGN intra-halo clustering signal is significantly shallower. We interpret this observation with HOD methods and find Type I AGN are significantly less likely ($f_{sat}\sim0.05^{+1}_{-0.05}\%$) to be found in satellite galaxies than Type II AGN. We find reddened + obscured AGN to have typical satellite fractions for their inferred average halo mass ($\sim10^{13} M_\odot$), with $f_{sat} \sim 20^{+10}_{-5}\%$. Taken together, these results pose a significant challenge to the strict unified AGN morphological model, and instead suggest that a quasar's spectral class is strongly correlated with its host galaxy's dark matter halo environment. These intriguing results have provided a more complex picture of the SMBH -- DM halo connection, and motivate future analyses of the intrinsic galaxy and accretion properties of AGN.</description>

      <title>Connecting Cores and Black Hole Dynamics Across Scales: From Globular Clusters to Massive Ellipticals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The centers of massive elliptical galaxies exhibit a wide range in density profiles, from central cusps to resolved cores with order kiloparsec sizes. The cored ellipticals have been linked to the presence of supermassive black hole binaries that excavate their hosts' central stellar populations through three-body encounters. This connection between cores and black holes similarly operates in globular clusters, which also exhibit a bimodality in cored and core-collapsed architectures, respectively rich and depleted in stellar black holes. We report new estimates of the total black hole mass in 25 Galactic globular clusters based on a suite of roughly 150 Monte Carlo $N$-body simulations that fit observed surface brightness and velocity dispersion profiles. We show that both globular clusters and massive elliptical galaxies individually exhibit strong correlations between total black hole mass ($M_\bullet$) and core radius ($r_c$), and that these individual relations share a common power-law exponent to within $1\sigma$ statistical precision: $M_\bullet \sim r_c^{1.3}$. The individual relations appear to be offset, suggesting swarms of stellar black holes scour globular cluster cores more efficiently than lone supermassive black holes scour the cores of massive ellipticals. Yet the shared basis of core scouring via black hole binaries hints at a unified $M_{\bullet}-r_c$ connection across over 10 orders of magnitude in $M_\bullet$. Our findings imply core radius measurements may offer a powerful observational constraint on black hole merger rates, from kilohertz sources detectable by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA formed in globular clusters to millihertz and nanohertz sources formed in massive elliptical galaxies.</description>

      <title>ELPIS: Accelerated metal and dust enrichment in a proto-cluster core at $z\approx8$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of the metal, dust, and molecular gas content in galaxies within the A2744-z7p9OD proto-cluster at z ~ 7.88. We focus on two galaxy groups, the Quintet and the Chain, which are covered by the ELPIS survey (The Emission-Line Protocluster Imaging Survey of the furthest overdensity beyond Pandora's Cluster Abell 2744). [C II] 158 um emission is detected in five galaxies, revealing molecular gas reservoirs with log(M_gas/Msun) ~ 9.0-9.6, while dust continuum at the observed frame of 1.26 mm is detected in three galaxies, yielding dust masses of log(M_dust/Msun) ~ 6.0-6.4, assuming a dust temperature of T_dust = 45 (+15, -15) K. The derived properties, including stellar-to-dust mass ratios of log(M_dust/M_star) ~ -3 to -2 at log(M_star/Msun) ~ 9, and dust-to-gas mass ratios of log(M_dust/M_gas) ~ -4 to -3 at 12+log(O/H) ~ 8, place these galaxies in an intermediate regime: higher than the very low ratios expected from supernova-driven dust production, but still below the levels attained once efficient grain growth dominates. These values indicate a transition phase of dust mass assembly, likely reflecting the onset of grain growth via metal accretion under accelerated evolution in the proto-cluster core.</description>

      <title>Dwarf diversity in $\Lambda$CDM with baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observed rotation curves of dwarf galaxies exhibit significant diversity at fixed halo mass, challenging galaxy formation within the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model. Previous cosmological galaxy formation simulations with baryonic physics fail to reproduce the full diversity of rotation curves, suggesting either that there is a flaw in baryonic feedback models, or that an alternative to CDM must be invoked. In this work, we use the Marvelous Massive Dwarf zoom-in simulations, a suite of high-resolution dwarf simulations with $M_{200}~\sim 10^{10}-10^{11}$ ${\rm M}_{\odot}$ and $M_{*}\sim 10^{7}-10^{9}$ ${\rm M}_{\odot}$, designed to target the mass range where galaxy rotation curve diversity is maximized, i.e., between $V_{\rm max} \sim 70-100~ {\rm km/s}$. We add to this a set of low-mass galaxies from the Marvel Dwarf Zoom Volumes to extend the galaxy mass range to lower values. Our fiducial star formation and feedback models produce simulated dwarfs with a broader range of rotation curve shapes, similar to observations. These are the first simulations that can both create dark matter cores via baryonic feedback, reproducing the slower rising rotation curves, while also allowing for compact galaxies and steeply rising rotation curves. Our simulated dwarfs also reproduce the observed size$-M_*$ relation, including scatter, producing both extended and compact dwarfs for the first time in simulated field dwarfs. We explore star formation and feedback models and conclude that previous simulations may have had feedback that was too strong to produce compact dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Delayed phase mixing in the self-gravitating Galactic disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gaia phase spiral is considered to work as a dynamical clock for dating past perturbations, but most of the previous studies neglected the disc's self-gravity, potentially biasing estimates of the phase spiral's excitation time. We aim to evaluate the impact of self-gravitating effects on the evolution of vertical phase spirals and to quantify the bias introduced in estimating their excitation time when such effects are ignored. We analysed a high-resolution, self-consistent $N$-body simulation of the MW-Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (Sgr) system, alongside four test particle simulations in potentials contracted from the $N$-body snapshots. In each case, we estimated the winding time of phase spirals by measuring the slope of the density contrast in the vertical angle-frequency space. In test particle models, the phase spiral begins winding immediately after Sgr's pericentre passage, and the winding time closely tracks the true elapsed time since the Sgr's pericentre passage. Adding the DM wake yields only a modest (&lt; 100 Myr) reduction of the winding time relative to Sgr alone. By contrast, the self-consistent $N$-body simulation exhibits an initial, coherent vertical oscillation lasting $\gtrsim$ 300 Myr before a clear spiral forms, leading to systematic underestimation of excitation times. An analytical shearing-box model with self-gravity, developed by Widrow (2023), qualitatively reproduces this delay, supporting its origin in the disc's self-gravitating response. Assuming that self-gravity affects phase mixing in the MW to the same degree as the $N$-body model, the lag induced by self-gravity is estimated to be $\sim$ 0.3 Gyr in the solar neighbourhood. Accounting for this delay revises the inferred age of the MW's observed phase spiral to $\sim$0.6-1.2 Gyr, in better agreement with the Sgr's pericentre passage. (shortened for arXiv)</description>

      <title>GALACTICNUCLEUS: A high angular resolution JHKs imaging survey of the Galactic centre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The center of the Milky Way is a unique environment of great astrophysical interest, but its extreme crowding and extinction make it difficult to study. The GALACTICNUCLEUS survey, a high-angular-resolution near-infrared imaging program, was designed to overcome these challenges. We present the methodology and first results of its second data release, which includes major improvements in reduction, calibration, and analysis, providing deeper photometry, improved astrometry, and high-precision proper motions across the Nuclear Stellar Disk. Observations were obtained with VLT/HAWK-I in two epochs separated by seven years, using speckle holography and a ground-layer adaptive optics system. Proper motions were derived both relative, by aligning epochs within the survey, and absolute, by tying to the Gaia reference frame. The new release achieves photometry about one magnitude deeper and astrometry about ten times more precise than the first release. Proper motions reach an accuracy of about 0.5 mas/yr relative to Gaia. In the Arches field, our clustering analysis recovers the cluster with mean velocities consistent with HST-based results. The second data release of the GALACTICNUCLEUS survey provides the most precise ground-based proper motion catalogs of the Galactic Center to date, enabling studies of the Nuclear Stellar Disk, young star kinematics, and new stellar cluster detections.</description>

      <title>Deep JWST spectroscopy of galaxies in a candidate ionized bubble at $z = 8.7$: probing reionization at pMpc scales with Ly$\alpha$ emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong Ly$\alpha$ emission observed from galaxies when the Universe is expected to be highly neutral is thought to trace large ionized regions that facilitate the transmission of Ly$\alpha$ through the IGM. In this work, we use deep JWST Ly$\alpha$ spectroscopy to constrain the size of a candidate ionized bubble at $z\sim8.7$ in the EGS field, with a potential radius of $R_b=2$ physical Mpc (pMpc) or larger. We measure a photometric galaxy density and find that the volume is a factor of $\sim2.5-3.6$ overdense, suggesting that there may be a large population of galaxies capable of creating an $R_b\sim2$ pMpc bubble. Then, we infer the Ly$\alpha$ transmission through the IGM for galaxies in the EGS volume using our deep spectroscopy, finding $\mathcal{T}_{\rm IGM}=0.26_{-0.14}^{+0.25}$. This transmission is consistent with the average at $z\sim9$ and is mildly inconsistent with the transmission expected for an $R_b\sim2$ pMpc bubble ($\mathcal{T}_{\rm IGM, 2{\rm pMpc}}=0.53-0.63$), implying that such a large bubble is unlikely to be present. However, the photometric galaxy density in the EGS field is larger than in several other deep fields. This overdensity and the moderate Ly$\alpha$ transmission may be consistent with smaller, $R_b\sim0.5-1$ pMpc bubbles in EGS. This additionally motivates the need for future wider area Ly$\alpha$ spectroscopy in EGS and other fields to obtain a more representative understanding of the sizes of ionized bubbles in the early stages of reionization, and the properties of the galaxies that create them.</description>

      <title>Using gravitational lensing to probe for bright quintessential galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the properties of the first generation of galaxies is an ongoing challenge in observational astrophysics. While advances in deep field observation have led to the identification of large numbers of galaxies within the Epoch of Reionization, there are very few observed galaxies at this range that are sufficiently bright for high signal-to-noise spectroscopy. To this end, we analyse HST and ground-based photometry of five candidate strongly lensed galaxies, all projected behind the cores of massive clusters and with similarly red optical-NIR colors. All are characterized by a drop-off in their spectra between the near-infrared and optical wavelengths, corresponding to a Lyman-break that sets a lower bound on their redshifts. Using the open-source SED modeling software Prospector, we characterize two of these galaxies as high-z (z $\sim$ 6.5-7) while the other three are low-z (z $\sim$ 2) despite all five having similar apparent magnitudes at the observed wavelengths. We demonstrate that for the brightest dropout candidates we can distinguish high-z galaxies from red or dusty low-z galaxies using limited photometric data. The bright sources enable deep constraints on the dropout color which, in combination with flat continua measured in redder bands, require high-z solutions when searching the parameter space. At the time of writing this work significantly increases the number of m_AB &lt; 24 galaxies at or above a redshift of 6, and provides a path forward for future analysis on the early era of galaxy formation</description>

      <title>A Possible Shutting-Down Event of Mass Accretion in An Active Galactic Nucleus at z~1.8</title>

Abstract: We present the discovery of a large gradual apparent fading event in optical and near-infrared wavelengths in a quasar at z=1.767 by a factor of 20-30 (in optical) over a period of ~20 years in the observed frame. This pronounced fading trend in brightness was first identified by comparing the magnitudes measured in the Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) images with those in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) images for ~3x10^4 quasars spectroscopically identified by SDSS. We performed follow-up observations, including optical imaging and spectroscopy as well as near-infrared imaging, with &gt;4m-class telescopes such as Subaru, GTC, Keck, and SOAR telescopes. We combine these new data with the archival data to examine the variability behavior over ~20 years in detail and even the longer-term trend of the variability over ~70 years in the observed frame. We find that (i) the AGN component likely faded by a factor of ~50 from the early 2000s to 2023 and (ii) the observed brightness decline is best explained by a substantial decrease in accretion rate rather than time-varying line-of-sight dust obscuration. These findings are derived from multi-component (time-varying AGN + constant galaxy) spectral energy distribution fitting over multi-epochs, which is well consistent with the optical spectra. The Eddington ratio decreases by a factor of ~50, from ~0.4 to ~0.008 if we use the black hole mass measured with the SDSS spectrum, which could be highly uncertain because of the very large variability. The total brightness is dominated by the host galaxy in the rest-frame optical wavelength rather than the AGN as of 2023.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Brightest: A Deep Learning Approach to Identifying Major and Minor Galaxy Mergers in CANDELS at $z \sim 1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy mergers play an important role in many aspects of galaxy evolution, therefore, more accurate merger identifications are paramount for achieving a complete understanding of galaxy evolution. As we enter the era of very large imaging surveys, we are able to observe mergers extending to even lower masses and higher redshifts. Despite low-mass galaxies being more common, many previous merger identification methods were mostly calibrated for high-mass, local galaxies, which are easier to identify. To prepare for upcoming surveys, we train a convolutional neural network (CNN) using mock $\textit{HST}$ CANDELS images at $z \sim 1$ created from the IllustrisTNG50 cosmological simulation. We successfully identify galaxy mergers between a wide range of galaxies ($10^8M_\odot &lt; M_\star &lt; 10^{12.5}M_\odot$, and $\mu &gt;1:10$), achieving overall accuracy, purity, and completeness of $\sim73\%$. We show, for the first time, that a CNN trained on this diverse set of galaxies is capable of identifying both major and minor mergers, early and late stage mergers, as well as nonmerging galaxies, similar to that of networks trained at lower redshifts and/or higher masses (with accuracies ranging between $66-80\%$) for the first time. We discuss the inherent limits of galaxy merger identification due to orientation angle and explore the confounding variables, such as star formation, to consider when applying to real data. This network enables the exploration of the impact of previously overlooked mergers of high mass ratio and low stellar masses on galaxy evolution in CANDELS, and can be expanded to surveys from $\textit{JWST}$, Rubin, $\textit{Roman}$, and $\textit{Euclid}$.</description>

      <title>The AURORA Survey: Ionizing Photon Production Efficiency with Minimal Nebular Dust Attenuation Systematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present ionizing photon production efficiencies (${\xi}_{\rm ion}$) for 63 z=1.5-6.9 star-forming galaxies using precise nebular dust attenuation corrections from the JWST/AURORA survey. A subset of objects within AURORA have individually-determined nebular dust attenuation curves, which vary significantly in shape and normalization, resulting in reduced systematic uncertainty when constraining the total attenuation of H${\alpha}$ luminosity, and thus the intrinsic ionizing output within our sample. We find evidence for positive correlations between ${\xi}_{\rm ion}$ and redshift, equivalent width of [OIII]${\lambda}$5007, and O32=[OIII]${\lambda}$5007/[OII]${\lambda}$3726,3729, and negative correlations between ${\xi}_{\rm ion}$ and stellar attenuation, UV luminosity (L$_{\rm UV}$), stellar mass, and direct-method metallicity. We test alternate dust prescriptions within this sample, and find that the total attenuation is lower when using the commonly-assumed Galactic extinction curve or when assuming that stellar attenuation is equal to nebular attenuation. We also find that assuming either of these alternate dust prescriptions can change the slope of relationships between ${\xi}_{\rm ion}$ and galaxy property, notably inducing a flat trend between ${\xi}_{\rm ion}$ and L$_{\rm UV}$ within AURORA. While the novel nebular dust curves derived from AURORA spectroscopy reveal obscured ionizing photon production within star-forming galaxies at these redshifts, a more complete understanding of stellar attenuation is required to fully reduce dust systematics on ${\xi}_{\rm ion}$ for inclusion in reionization models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review recent advances in the numerical modeling of turbulent flows and star formation. An overview of the most widely used simulation codes and their core capabilities is provided. We then examine methods for achieving the highest-resolution magnetohydrodynamical turbulence simulations to date, highlighting challenges related to numerical viscosity and resistivity. State-of-the-art approaches to modeling gravity and star formation are discussed in detail, including implementations of star particles and feedback from jets, winds, heating, ionization, and supernovae. We review the latest techniques for radiation hydrodynamics, including ray tracing, Monte Carlo, and moment methods, with comparisons between the flux-limited diffusion, moment-1, and variable Eddington tensor methods. The final chapter summarizes advances in cosmic-ray transport schemes, emphasizing their growing importance for connecting small-scale star formation physics with galaxy-scale evolution.</description>

      <title>A census of quiescent galaxies across $0.5 &lt; z &lt; 8$ with JWST/MIRI: Mass-dependent number density evolution of quiescent galaxies in the early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST observations reveal numerous quiescent galaxies (QGs) at high redshift ($z \sim 4-8$), challenging models of early galaxy formation and quenching. Accurate number density estimates are crucial for comparison with theory but remain uncertain. We systematically study QGs at $0.5 &lt; z &lt; 8$ using a mass-complete sample from the JWST/PRIMER survey with deep NIRCam and MIRI imaging. The MIRI data, probing rest-frame near-infrared at $z \sim 3-8$, are vital for robust stellar mass measurement and QG identification. We find that nearly all photometrically selected, point-like QG candidates located in the UVJ QG region are actually "Little Red Dots", for which the UVJ colors were wrongly estimated due to inaccurate photometric redshift estimation. MIRI reduces significantly contamination to high-mass QGs from star-forming galaxies, yielding lower number densities than previous studies. The evolution of QG number density is strongly mass-dependent. The density of high-mass QGs ($\log (M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) &gt; 10.3$) decreases rapidly from $n = 1\times10^{-5}~\mathrm{Mpc^{-3}}$ at $z=3-4$ to $n=2\times10^{-6}~\mathrm{Mpc^{-3}}$ at $z = 4-5$, becoming negligible ($n \lesssim 10^{-6}~\mathrm{Mpc^{-3}}$ ) at $z &gt; 5$. Conversely, low-mass QGs ($9&lt;\log (M_{\star}/M_{\odot})&lt;10.3$) maintain a nearly constant number density ($n\sim3\times10^{-6}~\mathrm{Mpc^{-3}}$) across $z = 4-8$. This suggests low-mass QGs at $z &gt; 4$ are likely temporarily quenched, akin to mini-quenched galaxies. Comparison with major hydrodynamical and semi-analytical models shows most underestimate high-mass QG densities at $z&gt;4$ and fail to reproduce the constant low-mass QG density at $z&gt;5$.</description>

      <title>Is Milky Way stable all the way ? A TNG50 view from cosmic noon to the present day</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of Milky Way analogs (MWAs) in the \texttt{TNG50} simulation against the growth of local axisymmetric instabilities, tracing their evolution from cosmic noon ($z=2.5$) to the present day ($z=0$). Using a two-component stability criterion that accounts for stars, gas, and the force field of the dark matter halo, we compute the net stability parameter ($Q_{T}$), the critical gas surface density ($\Sigma_{c}$), and the instability timescale ($\tau$) for 10 barred and 10 unbarred MWAs. We find that these galaxies remain stable to axisymmetric instabilities at all epochs, with $Q_{T}^{\min}&gt;2$. The stability levels increase toward higher redshift, where enhanced gas velocity dispersion counterbalances the destabilizing effect of larger gas fractions. Further, the barred MWAs consistently show lower $Q_{T}^{\min}$ than unbarred ones. The gas density remains subcritical ($\Sigma_{g}&lt;\Sigma_{c}$) across radii and epochs, implying that local axisymmetric instabilities are not the primary channel for star formation. Growth timescales are short (a few Myr) in central regions but increase exponentially to several Gyr in the outer disc, naturally explaining the concentration of star formation toward galactic centers. We study the effect of gas dissipation and turbulence in ISM and find that while MWAs are stable against axisymmetric instabilities $(Q_{T}&gt;1)$, a combination of gas dissipation and turbulence in ISM can destabilize the disc at small scales even when $Q_{T}&gt;1$.</description>

      <title>Hidden Figures of Globular Clusters: Integrated Stellar Populations Impacted by Hot Subdwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Globular clusters (GCs) are fundamental for understanding the integrated light of old stellar populations and galaxy assembly processes. However, the role of hot, evolved stars, such as horizontal branch (HB), extreme HB, and blue stragglers, remains poorly constrained. These stars are often underrepresented or entirely excluded from stellar population models, despite their dominant contribution to the ultraviolet (UV) flux. Their presence can bias age estimates by mimicking the spectral signatures of younger populations. We examined the impact of evolved hot stars on the models using two well-studied Galactic GCs with high-quality Hubble Space Telescope photometry and integrated spectra from the International Ultraviolet Explorer and the Blanco Telescope. NGC 2808 and NGC 7089 (M 2) have extended HBs and are proxies for old stellar populations. Integrated spectra were constructed using a color magnitude diagram-based (CMD-based) method, matching observed stars to evolutionary phases and then to appropriate synthetic stellar libraries, enabling the HB morphology to be taken into account. Our findings show that the inclusion of evolved hot stars significantly improves the agreement between the model and observed spectra from the UV to the optical. The inclusion of these phases reduced the residuals in spectral comparisons. Our results reinforce that comprehensive stellar population models incorporating evolved hot components are essential to accurately date unresolved systems and to robustly trace formation histories of extragalactic galaxies.</description>

      <title>Association of cold gas, massive galaxies, and AGNs in a filamentary protocluster traced by triple narrow-band imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate galaxy populations in the HS1700+64 protocluster at $z=2.30$, characterized by two prominent linear filaments traced by spatially extended Ly$\alpha$ blobs. We conducted a wide area mapping of emission line galaxies across the protocluster using the unique combination of three matched narrow-band filters, corresponding to Ly$\alpha$, H$\alpha$, and [OIII] emission lines at $z=2.30$. We find that H$\alpha$ emitters are strongly clustered at the intersection of the filaments, suggesting a protocluster core. In contrast, Ly$\alpha$ emitters tend to avoid the dense region and the filaments, likely due to the resonant scattering of Ly$\alpha$ photons by HII gas and/or enhanced dust attenuation in galaxies associated with these structures. These findings support a scenario in which cold gas flows via filaments and to the core, fed by the cold-stream mode accretion in the early phase of protocluster assembly, and promoting active star formation there. Further evidence of the scenario comes from the alignment of massive, evolved galaxies in those filaments traced by distant red galaxies, suggesting accelerated galaxy growth in the filaments in the early Universe. This study clearly shows observationally that accelerated galaxy formation takes place not only in the protocluster core but also in the associated surrounding filamentary structure. This underscores the critical role of large-scale filaments in efficiently accumulating the cold gas and channeling it to galaxies therein and to the protocluster core. Such vigorous gas assembly facilitates star formation activity and drives galaxy growth in the early stage of cluster formation.</description>

      <title>Extremely UV-bright starbursts at the end of cosmic reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of 27 very UV-bright (-22.0&lt;MUV&lt;-24.4) sources at z~6 identified in SHELLQs survey. Stacking their rest-frame UV spectra reveals a prominent NV1240A P-Cygni, consistent with very young (~6Myr) stellar populations dominated by massive stars. They are thus powerful and efficient ionizing starbursts with an average ionizing photon production efficiency of log(Xi_ion/Hz erg-1)=25.54. For one of these, J0217-0208 at z=6.2 (MUV=-23.4), we analyzed NIRCam and NIRSpec data. Its SED indicates a young (~5Myr), compact (reff~260pc) starburst with a stellar mass of 10^9Msun and high sSFR (~100Gyr^-1). This translates to high stellar mass and SFR surface densities, about 100x higher than typical galaxies at similar redshifts. NIRSpec further reveals strong nebular emission, for which we derive a high electron density (~10^3 cm^-3), a metallicity 12+log(O/H)=8.20 (from the direct method), and a super-solar N/O ratio (log(N/O)=-0.30). Furthermore, J0217-0208 shows broad components in several rest-optical lines, indicating powerful ionized outflows, which appear heavily obscured (E(B-V)~0.6), in contrast to the nearly dust-free stellar continuum (E(B-V)~0.01). Combined with ALMA detections of a massive, extended, and cold dust reservoir, these findings point to dusty, feedback-driven outflows carrying and pushing dust well beyond the stellar core, boosting the observed UV luminosity. Our results suggest that UV-bright galaxies at high redshift represent short-lived but extreme phases of rapid stellar mass growth, efficient ionizing photon production, and strong feedback. The extreme properties of J0217-0208, such as supersolar N/O, steep UV slope, compact size, and very high surface densities, closely mirror those of the brightest galaxies at z&gt;10, suggesting a shared evolutionary pathway.[Abridged]</description>

      <title>Jets in Low-Mass Protostars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jets and outflows are key components of low-mass star formation, regulating accretion and shaping the surrounding molecular clouds. These flows, traced by molecular species at (sub)millimeter wavelengths (e.g., CO, SiO, SO, H$_2$CO, and CH$_3$OH) and by atomic, ionized, and molecular lines in the infrared (e.g., H$_2$, [Fe II], [S I]), originate from protostellar accretion disks deeply embedded within dusty envelopes. Jets play a crucial role in removing angular momentum from the disk, thereby enabling continued mass accretion, while directly preserving a record of the protostar's outflow history and potentially providing indirect insights into its accretion history. Recent advances in high-resolution, high-sensitivity observations, particularly with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in the infrared and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at (sub)millimeter wavelengths, have revolutionized studies of protostellar jets and outflows. These instruments provide complementary views of warm, shock-excited gas and cold molecular component of the jet-outflow system. In this review, we discuss the current status of observational studies that reveal detailed structures, kinematics, and chemical compositions of protostellar jets and outflows. Recent analyses of mass-loss rates, velocities, rotation, molecular abundances, and magnetic fields provide critical insights into jet launching mechanisms, disk evolution, and the potential formation of binary systems and planets. The synergy of JWST's infrared sensitivity and ALMA's high-resolution imaging is advancing our understanding of jets and outflows. Future large-scale, high-resolution surveys with these facilities are expected to drive major breakthroughs in outflow research.</description>

      <title>Faint galaxies in the Zone of Avoidance revealed by JWST/NIRCam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Zone of Avoidance (ZoA) remains one of the last frontiers in constructing a comprehensive three-dimensional map of the Universe. Galactic extinction, stellar crowding, and confusion noise have historically limited the detection of background galaxies in these regions, with implications for large-scale structure and cosmological measurements. We assess the capability of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) to detect extragalactic sources in a heavily contaminated region of the Milky Way. We analyzed JWST/NIRCam wide-filter images of NGC 3324 with a customized implementation of SExtractor v2.28. Sources were detected in the F444W band, cross-matched with F090W and F200W, and validated against recent DAOPHOT point spread function (PSF) photometry. A refined sample was obtained through full width at half maximum (FWHM) - signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) criteria and visual inspection. We identified 102 galaxies across the JWST/NIRCam field of view. The magnitude (F444W) distribution is bimodal, with about 10% brighter than m_F444W &lt; 15 mag and about 60% in the range 17 &lt; m_F444W &lt; 19 mag. Typical sizes are FWHM ~6.5 arcsec, from compact to extended systems with isophotal areas up to ~2000 pixels (~7.9 arcsec^2). Morphologies span from compact to spiral and lenticular systems, including a compact group at the eastern edge of the field. We also report the detection of "transnebular galaxies", visible through the most opaque regions of the molecular cloud. These results demonstrate the potential of JWST/NIRCam to probe extragalactic sources through highly obscured Galactic regions, opening new avenues for mapping large-scale structures across the ZoA.</description>

      <title>A Catalog of Filaments in the Central Molecular Zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a catalog of 1.28 GHz radio filaments observed by MeerKAT over the innermost 200 pc of the Galaxy (roughly $\pm 1.5\deg$), which includes the central molecular zone (CMZ). The catalog is generated by repurposing software developed for the automated detection of filaments in solar coronal loops. There are two parts to the catalog. The first part, the main catalog, provides a point-by-point listing of locations and basic observational properties along each detected filament. The second part is a summary catalog which provides a listing of mean, median, or total values of various properties for each filament. Tabulated quantities include position, length, curvature, brightness, and spectral index. The catalogs contain a heterogeneous mix of filamentary structures, including nonthermal radio filaments (NRFs), and parts of supernova remnants (SNRs) and thermally emitting regions (e.g. H II regions). We discuss criteria for selecting useful subsamples of filaments from the catalogs, and some of the details encountered in examining filaments or selections of filaments from the catalogs.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Reverberation Mapping for SARM: The Case of Mrk 1048 and Mrk 618</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust extragalactic distance measurements are crucial for resolving the persistent discrepancy in the value of the Hubble constant (H$_0$)). Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), through their compact and variable broad-line regions (BLRs), enable the determination of geometric distances when reverberation mapping (RM) is combined with spectroastrometry(SA). We report results from a spectroscopic RM campaign (October 2022 to March 2023) targeting two narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies, Mrk 1048 and Mrk 618, using 3.6-m DOT and 2-m HCT. High-cadence spectro-photometric monitoring was carried out using onboard instruments such as ADFOSC, HFOSC, and TANSPEC, resulting in well-sampled continuum and emission line light curves. The observed fractional variability ($F_{\mathrm{var}}$) ranged from 4% to 14% across the $g$-band, H$\beta$, and H$\alpha$ light curves. The time lags were measured using the interpolated cross-correlation function (ICCF), PyI$^{2}$CCF, and \textsc{JAVELIN} methods. In the rest frame, the ICCF analysis yields H$\beta$ lags of $10.5^{+2.6}_{-4.2}$ days for Mrk 1048 and $10.2^{+3.4}_{-2.9}$ days for Mrk 618, while the corresponding H$\alpha$ lags are $18.7^{+5.3}_{-5.4}$ and $14.4^{+4.6}_{-10.5}$ days, respectively. The emission-line widths, measured from the rms spectra using $\sigma_{\mathrm{line}}$, give virial black hole mass estimates of $6.3^{+2.0}_{-2.1} \times 10^7\,M_\odot$ for Mrk 1048 and $1.2^{+0.4}_{-0.6} \times 10^7\,M_\odot$ for Mrk 618. These results will serve as a basis for absolute geometric distance calibration when combined with VLTI/GRAVITY spectro-astrometric measurements, thereby contributing to the development of AGNs as standardizable cosmological probes.</description>

      <title>Widespread Hot Molecular Gas Heated by Shear-induced Turbulence in the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We observed NH3 metastable inversion lines from (3, 3) to (18, 18) toward G0.66-0.13 in the Galactic center with the Shanghai Tianma 65m radio telescope and Yebes 40 m telescope. Highly-excited lines of NH3 (17, 17), (18, 18) were detected in emission for the first time in the interstellar medium, with upper energy levels up to 3100 K. Mapping observations reveal widespread hot molecular gas traced by NH3 (13, 13) toward G0.66-0.13. The rotation temperatures of hot gas traced by NH3 exceed 400 K, which amounts to five percent of the total NH3 in the Galactic Center. Hot gas (&gt;400 K) and warm gas (100-140 K) are found in distinct clumps, with the hot gas located at the interfacing regions between different warm clouds. The theory of intermittency in turbulence reproduces the complex temperature structure in the central molecular zone, especially the hot gas observed here. The results presented here demonstrate that turbulence heating dominates the heating of the molecular gas in the Central Molecular Zone, while the turbulence is induced by the shear-motion of molecular clouds under the gravitational potential of the nuclear star clusters and the supermassive black hole. Our results suggest that shear-induced turbulence heating could be a widespread factor influencing galactic evolution.</description>

      <title>Cloudy with a chance of starshine: Possible photometric signatures of nebular-dominated emission in $1.5 &lt; z &lt; 8.5$ JADES galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of high-redshift galaxies exhibiting a steep spectral UV downturn potentially indicative of two-photon continuum emission marks a turning point in our search for signatures of top-heavy star formation in the early Universe. We develop a photometric search method for identifying further nebular-dominated galaxy candidates, whose nebular continuum dominates over the starlight, due to the high ionising photon production efficiencies $\xi_\mathrm{ion}$ associated with massive star formation. We utilise the extensive medium-band imaging from JADES, which enables the identification of Balmer jumps across a wide range of redshifts ($1.5 &lt; z &lt; 8.5$), through the deficit in rest-frame optical continuum level. As Balmer jumps are a general recombination feature of young starbursts ($\lesssim 3$~Myr), we further demand a high observed $\log\, (\xi_\mathrm{ion, obs}/\mathrm{(Hz\ erg^{-1})}) &gt; 25.60$ to power the strong nebular continuum, together with a relatively non-blue UV slope indicating a lack of stellar continuum emission. Our nebular-dominated candidates, constituting ${\sim}$10% of galaxies at $z \sim 6$ (decreasing to ${\sim}$3% at $z \sim 2$, not completeness-corrected) are faint in the rest-frame optical (median $M_\mathrm{opt} = -17.95$) with extreme line emission (median $\mathrm{EW}_\mathrm{H\alpha,rest} = 1567$ \AA, $\mathrm{EW}_\mathrm{[O\ III] + H\beta,rest} = 2244$ \AA). However, hot H II region temperatures, collisionally-enhanced two-photon continuum emission, and strong UV lines are expected to accompany top-heavy star formation. Thus nebular-dominated galaxies do not necessarily exhibit the biggest Balmer jumps, nor the largest $\xi_\mathrm{ion, obs}$ or reddest UV slopes. Hence continuum spectroscopy is ultimately required to establish the presence of a two-photon downturn in our candidates, thus advancing our understanding of primordial star formation and AGN.</description>

      <title>Searching for Stellar-Feedback-Driven Outflow Signatures: A Deep Dive into NGC 3741</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar feedback drives winds and outflows critical to the baryon cycles of low-mass galaxies whose shallow gravitational potential wells make them particularly susceptible to mass and metal loss through outflows. However, spatially resolved observations of stellar-feedback-driven outflows are limited due to their low-surface brightness and transient nature. We present the pilot of a larger multi-wavelength study searching for and quantifying stellar-feedback-driven winds and outflows on both spatially and globally resolved scales for a sample of 40 nearby low-mass galaxies. We search for outflow signatures in the star-forming dwarf galaxy NGC 3741 using new optical imaging and spectroscopy from the WIYN 3.5m telescope in conjunction with VLA 21cm observations and local star formation histories derived from resolved HST photometry. With this extensive dataset, we compare the neutral and ionized gas morphologies and kinematics, calculate mass-loading factors, and investigate spatial variations in the star formation history of NGC 3741. Though the galaxy is experiencing a burst in star formation, we find little evidence of strong outflows and calculate very low mass-loading factors. We suggest that, though star formation activity has increased dramatically in the central region of the galaxy over the last 40 Myr, the star formation rate is not high enough to produce a sufficient amount of high mass stars responsible for fueling outflows. Future analysis of the larger sample will allow us to explore how stellar feedback impacts mass loss on local scales, providing a deeper understanding of the interplay between stellar feedback and the interstellar medium in low-mass galaxies.</description>

      <title>Interacting galaxies in the IllustrisTNG simulations - IX: Mini mergers trigger AGN in cosmological simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy mergers are transformative events that can cause gaseous inflows capable of triggering active galactic nuclei (AGN). Previous studies of AGN in simulations have mainly focused on major interactions (i.e. between approximately equal mass galaxies), which produce the strongest inflows and, therefore, would be the most likely to trigger AGN activity. However, minor interactions are far more common and may still enhance accretion onto supermassive black holes. We present an analysis of post-merger galaxies from the IllustrisTNG simulation with stellar mass ratios of $\mu&gt;$1:100. We select post-mergers from the TNG50-1 simulation, from redshifts $0\leq z&lt; 1$, with stellar masses greater than $10^{10}M_{\odot}$. We find an AGN excess in post-mergers with a stellar mass ratio as low as 1:40. The AGN excess is mass ratio and luminosity dependent, with 1.2-1.6 times more AGN found in post-mergers of 1:40$\leq \mu &lt; $1:4 than in matched non-merger controls, and as many as 6 times more AGN found in major $\mu \geq$1:4 post-mergers. The AGN excess is long lived, between 500 Myr to 1 Gyr post-coalescence, across all of the mass ratio regimes. We demonstrate that the most luminous AGN in the simulation overwhelmingly occur in either post-mergers or pairs (with $\mu \geq $1:40). Finally, we demonstrate that mini mergers are likely to be overlooked in observational studies due to the weakness of features usually associated with recent merger activity, such as tidal streams and shells, making it challenging to completely account for merger-induced AGN activity even in deep galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>Visual morphological classification of the full MaNGA DR17 sample: a general characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the MaNGA Visual Morphology (MVM) catalogue, featuring a visual morphological classification of 10,059 galaxies in the final MaNGA sample. By combining SDSS and DESI Legacy Survey (DLS) images, we classified galaxies into 13 Hubble types, detected tidal features, categorized bars into different families, and estimated concentration, asymmetry, and clumpiness. The depth of the DLS images allowed us to identify structural details that were not evident in the SDSS images, resulting in a more reliable classification. After correcting for volume completeness, we find a bimodal distribution in galaxy morphology, with peaks in S0 and Scd types, and a transition zone around S0a-Sa types. Bars are present in 54% of disc galaxies with inclinations &lt; 70, following a bimodal trend with peaks in Sab-Sb and Scd-Sd types. Tidal structures are identified in ~13% of galaxies, particularly in massive E-Sa and low-mass Sdm-Irr galaxies. We derive the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) and decompose it into each morphological type. Schechter functions accurately describe the latter, while a triple Schechter function describes the total GSMF, associating three characteristic masses with different galaxy types. The abundance of early-type galaxies remains constant at low masses; they are predominantly satellites. We confirm that later-type galaxies are generally younger, bluer, more star-forming, and less metal-rich compared to early-type galaxies. Additionally, we find evidence connecting morphology and stellar mass to the star formation history of galaxies. The MVM catalogue provides a robust dataset for investigating galaxy evolution, secular processes, and machine learning-based morphological classifications.</description>

      <title>MESA-QUEST: Tracing the formation of direct collapse black hole seeds via quasi-stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of the first supermassive black holes (SMBHs) observed at redshifts $z\geq 9$ remains one of the most challenging open questions in astrophysics. Their rapid emergence suggests that massive ``heavy seeds'' must have formed early, possibly through the direct collapse of pristine gas clouds in the first galaxies. We present MESA-QUEST, a new framework built upon the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) code, designed to model the structure and evolution of quasi-stars -- massive, radiation-supported envelopes hosting accreting black holes at their cores -- believed to be the progenitors of direct-collapse black hole (DCBH) seeds. Our implementation introduces flexible boundary conditions representing both Bondi accretion and saturated-convection regimes, and explores the impact of several stellar wind and mass-loss prescriptions, including Reimers, Dutch, and super-Eddington radiation-driven winds. We find that quasi-stars can grow central black holes to $\geq 10^3\,M_{\odot}$ under favorable conditions, with saturated-convection models yielding BH-to-total mass ratios up to 0.55$M_*$ -- five times higher than Bondi-limited cases. However, strong radiation-driven winds can dramatically curtail growth, potentially quenching heavy-seed formation unless balanced by sustained envelope accretion. Our results delineate the physical limits under which quasi-stars can remain stable and produce heavy seeds capable of evolving into the earliest SMBHs detected by JWST and Chandra. Future extensions will incorporate rotation, magnetic fields, and GR-radiation hydrodynamics to refine accretion physics and constrain the viability of the quasi-star pathway for early SMBH formation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cometary activity from interstellar objects provides a unique window into the environs of other stellar systems. We report blue-sensitive integral field unit spectroscopy of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS from the Keck-II-mounted Keck Cosmic Web Imager on August 24, 2025 UT. We confirm previously reported CN and Ni outgassing, and present, for the first time, the radial profiles of Ni and CN emission in 3I/ATLAS. We find a characteristic $e$-folding radius of $593.7\pm14.8$ km for Ni and $841.0\pm15.4$ km for CN; this suggests that the Ni emission is more centrally concentrated in the nucleus of the comet and favors hypotheses involving easily dissociated species such as metal carbonyls or metal-polycyclic-aromatic-hydrocarbon molecules. Additional integral field spectroscopy after perihelion will offer a continued opportunity to determine the evolution of the radial distributions of species in interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS.</description>

      <title>False Alarm Rates in Detecting Gravitational Wave Lensing from Astrophysical Coincidences: Insights with Model-Independent Technique GLANCE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strong lensing gravitational waves (GWs) due to intervening massive astrophysical systems between the source and an observer are an inevitable consequence of the general theory of relativity, which can produce multiple GW events in overlapping sky localization error. However, the confirmed detection of such a unique astrophysical phenomenon is challenging due to several sources of contamination, arising from detector noise to astrophysical uncertainties. Robust model-independent search techniques that can mitigate noise contamination were developed in the past. In this study, we explore the astrophysical uncertainty associated with incorrectly classifying a pair of unlensed GW events as a lensed event, and the associated False Alarm Rate (FAR) depending on the GW source properties. To understand the effect of unlensed astrophysical GW sources in producing false lensing detections, we have performed a model-independent test using the pipeline GLANCE on a simulated population of merging binary-black holes (BBHs). We find that $\sim$ 0.01\% of the event pairs can be falsely classified as lensed with a lensing threshold signal-to-noise ratio of 1.5, appearing at a time delay between the event pairs of $\sim$ 1000 days or more. We show the FAR distribution for the parameter space of GW source masses, delay time, and lensing magnification parameter over which the model-independent technique GLANCE can confidently detect lensed GW pair with the current LIGO detector sensitivity. In the future, this technique will be useful for understanding the FAR of the upcoming next-generation GW detectors, which can observe many more GW sources.</description>

Abstract: It is shown how the well-known formula for the gravitational energy of self-gravitating regular polytropes of finite mass can be obtained in an elementary way by using Gauss's divergence theorem and the Chandrasekhar virial tensor, without resorting to lengthy algebra, to specific properties of Lane-Emden functions, and to thermodynamics arguments, as is instead commonly found in standard treatises and in astrophysical literature. The present approach, due to its simplicity, can be particularly useful to students and researchers, and it can be easily applied to the study of more complicated polytropic structures.</description>

      <title>Short-Lived Radioisotopic enrichment from AGB interlopers in low-mass star-forming regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The decay of Short-Lived Radioisotopes (SLRs) can be a significant source of heating early in protoplanetary systems, though how a protoplanetary disk becomes enriched with these SLRs far above the galactic background level remains an open question. Observational evidence suggests that this enrichment occurs during the period from when the disk forms to when it progresses into a protoplanetary system, and is homogenous throughout the resultant planetary system. Whilst SLRs such as 26Al and 60Fe can be injected into disks through interaction with Wolf-Rayet winds and supernovae, these outflows can disrupt disks, and in the case of low-mass star-forming regions high-mass stars may not form at all. Recent research has determined the existence of AGB ``interlopers'', Asymptotic Giant Branch stars that pass close to or through star-forming regions that could be an alternative source of SLR enrichment to WR winds and supernovae. In this paper we study the effect of AGB interlopers on star-forming regions from a dynamical perspective, determining the enrichment amount of 26Al and 60Fe in disks within small clusters via numerous N-body simulations via a parameter space exploration. We find that enrichment is widespread from AGB stars, with efficient enrichment dependent on the time at which the interloper intersects the star-forming region. Velocity is a factor, though interlopers travelling at 30 km/s are capable of enriching many disks in a star-forming region assuming they encounter a disk when the interloper is more evolved.</description>

      <title>YSO Variability in the W51 Star-Forming Region</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-domain studies of mid-infrared and submillimeter variability have shown that at least half of protostars are variable. We present a statistical analysis of mid-infrared variability among young stellar objects (YSOs) in the distant, massive star-forming region W51 using NEOWISE data. From a catalog of 81 protostars, 527 disk objects, and 37,687 other sources including diskless pre-main sequence and evolved contaminants, we identified significant variability in the 3.4 um (W1) and 4.6 um (W2) bands. Because of W51's distance (~5.4 kpc) and extinction, the sample mainly includes intermediate- to high-mass YSOs (&gt;2 Msun), unlike nearby regions dominated by low-mass stars. This mass bias may affect the observed variability. In W2, 11.1% of protostars, 7.6% of disk objects, and 0.6% of PMS+E sources showed secular variability, while 8.6%, 2.3%, and 0.5% showed stochastic variability; similar fractions were found in W1. The variability fraction and amplitude increase toward earlier stages. Protostars exhibit high-amplitude stochastic changes likely driven by dynamic accretion and extinction, whereas disk objects show more secular patterns-linear, curved, or periodic-possibly due to moderate accretion variations or disk geometry. Color-magnitude analysis shows that protostars generally redden as they brighten, consistent with enhanced dust emission or variable extinction, while disk objects show mixed trends: roughly balanced in W1 but more often bluer in W2, suggesting reduced extinction or hotspot modulation. These results highlight distinct mechanisms of variability across evolutionary stages and demonstrate that mid-infrared monitoring offers key insight into accretion and disk evolution in young stars.</description>

      <title>Optically thick winds of very massive stars suppress intermediate-mass black hole formation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) are the link between stellar-mass and supermassive black holes. Gravitational waves have started unveiling a population of IMBHs in the $\sim 100-300 \, \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ range. Here, we investigate the formation of IMBHs from very massive stars (VMSs, $&gt;100\,{} \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$). We calculate new VMS models that account for the transition from optically thin to optically thick winds, and study how this enhanced mass loss affects IMBH formation and the black hole mass function at intermediate and high metallicity ($Z=10^{-4}-0.02$). We show that optically thick winds suppress the formation of IMBHs from direct VMS collapse at metallicities $Z&gt;0.001$, one order of magnitude lower than predicted by previous models. Our models indicate that the stellar progenitors of GW231123 must have had a metallicity $Z&lt;0.002$, if the primary black hole formed via direct VMS collapse.</description>

      <title>Mass dependence of halo baryon fractions from the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We detect the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich imprint of peculiar motions of galaxy groups and clusters, using the photometric DESI Legacy Survey together with cosmic microwave background (CMB) maps from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). We develop a comprehensive forward model based on the AbacusSummit cosmological simulations: mock galaxy group catalogues and synthetic kSZ maps are generated, together with a reconstructed peculiar velocity field that allows for photo-$z$ errors, redshift-space distortions, and survey masks. We investigate possible contamination from the cosmic infrared background (CIB), finding that CIB effects are subdominant to the kSZ signal in the relevant ACT frequency channel. We then predict the kSZ signal expected when stacking CMB temperature maps around groups, taking account of their estimated radial velocity. Comparing the model with observations, we are able to constrain the total baryon fraction within haloes, as well as their internal gas profiles. We find evidence for mass dependence of the halo baryon fraction within the virial radius.The gas fraction in massive groups is consistent with the universal baryon fraction, but low-mass groups ($10^{12.5} \lesssim M\,/h^{-1}\mathrm{M}_\odot \lesssim 10^{14}$) are depleted to $0.21 \pm 0.06$ times the universal baryon fraction. We find this low virial baryon fraction to be consistent with an extended gas profile, for which the total baryon content reaches the universal value well beyond the virial radius. This conclusion is consistent with previous analyses using X-ray, kSZ, and weak lensing, and plausibly reflects energetic feedback processes from the galaxies in these haloes.</description>

      <title>JWST and Keck Observations of the Off-Nuclear TDE AT 2024tvd: A Massive Nuclear Star Cluster and Minor-Merger Origin for its Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present JWST/NIRSpec and NIRCam observations of the first optically selected off-nuclear tidal disruption event (TDE), AT 2024tvd, along with Keck/KCWI integral field unit spectroscopy. The spectra show broad H and He emission lines that are characteristic of a TDE. Stellar kinematics show smooth host-galaxy morphology and ordered bulge rotation, with no evidence of disturbances in velocity, dispersion, age or metallicity space. We construct the first quasi-simultaneous spectral-energy distribution (SED) from X-rays to infrared for a TDE and decompose it into three components: the TDE accretion flow, an unresolved nuclear star cluster (NSC), and heated dust emission. The accretion component implies a black hole mass of $\log(M_\bullet/M_\odot) = 5.50\pm 0.04$, an instantaneous super-Eddington accretion rate of $\log (\dot{M}/M_{\odot} yr^{-1}) = -1.22 \pm 0.04$, and an outer disk photosphere radius of $\log(r_{out}/r_{g}) = 3.8 \pm 0.1$. The dust emission is well described by a blackbody with $T_{dust} = 873\pm 15$ K and peak luminosity $\log (L_{dust}/erg$ $s^{-1}) = 40.80\pm 0.01$, consistent with a dust echo near the sublimation radius. The SED is best fit when including additional stellar emission above the galaxy background at the TDE location, corresponding to $\log(M_{\star}/M_\odot) = 7.97^{+0.16}_{-0.26}$, which we interpret as a massive NSC or an ultra-compact dwarf galaxy. These results support a minor-merger origin for the MBH responsible for the TDE over scenarios involving gravitational recoil or dynamical ejection from the nucleus.</description>

      <title>A constant upper luminosity limit of cool supergiant stars down to the extremely low metallicity of I Zw 18</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar wind mass loss is often assumed to depend on their metallicity $Z$. Therefore, evolutionary models of massive stars at lower $Z$ are able to retain more of their H-rich layers and evolve into brighter cool supergiants (cool SGs; $T_\mathrm{eff} &lt; 7$ kK). Surprisingly, in galaxies in the range $0.2 \lesssim Z / Z_\odot \lesssim 1.5$ previous studies did not find a $Z$-dependence of the upper luminosity limit $L_\mathrm{max}$ of cool SGs. Here, we study four extra galaxies with HST and JWST. Observations of the extremely low-$Z$ dwarf galaxy I Zw 18 from JWST allow us to go down to $Z / Z_\odot \approx 1/40$. For cool SGs in all studied galaxies including I Zw 18, we find a constant $L_\mathrm{max} \approx 10^{5.6}$L$_\odot$, similar to literature results for $0.2 \lesssim Z / Z_\odot \lesssim 1.5$. In I Zw 18 and the other studied galaxies, the presence of Wolf-Rayet stars has been claimed. Although we cannot rule out that some of them become intermediate-temperature objects, this paints a picture in which evolved stars with $L&gt;10^{5.6}$L$_\odot$ burn He as hot He-rich stars down to extremely low $Z$. We argue that $Z$-independent late-phase mass loss would be the most likely mechanism responsible. Regardless of the exact stripping mechanism, for the Early Universe our results imply a limitation on black hole masses and a contribution of stars born with $M\gtrsim 30$M$_\odot$ to its surprisingly strong nitrogen enrichment. We propose a scenario in which single stars at low $Z$ emit sufficiently hard ionizing radiation to produce lines of He II and C IV. In this scenario, late-phase $Z$-independent mass loss produces hot He-rich stars. Due to the well-understood $Z$-dependence of radiation-driven winds of hot stars, a window of opportunity would open below 0.2Z$_\odot$, where self-stripped He-rich stars can exist without dense WR winds that absorb hard ionizing radiation.</description>

      <title>Formation of protostars and the launching of stellar core outflows with moving-mesh radiation non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an implementation of radiative transfer with flux-limited diffusion (FLD) for the moving-mesh code {\small AREPO} and use the method in a physical model for the formation of protostars with non-ideal radiation-magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD). We follow previous work in splitting the additional terms to the hydrodynamical equations arising from the inclusion of radiation into terms to be integrated explicitly and implicitly, as the diffusion and coupling terms would impose very restrictive timestep criteria. We validate the scheme with standard test problems for radiation diffusion, matter-gas coupling, and radiative shocks from the literature. Our implementation is compatible with local timestepping, which often presents problems for implicit schemes, and we found very good agreement with results obtained with global timesteps. We present an example application of the new implementation to the collapse of a $1\,{\rm M}_\odot$ molecular cloud core to a second Larson core modelled with radiation non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics. A high-velocity jet with v$_{\rm rad}&gt; 10\, {\rm km\,s^{-1}}$ is self-consistently launched from the second core, nested within the first core, which produces a lower-velocity magnetorotational outflow. We observe magnetic field amplification up to more than $\vert \mathbf{B}\vert_{\rm max}&gt;10^5$~G in the second core, which is surrounded by a small ($&lt;0.5$~au) disk. This application demonstrates the robustness of our scheme in multi-scale and high-resolution simulations on arbitrary meshes and, as such, the model can be readily used for further simulations of protostar formation at high resolution.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Perseus Galaxy Cluster with XRISM: Gas Kinematic Features and their Implications for Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present extended gas kinematic maps of the Perseus cluster by combining five new XRISM/Resolve pointings observed in 2025 with four Performance Verification datasets from 2024, totaling 745 ks net exposure. To date, Perseus remains the only cluster that has been extensively mapped out to ~0.7$r_{2500}$ by XRISM/Resolve, while simultaneously offering sufficient spatial resolution to resolve gaseous substructures driven by mergers and AGN feedback. Our observations cover multiple radial directions and a broad dynamical range, enabling us to characterize the intracluster medium kinematics up to the scale of ~500 kpc. In the measurements, we detect high velocity dispersions ($\simeq$300 km/s) in the eastern region of the cluster, corresponding to a nonthermal pressure fraction of $\simeq$7-13%. The velocity field outside the AGN-dominant region can be effectively described by a single, large-scale kinematic driver based on the velocity structure function, which statistically favors an energy injection scale of at least a few hundred kpc. The estimated turbulent dissipation energy is comparable to the gravitational potential energy released by a recent merger, implying a significant role of turbulent cascade in the merger energy conversion. In the bulk velocity field, we observe a dipole-like pattern along the east-west direction with an amplitude of $\simeq\pm$200-300 km/s, indicating rotational motions induced by the recent merger event. This feature constrains the viewing direction to ~30$^\circ$-50$^\circ$ relative to the normal of the merger plane. Our hydrodynamic simulations suggest that Perseus has experienced at least two energetic mergers since redshift z~1, the latest associated with the radio galaxy IC310. This study showcases exciting scientific opportunities for future missions with high-resolution spectroscopic capabilities (e.g., HUBS, LEM, and NewAthena).</description>

      <title>Value Added Catalog of physical properties of more than 1.3 million galaxies from the DESI Survey</title>

Abstract: Aims. We present an extensive catalog of the physical properties of more than a million galaxies within the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), one of the largest spectroscopic surveys to date. Spanning over a full variety of target types, including emission line galaxies and luminous red galaxies as well as quasars, our survey encompasses an unprecedented range of spectroscopic redshifts, stretching from 0 to 6.
  Methods. The physical properties, such as stellar masses and star formation rates, are derived via the CIGALE spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting code accounting for the contribution coming from active galactic nuclei (AGN). Based on the modeling of the optical-mid-infrared (grz complemented by WISE photometry) SEDs, we study galaxy properties with respect to their location on the main sequence.
  Results. We revise the dependence of stellar mass estimates on model choices and availability of the WISE photometry. The WISE information is mandatory to minimize the misclassification of star-forming galaxies as AGN. The lack of WISE bands in SED fits leads to elevated AGN fractions for 68% of star-forming galaxies identified using emission line diagnostic diagram but does not significantly affect their stellar mass nor star formation estimates.</description>

      <title>Measuring Star Formation Histories from Asymptotic Giant Branch Stars I: A Demonstration in M31</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09256v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate how near-infrared (NIR) imaging of resolved luminous asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars can be used to measure well-constrained star formation histories (SFHs) across cosmic time. Using UKIRT $J$ and $K$-band imaging of M31, we first show excellent agreement over the past $\sim8$ Gyr between the PHAT SFH of M31's outer disk derived from a deep optical color-magnitude diagram (CMD; $\sim3.3\times10^{7}$ stars with $M_{\rm F814W} \lesssim +2$), and our spatially-matched SFH based only on modeling AGB stars on a NIR CMD ($\sim7.7\times10^{3}$ stars with $M_{\rm J} \lesssim -6$). We find that only $\sim1000$ AGB stars are needed for reliable SFH recovery, owing to their excellent age sensitivity in the NIR. We then measure the spatially-resolved SFH of M31's inner stellar halo ($D_{\rm M31, projected} \sim20-30$ kpc) using $\sim10^4$ AGB stars. We find: (i) a dominant burst of star formation across M31's stellar halo $3-5$ Gyr ago and lower level, spatially distributed star formation $\sim1-3$ Gyr ago; (ii) $M_{\star}\approx3_{-1}^{+5}\times10^9 M_{\odot}$ formed over the past $\sim8$ Gyr. We discuss some caveats and the enormous potential of resolved AGB stars in the NIR for measuring SFHs back to ancient epochs ($\sim14$ Gyr ago) in galaxies to large distances ($D\gtrsim20$ Mpc) with JWST, Roman, and Euclid.</description>

      <title>How Many Bursts Does it Take to Form a Core at the Center of a Galaxy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09566v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel method for systematically assessing the impact of central potential fluctuations associated with bursty outflows on the structure of dark matter halos for classical and ultra-faint dwarf galaxies. Specifically, we use dark-matter-only simulations augmented with a manually-added massive particle that modifies the central potential and approximately accounts for a centrally-concentrated baryonic component. This approach enables precise control over the magnitude, frequency, and timing of rapid outflow events. We demonstrate that this method can reproduce the established result of core formation for systems that undergo multiple episodes of bursty outflows. In contrast, we also find that equivalent models that involve only a single (or small number of) burst episodes do not form cores with the same efficacy. This is important because many UFDs in the Local Universe are observed to have tightly constrained star formation histories that are best described by a single, early burst of star formation. Using a suite of cosmological, zoom-in simulations, we identify the regimes in which single bursts can and cannot form a cored density profile. Our results suggest that it may be difficult to form cores in UFD-mass systems with a single, early burst regardless of its magnitude.</description>

      <title>The $z \gtrsim 9$ galaxy UV luminosity function from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey: insights into early galaxy evolution and reionization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The high-redshift UV luminosity function provides important insights into the evolution of early galaxies. JWST has revealed an unexpectedly large population of bright ($M_\mathrm{UV} \lesssim -20$) galaxies at $z\gtrsim10$, implying fundamental changes in the star forming properties of galaxies at increasingly early times. However, constraining the fainter population ($M_\mathrm{UV} \gtrsim -18$) has been more challenging. In this work, we present the $z\gtrsim9$ UV luminosity function from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey. We calculate the UV luminosity function from several hundred $z\gtrsim9$ galaxy candidates that reach UV luminosities of $M_\mathrm{UV}\sim-17$ in redshift bins of $z\sim9-12$ (309 candidates) and $z\sim12-16$ (63 candidates). We search for candidates at $z\sim16-22.5$ and find none. We also estimate the $z\sim14-16$ luminosity function from the $z\geq14$ subset of the $z\sim12-16$ sample. Consistent with other measurements, we find an excess of bright galaxies that is in tension with many theoretical models, especially at $z\gtrsim12$. However, we also find high number densities at $-18\lesssim M_\mathrm{UV} \lesssim-17$, suggesting that there is a larger population of faint galaxies than expected, as well as bright ones. From our parametric fits for the luminosity function, we find steep faint end slopes of $-2.5\lesssim\alpha\lesssim-2.3$, suggesting a large population of faint ($M_\mathrm{UV} \gtrsim -17$) galaxies. Combined, the high normalization and steep faint end slope of the luminosity function could imply that the reionization process is appreciably underway as early as $z=10$.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the trends between dust attenuation and galaxy properties at z ~ 2 - 12 with the James Webb Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A variety of dust attenuation/extinction curves have been observed in high-redshift galaxies, with mixed results regarding their correlations with global galaxy properties. These variations are likely driven by factors such as intrinsic dust properties, total dust content, and the dust-star geometry. In this work, we explore how the shape of dust attenuation curves-quantified by the UV-optical slope (S) and UV bump strength (B)-correlates with galaxy properties. Our goal is to identify the key physical mechanisms shaping attenuation curves through cosmic time. We build on arXiv:2402.05996, analyzing 173 dusty galaxies at z ~ 2-11.5, with attenuation curves inferred via SED fitting of JWST data using a modified version of BAGPIPES (arXiv:2304.11178). We investigate trends between S, B, and properties inferred from SED fitting: AV, SFR, stellar mass (M*), specific SFR (sSFR), mass-weighted stellar age (a*), ionization parameter (U), and metallicity (Z). For a subset, we also consider oxygen abundance (12 + log(O/H)), derived via Te-based methods. We find that lower AV galaxies tend to have steeper slopes and stronger UV bumps, consistent with radiative transfer predictions involving dust geometry and content. S also correlates with a* and sSFR, suggesting that strong radiation fields in young, bursty galaxies may destroy small grains, flattening the slope. B correlates with 12 + log(O/H), possibly due to metallicity-driven dust composition changes. Overall, attenuation curve shapes appear most strongly linked to: (1) redshift (dust evolution), (2) AV (RT effects), (3) a* or sSFR (radiation field), and (4) oxygen abundance (dust composition). Disentangling these effects requires spatially resolved data and theoretical models including dust evolution.</description>

      <title>HeII emitters at cosmic noon and beyond. Characterising the HeII {\lambda}1640 emission with MUSE and JWST/NIRSpec</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11685v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of high-redshift galaxies provides critical insights into the early stages of cosmic evolution, particularly during the so-called 'cosmic noon', when star formation activity reached its peak. Within this context, the origin of the nebular emission remains an open question. In this work, we conduct a systematic, multi-wavelength investigation of a sample of z ~ 2-4 emitters from the MUSE Hubble Ultra Deep Field surveys, utilising both MUSE and JWST/NIRSpec data and extending the sample presented by previous studies. We derive gas-phase metallicities and key physical properties, including electron densities, temperatures and the production rates of hydrogen- and He+-ionising photons. Our results suggest that a combination of factors-such as stellar mass, initial mass function, stellar metallicity, and stellar multiplicity-likely contributes to the origin of the observed nebular emission. Specifically, for our galaxies with higher gas-phase metallicity (12 + log(O/H) &gt; 7.55), we find that models for binary population with Salpeter IMF (Mup=100 Msol) and stellar metallicity ~ 0.001 (i.e., similar to that of the gas) can reproduce the observed ionising conditions. However at lower metallicities, models for binary population with `top-heavy' initial mass function (Mup = 300 Msol) and Zstar much lower &lt; Zstar) than that of the gas are required to fully account for the observed ionising photon production. These results reinforce that the ionisation keeps challenging current stellar populations, and the ionisation problem persists in the very low metallicity regime.</description>

      <title>Dwarf galaxy halo masses from spectroscopic and photometric lensing in DESI and DES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the most precise and lowest-mass weak lensing measurements of dwarf galaxies to date, enabled by spectroscopic lenses from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and photometric lenses from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) calibrated with DESI redshifts. Using DESI spectroscopy from the first data release, we construct clean samples of galaxies with median stellar masses $\log_{10}(M_*/M_{\odot})=8.3-10.1$ and measure their weak lensing signals with sources from DES, KiDS, and SDSS, achieving detections with $S/N$ up to 14 for dwarf galaxies ($\log_{10}(M_*/M_{\odot})&lt;$9.25) -- opening up a new regime for lensing measurements of low-mass systems. Leveraging DES photometry calibrated with DESI, we extend to a photometric dwarf sample of over 700,000 galaxies, enabling robust lensing detections of dwarf galaxies with combined $S/N=38$ and a significant measurement down to $\log_{10}(M_*/M_{\odot})=8.0$. We show that the one-halo regime (scales $\lesssim 0.15h^{-1}\rm Mpc$) is insensitive to various systematic and sample selection effects, providing robust halo mass estimates, while the signal in the two-halo regime depends on galaxy color and environment. These results demonstrate that DESI already enables precise dwarf lensing measurements, and that calibrated photometric samples extend this capability. Together, they pave the way for novel constraints on dwarf galaxy formation and dark matter physics with upcoming surveys like the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's LSST.</description>

      <title>Resolving stellar populations, star formation, and ISM conditions with JWST in a large spiral galaxy at z $\sim$ 2</title>

Abstract: Cosmic noon represents the prime epoch of galaxy assembly, and a sweet spot for observations with the James Webb Telescope (JWST) and ground-based near-IR integral-field unit (IFU) spectrographs. This work analyses JWST NIRSpec Micro Shutter Array (MSA), NIRCam Wide Field Slitless Spectroscopy (WFSS) of K20-ID7, a large spiral, star-forming (SF) galaxy at z=2.2, with evidence for radial gas inflows. By exploiting the synergy with ground-based IFU ERIS observations, we conduct a comprehensive and resolved study of the interstellar medium (ISM) and stellar properties, from rest optical to near-IR, via emission-line diagnostics, resolved spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting of high-resolution imaging, and Pa$\beta$ line detection in NIRCam WFSS data. Our analysis reveals massive ($M_{\star}\simeq$(0.67-3.5)$\times$10$^{9}$ $M_{\odot}$) SF clumps with star formation rates (SFRs) ~3-24 $M_{\odot}$/yr, and quite low dust attenuation ($A_V\simeq$0.4), electron density ($n_{e}$&lt;300 cm$^{-3}$), and ionisation (log(U)$\simeq -3.0$). The central bulge turns out to be modestly massive ($M_{\star}$=(7$\pm$3)$\times$10$^{9}$ M$_{\odot}$), heavily obscured ($A_V$=6.43$\pm$0.55), and likely to have formed most of its stellar mass in the past (SFR=82$\pm$42 $M_{\odot}$/yr over the last 100 Myr), yet still forming stars at a lower rate (SFR=12$\pm$8 M$_{\odot}$/yr over the last 10 Myr). We infer a metallicity 12+log(O/H)~8.54 and an apparent enhancement of the N/O abundance (log(N/O)$\simeq -1.0$) in all distinct galaxy regions, a likely consequence of dilution effects due to radial inflows of metal-poor gas. We measure a sub-solar sulfur abundance (log(S/O)$\simeq$-1.9). Finally, the radial stellar age profile reveals older stellar populations in the inner galaxy regions compared to the outskirts, pointing to an inside-out growth of K20-ID7.</description>

      <title>The Relation Between AGN and Host Galaxy Properties in the JWST Era: II. The merger-driven evolution of Seyferts at Cosmic Noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Paper I, we exploited the unsurpassed resolution and depth of JWST/NIRCam imagery to investigate the relationship between AGN and host-galaxy properties in the JWST era, finding a correlation between the level of spatial disturbance (as measured by shape asymmetry, $A_S$) and obscuration ($N_H$). Here in Paper II, we report an expansion of our X-ray and infrared analysis of Seyfert-luminosity host galaxies with four additional metrics to the single-metric morphology analysis of Paper I, as well as new samples of inactive control galaxies. This expanded study of one of the largest and most complete, multi-wavelength samples of AGN detected at $0.6&lt;z&lt;2.4$ in the GOODS-South and North fields, confirms that mergers surprisingly play a significant role in obscured, sub-quasar AGN host galaxies. Additionally, the pattern of morphological disturbances observed amongst the X-ray- and mid-IR-selected AGN suggests that these represent different phases of AGN evolution tied to a major-merger timeline, as opposed to distinct populations of AGN. These results indicate that mergers are important in triggering sub-quasar AGN at these redshifts.</description>

      <title>The Sunburst Arc with JWST. IV. The importance of interaction, turbulence, and feedback for Lyman-continuum escape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At present, the best opportunity for detailed Lyman Continuum escape studies is in gravitationally lensed galaxies at z &gt;~ 2. Only one such galaxy currently exists in the literature with sufficient spatial magnification: The Sunburst Arc at redshift z = 2.37. Here, we present rest-frame optical JWST NIRSpec integral field observations of the Sunburst Arc that cover a large fraction of the source plane. From this dataset, we generate precise maps of ISM kinematics, dust geometry, ionization, and chemical enrichment. We extract a stacked spectrum of five gravitationally lensed images of the Lyman-Continuum leaking cluster, as well as an magnification-corrected, integrated spectrum of most of the galaxy, enabling a direct comparison to other LyC leakers in the literature. We find that the galaxy rotates but also shows strong, possibly dominant, signatures of turbulence, which are indicative of recent or ongoing major interaction. The cluster that leaks ionizing photons shows little variation in kinematics or dust coverage, but dramatically elevated ionization, indicating that photoionization is the predominant mechanism that creates paths for LyC escape. We conjecture that tidal stripping of H I gas due to an interaction could have removed a large portion of the neutral ISM around the LyC emitting cluster, making it easier for the cluster to completely ionize the rest.</description>

      <title>A Time-Dependent Solution for GSN 069 Disk Evolution and the Nature of Long-Lived Tidal Disruption Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20148v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the implementation of a fully time-dependent relativistic disk model-based on the light curve fitting package FitTeD-into the X-ray spectral fitting environment, pyXspec. This implementation enables simultaneous fitting of multi-epoch and multi-wavelength spectral data, where the only free parameters are those describing the black hole and the initial conditions, while the subsequent evolution is governed by the dynamical equations of an evolving accretion flow. We use it fit seven epochs of X-ray spectra and two epochs of UV spectra of the 'long-lived' tidal disruption event (TDE) and quasi-periodic eruption (QPE) source GSN 069, from 2010 through late-2019. Our results show that such 'long-lived', X-ray-bright TDEs-of which GSN 069 is a prime, but not unique, example-can naturally be explained within the same framework as events with shorter-lived X-ray emission, like ASASSN-14li and AT2019dsg. Their distinction lies in the `viscous' timescale parameter-tied to the disk's angular momentum transport efficiency-which should be treated as a free parameter when modeling the disk evolution of transient events. We examine the implications for QPE models by tracking the time evolution of disk properties such as mass surface density and accretion rate. We argue that existing QPE models may not be able to reproduce the observed connection between the presence (2018) or absence (2014) of eruptions and the disk properties. In the context of orbiter-disk collision models, the change in mass surface density appears insufficient to explain the needed variation in the eruption's temperature. The absence of eruptions in GSN 069 in 2014 remains a challenge for QPE models.</description>

      <title>The Giant Arc -- Filament or Figment?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The so-called "Giant Arc" is a sparse pattern of MgII absorbers spanning approximately 740 comoving Mpc, whose discovery has been claimed to contradict the large-scale homogeneity inherent to the standard cosmological model. We previously showed that, with the same algorithm and parameters used for its discovery, very similar patterns are abundant in uniform random distributions, and among equivalent halo samples in a cosmological simulation of the standard model. In a response, the original discoverers of the "Giant Arc" have argued that these parameters were only appropriate for their specific observational data, but that a smaller linking length should be used for control studies, in which case far fewer patterns are detected. We briefly review and disprove these arguments, and demonstrate that large patterns like the "Giant Arc" are indeed ubiquitous in a statistically homogeneous universe.</description>

      <title>Clustering analysis of BOSS-CMASS galaxies with semi-analytical model for galaxy formation and halo occupation distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spatial distribution of massive and luminous galaxies have provided important constraints on the fundamental cosmological parameters and physical processes governing galaxy formation. In this work, we construct and compare independent galaxy-halo connection models in the application of clustering measurement at non-linear scales of BOSS-CMASS galaxies. In particular, we adopt a halo occupation distribution (HOD) model with 11 parameters and a semi-analytical model (SAM) with 16 parameters to describe the galaxy two point correlation function. With an empirical parameterization for the velocity field to model the redshift space distortion effect and the emulator technique, we can explore the parameter space of both models. We find that the HOD model is able to recover the underlying velocity field of SAM with an accuracy of 3\%, and can be improved to 1\% when the analysis is restricted to scales above 1$h^{-1}$Mpc. The comparison is based on multiple samplings in the parameter space which can verify the convergence of the models. Then we perform constraints on the model parameters using clustering measurement of CMASS galaxies. Although limited by the emulator accuracy and the flexibility of the model, we find that the clustering measurement is capable of constraining a subset of the SAM parameters, especially for components sensitive to the star formation rate. This result leads us to anticipate that a joint analysis of both clustering and abundance measurements can significantly constrain the parameters of galaxy formation physics, which requires further investigation from both theoretical and observational aspects.</description>
