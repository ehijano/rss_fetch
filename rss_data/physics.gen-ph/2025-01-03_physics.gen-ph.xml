Abstract: The integration of non-commutative geometry and Gauss-Bonnet corrections in an action and the study of their black hole responses can provide highly intriguing insights. Our primary motivation for this study is to understand the interplay of these two parameters on the geodesics of spacetime, including photon spheres and time-like orbits. In this study, we found that this integration, in its initial form, can limit the value of the Gauss-Bonnet parameter ($\alpha$), creating a critical threshold beyond which changes in the non-commutative parameter ($\Xi$) become ineffective, and the structure can only manifest as a naked singularity. Furthermore, we found that using a more complex model, which includes additional factors such as a cloud of strings and linear charge, as a sample for studying spacetime geodesics, yield different and varied results. In this scenario, negative $\alpha$ values can also play a role, notably preserving the black hole form even with a super-extremal charge ($q &gt; m$). For $\alpha&gt; 0.1$, the black hole mass parameter becomes significantly influential, with a critical mass below which the impact of other parameter changes is nullified. Interestingly, considering a more massive black hole, this high-mass state also maintains its black hole form within the super-extremal charge range. The existence of these two models led us to our main goal. By examining the temperature for these two cases, we find that both situations are suitable for studying the WGC. Finally, based on the behavior of these two models, we will explain how the WGC acts as a logical solution and a protector for the WCCC.</description>
