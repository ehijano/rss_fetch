      <title>Core binding energies of solids with periodic EOM-CCSD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the core binding energies of K-edge and L-edge transitions in simple semiconducting and insulating solids using periodic equation-of-motion coupled-cluster theory with single and double excitations (EOM-CCSD). In our all-electron calculations, we use triple zeta basis sets with core correlation, and we sample the Brillouin zone using up to 4x4x4 k-points. Our final numbers, which are obtained through composite corrections and extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit, exhibit errors of about 2 eV when compared to experimental values. This level of accuracy from CCSD is about the same as it is for molecules. A low-scaling approximation to EOM-CCSD performs marginally worse at lower cost, with errors of about 3 eV.</description>

      <title>Organic Electrochemical Neurons: Nonlinear Tools for Complex Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid oscillator architectures that combine feedback oscillators with self-sustained negative resistance oscillators have emerged as a promising platform for artificial neuron design. In this work, we introduce a modeling and analysis framework for amplifier-assisted organic electrochemical neurons, leveraging nonlinear dynamical systems theory. By formulating the system as coupled differential equations describing membrane voltage and internal state variables, we identify the conditions for self-sustained oscillations and characterize the resulting dynamics through nullclines, phase-space analysis, and bifurcation behavior, providing complementary insight to standard circuit-theoretic arguments of the operation of oscillators. Our simplified yet rigorous model enables tractable analysis of circuits integrating classical feedback components (e.g., operational amplifiers) with novel devices exhibiting negative differential resistance, such as organic electrochemical transistors (OECT). This approach reveals the core mechanisms behind oscillation generation, demonstrating the utility of dynamic systems theory in understanding and designing complex hybrid circuits. Beyond neuromorphic and bioelectronic applications, the proposed framework offers a generalizable foundation for developing tunable, biologically inspired oscillatory systems in sensing, signal processing, and adaptive control.</description>

      <title>Impact of Metal Cation on Chiral Properties of 2D Halide Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral two-dimensional (2D) halide perovskites are formed by embedding chiral organic cations in a perovskite crystal structure. The chirality arises from distortions of the 2D metal halide layers induced by the packing of these organic cations. Sn-based octahedra spontaneously distort, but it remains unclear whether this intrinsic structural instability enhances the chirality. We investigate the effect of the metal cation on structural and phonon chirality in MBA$_{2}$Sn$_{\mathrm{x}}$Pb$_{1-\mathrm{x}}$I$_{4}$ (x = 0, 1/2, and 1). Incorporating Sn does distort the metal halide octehedra, yet it only has a minor impact on the structural chirality. In contrast, the phonons in MBA$_{2}$SnI$_{4}$ are substantially more chiral than in MBA$_{2}$PbI$_{4}$, especially the in-plane acoustic modes. However, this enhanced phonon chirality does not lead to a generation of a larger angular momentum under a temperature gradient, because the contributions of different chiral phonons tend to compensate one another.</description>

      <title>Observation and control of potential-dependent surface state formation at a semiconductor-electrolyte interface via the optical anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interface between semiconductors and ion-conducting electrolytes is characterised by charge distributions and potential drops that vary substantially with the evolution of surface states. These surface states at the very interface to the liquid can form or be passivated, depending on the applied potential between electrode and electrolyte, and hereby fundamentally impact properties such as charge transfer. Characterisation and understanding of such potential-dependent surface states with high spatial and temporal resolution is a significant challenge for the understanding and control of semiconductor-electrolyte interfaces. Here, we show that the optical anisotropy of InP(100) can be used to detect the potential-dependent formation of highly ordered surface states under operating conditions. Upon formation of a surface state in the bandgap of the semiconductor, the potential drop and hence the electric field is shifted away from the semiconductor to the Helmholtz-layer of the electrolyte. This modifies the instantaneous response of the optical anisotropy to disturbances of the applied potential. We propose an electrochemical variant of the linear electro-optical effect and our findings open a novel route for understanding these interfaces. The results show how surface states from surface reconstructions at this reactive interface can be switched on or off with the applied potential.</description>

      <title>Beyond asymptotic reasoning: a practical ground state projector based on the wall-Chebyshev expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a quantum algorithm for ground-state preparation based on a Chebyshev series approximation to the wall function. This projector can be efficiently implemented as a product of Hamiltonian operators, enabling a straightforward realization via the linear combinations of unitaries method. We analyze the asymptotic scaling and provide numerical benchmarks, demonstrating that the wall-Chebyshev projector achieves competitive performance with leading methods based on imaginary time evolution and alternative projector function approximations. Notably, our approach exhibits superior robustness and convergence in scenarios where accurate ground-state energy estimates are unavailable, showing promise for realistic chemistry problems.</description>

      <title>Learning Potential Energy Surfaces of Hydrogen Atom Transfer Reactions in Peptides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reactions are essential in many biological processes, such as radical migration in damaged proteins, but their mechanistic pathways remain incompletely understood. Simulating HAT is challenging due to the need for quantum chemical accuracy at biologically relevant scales; thus, neither classical force fields nor DFT-based molecular dynamics are applicable. Machine-learned potentials offer an alternative, able to learn potential energy surfaces (PESs) with near-quantum accuracy. However, training these models to generalize across diverse HAT configurations, especially at radical positions in proteins, requires tailored data generation and careful model selection. Here, we systematically generate HAT configurations in peptides to build large datasets using semiempirical methods and DFT. We benchmark three graph neural network architectures (SchNet, Allegro, and MACE) on their ability to learn HAT PESs and indirectly predict reaction barriers from energy predictions. MACE consistently outperforms the others in energy, force, and barrier prediction, achieving a mean absolute error of 1.13 kcal/mol on out-of-distribution DFT barrier predictions. This accuracy enables integration of ML potentials into large-scale collagen simulations to compute reaction rates from predicted barriers, advancing mechanistic understanding of HAT and radical migration in peptides. We analyze scaling laws, model transferability, and cost-performance trade-offs, and outline strategies for improvement by combining ML potentials with transition state search algorithms and active learning. Our approach is generalizable to other biomolecular systems, enabling quantum-accurate simulations of chemical reactivity in complex environments.</description>

      <title>Explicit core-hole single-particle methods for L- and M- edge X-ray absorption and electron energy-loss spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-particle methods based on Kohn-Sham unoccupied states to describe near-edge X-ray absorption (XAS) spectra are routinely applied for the description of K-edge spectra, as there is no complication due to spin-orbit (SO) coupling. L- and M-edge spectra are often addressed via variants of time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) based on SO calculations. Here, we present a computationally efficient implementation based on single-particle calculations with core holes within the frozen-core approximation. Combined with a semiempirical energy shift and a fixed spin-orbit splitting for each core level, this allows for a computationally cheap, while overall accurate prediction of experimental spectra on the absolute energy scale. The spectra are compared to about 40 times slower linear-response TDDFT calculations for molecules and show similar or even better match with experiment. An exception are multiplet effects that we analyze in detail and show that they cannot be covered by a single-particle approximation. A similar picture emerges for solids, where good qualitative and sometimes even quantitative agreement to experimental XAS and electron energy-loss spectra is achieved.</description>
