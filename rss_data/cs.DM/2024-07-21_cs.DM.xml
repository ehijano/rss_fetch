      <title>On the normality of Boolean quadrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the BFA 2023 conference paper, A. Polujan, L. Mariot and S. Picek exhibited the first example of a non-normal but weakly normal bent function in dimension 8. In this note, we present numerical approaches based on the classification of Boolean spaces to explore in detail the normality of bent functions of 8 variables and we complete S. Dubuc s results for dimensions less or equal to 7. Based on our investigations, we show that all bent functions in 8 variables are normal or weakly normal. Finally, we conjecture that more generally all Boolean functions of degree at most 4 in 8 variables are normal or weakly normal.</description>

      <title>Coprime networks of the composite numbers: pseudo-randomness and synchronizability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a network whose nodes are labeled by the composite numbers and two nodes are connected by an undirected link if they are relatively prime to each other. As the size of the network increases, the network will be connected whenever the largest possible node index $n\geq 49$. To investigate how the nodes are connected, we analytically describe that the link density saturates to $6/\pi^2$, whereas the average degree increases linearly with slope $6/\pi^2$ with the size of the network. To investigate how the neighbors of the nodes are connected to each other, we find the shortest path length will be at most 3 for $49\leq n\leq 288$ and it is at most 2 for $n\geq 289$. We also derive an analytic expression for the local clustering coefficients of the nodes, which quantifies how close the neighbors of a node to form a triangle. We also provide an expression for the number of $r$-length labeled cycles, which indicates the existence of a cycle of length at most $O(\log n)$. Finally, we show that this graph sequence is actually a sequence of weakly pseudo-random graphs. We numerically verify our observed analytical results. As a possible application, we have observed less synchronizability (the ratio of the largest and smallest positive eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix is high) as compared to Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random network and Barab\'{a}si-Albert network. This unusual observation is consistent with the prolonged transient behaviors of ecological and predator-prey networks which can easily avoid the global synchronization.</description>

      <title>Disconnected Cliques in Derangement Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain a correspondence between pairs of $N\times N$ orthogonal Latin squares and pairs of disconnected maximal cliques in the derangement graph with $N$ symbols. Motivated by methods in spectral clustering, we also obtain modular conditions on fixed point counts of certain permutation sums for the existence of collections of mutually disconnected maximal cliques. We use these modular obstructions to analyze the structure of maximal cliques in $X_N$ for small values of $N$. We culminate in a short, elementary proof of the nonexistence of a solution to Euler's $36$ Officer Problem.</description>

      <title>Majorization and the degree sequence of trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the relation between degree sequences of trees and the majorization order using the Muirhead theorem. In this way, we prove a theorem that provides a necessary and sufficient condition for delta sequences of trees to be comparable in the majorization order. Although our investigation is largely theoretical, our study contributes to a better knowledge of trees as an important data structure. We point out that this study is among the few combining Lorenz curves and majorization on the one hand, and degree sequences of networks on the other.</description>

      <title>Makespan Trade-offs for Visiting Triangle Edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.01191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a primitive vehicle routing-type problem in which a fleet of $n$unit speed robots start from a point within a non-obtuse triangle $\Delta$, where $n \in \{1,2,3\}$. The goal is to design robots' trajectories so as to visit all edges of the triangle with the smallest visitation time makespan. We begin our study by introducing a framework for subdividing $\Delta$into regions with respect to the type of optimal trajectory that each point $P$ admits, pertaining to the order that edges are visited and to how the cost of the minimum makespan $R_n(P)$ is determined, for $n\in \{1,2,3\}$. These subdivisions are the starting points for our main result, which is to study makespan trade-offs with respect to the size of the fleet. In particular, we define $ R_{n,m} (\Delta)= \max_{P \in \Delta} R_n(P)/R_m(P)$, and we prove that, over all non-obtuse triangles $\Delta$: (i) $R_{1,3}(\Delta)$ ranges from $\sqrt{10}$ to $4$, (ii) $R_{2,3}(\Delta)$ ranges from $\sqrt{2}$ to $2$, and (iii) $R_{1,2}(\Delta)$ ranges from $5/2$ to $3$. In every case, we pinpoint the starting points within every triangle $\Delta$ that maximize $R_{n,m} (\Delta)$, as well as we identify the triangles that determine all $\inf_\Delta R_{n,m}(\Delta)$ and $\sup_\Delta R_{n,m}(\Delta)$ over the set of non-obtuse triangles.</description>

      <title>Small unsatisfiable $k$-CNFs with bounded literal occurrence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16149v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain the smallest unsatisfiable formulas in subclasses of $k$-CNF (exactly $k$ distinct literals per clause) with bounded variable or literal occurrences. Smaller unsatisfiable formulas of this type translate into stronger inapproximability results for MaxSAT in the considered formula class. Our results cover subclasses of 3-CNF and 4-CNF; in all subclasses of 3-CNF we considered we were able to determine the smallest size of an unsatisfiable formula; in the case of 4-CNF with at most 5 occurrences per variable we decreased the size of the smallest known unsatisfiable formula. Our methods combine theoretical arguments and symmetry-breaking exhaustive search based on SAT Modulo Symmetries (SMS), a recent framework for isomorph-free SAT-based graph generation. To this end, and as a standalone result of independent interest, we show how to encode formulas as graphs efficiently for SMS.</description>

      <title>Obstructions to return preservation for episturmian morphisms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies obstructions to preservation of return sets by episturmian morphisms. We show, by way of an explicit construction, that infinitely many obstructions exist. This generalizes and improves an earlier result about Sturmian morphisms.</description>

      <title>The reflection complexity of sequences over finite alphabets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09302v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In combinatorics on words, the well-studied factor complexity function $\rho_{\bf x}$ of a sequence ${\bf x}$ over a finite alphabet counts, for any nonnegative integer $n$, the number of distinct length-$n$ factors of $\mathbf{x}$. In this paper, we introduce the reflection complexity function $r_{\bf x}$ to enumerate the factors occurring in a sequence ${\bf x}$, up to reversing the order of symbols in a word. We introduce and prove general results on $r_{\bf x}$ regarding its growth properties and relationship with other complexity functions. We prove a Morse-Hedlund-type result characterizing eventually periodic sequences in terms of their reflection complexity, and we deduce a characterization of Sturmian sequences. Furthermore, we investigate the reflection complexity of quasi-Sturmian, episturmian, $(s+1)$-dimensional billiard, and complementation-symmetric Rote, and rich sequences. Furthermore, we prove that if ${\bf x}$ is $k$-automatic, then $r_{\bf x}$ is computably $k$-regular, and we use the software $\mathtt{Walnut}$ to evaluate the reflection complexity of automatic sequences, such as the Thue-Morse sequence. We note that there are still many unanswered questions about this measure.</description>
