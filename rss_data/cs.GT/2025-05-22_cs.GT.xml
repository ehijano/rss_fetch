      <title>Cooperative Bargaining Games Without Utilities: Mediated Solutions from Direction Oracles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperative bargaining games are widely used to model resource allocation and conflict resolution. Traditional solutions assume the mediator can access agents utility function values and gradients. However, there is an increasing number of settings, such as human AI interactions, where utility values may be inaccessible or incomparable due to unknown, nonaffine transformations. To model such settings, we consider that the mediator has access only to agents most preferred directions, i.e., normalized utility gradients in the decision space. To this end, we propose a cooperative bargaining algorithm where a mediator has access to only the direction oracle of each agent. We prove that unlike popular approaches such as the Nash and Kalai Smorodinsky bargaining solutions, our approach is invariant to monotonic nonaffine transformations, and that under strong convexity and smoothness assumptions, this approach enjoys global asymptotic convergence to Pareto stationary solutions. Moreover, we show that the bargaining solutions found by our algorithm also satisfy the axioms of symmetry and (under slightly stronger conditions) independence of irrelevant alternatives, which are popular in the literature. Finally, we conduct experiments in two domains, multi agent formation assignment and mediated stock portfolio allocation, which validate these theoretic results. All code for our experiments can be found at https://github.com/suryakmurthy/dibs_bargaining.</description>

      <title>Beyond Symmetry in Repeated Games with Restarts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infinitely repeated games support equilibrium concepts beyond those present in one-shot games (e.g., cooperation in the prisoner's dilemma). Nonetheless, repeated games fail to capture our real-world intuition for settings with many anonymous agents interacting in pairs. Repeated games with restarts, introduced by Berker and Conitzer [IJCAI '24], address this concern by giving players the option to restart the game with someone new whenever their partner deviates from an agreed-upon sequence of actions. In their work, they studied symmetric games with symmetric strategies. We significantly extend these results, introducing and analyzing more general notions of equilibria in asymmetric games with restarts. We characterize which goal strategies players can be incentivized to play in equilibrium, and we consider the computational problem of finding such sequences of actions with minimal cost for the agents. We show that this problem is NP-hard in general. However, when the goal sequence maximizes social welfare, we give a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm.</description>

      <title>Pointwise Convergence in Games with Conflicting Interest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce the concept of non-negative weighted regret, an extension of non-negative regret \cite{anagnostides2022last} in games. Investigating games with non-negative weighted regret helps us to understand games with conflicting interests, including harmonic games and important classes of zero-sum games.We show that optimistic variants of classical no-regret learning algorithms, namely optimistic mirror descent (OMD) and optimistic follow the regularized leader (OFTRL), converge to an $\epsilon$-approximate Nash equilibrium at a rate of $O(1/\epsilon^2)$.Consequently, they guarantee pointwise convergence to a Nash equilibrium if there are only finitely many Nash equilibria in the game. These algorithms are robust in the sense the convergence holds even if the players deviate Our theoretical findings are supported by empirical evaluations of OMD and OFTRL on the game of matching pennies and harmonic game instances.</description>

      <title>Antichains for Concurrent Parameterized Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Concurrent parameterized games involve a fixed yet arbitrary number of players. They are described by finite arenas in which the edges are labeled with languages that describe the possible move combinations leading from one vertex to another (n players yield a word of length n).
  Previous work showed that, when edge labels are regular languages, one can decide whether a distinguished player, called Eve, has a uniform strategy to ensure a reachability objective, against any strategy profile of her arbitrarily many opponents. This decision problem is known to be PSPACE-complete. A basic ingredient in the PSPACE algorithm is the reduction to the exponential-size knowledge game, a 2-player game that reflects the knowledge Eve has on the number of opponents.
  In this paper, we provide a symbolic approach, based on antichains, to compute Eve's winning region in the knowledge game. In words, it gives the minimal knowledge Eve needs at every vertex to win the concurrent parameterized reachability game. More precisely, we propose two fixed-point algorithms that compute, as an antichain, the maximal elements of the winning region for Eve in the knowledge game. We implemented in C++ these two algorithms, as well as the one initially proposed, and report on their relative performances on various benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Causal GraphSAGE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GraphSAGE is a widely used graph neural network. The introduction of causal inference has improved its robust performance and named as Causal GraphSAGE. However, Causal GraphSAGE focuses on measuring causal weighting among individual nodes, but neglecting the cooperative relationships among sampling nodes as a whole. To address this issue, this paper proposes Cooperative Causal GraphSAGE (CoCa-GraphSAGE), which combines cooperative game theory with Causal GraphSAGE. Initially, a cooperative causal structure model is constructed in the case of cooperation based on the graph structure. Subsequently, Cooperative Causal sampling (CoCa-sampling) algorithm is proposed, employing the Shapley values to calculate the cooperative contribution based on causal weights of the nodes sets. CoCa-sampling guides the selection of nodes with significant cooperative causal effects during the neighborhood sampling process, thus integrating the selected neighborhood features under cooperative relationships, which takes the sampled nodes as a whole and generates more stable target node embeddings. Experiments on publicly available datasets show that the proposed method has comparable classification performance to the compared methods and outperforms under perturbations, demonstrating the robustness improvement by CoCa-sampling.</description>

      <title>Online Envy Minimization and Multicolor Discrepancy: Equivalences and Separations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the fundamental problem of allocating $T$ indivisible items that arrive over time to $n$ agents with additive preferences, with the goal of minimizing envy. This problem is tightly connected to online multicolor discrepancy: vectors $v_1, \dots, v_T \in \mathbb{R}^d$ with $\| v_i \|_2 \leq 1$ arrive over time and must be, immediately and irrevocably, assigned to one of $n$ colors to minimize $\max_{i,j \in [n]} \| \sum_{v \in S_i} v - \sum_{v \in S_j} v \|_{\infty}$ at each step, where $S_\ell$ is the set of vectors that are assigned color $\ell$. The special case of $n = 2$ is called online vector balancing. Any bound for multicolor discrepancy implies the same bound for envy minimization. Against an adaptive adversary, both problems have the same optimal bound, $\Theta(\sqrt{T})$, but whether this holds for weaker adversaries is unknown.
  Against an oblivious adversary, Alweiss et al. give a $O(\log T)$ bound, with high probability, for multicolor discrepancy. Kulkarni et al. improve this to $O(\sqrt{\log T})$ for vector balancing and give a matching lower bound. Whether a $O(\sqrt{\log T})$ bound holds for multicolor discrepancy remains open. These results imply the best-known upper bounds for envy minimization (for an oblivious adversary) for $n$ and two agents, respectively; whether better bounds exist is open.
  In this paper, we resolve all aforementioned open problems. We prove that online envy minimization and multicolor discrepancy are equivalent against an oblivious adversary: we give a $O(\sqrt{\log T})$ upper bound for multicolor discrepancy, and a $\Omega(\sqrt{\log T})$ lower bound for envy minimization. For a weaker, i.i.d. adversary, we prove a separation: For online vector balancing, we give a $\Omega\left(\sqrt{\frac{\log T}{\log \log T}}\right)$ lower bound, while for envy minimization, we give an algorithm that guarantees a constant upper bound.</description>

      <title>On Signed Network Coordination Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study binary-action pairwise-separable network games that encompass both coordinating and anti-coordinating behaviors. Our model is grounded in an underlying directed signed graph, where each link is associated with a weight that describes the strenght and nature of the interaction. The utility for each agent is an aggregation of pairwise terms determined by the weights of the signed graph in addition to an individual bias term. We consider a scenario that assumes the presence of a prominent cohesive subset of players, who are either connected exclusively by positive weights, or forms a structurally balanced subset that can be bipartitioned into two adversarial subcommunities with positive intra-community and negative inter-community edges. Given the properties of the game restricted to the remaining players, our results guarantee the existence of Nash equilibria characterized by a consensus or, respectively, a polarization within the first group, as well as their stability under best response transitions. Our results can be interpreted as robustness results, building on the supermodular properties of coordination games and on a novel use of the concept of graph cohesiveness.</description>

      <title>Optimal classification with endogenous behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06127v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I consider the problem of classifying individual behavior in a simple setting of outcome performativity where the behavior the algorithm seeks to classify is itself dependent on the algorithm. I show in this context that the most accurate classifier is either a threshold or a negative threshold rule. A threshold rule offers the "good" classification to those individuals more likely to have engaged in a desirable behavior, while a negative threshold rule offers the "good" outcome to those less likely to have engaged in the desirable behavior. While seemingly pathological, I show that a negative threshold rule can maximize classification accuracy when behavior is endogenous. I provide an example of such a classifier and extend the analysis to more general algorithm objectives. A key takeaway is that when behavior is endogenous to classification, optimal classification can negatively correlate with signal information. This may yield negative downstream effects on groups in terms of the aggregate behavior induced by an algorithm.</description>
