      <title>Numerical Modeling of Liquid Wall Flows for Fusion Energy Applications Using Maxwell-Navier-Stokes Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the Z-Pinch fusion process, electric current is injected into liquid metal from the plasma column, generating Lorentz forces that deform the liquid metal's free surface. Modeling this phenomenon is essential for assessing the feasibility of using liquid metal as an electrode wall in fusion devices. Traditionally, such problems, where liquid metal is exposed to electromagnetic forces, are modeled using magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) formulation, which is more suitable for cases without external electric current penetration into liquid metals. MHD formulation typically models situations where liquid metal flows in the presence of an external magnetic field, with the initial magnetic field known and evolving over time via the magnetic induction equation. However, in Z-Pinch fusion devices, the electric current penetrates and traverses through the liquid metal, necessitating numerical calculations for the initial magnetic field. Additionally, the deformation of the liquid metal surface alters the current path's geometry and the resulting magnetic field, rendering traditional MHD formulations unsuitable. This work addresses this issue by directly solving Maxwell's equations, instead of the magnetic induction equation, in combination with Navier-Stokes equations, making it possible to predict the magnetic field even when the fluid is in motion. The Maxwell equations are solved in potential formulation alongside Navier-Stokes equations using a finite volume numerical method on a collocated grid arrangement. This proposed numerical framework successfully captures the deformation of the liquid metal's free surface due to the applied electric current.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Flux-Corrected Transport Algorithm I: A Finite-Difference Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a generalized flux-corrected transport (FCT) algorithm, which is shown to be total variation diminishing under some conditions. The new algorithm has improved properties from the standpoint of use and analysis. Results show that the new FCT algorithm performs better than the older FCT algorithms and is comparable with other modern methods. This reformulation will also allow the FCT to be used effectively with exact or approximate Riemann solvers and as an implicit algorithm.
  This paper was originally submitted to the Journal of Computational Physics in 1990. It got lost in review. One reviewer loved the paper and suggested it be published immediately (he also died while it was in review). Another reviewer savaged the paper being from the FCT camp. The journal also went through several changes in management. Ultimately I declined to continue pursuing the paper as I had one infant child at the time and another on the way in 1995. Now 30 years on I am going to put this online.</description>

      <title>Combining Hyperbolic Quadrature Method of Moments and Discrete-Velocity-Direction Models for Solving BGK-type Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the discrete-velocity-direction model (DVDM) in conjunction with the hyperbolic quadrature method of moments (HyQMOM) to develop a multidimensional spatial-temporal approximation of the BGK equation, termed DVD-HyQMOM. Serving as a multidimensional extension of HyQMOM, DVD-HyQMOM model achieves higher accuracy than other DVDM submodels, especially with an increased number of abscissas. The efficiency and effectiveness of this model are demonstrated through various numerical tests.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Evaluation Metric Discrepancies across Programming Languages and Their Components: Need for Standardization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study evaluates metrics for tasks such as classification, regression, clustering, correlation analysis, statistical tests, segmentation, and image-to-image (I2I) translation. Metrics were compared across Python libraries, R packages, and Matlab functions to assess their consistency and highlight discrepancies. The findings underscore the need for a unified roadmap to standardize metrics, ensuring reliable and reproducible ML evaluations across platforms. This study examined a wide range of evaluation metrics across various tasks and found only some to be consistent across platforms, such as (i) Accuracy, Balanced Accuracy, Cohens Kappa, F-beta Score, MCC, Geometric Mean, AUC, and Log Loss in binary classification; (ii) Accuracy, Cohens Kappa, and F-beta Score in multi-class classification; (iii) MAE, MSE, RMSE, MAPE, Explained Variance, Median AE, MSLE, and Huber in regression; (iv) Davies-Bouldin Index and Calinski-Harabasz Index in clustering; (v) Pearson, Spearman, Kendall's Tau, Mutual Information, Distance Correlation, Percbend, Shepherd, and Partial Correlation in correlation analysis; (vi) Paired t-test, Chi-Square Test, ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis Test, Shapiro-Wilk Test, Welchs t-test, and Bartlett's test in statistical tests; (vii) Accuracy, Precision, and Recall in 2D segmentation; (viii) Accuracy in 3D segmentation; (ix) MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R-Squared in 2D-I2I translation; and (x) MAE, MSE, and RMSE in 3D-I2I translation. Given observation of discrepancies in a number of metrics (e.g. precision, recall and F1 score in binary classification, WCSS in clustering, multiple statistical tests, and IoU in segmentation, amongst multiple metrics), this study concludes that ML evaluation metrics require standardization and recommends that future research use consistent metrics for different tasks to effectively compare ML techniques and solutions.</description>

      <title>Large Eddy Simulation using Nonlinearly Stable Flux Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of the nonlinearly stable flux reconstruction (NSFR) schemes for resolving subsonic viscous turbulent free-shear flows is investigated. The schemes are extensively verified for the direct numerical simulation (DNS) of the Taylor-Green Vortex (TGV) problem. Several under-resolved simulations of the TGV problem are conducted to assess the performance of NSFR for large eddy simulation that is implicitly filtered and fully implicit (ILES). Increasing the flux reconstruction correction parameter ensures that NSFR is stable and accurate for ILES while allowing for larger explicit time-steps. The entropy-stable schemes implemented with sum-factorization for tensor and Hadamard products are shown to be more cost-effective than classical DG with over-integration. The choice of the two-point (TP) numerical flux does not impact the solution and the use of standard eddy-viscosity-based sub-grid scale models does not yield improvements for the problem considered. From the DNS results, the pressure dilatation-based dissipation rate for the nonlinearly stable schemes is consistent with literature when computed from the kinetic energy (KE) budget terms, while spurious oscillations are seen when the term is directly computed. The magnitude of these oscillations is significantly lower for a collocated scheme and are effectively eliminated with the addition of Roe upwind dissipation to the TP numerical flux. Therefore, these oscillations are believed to be associated with the treatment of the face terms in nonlinearly stable schemes. It is shown that oversampling the velocity field is necessary for obtaining accurate turbulent KE (TKE) spectra and eliminates an apparent pile-up of TKE at the smallest resolved scales. Lastly, the TKE spectra for a decaying homogeneous isotropic turbulence case are in good agreement with experiment measurements and computational results in the literature.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Material Property Predictions: elastic constant tensor prediction and materials design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient and accurate prediction of material properties is critical for advancing materials design and applications. The rapid-evolution of large language models (LLMs) presents a new opportunity for material property predictions, complementing experimental measurements and multi-scale computational methods. We focus on predicting the elastic constant tensor, as a case study, and develop domain-specific LLMs for predicting elastic constants and for materials discovery. The proposed ElaTBot LLM enables simultaneous prediction of elastic constant tensors, bulk modulus at finite temperatures, and the generation of new materials with targeted properties. Moreover, the capabilities of ElaTBot are further enhanced by integrating with general LLMs (GPT-4o) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for prediction. A specialized variant, ElaTBot-DFT, designed for 0 K elastic constant tensor prediction, reduces the prediction errors by 33.1% compared with domain-specific, material science LLMs (Darwin) trained on the same dataset. This natural language-based approach lowers the barriers to computational materials science and highlights the broader potential of LLMs for material property predictions and inverse design.</description>

      <title>Transition-path sampling for Run-and-Tumble particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We elaborate and validate a generalization of the renowned transition-path-sampling algorithm for a paradigmatic model of active particles, namely the Run-and-Tumble particles. Notwithstanding the non-equilibrium character of these particles, we show how the consequent lack of the microscopical reversibility property, which is usually required by transition-path sampling, can be circumvented by identifying reasonable backward dynamics with a well-defined path-probability density. Our method is then applied to characterize the structure and kinetics of rare transition pathways undergone by Run-and-Tumble particles having to cross a potential barrier in order to find a target.</description>

      <title>Variational learning of integrated quantum photonic circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated photonic circuits play a crucial role in implementing quantum information processing in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. Variational learning is a promising avenue that leverages classical optimization techniques to enhance quantum advantages on NISQ devices. However, most variational algorithms are circuit-model-based and encounter challenges when implemented on integrated photonic circuits, because they involve explicit decomposition of large quantum circuits into sequences of basic entangled gates, leading to an exponential decay of success probability due to the non-deterministic nature of photonic entangling gates. Here, we present a variational learning approach for designing quantum photonic circuits, which directly incorporates post-selection and elementary photonic elements into the training process. The complicated circuit is treated as a single nonlinear logical operator, and a unified design is discovered for it through variational learning. Engineering an integrated photonic chip with automated control, we adjust and optimize the internal parameters of the chip in real time for task-specific cost functions. We utilize a simple case of designing photonic circuits for a single ancilla CNOT gate with improved success rate to illustrate how our proposed approach works, and then apply the approach in the first demonstration of quantum stochastic simulation using integrated photonics.</description>

      <title>Optothermally Induced Active and Chiral Motion of the Colloidal Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial soft matter systems have appeared as important tools to harness mechanical motion for microscale manipulation. Typically, this motion is driven either by the external fields or by mutual interaction between the colloids. In the latter scenario, dynamics arise from non-reciprocal interaction among colloids within a chemical environment. In contrast, we eliminate the need for a chemical environment by utilizing a large area of optical illumination to generate thermal fields. The resulting optothermal interactions introduce non-reciprocity to the system, enabling active motion of the colloidal structure. Our approach involves two types of colloids: passive and thermally active. The thermally active colloids contain absorbing elements that capture energy from the incident optical beam, creating localized thermal fields around them. In a suspension of these colloids, the thermal gradients generated drive nearby particles through attractive thermo-osmotic forces. We investigate the resulting dynamics, which lead to various swimming modes, including active propulsion and chiral motion. We have also experimentally validated certain simulated results. By exploring the interplay between optical forces, thermal effects, and particle interactions, we aim to gain insights into controlling colloidal behavior in non-equilibrium systems. This research has significant implications for directed self-assembly, microfluidic manipulation, and the study of active matter.</description>

      <title>Poisson quadrature method of moments for 2D kinetic equations with velocity of constant magnitude</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work is concerned with kinetic equations with velocity of constant magnitude. We propose a quadrature method of moments based on the Poisson kernel, called Poisson-EQMOM. The derived moment closure systems are well defined for all physically relevant moments and the resultant approximations of the distribution function converge as the number of moments goes to infinity. The convergence makes our method stand out from most existing moment methods. Moreover, we devise a delicate moment inversion algorithm. As an application, the Vicsek model is studied for overdamped active particles. Then the Poisson-EQMOM is validated with a series of numerical tests including spatially homogeneous, one-dimensional and two-dimensional problems.</description>

      <title>Scientific Machine Learning Based Reduced-Order Models for Plasma Turbulence Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05972v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates non-intrusive Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) Reduced-Order Models (ROMs) for plasma turbulence simulations. In particular, we focus on Operator Inference (OpInf) to build low-cost physics-based ROMs from data for such simulations. As a representative example, we consider the (classical) Hasegawa-Wakatani (HW) equations used for modeling two-dimensional electrostatic drift-wave turbulence. For a comprehensive perspective of the potential of OpInf to construct predictive ROMs, we consider three setups for the HW equations by varying a key parameter, namely the adiabaticity coefficient. These setups lead to the formation of complex and nonlinear dynamics, which makes the construction of predictive ROMs of any kind challenging. We generate the training datasets by performing direct numerical simulations of the HW equations and recording the computed state data and outputs the over a time horizon of $100$ time units in the turbulent phase. We then use these datasets to construct OpInf ROMs for predictions over $400$ additional time units, that is, $400\%$ more than the training horizon. Our results show that the OpInf ROMs capture important statistical features of the turbulent dynamics and generalize beyond the training time horizon while reducing the computational effort of the high-fidelity simulation by up to five orders of magnitude. In the broader context of fusion research, this shows that non-intrusive SciML ROMs have the potential to drastically accelerate numerical studies, which can ultimately enable tasks such as the design of optimized fusion devices.</description>

Abstract: A statistical model for the calculation of the ionisation-cluster size distribution in nanodosimetry is proposed. It is based on a canonical ensemble and derives from the well-known nuclear droplet model. The model especially can be applied to the scenario 'low energy primaries (smaller than 100 eV) moving in nanovolumes (in the order of a few nanometers)'; a scenario to which trajectory models should not be used. The focus of this work is on presenting the model and demonstrating its feasibility.</description>

      <title>A Coherent Theory for Superconductivity through Integration of Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer Theory and Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A coherent theory for superconductivity of both conventional and unconventional superconductors is currently lacking. We propose an integrated theory based on the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory and density functional theory (DFT), suggesting that superconductivity originates from the formation of a symmetry-broken superconducting configuration (SCC) due to atomic perturbation of the normal conducting configuration (NCC). This perturbation creates straight one-dimensional tunnels (SODTs) for electrons and/or holes, which act as resistance-free superhighways, akin to Cooper pairs in the BCS theory. The formation of SODTs implies that the electron-phonon interaction in the BCS theory can be predicted by the difference in charge densities between SCC and NCC through DFT. Our integrated theory highlights that in conventional superconductors, SODTs are part of the bulk material and are easily disrupted by phonon vibrations, resulting in a low critical superconducting temperature (Tc). Conversely, in unconventional superconductors such as YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO7), SODTs are protected by a layered pontoon structure with very weak bonding to the bulk material, maintaining stability at higher temperatures and leading to a much higher Tc. This integrated theory is validated for 13 conventional superconductors of 18 pure elements examined in this work, including the predicted superconductivity in Cu, Ag, Au, Sb, and Bi at 0 K and 0 GPa, and one unconventional superconductor, YBCO7. Our discovery indicates that DFT can be a practical tool for predicting superconductors, enabling a systematic search for new superconducting materials in the future.</description>

      <title>Realistic binary neutron star initial data with Elliptica</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces the Elliptica pseudo-spectral code for generating initial data of binary neutron star systems. Building upon the recent Elliptica code update, we can now construct initial data using not only piecewise polytropic equations of state, but also tabulated equations of state for these binary systems. Furthermore, the code allows us to endow neutron stars within the binary system with spins. These spins can have a magnitude close to the mass shedding limit and can point in any direction.</description>

      <title>Differentiable MadNIS-Lite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differentiable programming opens exciting new avenues in particle physics, also affecting future event generators. These new techniques boost the performance of current and planned MadGraph implementations. Combining phase-space mappings with a set of very small learnable flow elements, MadNIS-Lite, can improve the sampling efficiency while being physically interpretable. This defines a third sampling strategy, complementing VEGAS and the full MadNIS.</description>

      <title>SPRING: an effective and reliable framework for image reconstruction in single-particle Coherent Diffraction Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07413v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coherent Diffraction Imaging (CDI) is an experimental technique to gain images of isolated structures by recording the light scattered off the sample. In principle, the sample density can be recovered from the scattered light field through a straightforward Fourier Transform operation. However, only the amplitude of the field is recorded, while the phase is lost during the measurement process and has to be retrieved by means of suitable, well-established, phase retrieval algorithms. In this work we present SPRING, an analysis framework tailored on X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) diffraction data that implements the Memetic Phase Retrieval method to mitigate the shortcomings of conventional algorithms. We benchmark the approach on experimental data acquired in two experimental campaigns at SwissFEL and European XFEL. Imaging results on isolated nanostructures reveal unprecedented stability and resilience of the algorithm's behavior on the input parameters, as well as the capability of identifying the solution in conditions hardly treatable so far with conventional methods. A user-friendly implementation of SPRING is released as open-source software, aiming at being a reference tool for the coherent diffraction imaging community at XFEL and synchrotron facilities.</description>

      <title>Star Log-extended eMulation: a method for efficient computation of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We emulate the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations, including tidal deformability, for neutron stars using a novel hybrid method based upon the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) for the first time. This new method, which we call Star Log-extended eMulation (SLM), utilizes the underlying logarithmic behavior of the differential equations to enable accurate emulation of the nonlinear system. We show predictions for well-known phenomenological equations of state (EOS) with fixed parameters and with a freely-varying parametric Quarkyonic EOS. Our results produce a significant computational speed-up of $\approx 3 \times 10^4$ compared to high fidelity (HF) calculations using standard Runge-Kutta methods, providing an efficient emulator for the numerous TOV evaluations required by multi-messenger astrophysical frameworks that infer constraints on the EOS from neutron star mergers. The ability of the SLM algorithm to learn a mapping between parameters of the EOS and subsequent neutron star properties also opens up potential extensions for assisting in computationally prohibitive uncertainty quantification (UQ) for any type of EOS. The source code for the methods developed in this work will be openly available in a public GitHub repository for community modification and use.</description>
