      <title>Taming Uncertainty in a Complex World: The Rise of Uncertainty Quantification -- A Tutorial for Beginners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a tutorial about uncertainty quantification (UQ) for those who have no background but are interested in learning more in this area. It exploits many very simple examples, which are understandable to undergraduates, to present the ideas of UQ. Topics include characterizing uncertainties using information theory, UQ in linear and nonlinear dynamical systems, UQ via data assimilation, the role of uncertainty in diagnostics, and UQ in advancing efficient modeling. The surprisingly simple examples in each topic explain why and how UQ is essential. Both Matlab and Python codes are made available for these simple examples.</description>

      <title>Identifying influential node groups in networks with core-periphery structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying influential spreaders is a crucial problem for practical applications in network science. The core-periphery(C-P) structure, common in many real-world networks, comprises a densely interconnected group of nodes(core) and the rest of the sparsely connected nodes subordinated to the core(periphery). Core nodes are expected to be more influential than periphery nodes generally, but recent studies suggest that this is not the case in some networks. In this work, we look for mesostructural conditions that arise when core nodes are significantly more influential than periphery nodes. In particular, we investigate the roles of the internal and external connectivity of cores in their relative influence. We observe that the internal and external connectivity of cores are broadly distributed, and the relative influence of the cores is also broadly distributed in real-world networks. Our key finding is that the internal connectivity of cores is positively correlated with their relative influence, whereas the relative influence increases up to a certain value of the external connectivity and decreases thereafter. Finally, results from the model-generated networks clarify the observations from the real-world networks. Our findings provide a structural condition for influential cores in networks and shed light on why some cores are influential and others are not.</description>

      <title>Bayesian analysis of nucleon-nucleon scattering data in pionless effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform Bayesian model calibration of two-nucleon ($NN$) low-energy constants (LECs) appearing in an $NN$ interaction based on pionless effective field theory (EFT). The calibration is carried out for potentials constructed using naive dimensional analysis in $NN$ relative momenta ($p$) up to next-to-leading order [NLO, $O(p^2)$] and next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order [N3LO, $O(p^4)$]. We consider two classes of pionless EFT potential: one that acts in all partial waves and another that is dominated by $s$-wave physics. The two classes produce broadly similar results for calibrations to $NN$ data up to $E_{\rm lab}=5$ MeV. Our analysis accounts for the correlated uncertainties that arise from the truncation of the pionless EFT. We simultaneously estimate both the EFT LECs and the parameters that quantify the truncation error. This permits the first quantitative estimates of the pionless EFT breakdown scale, $\Lambda_b$: the 95% intervals are $\Lambda_b \in [50.11,63.03]$ MeV at NLO and $\Lambda_b \in [72.27, 88.54]$ MeV at N3LO. Invoking naive dimensional analysis for the $NN$ potential, therefore, does not lead to consistent results across orders in pionless EFT. This exemplifies the possible use of Bayesian tools to identify inconsistencies in a proposed EFT power counting.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Node Mass through Self-Consistent Gravity Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.10025v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gravity model, inspired by Newton's law of universal gravitation, has long served as a primary tool for interpreting trade flows between countries, using a country's economic `mass' as a key determinant. Despite its wide application, the definition of `mass' within this model remains ambiguous. It is often approximated using indicators like GDP, which may not accurately reflect a country's true trade potential. Here, we introduce a data-driven, self-consistent numerical approach that redefines `mass' from a static proxy to a dynamic attribute inferred directly from flow data. We infer mass distribution and interaction nature through our method, mirroring Newton's approach to understanding gravity. Our methodology accurately identifies predefined embeddings and reconstructs system attributes when applied to synthetic flow data, demonstrating its strong predictive power and adaptability. Further application to real-world trade networks yields critical insights, revealing the spatial spectrum of trade flows and the economic mass of countries, two key features unexplored in depth by existing models. Our methodology not only enables accurate reconstruction of the original flow but also allows for a deep understanding of the unique capabilities of each node within the network. This study marks a significant shift in the understanding and application of the gravity model, providing a more comprehensive tool for analyzing complex systems and uncovering new insights into various fields, including global trade, traffic engineering, epidemic disease prevention, and infrastructure design.</description>
