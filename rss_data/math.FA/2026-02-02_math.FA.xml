      <title>Hermitian indices and factorization of selfadjoint operators on a Kre\u{i}n space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hermitian indices of a selfadjoint operator $C$ on a Kre\u{i}n space $\mathcal H$ are defined as geometric measures of positivity and negativity of the operator. A different pair of indices arises in the Bogn\'ar-Kr\'amli factorization of $C$, which writes $C$ as a product $AA^*$ where $A$ acts on a Kre\u{i}n space $\mathcal A$ into $\mathcal H$ and has zero kernel; the new indices are the positive and negative indices of $\mathcal A$. Such factorizations are far from unique. When $\mathcal H$ is separable, it is known that the two notions of indices always coincide, and this has applications to index formulas in the theory of Julia operators and completion problems for operator matrices. A new proof of the equality of indices that does not require separability is given in this work.</description>

      <title>On the BSE and BED properties of the Beurling algebra $L^1(G,\omega)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a locally compact abelian group, and let $\omega:G \to [1,\infty)$ be a weight, i.e., $\omega$ is measurable, $\omega$ is locally bounded and $\omega(s+t)\leq \omega(s)\omega(t)$ for all $s, t \in G$. If $\omega^{-1}$ is vanishing at infinity, then we show that the Beurling algebra $L^1(G,\omega)$ is both BSE- algebra and BED- algebra.</description>

      <title>Baire-type properties of topological vector spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Burzyk, Kli\'{s} and Lipecki proved that every topological vector space (tvs) $E$ with the property $(K)$ is a Baire space. K\c{a}kol and S\'{a}nchez Ruiz proved that every sequentially complete Fr\'{e}chet--Urysohn locally convex space (lcs) is Baire. Being motivated by the property $(K)$ and the notion of a Mackey null sequence we introduce a property $(MK)$ which is strictly weaker than the property $(K)$, and show that any locally complete lcs has the property $(MK)$. We prove that any $\kappa$-Fr\'{e}chet--Urysohn tvs with the property $(MK)$ is a Baire space; consequently, each locally complete $\kappa$-Fr\'{e}chet--Urysohn lcs is a Baire space. This generalizes both the aforementioned results. We construct a feral Baire space $E$ with the property $(K)$ and which is not $\kappa$-Fr\'{e}chet--Urysohn. Although a $\kappa$-Fr\'{e}chet--Urysohn lcs $E$ can be not a Baire space, we show that $E$ is always $b$-Baire-like in the sense of Ruess. Applications to spaces of Baire functions and $C_k$-spaces are given.</description>

      <title>The metaplectic semigroup and its applications to time-frequency analysis and evolution operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a systematic analysis of the metaplectic semigroup $\mathrm{Mp}_+(d,\mathbb{C})$ associated with positive complex symplectic matrices, a notion introduced almost simultaneously and independently by H\"ormander, Brunet, Kramer, and Howe, thereby extending the classical metaplectic theory beyond the unitary setting.
  While the existing literature has largely focused on propagators of quadratic evolution equations, for which results are typically obtained via Mehler formulas, our approach is operator-theoretic and symplectic in spirit and adapts techniques from the standard metaplectic group $\mathrm{Mp}(d,\mathbb{R})$ to a substantially broader framework that is not driven by differential problems or particular propagators.
  This point of view provides deeper insight into the structure of the metaplectic semigroup, and allows us to investigate its generators, polar decomposition, and intertwining relations with complex conjugation and with the Wigner distribution. We then exploit these structural results to characterize, from a metaplectic perspective, classes of time-frequency representations satisfying prescribed structural properties. Finally, we discuss further implications for parabolic equations with complex quadratic Hamiltonians, we study the boundedness of their propagators on modulation spaces, we obtain estimates in time of their operator norms. Finally, we apply our theory to the study of propagation of Wigner singularities.</description>

      <title>Some Geometric Aspects Related to Lim's Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In their seminal work, Lau and Mah (1986) study $w^*$-normal structure in the space of operators $\mathcal{L}(H)$, on a Hilbert space $H$, using a geometric property of the dual unit ball called Lim's condition. In this paper, we study a weaker form of Lim's condition, which we call property ($\ddagger$), for $C^\ast$-algebras, uniform algebras, and $L^1$-predual spaces. In the case of a $C^\ast$-algebra, we prove that property $(\ddagger)$ is equivalent to Lim's condition and consequently, we obtain a geometric characterization of $C^*$-algebras which are $c_0$-direct sum of finite-dimensional operator spaces. For a uniform algebra, we extend a result of Lau and Mah to show that property $(\ddagger)$ implies that the space is finite-dimensional. In the case of an $L^1$-predual space, we show that this condition implies $k$-smoothness of the norm in the sense considered in Lin and Rao (2007).</description>

      <title>On anti-coproximinal and strongly anti-coproximinal subspaces of function spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this article is to study the anti-coproximinal and strongly anti-coproximinal subspaces of the Banach space of all bounded (continuous) functions. We obtain a tractable necessary condition for a subspace to be stronsgly anti-coproximinal. We prove that for a subspace $\mathbb{Y}$ of a Banach space $\mathbb{X}$ to be strongly anti-coproximinal, $\mathbb Y$ must contain all w-ALUR points of $\mathbb{X}$ and intersect every maximal face of $B_{\mathbb{X}}.$ We also observe that the subspace $\mathbb{K}(\mathbb{X}, \mathbb{Y})$ of all compact operators between the Banach spaces $ \mathbb X $ and $ \mathbb Y$ is strongly anti-coproximinal in the space $\mathbb{L}(\mathbb{X}, \mathbb{Y})$ of all bounded linear operators between $ \mathbb X $ and $ \mathbb Y$, whenever $\mathbb{K}(\mathbb{X}, \mathbb{Y})$ is a proper subset of $\mathbb{L}(\mathbb{X}, \mathbb{Y}),$ and the unit ball $B_{\mathbb{X}}$ is the closed convex hull of its strongly exposed points.</description>

      <title>Abstract Integration in Net Convergence Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a general theory of integration of the Riemann and Lebesgue types with respect to arbitrary measures and functions, connected by a continuous bilinear product, with values in abstract vector spaces endowed with a convergence structure given by nets. This covers both the topological and order based convergences in the literature. We then show that this integral satisfies most of the common properties of the objects that comprises integration theory. By establishing a generalized notion of summability on Riesz spaces and an integral built upon countable partitions of the base space, we then stablish some uniform, monotone and dominated convergence theorems for the refereed integrals, as well as a non-topological or order based Henstock Lemma and a general convergence theorem based on the notion of conjugated lattice seminorms. An application of these theorems is made to prove various equivalences concerning the Lebesgue, for which we give a brief survey, Saks and Riemann type integrals in partially ordered and topological vector spaces presented in the literature, for which we also make a thorough review. We finish the article with a possible way of classifying general integration procedures defined in abstract convergence structures, and pose some open problems based on them.</description>

      <title>The wanted extension of Fujii and Tsurumaru's formula for the spectral radius of the Bell-CHSH operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is motivated by a recent paper of Yuki Fujii and Toyohiro Tsurumaru in which they established a beautiful formula for the spectral radius of the Bell-CHSH operator on finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. To tackle the operator on infinite-dimensional spaces, they elaborated a method based on appropriate approximation of commutators of infinite-dimensional orthogonal projections by commutators of orthogonal projections on finite-dimensional spaces. We here give a proof of Fujii and Tsurumaru's original formula that works in all dimensions. We also present an alternative approximation procedure, uncover the connection of the problem with block Toeplitz operators, and derive good estimates and explicit expressions for the spectral radius in concrete cases.</description>

Abstract: We give several new characterizations of $IP$ (the independence property) and $SOP$ (the strict order property) for continuous first order logic and study their relations to the function theory and the Banach space theory. We suggest new dividing lines of unstable theories by the study of subclasses of Baire-1 functions and argue why one should not expect a perfect analog of Shelah's theorem, namely a theory is unstable iff it has $IP$ or $SOP$, for real-valued logics, especially for continuous logic.</description>

In fact, we discovered many other extension like this one (lying in the orbit of such group action), such as: $f(x)\mapsto f(x)+i(f(x)-f(x-y))$.</description>

      <title>Well-Posedness of the Linear Regularized 13-Moment Equations Using Tensor-Valued Korn Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we finally prove the well-posedness of the linearized R13 moment model, which describes, e.g., rarefied gas flows. As an extension of the classical fluid equations, moment models are robust and have been frequently used, yet they are challenging to analyze due to their additional equations. By effectively grouping variables, we identify a 2-by-2 block structure, allowing us to analyze well-posedness within the abstract LBB framework for saddle point problems. Due to the unique tensorial structure of the equations, in addition to an interesting combination of tools from Stokes' and linear elasticity theory, we also need new coercivity estimates for tensor fields. These Korn-type inequalities are established by analyzing the symbol map of the symmetric and trace-free part of tensor derivative fields. Together with the corresponding right inverse of the tensorial divergence, we obtain the existence and uniqueness of weak solutions. This result also serves as the basis for future numerical analysis of corresponding discretization schemes.</description>

      <title>Discrete analogues of second-order Riesz transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discrete analogues of classical operators in harmonic analysis have been widely studied, revealing deep connections with areas such as ergodic theory and analytic number theory. This line of research is commonly known as \emph{Discrete Analogues in Harmonic Analysis (DAHA)}.
  In this paper, we study the $\ell^p$ norms of discrete analogues of second-order Riesz transforms. Using probabilistic methods, we construct a new class of second-order discrete Riesz transforms $\mathcal{R}^{(jk)}$ on the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d \ge 2$. We show that for $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$, their $\ell^p(\mathbb{Z}^d)$ norms coincide with those of the classical second-order Riesz transforms $R^{(jk)}$ on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^d)$ when $j \neq k$, and are comparable up to dimensional constants when $j = k$.
  The operators $\mathcal{R}^{(jk)}$ differ from the discrete analogue $R^{(jk)}_{\mathrm{dis}}$ by convolution with an $\ell^1(\mathbb{Z}^d)$ function. Applications are given to the DAHA of the Beurling--Ahlfors operator. We also show that $\mathcal{R}^{(jk)}$ arise as discrete analogues of certain Calder\'on--Zygmund operators $\mathbf{R}^{(jk)}$, which differ from $R^{(jk)}$ by convolution with an $L^1(\mathbb{R}^d)$ function. Finally, we conjecture that the $L^p$ norms of $\mathcal{R}^{(jk)}$, $R^{(jk)}_{\mathrm{dis}}$, and $\mathbf{R}^{(jk)}$ agree with those of the classical Riesz transforms, known to equal the corresponding martingale transform norms.</description>

      <title>Tameness of actions on finite rank median algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that for (compact) finite-rank median algebras the geometric rank equals the independence number of all (continuous) median-preserving functions to $[0,1]$. Combined with Rosenthal's dichotomy, this yields a generalized Helly selection principle: for finite-rank median algebras, the space of all median-preserving functions to $[0,1]$ is sequentially compact in the pointwise topology. Generalizing joint results with E. Glasner on dendrons (rank-1), we establish that every continuous action of a topological group $G$ by median automorphisms on a finite-rank compact median algebra is Rosenthal representable, hence dynamically tame. As an application, the Roller-Fioravanti compactification of finite-rank topological median $G$-algebras with compact intervals is often a dynamically tame $G$-system.</description>
