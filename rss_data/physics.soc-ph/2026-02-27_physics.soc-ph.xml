      <title>The Swarm Intelligence Freeway-Urban Trajectories (SWIFTraj) Dataset - Part I: Dataset Description and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a detailed description and characterization of a new open-source vehicle trajectory dataset, namely SWIFTraj, constructed from videos recorded by a swarm of 16 drones equipped with 5.4K-resolution cameras. The dataset is distinguished from existing open-source trajectory datasets in several aspects. First, it provides long-distance continuous trajectories of up to 4.5 km on a freeway, enabling in-depth investigation of traffic phenomena and their spatial and temporal evolution. Second, the data collection site covers an integrated network consisting of a long freeway corridor and parts of its connected urban network, facilitating traffic analysis and modeling from a network perspective. The potential applications of the dataset for transportation research, including traffic flow analysis, modeling, and control at multiple scales, as well as topics related to autonomous driving, are thoroughly discussed. Finally, SWIFTraj is released as a freely accessible open-source dataset to support and accelerate future research in the transportation community. The dataset is publicly available at the SWIFTraj website (https://www.swiftraj.com).</description>

      <title>Supervised tax compliance and evasion from a spatial evolutionary game perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Taxation constitutes a fundamental component of modern national economic systems, exerting profound impacts on both societal functioning and governmental operations. In this paper, we employ an interdependent network approach to model the coevolution between citizens and regulators within a taxation system that fundamentally constitutes a public goods game framework with complex interactive dynamics. In a game layer, citizens engage in public goods games, facing the social dilemma of tax compliance (cooperation) versus evasion (defection). Tax compliance supports the sustainability of public finances while tax evasion presents markedly stronger short-term incentives. In a regulatory layer, fair regulators punish tax evaders, while corrupt regulators keep silent due to bribes. Governmental regulatory interventions introduce critical institutional constraints that alter the traditional equilibrium of the game. Importantly, there exists a strategy update not only among citizens but also among regulators. Our results indicate that strengthening penalties can effectively curb tax evasion, and the influence of bribery on both tax compliance rates and the proportion of fair regulators is nonlinear. Additionally, increasing regulators' salaries and intensifying the crackdown on corrupt regulators can foster the emergence of fair regulators, thereby reducing tax evasion among citizens. The results offer practical policy implications, suggesting that balanced deterrence and institutional fairness are essential to sustaining compliance, and point to the need for future empirical validation and model extensions.</description>

      <title>Engineered Simultaneity: The Physical Impossibility of Consolidated Price Discovery Across Spacelike-Separated Exchanges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of engineered simultaneity: a system design that (1) requires comparing events at spacelike-separated locations, (2) implements this comparison via an implicit simultaneity convention, and (3) represents the result as objective rather than conventional. The United States National Best Bid and Offer (NBBO), mandated by SEC Regulation NMS Rule 611, is shown to be an instance of engineered simultaneity. We prove that the NBBO is frame-dependent: its value depends on the reference frame in which "current" prices are defined. Since the exchanges that generate quote data are separated by distances of 43-1,180 km, light-travel times of 143-3,940 microseconds create unavoidable windows during which no frame-independent price ordering exists. High-frequency trading firms exploit this window by accessing exchange data via direct feeds (latency ~tens of microseconds) while the consolidated Securities Information Processor operates at ~1,128 microseconds -- a ratio exceeding 50:1. We demonstrate that this constitutes a category mistake in the sense of Ryle: the NBBO applies the concept of "simultaneity" in a domain where it has no frame-independent meaning. The resulting information asymmetry extracts approximately $5 billion annually from other market participants.</description>

      <title>Three AI-agents walk into a bar . . . . `Lord of the Flies' tribalism emerges among smart AI-Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Near-future infrastructure systems may be controlled by autonomous AI agents that repeatedly request access to limited resources such as energy, bandwidth, or computing power. We study a simplified version of this setting using a framework where N AI-agents independently decide at each round whether to request one unit from a system with fixed capacity C. An AI version of "Lord of the Flies" arises in which controlling tribes emerge with their own collective character and identity. The LLM agents do not reduce overload or improve resource use, and often perform worse than if they were flipping coins to make decisions. Three main tribal types emerge: Aggressive (27.3%), Conservative (24.7%), and Opportunistic (48.1%). The more capable AI-agents actually increase the rate of systemic failure. Overall, our findings show that smarter AI-agents can behave dumber as a result of forming tribes.</description>

      <title>Swiss-system chess tournaments and unfairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19333v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Swiss-system is an increasingly popular competition format as it provides a favourable trade-off between the number of matches and ranking accuracy. However, there is no empirical study on the potential unfairness of Swiss-system chess tournaments caused by the odd number of rounds played. To analyse this issue, our paper compares the number of points scored in the tournament between players who played one game more with the white pieces and players who played one game less with the white pieces. Using data from 28 highly prestigious competitions, we find that players with an extra white game score significantly more points. In particular, the advantage exceeds the value of a draw in the four Grand Swiss tournaments. A potential solution to this unfairness could be organising Swiss-system chess tournaments with an even number of rounds, and guaranteeing a balanced colour assignment for all players using a recently proposed pairing mechanism.</description>

      <title>Fluid dynamics meet network science: two cases of temporal network eigendecomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Temporal networks, defined as sequences of time-aggregated adjacency matrices, sample latent graph dynamics and trace trajectories in graph space. By interpreting each adjacency matrix as a different time snapshot of a scalar field, fluid-mechanics theories can be applied to construct two distinct eigendecompositions of temporal networks. The first builds on the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) of flowfields and decomposes the evolution of a network in terms of a basis of orthogonal network eigenmodes which are ordered in terms of their relative importance, hence enabling compression of temporal networks as well as their reconstruction from low-dimensional embeddings. The second proposes a numerical approximation of the Koopman operator, a linear operator acting on a suitable observable of the graph space which provides the best linear approximation of the latent graph dynamics. Its eigendecomposition provides a data-driven spectral description of the temporal network dynamics, in terms of dynamic modes which grow, decay or oscillate over time. Both eigendecompositions are illustrated and validated in a suite of synthetic generative models of temporal networks with varying complexity.</description>
