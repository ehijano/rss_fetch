      <title>Towards a fictitious magnetic field trap for both ground and Rydberg state $^{87}$Rb atoms via the evanescent field of an optical nanofibre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cold Rydberg atoms, known for their long lifetimes and strong dipole-dipole interactions that lead to the Rydberg blockade phenomenon, are among the most promising platforms for quantum simulations, quantum computation and quantum networks. However, a major limitation to the performance of Rydberg atom-based platforms is dephasing, which can be caused by atomic motion within the trap. Here, we propose a trap for $^{87}$Rb cold atoms that confines both the electronic ground state and a Rydberg state, engineered to minimize the differential light shifts between the two states. This is achieved by combining a fictitious magnetic field induced by optical nanofibre guided light and an external bias magnetic field. We calculate trap potentials for the cases of one- and two-guided modes with quasi-linear and quasi-circular polarisations, and calculate trap depths and trap frequencies for different values of laser power and bias fields. Moreover, we discuss the impact of the quadrupole polarisability of the Rydberg atoms on the trap potential and demonstrate how the size of a Rydberg atom influences the ponderomotive potential generated by the nanofibre-guided light field. This work expands on the idea of light-induced fictitious magnetic field traps and presents a practical approach for creating quantum networks using Rydberg atoms integrated with optical nanofibres to generate 1D atom arrays.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Feshbach resonances in Ba$^+$+Li collisions due to strong spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a pronounced dependence of magnetic Feshbach resonance spectra on the initial hyperfine-Zeeman state of Li in ultracold $^{138}$Ba$^+$+$^6$Li collisions. The measured number and distribution of resonances differ significantly between the two lowest states despite their similar electron spin character. We address this puzzle by developing a comprehensive yet generic computational model calibrated against key statistical features in the experimental spectrum. We confirm that strong spin-orbit coupling induces essential changes in the distribution of resonances, leading to an increase in the number of resolvable resonances. Our model reproduces the statistics of the spectrum with the lowest Li state but struggles with the second-lowest state, where a significantly smaller number of resonances is experimentally observed.</description>

      <title>Energy Dynamics of a Nonequilibrium Unitary Fermi Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the energy dynamics of a unitary Fermi gas driven away from equilibrium. The energy is injected into the system by periodically modulating the trapping potential of a spherical unitary Fermi gas, and due to the existence of SO(2,1) symmetry, the breathing mode is excited without dissipation. Through the long-lived breathing oscillation, we precisely measure the energy evolution of the nonequilibrium system during the trap modulation. We find the trapping potential and internal energies increase with modulation time and simultaneously oscillate nearly $\textrm{180}^{\textrm{o}}$ out of phase. At large modulation amplitudes, the energy-injection efficiency is strongly reduced due to the trap anharmonicity. Unlike the equilibrium system, the measured energy evolution agrees well with predictions of the dynamic virial theorem. Our work provides valuable insights into the energy injection and redistribution in a non-equilibrium system, paving a way for future investigations of nonequilibrium thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Dark matter detection using optically trapped Rydberg atom tweezer arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new scheme for detecting wave-like dark matter (DM) using Rydberg atoms is proposed. Recent advances in trapping and manipulating Rydberg atoms make it possible to use Rydberg atoms trapped in optical tweezer arrays for DM detection. We present a simple and innovative experimental procedure that searches for excitations of trapped Rydberg atoms due to DM-induced electric field. A scan over DM mass is enabled with the use of the Zeeman and diamagnetic shifts of energy levels under an applied external magnetic field. Taking dark photon DM as an example, we demonstrate that our proposed experiment can have high sensitivity enough to probe previously unexplored regions of the parameter space of dark photon coupling strengths and masses.</description>

      <title>Optimized Measurements of Rabi model in a linear potential under Strong Doppler shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Harnessing quantum resources in the atomic external degrees of freedom--particularly matter-wave states with broad momentum spreads--holds significant potential for enhancing the sensitivity of Kasevich-Chu atom gravimeters at the standard quantum limit. However, a fully quantum-mechanical investigation of the critical Doppler effect inherent to this approach remains lacking. Employing the SU(2) Lie group theory, we derive a generic Riccati equation governing the unitary dynamics of the Rabi model within a linear potential and analyze the Doppler effect impact on Rabi oscillations because of the strong coupling between the internal and external states. Furthermore, by integrating Fisher information theory, we specifically demonstrate the near-universality and high metrological gain of phase rotation measurement protocols under strong Doppler broadening. This theoretical work provides insightful implications for boarder generalization, such as extensions to finite-temperature scenarios or multi-pulse sequences--exemplified by the $\pi/2-\pi-\pi/2$ pulse sequence characteristic of Kasevich-Chu atom gravimeters. Thus, this work lays a theoretical foundation for developing high-sensitivity, noise-resistant atom gravimeters leveraging external-state quantum resources.</description>

      <title>Perspective: Practical Atom-Based Quantum Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomic vapors, manipulated and probed by light and other electromagnetic fields, constitute versatile and powerful quantum systems for sensing applications. Atoms are identical, isolatable, interfaceable, and intelligible. These features, coupled with the relative simplicity with which quantum properties can be exploited in state preparation and detection using modern laser and electro-optic tools, make atoms very attractive for sensing applications. This Perspective discusses the potential and process for realizing practical quantum sensors using atoms.</description>

      <title>Multiple ionization, fragmentation and dehydrogenation of coronene in collisions with swift protons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13238v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coronene molecules have been bombarded with protons of energy ranging from 100 to 300 keV. The time of flight mass spectra have been recorded using a two stage Wiley McLaren type spectrometer. A significant enhancement in the yields of doubly and triply ionized recoil ions is observed compared to the singly ionized ones. The single, double and triple ionization cross sections are also calculated theoretically using the continuum distorted wave eikonal initial state (CDW EIS) and are compared with the experimental results. The experimental ratios of yields of double to single charged and triple to single charged recoil ions are found to be much higher compared to those for the gaseous atoms. Evaporation peaks corresponding to the loss of several neutral C2H2 molecules are observed for singly, doubly and triply charged coronene recoil ions. Multi fragmentation peaks corresponding to smaller masses of carbohydrates CnHx (n = 3 to 7), appear in the spectra due to higher energy transfer from the projectile to the molecule. The yields of evaporation and fragment products exhibit a pronounced dependence on projectile energy, with a significant decrease observed at higher energies. Dehydrogenetaion i.e. loss of H atoms or H2 molecules are also investigated from the measured spectra. It is observed that hydrogen molecule losses are preferred over H loss in the cation and dication coronene peak structures, with up to three molecules being lost. This observation is in line with some of the predictions and may provide important inputs towards the astrochemistry regarding the observed abundance of H2 in the inter stellar medium.</description>
