      <title>Predicting the electroporated tissue area trajectory in Electroporation-based protocol optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroporation (EP), the temporary or permanent permeabilization of the cell membrane induced by an electric field, is the basis of various applications in medicine and food processing. In EP-based protocol optimization in terms of pulse number, such as in electrochemotherapy (ECT), irreversible electroporation (IRE), and gene electrotransfer (GET), it is essential to reach an optimal dose-response, that is, the pulse dose that maximizes the electroporated tissue area while minimizing damage. Predicting the electroporated tissue area variation in time, i.e., its trajectory, requires measuring the EP threshold trajectory and understanding the interaction between both trajectories and the damaged tissue area trajectory. Here we introduce a new methodology, based on the analysis of the nonlinear dynamic interaction of the EP threshold and damaged tissue area trajectories, that shows that the EP threshold trajectory is the time gradient of the electric field. This allows predicting the electroporated area trajectory with a single electroporated area measurement at the last pulse, thus avoiding the need to measure the EP threshold trajectory, a rather cumbersome task. Also, it makes it possible to explain at the macroscopic level why the EP threshold trajectory has an approximate exponential time decrease while the EP threshold isoline trajectory, aka the electroporated tissue area trajectory, has an approximate logarithmic time increase. Further, it permits predicting an optimal dose response in terms of pulse number in an EP-based protocol, with a single electroporated tissue area measurement. Examples of its application to an in vitro vegetal model, and to an in vivo skinfold chamber shed new light on the nonlinear dynamic behavior of electroporated tissue area, EP threshold, and damaged tissue area trajectories, paving the way for optimal treatment planning in EP-based protocols.</description>

      <title>Intercomparison exercise on Monte Carlo simulations of electron spectra and energy depositions by a single gold nanoparticle under X-ray irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13813</link>

Abstract: Computational approaches, such as Monte Carlo (MC) radiation transport simulations, are used to estimate the dosimetric effects of GNPs, where results differing by orders of magnitudes have been reported by different investigators. This has motivated an intercomparison exercise, which was conducted as a joint activity of EURADOS Working Groups 6 "Computational Dosimetry" and 7 "Internal Dosimetry". The aim of this exercise was to determine the extent of such discrepancies between the results obtained by different researchers and different codes in a very simple simulation setup.
  Several individual EURADOS associate members and two code developer groups from outside Europe participated in this exercise applying seven different MC codes to perform the simulations of a simple defined geometry set-up of one single GNP irradiated in water by kilo-voltage X-rays. Two GNP diameters of 50 nm and 100 nm of were considered and two photon spectra as generated by X-ray tubes operated at 50 kV and 100 kV peak voltages. The geometry set-up and X-ray spectra were provided by the EURADOS task group. The participants were asked to determine for each combination of GNP size and X-ray spectrum the dose enhancement ratio (DER) of 10 nm-thick water shells up to 1000 nm and 1 $\mu$m-thick water shells up to 50 $\mu$m around the GNP. Furthermore, the electron spectra emitted from the GNP and the energy depositions in water shells around it were also to be reported.
  This EURADOS report summarizes the motivation and background for the exercise, the tasks to be solved, the codes used, the results reported by the participants, the consistency checks applied in their evaluation and a best estimates and uncertainty bands derived from the final results for the energy spectra of emitted electrons and the energy imparted in the vicinity of the GNP.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Chaotic Mixing in the Alveolar Region of the Lung</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report an experimental and numerical investigation to study the role of asymmetry in the expansion-contraction of the acinar wall on the particle transport in the acinus. We model the acinar flow feature using a T-section by appropriately matching the dimensionless numbers to that in the acinus of healthy human subjects. We show that asymmetry in the expansion-contraction process (quantified by $\phi$) is required for chaotic advection. We show the stretch and fold process leading to chaos for a range of $\phi$ and scaled oscillation frequency $Sr$. We show a regime map in this generalize $\phi$ and $Sr$ space and show that most mammalian lungs fall at the boundary of chaotic regime.</description>

      <title>QSMDiff: Unsupervised 3D Diffusion Models for Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM) dipole inversion is an ill-posed inverse problem for quantifying magnetic susceptibility distributions from MRI tissue phases. While supervised deep learning methods have shown success in specific QSM tasks, their generalizability across different acquisition scenarios remains constrained. Recent developments in diffusion models have demonstrated potential for solving 2D medical imaging inverse problems. However, their application to 3D modalities, such as QSM, remains challenging due to high computational demands. In this work, we developed a 3D image patch-based diffusion model, namely QSMDiff, for robust QSM reconstruction across different scan parameters, alongside simultaneous super-resolution and image-denoising tasks. QSMDiff adopts unsupervised 3D image patch training and full-size measurement guidance during inference for controlled image generation. Evaluation on simulated and in-vivo human brains, using gradient-echo and echo-planar imaging sequences across different acquisition parameters, demonstrates superior performance. The method proposed in QSMDiff also holds promise for impacting other 3D medical imaging applications beyond QSM.</description>
