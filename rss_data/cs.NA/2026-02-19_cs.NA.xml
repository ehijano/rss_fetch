      <title>Quantum-Inspired Tensor Networks for Approximating PDE Flow Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate quantum-inspired tensor networks (QTNs) for approximating flow maps of hydrodynamic partial differential equations (PDEs). Motivated by the effective low-rank structure that emerges after tensorization of discretized transport and diffusion dynamics, we encode PDE states as matrix product states (MPS) and represent the evolution operator as a structured low-rank matrix product operator (MPO) in tensor-train form (e.g., arising from finite-difference discretizations assembled in MPO form). The MPO is applied directly in MPS form, and rank growth is controlled via canonicalization and SVD-based truncation after each step. We provide theoretical context through standard matrix product properties, including exact MPS representability bounds, local optimality of SVD truncation, and a Lipschitz-type multi-step error propagation estimate. Experiments on one- and two-dimensional linear advection-diffusion and nonlinear viscous Burgers equations demonstrate accurate short-horizon prediction, favorable scaling in smooth diffusive regimes, and error growth in nonlinear multi-step predictions.</description>

      <title>Projection-based approximations for eigenvalue problems of Fredholm integral operators with Green's kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the eigenvalue problem $K x = \lambda x$. Our analysis focuses on the convergence rates of eigenvalue and spectral subspace approximations for compact linear integral operator $K$ with Green's kernels. By employing orthogonal and interpolatory projections at $2r+1$ collocation points (which are not necessarily Gauss points) onto an approximating space of piecewise even degree polynomials, we establish the superconvergence of eigenfunctions under iteration. The modified projection methods achieve a faster convergence rates compared to classical projection methods. The enhancement in convergence rate is verified by numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Numerical Construction of Quasi-Periodic Solutions Beyond Symplectic Integrators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symplectic integrators are the established standard for long-term simulations of nearly-integrable Hamiltonian systems due to their preservation of geometric structures. However, they suffer from an inherent limitation: secular phase-shift errors. While the qualitative ''shape'' of invariant tori is preserved, the numerical solution gradually drifts along the torus, leading to a phase-lag accumulation that degrades long-term positional accuracy. Inspired by the Craig-Wayne-Bourgain (CWB) scheme, originally developed as an analytical tool for infinite-dimensional systems, we introduce a numerical operator that incorporates frequency updates into a dimension-enlarged Newton iteration to compute quasi-periodic solutions. Unlike conventional time-stepping integrators, our alternating numerical procedure eliminates phase-lag accumulation by directly solving for instantaneous positions and phase angles. Theoretically, provided sufficient computational resources, the phase error can be reduced arbitrarily, remaining independent of the total integration time. Our algorithm translates the Nash-Moser iteration into a practical numerical framework, marking a significant departure from traditional Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) theory. While KAM provides rigorous existence proofs, its requirement for global Diophantine conditions and the total exclusion of resonant sets render it numerically inaccessible. By employing a ''step-by-step'' exclusion process and incrementally enlarging the dimension, our algorithm resolves irrationality conditions locally. This approach demonstrates that the ''numerical irrationality problem'' is not an intrinsic barrier to computation, offering a constructive, executable alternative to the non-executable nature of global KAM-based methods.</description>

      <title>Finite elements for the space approximation of a differential model for salts crystallization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates a space-time differential model related to the degradation of stone artifacts caused by exposure to air and atmospheric agents, which specifically lead to the accumulation of salt crystals in the material. A numerical method based on finite-element space discretization and implicit-explicit time marching is proposed as an extension of a one-dimensional finite-difference framework introduced in the literature. Within the same one-dimensional setting, a sensitivity analysis is performed, based on the techniques developed therein. They are also used as a comparison tool for the finite-element formulation, here introduced for more realistic simulations in higher space dimensions. Considerations about stability will be provided, together with an experimental convergence analysis highlighting the performance of the proposed approach. Numerical results in two and three space dimensions, obtained by an efficient code implementation, will be presented and discussed.</description>

      <title>An agglomeration-based multigrid solver for the discontinuous Galerkin discretization of cardiac electrophysiology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a novel agglomeration-based multilevel preconditioner designed to accelerate the convergence of iterative solvers for linear systems arising from the discontinuous Galerkin discretization of the monodomain model in cardiac electrophysiology. The proposed approach exploits general polytopic grids at coarser levels, obtained through the agglomeration of elements from an initial, potentially fine, mesh. By leveraging a robust and efficient agglomeration strategy, we construct a nested hierarchy of grids suitable for multilevel solver frameworks. The effectiveness and performance of the methodology are assessed through a series of numerical experiments on two- and three-dimensional domains, involving different ionic models and realistic unstructured geometries. The results demonstrate strong solver effectiveness and favorable scalability with respect to both the polynomial degree of the discretization and the number of levels selected in the multigrid preconditioner.</description>

      <title>A Fully Discrete Nonnegativity-Preserving FEM for a Stochastic Heat Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a stochastic heat equation with nonlinear multiplicative finite-dimensional noise that admits a unique nonnegative solution when given nonnegative initial data. Inspired by existing results for fully discrete finite difference schemes and building on the convergence analysis of semi-discrete mass-lumped finite element approximations, a fully discrete numerical method is introduced that combines mass-lumped finite elements with a Lie-Trotter splitting strategy. This discretization preserves nonnegativity at the discrete level and is shown to be convergent under suitable regularity conditions. A rigorous convergence analysis is provided, highlighting the role of mass lumping in ensuring nonnegativity and of operator splitting in decoupling the deterministic and stochastic dynamics. Numerical experiments are presented to confirm the convergence rates and the preservation of nonnegativity. In addition, we examine several numerical examples outside the scope of the established theory, aiming to explore the range of applicability and potential limitations of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>A higher order pressure-stabilized virtual element formulation for the Stokes-Poisson-Boltzmann equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrokinetic phenomena in nanopore sensors and microfluidic devices require accurate simulation of coupled fluid-electrostatic interactions in geometrically complex domains with irregular boundaries and adaptive mesh refinement. We develop an equal-order virtual element method for the Stokes--Poisson--Boltzmann equations that naturally handles general polygonal meshes, including meshes with hanging nodes, without requiring special treatment or remeshing. The key innovation is a residual-based pressure stabilization scheme derived by reformulating the Laplacian drag force in the momentum equation as a weighted advection term involving the nonlinear Poisson--Boltzmann equation, thereby eliminating second-order derivative terms while maintaining theoretical rigor. Well-posedness of the coupled stabilized problem is established using the Banach and Brouwer fixed-point theorems under sufficiently small data assumptions, and optimal a priori error estimates are derived in the energy norm with convergence rates of order $\mathcal{O}(h^k)$ for approximation degree $k \geq 1$. Numerical experiments on diverse polygonal meshes -- including distorted elements, non-convex polygons, Voronoi tessellations, and configurations with hanging nodes -- confirm optimal convergence rates, validating theoretical predictions. Applications to electro-osmotic flows in nanopore sensors with complex obstacle geometries illustrate the method's practical utility for engineering simulations. Compared to Taylor--Hood finite element formulations, the equal-order approach simplifies implementation through uniform polynomial treatment of all fields and offers native support for general polygonal elements.</description>

      <title>Whittle-Mat\'{e}rn Fields with Variable Smoothness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and analyze a nonlocal generalization of Whittle--Mat\'ern Gaussian fields in which the smoothness parameter varies in space through the fractional order, $s=s(x)\in[\underline{s}\,,\bar{s}]\subset(0,1)$. The model is defined via an integral-form operator whose kernel is constructed from the modified Bessel function of the second kind and whose local singularity is governed by the symmetric exponent $\beta(x,y)=(s(x)+s(y))/2$. This variable-order nonlocal formulation departs from the classical constant-order pseudodifferential setting and raises new analytic and numerical challenges. We develop a novel variational framework adapted to the kernel, prove existence and uniqueness of weak solutions on truncated bounded domains, and derive Sobolev regularity of the Gaussian (spectral) solution controlled by the minimal local order: realizations lie in $H^r(G)$ for every $r&lt;2\underline{s}-\tfrac{d}{2}$ (here $H^r(G)$ denotes the Sobolev space on the bounded domain $G$), hence in $L_2(G)$ when $\underline s&gt;d/4$. We also present a finite-element sampling method for the integral model, derive error estimates, and provide numerical experiments in one dimension that illustrate the impact of spatially varying smoothness on samples covariances. Computational aspects and directions for scalable implementations are discussed.</description>

      <title>Discrete reliability for high-order Crouzeix--Raviart finite elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the adaptive numerical solution of a 2D Poisson model problem by Crouzeix-Raviart elements ($\operatorname*{CR}_{k}$ $\operatorname*{FEM}$) of arbitrary odd degree $k\geq1$ is investigated. The analysis is based on an established, abstract theoretical framework: the \textit{axioms of adaptivity} imply optimal convergence rates for the adaptive algorithm induced by a residual-type a posteriori error estimator. Here, we introduce the error estimator for the $\operatorname*{CR}_{k}$ $\operatorname*{FEM}$ discretization and our main theoretical result is the proof ot Axiom 3: \textit{discrete reliability}. This generalizes results for adaptive lowest order $\operatorname*{CR}_{1}$ $\operatorname*{FEM}$ in the literature. For this analysis, we introduce and analyze new local quasi-interpolation operators for $\operatorname*{CR}_{k}$ $\operatorname*{FEM}$ which are key for our proof of discrete reliability. We present the results of numerical experiments for the adaptive version of $\operatorname*{CR}_{k}$ $\operatorname*{FEM}$ for some low and higher (odd) degrees $k\geq1$ which illustrate the optimal convergence rates for all considered values of $k$.</description>

      <title>Fast Ewald Summation using Prolate Spheroidal Wave Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast Ewald summation efficiently evaluates Coulomb interactions and is widely used in molecular dynamics simulations. It is based on a split into a short-range and a long-range part, where evaluation of the latter is accelerated using the fast Fourier transform (FFT). The accuracy and computational cost depend critically on the mollifier in the Ewald split and the window function used in the spreading and interpolation steps that enable the use of the FFT. The first prolate spheroidal wavefunction (PSWF) has optimal concentration in real and Fourier space simultaneously, and is used when defining both a mollifier and a window function. We provide a complete description of the method and derive rigorous error estimates. In addition, we obtain closed-form approximations of the Fourier truncation and aliasing errors, yielding explicit parameter choices for the achieved error to closely match the prescribed tolerance. Numerical experiments confirm the analysis: PSWF-based Ewald summation achieves a given accuracy with significantly fewer Fourier modes and smaller window supports than Gaussian- and B-spline-based approaches, providing a superior alternative to existing Ewald methods for particle simulations.</description>

      <title>Numerical Solution of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer Equation for Unconventional Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the analytical properties and the efficient numerical solution of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer equation for unconventional superconductivity incorporating long-range power-law electron-electron interactions within a tight-binding model on a $d$-dimensional lattice. It is a nonlinear convolution equation for the complex matrix-valued superconducting gap under symmetry constraints imposed by the fermionic anticommutation rules. The long-range interaction enters in momentum space in the form of the now efficiently computable Epstein zeta function, which exhibits a power-law singularity at zero momentum. This needs to be accounted when evaluating the convolution. After a brief overview of some of the equation's analytical properties, we discuss its efficient numerical solution using a Galerkin method with B-splines. We present numerical results for a nodal superconductor on a two-dimensional square lattice.</description>

      <title>An intrinsic expansion approach to the Galerkin approximations for the Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Galerkin approximation of the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations. In particular, we examine the convergence of these solutions in a sequence of finite dimensional spaces as the dimension goes to infinity. For any sequence of steady state or, respectively, time dependent Galerkin solutions that converges to a solution of the Navier-Stokes equations, we obtain a subsequence with an intrinsic asymptotic expansion in appropriate nested function spaces. Consequently, an induced asymptotic expansion is obtained in a more standard spatial Sobolev or, respectively, spatiotemporal Sobolev-Lebesgue space. In the case of steady states, we establish certain relations among leading terms of this expansion.</description>

      <title>The nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with combined nonlinearities in 1D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the one-dimensional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation $$ iu_t + u_{xx} + \mathcal{N}(u)u=0, \quad x,t \in \mathbb R, $$ with the nonlinearity term that is expressed as a sum of powers, possibly infinite: $$ \mathcal{N}(u) = \sum d_k |u|^{\alpha_k}, \quad \alpha_k &gt; 0. $$
  We first investigate the local well-posedness of this equation for any positive powers of $\alpha_k$ in a certain weighted class of initial data, subset of $H^1 (\mathbb R)$. For that we use an approach of Cazenave-Naumkin [19], thus, avoiding any Strichartz estimates. Then, using the pseudo-conformal transformation, we extend the local result to the global one for the initial data with a quadratic phase. Furthermore, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of such global solutions and prove scattering for data with the quadratic phase $e^{ib|x|^2}$ with sufficiently large positive $b$, in $H^1(\mathbb R)$. One of the advantages of considering an infinite sum in the nonlinearity term is being able to consider exponential nonlinearities, such as $e^{\gamma |u|^{k}} u$, as well as sine or cosine nonlinearities, and obtain well-posedness in those cases, the first such result for most of those nonlinearities.
  To conclude, we show numerical simulations for various examples of combined nonlinearities, including the double nonlinearity and an exponential one, then investigate the behavior of solutions with positive or negative initial $b$ in a quadratic phase data. Furthermore, we also show that a ground state in the NLS equation with combined nonlinearities no longer provides a sharp threshold for global behavior such as scattering vs. finite time blow-up, instead the equation has a much richer dynamics.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Quadrature: Gaussian Processes for Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian quadrature is a probabilistic, model-based approach to numerical integration, the estimation of intractable integrals, or expectations. Although Bayesian quadrature was popularised already in the 1980s, no systematic and comprehensive treatment has been published. The purpose of this survey is to fill this gap. We review the mathematical foundations of Bayesian quadrature from different points of view; present a systematic taxonomy for classifying different Bayesian quadrature methods along the three axes of modelling, inference, and sampling; collect general theoretical guarantees; and provide a controlled numerical study that explores and illustrates the effect of different choices along the axes of the taxonomy. We also provide a realistic assessment of practical challenges and limitations to application of Bayesian quadrature methods and include an up-to-date and nearly exhaustive bibliography that covers not only machine learning and statistics literature but all areas of mathematics and engineering in which Bayesian quadrature or equivalent methods have seen use.</description>

Abstract: Restarted GMRES is a robust and widely used iterative solver for linear systems. The control of the restart parameter is a key task to accelerate convergence and to prevent the well-known stagnation phenomenon. We focus on the Proportional-Derivative GMRES (PD-GMRES), which has been derived using control-theoretic ideas in [Cuevas N\'u\~nez, Schaerer, and Bhaya (2018)] as a versatile method for modifying the restart parameter. Several variants of a quadtree-based geometric optimization approach are proposed to find a best choice of PD-GMRES parameters. We show that the optimized PD-GMRES performs well across a large number of matrix types and we observe superior performance as compared to major other GMRES-based iterative solvers. Moreover, we propose an extension of the PD-GMRES algorithm to further improve performance by controlling the range of values for the restart parameter.</description>

      <title>Computation of whispering gallery modes for spherical symmetric, heterogeneous Helmholtz problems with piecewise smooth refractive index</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a numerical method for the computation of (quasi-)resonances in spherical symmetric, heterogeneous Helmholtz problems with piecewise smooth refractive index. Our focus lies in resonances very close to the real axis, which characterize the so-called whispering gallery modes. Our method involves a modal equation incorporating fundamental solutions to decoupled problems, extending the known modal equation to the case of piecewise smooth coefficients. We first establish the well-posedness of the fundamental system, then we formulate the problem of resonances as a nonlinear eigenvalue problem, whose determinant will be the modal equation in the piecewise smooth case. In combination with the numerical approximation of the fundamental solutions using a spectral method, we propose a Newton method to solve the nonlinear modal equation with a proper scaling. We prove the local convergence of the algorithm in the piecewise constant case by showing the simplicity of the roots. We confirm our approach through a series of numerical experiments in the piecewise constant as well as in the variable case.</description>

      <title>Stability analyses of divergence and vorticity damping on gnomonic cubed-sphere grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05624v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Divergence and vorticity damping, which operate upon horizontal divergence and relative vorticity, are explicit diffusion mechanisms used in dynamical cores to ensure stability. To avoid numerical blow-up from excessively strong diffusion, there are mesh-dependent upper bounds on the coefficients of the diffusion operators. This work considers such stability limits for three gnomonic cubed-sphere meshes: the 1) equidistant, 2) equiangular, and 3) equi-edge mappings. Stability limits are derived from a von Neumann analysis of damping with a simplified pseudo-Laplacian operator, as used in NOAA GFDL's finite-volume dynamical core on the cubed-sphere (FV3), and with the full curvilinear Laplacian. The resulting stability limits depend on the gnomonic mapping through the cubed-sphere cell areas, aspect ratios, and grid nonorthogonality. The analytical stability limits are compared to practical divergence and vorticity damping upper bounds in FV3, using idealised tests and the equiangular and equi-edge grids. For divergence damping, both the magnitude of maximum stable coefficients and the locations of instability agree with linear theory. Due to implicit vorticity diffusion in the FV3 transport scheme, practical limits for vorticity damping are lower than the explicit stability limits and depend on the choice of horizontal transport scheme.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic numerical hypocoercivity of the space-time discontinuous Galerkin method for the Kolmogorov equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are concerned with discretisations of the classical Kolmogorov equation by a standard space-time discontinuous Galerkin method. {The} Kolmogorov equation serves as simple, yet rich enough in the present context, model problem for a wide range of kinetic-type equations: although it involves diffusion in one of the two spatial dimensions only, the combined nature of the first order transport/drift term and the degenerate diffusion are sufficient to `propagate dissipation' across the spatial domain in its entirety. This is a manifestation of the celebrated concept of hypocoercivity, a term coined and studied extensively by Villani in \cite{villani}. We show that the {classical} space-time discontinuous Galerkin method {admits} a corresponding hypocoercivity property at the discrete level, asymptotically for large times. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result of this kind for any standard Galerkin scheme. This property is shown by proving one part of a discrete inf-sup-type stability result for the method in a family of norms dictated by a modified scalar product motivated by the theory in \cite{villani}. This family of norms contains the full gradient of the numerical solution, thereby allowing for a full spectral gap/Poincar\'e-type inequality at the discrete level, thus, showcasing a subtle, discretisation-parameter-dependent, numerical hypocoercivity property. Further, we show that the space-time discontinuous Galerkin method is inf-sup stable in the family of norms containing the full gradient of the numerical solution, which may be a result of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Hybrid CG-Tikhonov is a filtration of the CG Lanczos vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24056v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider iterative methods for solving linear ill-posed problems with compact operator and right-hand side only available via noise-polluted measurements. Conjugate gradients (CG) applied to the normal equations with an appropriate stopping rule and CG applied to the system solving for a Tikhonov-regularized solution (CGT) $(A^\ast A + c I_{\mathcal{X}}) x^{(\delta,c)} = A^\ast y^\delta$ are closely related regularization methods that build iterates from the same Krylov subspaces.
  In this work, we show that the CGT iterate can be expressed as $ x^{(\delta,c)}_m = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \gamma^{(m)}_i(c) z_i^{(m)}v_i, $ where $\left\lbrace\gamma_i^{(m)}(c)\right\rbrace_{i=1}^m$ are functions of the Tikhonov parameter $c$ and $x^{(\delta)}_m = \sum_{i=1}^{m} z_i^{(m)}v_i$ is the $m$-th CG iterate. We call these functions Lanczos filters, and they can be shown to have decay properties as $c\rightarrow\infty$ with the speed of decay increasing with $i$. This has the effect of filtering out the contribution of the later terms of the CG iterate. The filters can be constructed using quantities defined via recursions at each iteration.
  We demonstrate with numerical experiments that good parameter choices correspond to appropriate damping of the Lanczos vectors. The filtration approach also provides a platform for further development of parameter choice rules, and similar representations may hold for other hybrid iterative schemes.</description>

      <title>Admissible and attainable convergence behavior with stagnation mirroring in restarted (block) GMRES</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17077v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we describe how to construct matrices and block right-hand sides that exhibit a specified restarted block \gmres convergence pattern, such that the eigenvalues and Ritz values at each iteration can be chosen independent of the specified convergence behavior. This work is a generalization of the work in [Meurant and Tebbens, Num.~Alg.~2019] in which the authors do the same for restarted non-block \gmres. We use the same tools as were used in [Kub\'inov\'a and Soodhalter, SIMAX 2020], namely to analyze block \gmres as an iteration over a right vector space with scalars from the $^\ast$-algebra of matrices. To facilitate our work, we also extend the work of Meurant and Tebbens and offer alternative proofs of some of their results, that can be more easily generalized to the block setting.</description>

      <title>Minimizing Residuals in ODE Integration Using Optimal Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given the set of discrete solution points or nodes, called the skeleton, generated by an ODE solver, we study the problem of fitting a curve passing through the nodes in the skeleton minimizing a norm of the residual vector of the ODE. We reformulate this interpolation problem as a multi-stage optimal control problem and, for the minimization of two different norms, we apply the associated maximum principle to obtain the necessary conditions of optimality. We solve the problem analytically for the Dahlquist test problem and a variant of the leaky bucket problem, in terms of the given skeleton. We also consider the Van der Pol equation, for which we obtain interpolating curves with minimal residual norms by numerically solving a direct discretization of the problem through optimization software. With the skeletons obtained by various ODE solvers of MATLAB, we make comparisons between the residuals obtained by our approach and those obtained by the MATLAB function deval.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional seepage analysis using a polygonal cell-based smoothed finite element method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study develops a polygonal cell-based smoothed finite element method (CSFEM) for two-dimensional seepage analyses in porous media, covering steady-state, transient, and free-surface problems. Wachspress interpolation on convex polygonal elements is combined with cell-based gradient smoothing, so that element matrices are assembled using boundary integrals only, avoiding in-element derivatives and improving robustness on distorted and locally refined meshes. To improve efficiency, a solution-driven adaptive refinement strategy is employed to concentrate resolution near steep hydraulic gradients and evolving wet-dry interfaces. Free-surface seepage is handled by a fixed-mesh iterative scheme that updates the wetted region and boundary conditions to track the phreatic surface. Benchmark tests validate the formulation against analytical solutions and high-fidelity FEM references. In steady seepage examples, the proposed polygonal CSFEM reproduces linear hydraulic-head fields to near machine precision and yields smaller head errors than conventional FEM at the same characteristic mesh size. In transient problems, accurate head evolution and stable time responses are obtained, while adaptive refinement efficiently resolves localized high-gradient zones. For free-surface cases, the method captures the phreatic-surface profile and seepage-face development reliably without remeshing. The quadtree refinement and adaptivity provide substantial efficiency gains in degrees of freedom and runtime for a prescribed accuracy level.</description>

      <title>Monotone-based Numerical Schemes for Two-Dimensional Systems of Nonlocal Conservation Laws</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a class of numerical schemes for two-dimensional systems of nonlocal conservation laws, which are based on utilizing well-known monotone numerical flux functions after suitably approximating the nonlocal terms. The considered systems are weakly coupled by the nonlocal terms and the underlying flux function is rather general to guarantee that our results are applicable to a wide range of common nonlocal models. We state sufficient conditions to ensure the convergence of the monotone-based numerical schemes to the unique weak entropy solution. Moreover, we provide an error estimate that yields the convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\Delta t})$ for the numerical approximations of the solution. Our results include an existence and uniqueness proof of the nonlocal system, too. Numerical results illustrate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>A Cost-Effective Slag-based Mix Activated with Soda Ash and Hydrated Lime: A Pilot Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.12288v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present study explores a cost-effective method for using activated ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) and silica fume (SF) as cement substitutes. Instead of activating them with expensive alkali solutions, the present study employs industrial-grade powdered soda ash (SA) and hydrated lime (HL) as activators, reducing expenses by about 94.5% compared to their corresponding analytical-grade counterparts. Herein, the exclusivity is depicted using less pure chemicals rather than relying on reagents with 99% purity. Two mixing techniques are compared: one involves directly introducing powdered SA and HL, while the other pre-mixes SA with water before adding it to a dry powder mixture of GGBFS, SF, and HL. Microstructural analysis reveals that the initial strength results from various hydrate phases, including calcium-sodium-aluminate-silicate hydrate (CNASH). The latter strength is attributed to the coexistence of calcium-silicate hydrate (CSH), calcium-aluminate-silicate hydrate (CASH) and sodium-aluminate-silicate hydrate (NASH), with contributions from calcite and hydrotalcite. The SF content significantly influenced the formation of these gel phases. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) reveals phase transitions and bound water related to hydration products. The optimal mix comprises 10% SF, 90% GGBFS, 9.26% HL, and 13.25% SA, with a water-to-solids ratio of 0.45. This approach yields a compressive strength of 35.1 MPa after 28 days and 41.33 MPa after 120 days, hence suitable for structural construction.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by a recent method for approximate solution of Fredholm equations of the first kind, we develop a corresponding method for a class of Fredholm equations of the \emph{second kind}. In particular, we consider the class of equations for which the solution is a probability measure. The approach centres around specifying a functional whose gradient flow admits a minimizer corresponding to a regularized version of the solution of the underlying equation and using a mean-field particle system to approximately simulate that flow. Theoretical support for the method is presented, along with some illustrative numerical results.</description>

Abstract: We generalize the $2$-tensor paraproduct decomposition result of [arXiv:2503.12629] to $d$-tensors. In particular, we show that for $A \in C^{d}(\mathbb{R}), f \in \Lambda_{\alpha}([0,1]^d)$, $A(f)$ can be approximated by $\tilde{A}_{(N_i)_{i=0}^d}(f) = (\sum_{\beta=1}^d A^{\beta}(P^{j_1,j_2, \ldots, j_d}(f)) \tilde{\mathbf{v}}^{\beta}(f) ) $ with the residual $\Delta_{(N_i)_{i=1}^d}(A,f) = \tilde{A}_{(N_i)_{i=1}^d}(f) - A(f) \in \Lambda_{2\alpha}([0,1]^d)$. Our theoretical findings are supported by a computational example for d=3.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the inverse problem of determining an unknown time-dependent source term in a semilinear pseudo-parabolic equation with variable coefficients and a Dirichlet boundary condition. The unknown source term is recovered from additional measurement data expressed as a weighted spatial average of the solution. By employing Rothe's time-discretisation method, we prove the existence and uniqueness of a weak solution under a smallness condition on the problem data. We also provide a numerical scheme based on a perturbation approach, which reduces the solution of the resulting discrete problem to solving two standard variational problems and evaluating a scalar coefficient, and we demonstrate its accuracy and stability through numerical experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matrix--vector algorithms, particularly Krylov subspace methods, are widely viewed as the most effective algorithms for solving large systems of linear equations. This paper establishes lower bounds on the worst-case number of matrix--vector products needed by such an algorithm to approximately solve a general linear system. The first main result is that, for any matrix--vector algorithm which is allowed the use of randomization and can perform products with both a matrix and its transpose, $\Omega(\kappa \log(1/\varepsilon))$ matrix--vector products are necessary to solve a linear system with condition number $\kappa$ to accuracy $\varepsilon$, matching an upper bound for conjugate gradient on the normal equations. The second main result is that one-sided algorithms, which lack access to the transpose, must use $n$ matrix--vector products to solve an $n \times n$ linear system, even when the problem is perfectly conditioned. Both main results include explicit constants that match known upper bounds up to a factor of four. These results rigorously demonstrate the limitations of matrix--vector algorithms and confirm the optimality of widely used Krylov subspace algorithms.</description>

      <title>Learning Gradient Flow: Using Equation Discovery to Accelerate Engineering Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the use of data-driven equation discovery for dynamical systems to model and forecast continuous-time dynamics of unconstrained optimization problems. To avoid expensive evaluations of the objective function and its gradient, we leverage trajectory data on the optimization variables to learn the continuous-time dynamics associated with gradient descent, Newton's method, and ADAM optimization. The discovered gradient flows are then solved as a surrogate for the original optimization problem. To this end, we introduce the Learned Gradient Flow (LGF) optimizer, which is equipped to build surrogate models of variable polynomial order in full- or reduced-dimensional spaces at user-defined intervals in the optimization process. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach on several standard problems from engineering mechanics and scientific machine learning, including two inverse problems, structural topology optimization, and two forward solves with different discretizations. Our results suggest that the learned gradient flows can significantly expedite convergence by capturing critical features of the optimization trajectory while avoiding expensive evaluations of the objective and its gradient.</description>
