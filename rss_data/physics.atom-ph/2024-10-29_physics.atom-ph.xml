      <title>XUV yield optimization of two-color high-order harmonic generation in gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform an experimental two-color high-order harmonic generation study in argon with the fundamental of an ytterbium ultrashort pulse laser and its second harmonic. The intensity of the second harmonic and its phase relative to the fundamental are varied, in a large range compared to earlier works, while keeping the total intensity constant. We extract the optimum values for the relative phase and ratio of the two colors which lead to a maximum yield enhancement for each harmonic order in the extreme ultraviolet spectrum. Within the semi-classical three-step model, the yield maximum can be associated with a flat electron return time vs. return energy distribution. An analysis of different distributions allows to predict the required relative two-color phase and ratio for a given harmonic order, total laser intensity, fundamental wavelength, and ionization potential.</description>

      <title>Wavelength modulation laser spectroscopy of N$_2$O at 17 $\mu$m</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a mid-infrared quantum cascade laser and wavelength modulation absorption spectroscopy, we measure the frequencies of ro-vibrational transitions of N$_2$O in the 17 $\mu$m region with uncertainties below 5 MHz. These lines, corresponding to the bending mode of the molecule, can be used for calibration of spectrometers in this spectral region. We present a model for the lineshapes of absorption features in wavelength modulation spectroscopy that takes into account Doppler broadening, collisional broadening, saturation of the absorption, and lineshape distortion due to frequency and intensity modulation. Combining our data with previous measurements, we provide a set of spectroscopic parameters for several vibrational states of N$_2$O. The lines measured here fall in the same spectral region as a mid-infrared frequency reference that we are currently developing using trapped, ultracold molecules. With such a frequency reference, the spectroscopic methods demonstrated here have the potential to improve frequency calibration in this part of the spectrum.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetry dynamics on Rydberg atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spacetime supersymmetry (SUSY) that interchanges fermions and bosons is of great theoretical importance but has not yet been revealed experimentally in particle physics. It has also been desired to explore quantum-mechanical SUSY in microscopic lattice models. Inspired by the recent experiments of Floquet engineering of Rydberg atom arrays, we find that quantum mechanical SUSY can be realized in Floquet Rydberg atom arrays. Moreover, we utilize the supercharge dynamics to demonstrate the SUSY property of the model under investigation: the expectation value of supercharge freezes under time evolution for supersymmetric lattice models in contrast to the trivial oscillation for generic nonsupersymmetric lattice models. The proposal is validated on direct simulation of Rydberg atom arrays' dynamics and ready for experiments. This work sheds light on the future experimental exploration of SUSY with the help of Rydberg atom arrays.</description>

      <title>Effects of size of an oxide layer on the surface properties of lithium irradiated by deuterium plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how growth of an oxide film will influence the deuterium recycling properties of Li on plasma facing surfaces. Lithium films on the walls or plasma-facing material surfaces of a fusion vacuum vessel improves plasma performance in part by removing residual impurity atoms from the plasma. Oxygen atoms, from residual water vapor or eroded oxide surfaces, are a prominent ubiquitous impurity that can create a layer of oxide on lithium films. The results of the work herein also indicate a possibility for determining the thickness of the oxide layer on such Li films by measuring the reflection probability of incident deuterium particles from the surface.</description>

      <title>Observation of a Bilayer Superfluid with Interlayer Coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling the coupling between different degrees of freedom in many-body systems is a powerful technique for engineering novel phases of matter. We create a bilayer system of two-dimensional (2D) ultracold Bose gases and demonstrate the controlled generation of bulk coherence through tunable interlayer Josephson coupling. We probe the resulting correlated phases using matter-wave interferometry, measuring both the symmetric and antisymmetric phase modes of the bilayer system. These modes exhibit a crossover from short-range to quasi-long-range order above a coupling-dependent critical point, providing direct evidence of bilayer superfluidity mediated by interlayer coupling. We map out the phase diagram and interpret it with renormalization-group theory and Monte Carlo simulations. Additionally, we elucidate the underlying mechanism through the observation of suppressed vortex excitations in the antisymmetric mode.</description>

      <title>Quantum Locking of Intrinsic Spin Squeezed State in Earth-field-range Magnetometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the Earth-field range, the nonlinear Zeeman (NLZ) effect has been a bottleneck limiting the sensitivity and accuracy of atomic magnetometry from physical mechanism. To break this bottleneck, various techniques are introduced to suppress the NLZ effect. Here we revisit the spin dynamics in the Earth-field-range magnetometry and identify the existence of the intrinsic spin squeezed state (SSS) generated from the geomagnetically induced NLZ effect with the oscillating squeezing degree and squeezing axis. Such oscillating features of the SSS prevent its direct observation and as well, accessibility to magnetic sensing. To exploit quantum advantage of the intrinsic SSS in the Earth-field-range magnetometry, it's essential to lock the oscillating SSS to a persistent one. Hence, we develop a quantum locking technique to achieve a persistent SSS, benefiting from which the sensitivity of the Earth-field-range magnetometer is quantum-enhanced. This work presents an innovative way turning the drawback of NLZ effect into the quantum advantage and opens a new access to quantum-enhanced magnetometry in the Earth-field range.</description>

      <title>Constraining the spin-gravity coupling effects to the $10^{-10}$-level with dual-species atom interferometers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin is one fundamental property of microscopic particles. A lot of theoretical work has postulated the possible coupling between spin and gravitation, which could result in the violation of equivalence principle. In our recent joint mass-and-energy test of the weak equivalence principle with a 10-meter $^{85}$Rb-$^{87}$Rb dual-species atom interferometer, the E${\rm \ddot{o}}$tv${\rm \ddot{o}}$s parameters of four $^{85}$Rb-$^{87}$Rb combinations with specific atomic spin states were measured to the $10^{-10}$-level (\textit{L. Zhou et al., Phys. Rev. A 104, 022822}). Here these experimental results are used to constrain the postulated spin-gravity coupling effects. The bounds on the spin-independent and spin-dependent anomalous passive gravitational mass tensors in L${\rm \ddot{a}}$mmerzahl's model are set to the $10^{-10}$-level, which improves existing bounds by three orders of magnitude. The constraints to the spin-independent electron- and proton-gravity coupling parameters in the gravitational standard-model extension are set to the $10^{-6}\, {\rm GeV}$-level.</description>

      <title>Formation of singly ionized oxygen atoms from O$_2$ driven by XUV pulses: a toolkit for the break-up of FEL-driven diatomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate a general hybrid quantum-classical technique to describe the interaction of diatomic molecules with XUV pulses. We demonstrate the accuracy of our model in the context of the interaction of the O$_2$ molecule with an XUV pulse with photon energy ranging from 20 eV to 42 eV. We account for the electronic structure and electron ionization quantum mechanically employing accurate molecular continuum wavefunctions. We account for the motion of the nuclei using classical equations of motion. However, the force of the nuclei is computed by obtaining accurate potential-energy curves of O$_2$ up to O$_2^{2+}$, relevant to the 20 eV-42 eV photon-energy range, using advanced quantum-chemistry techniques. We find the dissociation limits of these states and the resulting atomic fragments and employ the Velocity Verlet algorithm to compute the velocities of these fragments. We incorporate both electron ionization and nuclear motion in a stochastic Monte-Carlo simulation and identify the ionization and dissociation pathways when O$_2$ interacts with an XUV pulse. Focusing on the O$^+$ + O$^+$ dissociation pathway, we obtain the kinetic-energy release distributions of the atomic fragments and find very good agreement with experimental results. Also, we explain the main features of the KER in terms of ionization sequences consisting of two sequential single-photon absorptions resulting in different O$^+$ and O$^{2+}$ electronic state configurations involved in the two transitions.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of a programmable optical lattice atom interferometer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.17603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Performing interferometry in an optical lattice formed by standing waves of light offers potential advantages over its free-space equivalents since the atoms can be confined and manipulated by the optical potential. We demonstrate such an interferometer in a one dimensional lattice and show the ability to control the atoms by imaging and reconstructing the wavefunction at many stages during its cycle. An acceleration signal is applied and the resulting performance is seen to be close to the optimum possible for the time-space area enclosed according to quantum theory. Our methodology of machine design enables the sensor to be reconfigurable on the fly, and when scaled up, offers the potential to make state-of-the art inertial and gravitational sensors that will have a wide range of potential applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum coarsening and collective dynamics on a programmable quantum simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the collective quantum dynamics of nonequilibrium many-body systems is an outstanding challenge in quantum science. In particular, dynamics driven by quantum fluctuations are important for the formation of exotic quantum phases of matter, fundamental high-energy processes, quantum metrology, and quantum algorithms. Here, we use a programmable quantum simulator based on Rydberg atom arrays to experimentally study collective dynamics across a (2+1)D Ising quantum phase transition. After crossing the quantum critical point, we observe a gradual growth of correlations through coarsening of antiferromagnetically ordered domains. By deterministically preparing and following the evolution of ordered domains, we show that the coarsening is driven by the curvature of domain boundaries, and find that the dynamics accelerate with proximity to the quantum critical point. We quantitatively explore these phenomena and further observe long-lived oscillations of the order parameter, corresponding to an amplitude (Higgs) mode. These observations offer a unique viewpoint into emergent collective dynamics in strongly correlated quantum systems and nonequilibrium quantum processes.</description>
