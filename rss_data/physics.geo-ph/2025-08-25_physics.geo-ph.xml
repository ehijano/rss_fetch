      <title>Estimating volumetric water content from electrical resistivity using a random forest model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Accurately estimating volumetric water content (VWC) can greatly enhance the prediction of landslide risk. The standard approach involves using locally limited, invasive sensor measurements. Recently, however, electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) has emerged as a cost-effective, minimally invasive, real-time, indirect method of monitoring VWC. However, linking ER to VWC poses distinct challenges. Purpose: Random forest models were developed to estimate and predict VWC from ER. Spatially and temporally heterogeneous measurements were conducted to improve robustness and accuracy. Methods: The models were trained using 370-500 ER sensor measurements at depths of 10, 50, 150 and 190 cm. Precipitation and air temperature with a depth-dependent impact delay were introduced to simulate infiltration. The models were then validated at various locations, and their predictive capabilities were examined. Results: Including precipitation and temperature as parameters reduced the mean absolute error (MAE) by between 7.3% and 73.0%, depending on the depth. However, not all outliers could be eliminated. Delaying the model parameter depth-dependently reduced the maximum relative error (MaRE) by 14.7-56.0% and the mean relative error (MRE) to below 2.8%. Observed uncertainties for the top meter remained fairly constant. A 24 h forecast revealed an MRE below 5% for all depths; however, outliers occurred more frequently. Nevertheless, models trained on data from one location failed to generalize to other locations. VWC tomography based on ERT revealed significant moisture bands at depths of one to two meters. Conclusion: VWC can be reliably predicted from ERT. However, validation of VWC from ERT in different locations revealed significant deficits. It is expected that an automated ERT training of models at various locations will eliminate these differences.</description>

      <title>3D latent diffusion models for parameterizing and history matching multiscenario facies systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geological parameterization procedures entail the mapping of a high-dimensional geomodel to a low-dimensional latent variable. These parameterizations can be very useful for history matching because the number of variables to be calibrated is greatly reduced, and the mapping can be constructed such that geological realism is automatically preserved. In this work, a parameterization method based on generative latent diffusion models (LDMs) is developed for 3D channel-levee-mud systems. Geomodels with variable scenario parameters, specifically mud fraction, channel orientation, and channel width, are considered. A perceptual loss term is included during training to improve geological realism. For any set of scenario parameters, an (essentially) infinite number of realizations can be generated, so our LDM parameterizes over a very wide model space. New realizations constructed using the LDM procedure are shown to closely resemble reference geomodels, both visually and in terms of one- and two-point spatial statistics. Flow response distributions, for a specified set of injection and production wells, are also shown to be in close agreement between the two sets of models. The parameterization method is applied for ensemble-based history matching, with model updates performed in the LDM latent space, for cases involving geological scenario uncertainty. For three synthetic true models corresponding to different geological scenarios, we observe clear uncertainty reduction in both production forecasts and geological scenario parameters. The overall method is additionally shown to provide posterior geomodels consistent with the synthetic true model in each case.</description>

      <title>Global lattice models of a rotating planet -- view on shake, rattle and roll</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new approach, based on the analysis of a spectral problem for a discrete gyroscopic system, to modelling earthquakes on a rotating planet is presented in this paper. The eigenmodes of gyroscopic three-dimensional icosahedron-dodecahedron lattices are used for the discrete approximations of Earth's vibrations. Related model of the gyroscopic centred icosahedron lattice reveals new results about the motion of Earth's core. The vibrations of the tectonic plate boundaries, inducing shear and longitudinal motions of the ground, are described through the oscillations of the nodal elements within the discrete gyroscopic models. The theoretical analysis is complemented with the illustrative numerical examples linked to natural resonant vibrations observed during large earthquakes.</description>

      <title>Convection in a Rapidly Rotating Spherical Shell: Newton's Method Using Implicit Coriolis Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geophysical flows are characterized by rapid rotation. Simulating these flows requires small timesteps to achieve stability and accuracy. Numerical stability can be greatly improved by the implicit integration of the terms that are most responsible for destabilizing the numerical scheme. We have implemented an implicit treatment of the Coriolis force in a rotating spherical shell driven by a radial thermal gradient. We modified the resulting timestepping code to carry out steady-state solving via Newton's method, which has no timestepping error. The implicit terms have the effect of preconditioning the linear systems, which can then be rapidly solved by a matrix-free Krylov method. We computed the branches of rotating waves with azimuthal wavenumbers ranging from 4 to 12. As the Ekman number (the non-dimensionalized inverse rotation rate) decreases, the flows are increasingly axially independent and localized near the inner cylinder, in keeping with well-known theoretical predictions and previous experimental and numerical results. The advantage of the implicit over the explicit treatment also increases dramatically with decreasing Ekman numbers, reducing the cost of computation by as much as a factor of 20 for Ekman numbers of order of $10^{-5}$. We carried out continuation for both the Rayleigh and Ekman numbers and obtained interesting branches in which the drift velocity remained unchanged between pairs of saddle-node bifurcations.</description>

      <title>Generative Latent Diffusion Model for Inverse Modeling and Uncertainty Analysis in Geological Carbon Sequestration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geological Carbon Sequestration (GCS) has emerged as a promising strategy for mitigating global warming, yet its effectiveness heavily depends on accurately characterizing subsurface flow dynamics. The inherent geological uncertainty, stemming from limited observations and reservoir heterogeneity, poses significant challenges to predictive modeling. Existing methods for inverse modeling and uncertainty quantification are computationally intensive and lack generalizability, restricting their practical utility. Here, we introduce a Conditional Neural Field Latent Diffusion (CoNFiLD-geo) model, a generative framework for efficient and uncertainty-aware forward and inverse modeling of GCS processes. CoNFiLD-geo synergistically combines conditional neural field encoding with Bayesian conditional latent-space diffusion models, enabling zero-shot conditional generation of geomodels and reservoir responses across complex geometries and grid structures. The model is pretrained unconditionally in a self-supervised manner, followed by a Bayesian posterior sampling process, allowing for data assimilation for unseen/unobserved states without task-specific retraining. Comprehensive validation across synthetic and real-world GCS scenarios demonstrates CoNFiLD-geo's superior efficiency, generalization, scalability, and robustness. By enabling effective data assimilation, uncertainty quantification, and reliable forward modeling, CoNFiLD-geo significantly advances intelligent decision-making in geo-energy systems, supporting the transition toward a sustainable, net-zero carbon future.</description>

      <title>Extension of Vertical Equilibrium Model for Two-Phase Displacement in Layer-Cake Reservoirs: Accounting for Water-CO2 Partial Miscibility and Fines Migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of geological CO2 storage in deep saline aquifers have demonstrated that vertical equilibrium (VE) models offer a robust and computationally efficient framework for reservoir optimization and upscaling. These studies emphasize the influence of fines migration and partial miscibility between water and CO2 on the evolving storage behaviour. Specifically, capillary-driven mobilization of clay and silica fines can impair injectivity, while water evaporation into the CO2 phase leads to near-wellbore drying, salt precipitation, and additional injectivity loss. However, conventional VE models do not account for these coupled physical and geochemical mechanisms. This work introduces an extended VE model that incorporates water vaporization into CO2, CO2 dissolution into the displaced brine, and fines migration leading to permeability reduction. For layer-cake aquifers, the model admits an exact analytical solution, providing closed-form expressions for both injectivity decline and sweep efficiency. The analysis identifies two distinct fronts during displacement: a leading displacement-dissolution front and a trailing full-evaporation front. Vertical model downscaling further reveals that gas saturation varies with the depth-dependent permeability profile. In formations where permeability decreases with depth, saturation declines monotonically; in contrast, in systems with increasing permeability, the competition between viscous and gravitational forces can generate non-monotonic saturation profiles. The results also indicate that while fines migration reduces injectivity, it may simultaneously enhance sweep efficiency; highlighting a complex trade-off that must be considered in the design and optimization of CO2 storage operations.</description>

      <title>Modeling Transient Electromagnetic Logging Using Sine Transform and Levin-Sidi Extrapolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transient electromagnetic logging (TEL) is of great significance for detecting deep formation structures outside the wellbore. Forward modeling using analytical solutions requires frequency-domain calculations followed by time-domain conversion. For electromagnetic field computations in horizontally stratified media, mature Hankel transform methods already enable precise solutions. However, for cylindrically stratified media, oscillatory integrals involving cosine functions must be evaluated. This study employs the sine transform to achieve frequency-to-time domain conversion for TEL, proposing a new set of 125-point sine transform filter coefficients with enhanced computational accuracy. For frequency-domain calculations in cylindrically stratified media, the Gauss-Legendre quadrature rule combined with Levin-Sidi extrapolation is adopted to accelerate the convergence of partial sum sequences toward the true integral value. The accuracy of the proposed computational method is verified through numerical experiments in both horizontally layered and cylindrically stratified media.</description>

      <title>Magnetic reversals in a geodynamo model with a stably-stratified layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the process of magnetic reversals in the presence of a stably-stratified layer below the core-mantle boundary using direct numerical simulations of the incompressible magnetohydrodynamics equations under the Boussinesq approximation in a spherical shell. We show that the dipolar-multipolar transition shifts to larger Rayleigh numbers in the presence of a stably-stratified layer, and that the dipolar strength of the magnetic field at the core-mantle boundary increases due to the skin effect. By imposing an heterogeneous heat flux at the outer boundary, we break the equatorial symmetry of the flow, and show that different heat flux patterns can trigger different dynamo solutions, such as hemispheric dynamos and polarity reversals. Using kinematic dynamo simulations, we show that the stably-stratified layer leads to similar growth rates of the dipole and quadrupole components of the magnetic field, playing the role of a conducting boundary layer, favouring magnetic reversals, and a dynamics predicted by low-dimensional models.</description>

      <title>Bursting of columnar structures in forced rotating turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we report intermittent bursting of cyclonic columnar structures in direct numerical simulations of forced rotating turbulence in a three-dimensional (3D) periodic box. Columnar structure formation is associated with dominant inverse cascade of energy in addition to the typical forward cascade at large wavenumbers. The forcing is random and isotropic, applied in two distinct wavenumber bands (kf = [3, 4] and [6, 7]). Notably, bursting is observed only for small forcing wavenumber, kf = [3, 4] and not at kf = [6, 7], for the same rotation rate and initial conditions. These bursting events are associated with forward cascade of energy in contrast to the inverse cascade of rotating turbulence, as confirmed from the ring spectrum and time-series of modal kinetic energy of modes with kz = 2, 3. Identifying some of the triads involved in the energy transfer from modal analysis, we also calculate the mode-to-mode energy transfer. We find that, before the event, the circular cyclonic vortex becomes elliptical due to cyclone-anticyclone interactions leading to elliptical instability. We argue that energy transfer preceding the bursting events to modes with higher kz triggers the Crow instability. These instabilities ultimately lead to bursting of the columnar vortex, which subsequently forms again due to the external rotation. Our results portray a tug-of-war between the destabilizing effect of elliptical instability and the stabilizing effect of external rotation.</description>

      <title>A unified model of feed rotation in radio telescopes and GNSS antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a model that accounts for the phase rotation that occurs when a receiver or transmitter changes orientation while observing or emitting circularly polarized electromagnetic waves. This model extends work detailing Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) carrier phase wind-up to allow us to describe the interaction of changing satellite orientation with phase rotation in observing radio telescopes. This development is motivated by, and a critical requirement of, unifying GNSS and Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) measurements at the observation level. The model can be used for either stationary choke ring antennas or steerable radio telescopes observing either natural radio sources or satellites. Simulations and experimental data are used to validate the model and to illustrate its importance. In addition, we rigorously lay out the feed rotation correction for radio telescopes with beam waveguide and full Nasmyth focuses and validate the correction by observing the effect with dual polarization observations. Using this feed rotation model for beam waveguide telescopes, we produce the first phase delay solution for the VLBI baseline WARK30M-WARK12M. We provide a practical guide to using the feed rotation model in Appendix D.</description>
