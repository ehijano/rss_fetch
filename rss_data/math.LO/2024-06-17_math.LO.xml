      <title>An almost Kurepa Suslin tree with strongly non-saturated square</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For uncountable downwards closed subtrees $U$ and $W$ of an $\omega_1$-tree $T$, we say that $U$ and $W$ are strongly almost disjoint if their intersection is a finite union of countable chains. The tree $T$ is strongly non-saturated if there exists a strongly almost disjoint family of $\omega_2$-many uncountable downwards closed subtrees of $T$. In this article we construct a c.c.c. forcing which adds a Suslin tree together with a family of $\omega_2$-many strongly almost disjoint automorphisms of it (and thus the square of the Suslin tree is strongly non-saturated). To achieve this goal, we introduce a new idea called $\rho$-separation, which is an adaptation to the finite context of the notion of separation which was recently introduced by Stejskalov\'{a} and the first author for the purpose of adding automorphisms of a tree with a forcing with countable conditions.</description>

      <title>Exponentiable linear orders need not be transitive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that every transitive linear order is exponentiable. However, is the converse true? This question was posed in Chapter 8 of the textbook titled "Linear Orderings" by Rosenstein. We define the class CTLO of cyclically transitive linear orders that properly contains the class of transitive linear orders, and show that all discrete unbounded orders in CTLO are exponentiable, thereby providing a negative answer to the question. The class CTLO is closely related to the class of transitive cyclic orders introduced by Droste, Giraudet and Macpherson. We also discuss the closure of subclasses of CTLO under products and iterated Hausdorff condensations.</description>

      <title>Computing Non-Repetitive Sequences with a Computable Lefthanded Local Lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lefthanded Lov\'asz local lemma (LLLL) is a generalization of the Lov\'asz local lemma (LLL), powerful technique from the probabilistic method. We prove a computable version of the LLLL and use it to effectivize a collection of results on the existence of certain types of non-repetitive sequences via the LLL and LLLL. This represents the first constructive proof of these results.</description>

      <title>A Coalgebraic Semantics for Intuitionistic Modal Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a new coalgebraic semantics for intuitionistic modal logic with $\Box$. In particular, we provide a colagebraic representation of intuitionistic descriptive modal frames and of intuitonistic modal Kripke frames based on image-finite posets. This gives a solution to a problem in the area of coalgebaic logic for these classes of frames, raised explicitly by Litak (2014) and de Groot and Pattinson (2020). Our key technical tool is a recent generalization of a construction by Ghilardi, in the form of a right adjoint to the inclusion of the category of Esakia spaces in the category of Priestley spaces. As an application of these results, we study bisimulations of intuitionistic modal frames, describe dual spaces of free modal Heyting algebras, and provide a path towards a theory of coalgebraic intuitionistic logics.</description>

      <title>On a cofinal Reinhardt embedding without Powerset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a positive answer to a question by Matthews whether $\mathsf{ZF}^-$ is consistent with a non-trivial cofinal Reinhardt elementary embedding $j\colon V\to V$. The consistency follows from $\mathsf{ZFC} + I_0$, and more precisely, Schultzenberg's model of $\mathsf{ZF}$ with an elementary embedding $k\colon V_{\lambda+2}\to V_{\lambda+2}$.</description>

      <title>On two recent extensions of the Big Five of Reverse Mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The program Reverse Mathematics in the foundations of mathematics seeks to identify the minimal axioms required to prove theorems of ordinary mathematics. One always assumes the base theory, a logical system embodying computable mathematics. As it turns out, many (most?) theorems are either provable in said base theory, or equivalent to one of four logical systems, collectively called the Big Five. This paper provides an overview of two recent extensions of the Big Five, working in Kohlenbach's higher-order framework. On one hand, we obtain a large number of equivalences between the second-order Big Five and third-order theorems of real analysis dealing with possibly discontinuous functions. On the other hand, we identify four new 'Big' systems, i.e. boasting many equivalences over the base theory, namely the uncountability of the reals, the Jordan decomposition theorem, the Baire category theorem, and Tao's pigeon hole principle for the Lebesgue measure. We discuss a connection to hyperarithmetical analysis, completing the picture.</description>

      <title>Modal logics of almost sure validities in some classes of euclidean and transitive frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a class C of finite Kripke frames, we consider the uniform distribution on the frames from C with n states. A formula is almost surely valid in C if the probability that it is valid in a random C-frame with n states tends to 1 as n tends to infinity. The formulas that are almost surely valid in C form a normal modal logic. We find complete and sound axiomatizations for the logics of almost sure validities in the classes of finite frames defined by the logics K5, KD5, K45, KD45, K5B, S5, Grz.3, and GL.3.</description>

      <title>Ajtai's theorem for $T^2_2(R)$ and pebble games with backtracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a pebble game extended by backtracking options for one of the two players (called Prover) and reduce the provability of the pigeonhole principle for a generic predicate $R$ in the bounded arithmetic $T^2_2(R)$ to the existence of a particular kind of winning strategy (called oblivious) for Prover in the game. While the unprovability of the said principle in $T^2_2(R)$ is an immediate consequence of a celebrated theorem of Ajtai (which deals with a stronger theory $T_2(R)$), up-to-date no methods working for $T^2_2(R)$ directly (in particular without switching lemma) are known. Although the full analysis of the introduced pebble game is left open, as a first step towards resolving it, we restrict ourselves to a simplified version of the game. In this case, Prover can use only two pebbles and move in an extremely oblivious way. Besides, a series of backtracks can be made only once during a play. Under these assumptions, we show that no strategy of Prover can be winning.</description>

      <title>Bundles of metric structures as left ultrafunctors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We pursue the study of Ultracategories initiated by Makkai and more recently Lurie by looking at properties of Ultracategories of complete metric structures, i.e. coming from continuous model theory, instead of ultracategories of models of first order theories. Our main result is that for any continuous theory $\mathbb{T}$, there is an equivalence between the category of left ultrafunctors from a compact Hausdorff space $X$ to the category of $\mathbb{T}$-models and a notion of bundle of $\mathbb{T}$-models over $X$. The notion of bundle of $\mathbb{T}$-models is new but recovers many classical notions like Bundle of Banach spaces, or (semi)-continuous field of $\mathrm{C}^*$-algebras or Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>Coordinate systems in Banach spaces and lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using methods of descriptive set theory, in particular, the determinacy of infinite games of perfect information, we answer several questions from the literature regarding different notions of bases in Banach spaces and lattices. For the case of Banach lattices, our results follow from a general theorem stating that (under the assumption of projective determinacy), every order basis $(e_n)$ for a Banach lattice $X=[e_n]$ is also a $\sigma$-order basis for $X$, every $\sigma$-order basis for $X$ is a uniform basis for $X$, and every uniform basis is Schauder. Regarding Banach spaces, we address two problems concerning filter Schauder bases for Banach spaces, i.e., in which the norm convergence of partial sums is replaced by norm convergence along some appropriate filter on $\mathbb N$. We first provide an example of a Banach space admitting such a filter Schauder basis, but no ordinary Schauder basis. Secondly, we show that every filter Schauder basis with respect to an analytic filter is also a filter Schauder basis with respect to a Borel filter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.06170v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A well-known version of Rowbottom's theorem for supercompactness ultrafilters leads naturally to notions of two-cardinal Ramseyness and corresponding normal ideals introduced herein. Generalizing results of Baumgartner [7, 8], Feng [22] and the first author [16, 17], we study the hierarchies associated with a particular version of two-cardinal Ramseyness and a strong version of two-cardinal ineffability, as well as the relationships between these hierarchies and a natural notion of transfinite two-cardinal indescribability.</description>

      <title>Direct and ordinal products realized by triangular norm operators with no zero divisors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: IIn this note we continue the work of Chon, as well as Mezzomo, Bedregal, and Santiago, by studying algebraic operations on fuzzy posets and bounded fuzzy lattices. We first prove that fuzzy posets are closed under finite direct products whenever the triangular norm realizing the product construction has no zero divisors. This result is then extended to the case of bounded fuzzy lattices. Some immediate consequences are then obtained within the setting of direct products realized by triangular norms with no nilpotent elements as well as strictly monotone and cancellative triangular norms. We then introduce a triangular norm based construction of ordinal products and similarly show that fuzzy posets are closed under ordinal products whenever the triangular norm realizing the product construction has no zero divisors.</description>

      <title>An analytic version of stable arithmetic regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a structure theorem for stable functions on amenable groups, which extends the arithmetic regularity lemma for stable subsets of finite groups. Given a group $G$, a function $f\colon G\to [-1,1]$ is called stable if the binary function $f(x\cdot y)$ is stable in the sense of continuous logic. Roughly speaking, our main result says that if $G$ is amenable, then any stable function on $G$ is almost constant on all translates of a unitary Bohr neighborhood in $G$ of bounded complexity. The proof uses ingredients from topological dynamics and continuous model theory. We also prove several applications which generalize results in arithmetic combinatorics to nonabelian groups.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of the big Ramsey degrees of the generic partial order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.10088v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a result of 33 intercontinental Zoom calls, we characterise big Ramsey degrees of the generic partial order. This is an infinitary extension of the well known fact that finite partial orders endowed with linear extensions form a Ramsey class (this result was announced by Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il and R\"odl in 1984 with first published proof by Paoli, Trotter and Walker in 1985). Towards this, we refine earlier upper bounds obtained by Hubi\v{c}ka based on a new connection of big Ramsey degrees to the Carlson-Simpson theorem and we also introduce a new technique of giving lower bounds using an iterated application of the upper-bound theorem.</description>
