      <title>A symbiotic nondipolar droplet supersolid in a binary dipolar-nondipolar Dy-Rb mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the formation of two types of symbiotic nondipolar droplet supersolid in a binary dipolar-nondipolar mixture with an interspecies atraction, where the dipolar (nondipolar) atoms are trapped (untrapped). In the absence of an interspecies attraction, in the first type, a dipolar droplet supersolid exists, whereas in the second type, there are no droplets in the dipolar component. To illustrate, we consider a $^{164}$Dy-$^{87}$Rb mixture, where the untrapped $^{87}$Rb supersolid sticks to the trapped $^{164}$Dy supersolid due to the interspecies attraction and forms a symbiotic supersolid with overlapping droplets. The first (second) type of symbiotic supersolid emerges for the scattering length $ a_1=85a_0$ ($a_1=95a_0$) of $^{164}$Dy atom, while under an appropriate trap a dipolar droplet supersolid exists (does not exist) for no interspecies interaction, where $a_0$ the Bohr radius. This study is based on the numerical solution of an improved binary mean-field model, where we introduce an intraspecies Lee-Huang-Yang interaction in the dipolar component, which stops a dipolar collapse and forms a dipolar supersolid.To observe this symbiotic droplet supersolid, one should prepare the corresponding fully trapped dipolar-nondipolar supersolid and then remove the trap on the nondipolar atoms.</description>

      <title>Delta-Learning approach combined with the cluster Gutzwiller approximation for strongly correlated bosonic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cluster Gutzwiller method is widely used to study the strongly correlated bosonic systems, owing to its ability to provide a more precise description of quantum fluctuations. However, its utility is limited by the exponential increase in computational complexity as the cluster size grows. To overcome this limitation, we propose an artificial intelligence-based method known as $\Delta$-Learning. This approach constructs a predictive model by learning the discrepancies between lower-precision (small cluster sizes) and high-precision (large cluster sizes) implementations of the cluster Gutzwiller method, requiring only a small number of training samples. Using this predictive model, we can effectively forecast the outcomes of high-precision methods with high accuracy. Applied to various Bose-Hubbard models, the $\Delta$-Learning method effectively predicts phase diagrams while significantly reducing the computational resources and time. Furthermore, we have compared the predictive accuracy of $\Delta$-Learning with other direct learning methods and found that $\Delta$-Learning exhibits superior performance in scenarios with limited training data. Therefore, when combined with the cluster Gutzwiller approximation, the $\Delta$-Learning approach offers a computationally efficient and accurate method for studying phase transitions in large, complex bosonic systems.</description>

      <title>The St\v{r}eda Formula for Floquet Systems: Topological Invariants and Quantized Anomalies from Ces\`aro Summation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a general theoretical framework, which expresses the topological invariants of two-dimensional Floquet systems in terms of tractable response functions: Building on the Sambe representation of periodically-driven systems, and inspired by the St\v{r}eda formula for static systems, we evaluate the flow of the unbounded Floquet density of states in response to a magnetic perturbation. This Floquet-St\v{r}eda response, which is a priori mathematically ill-defined, is regularized by means of a Ces\`aro summation method. As a key outcome of this approach, we relate all relevant Floquet winding numbers to simple band properties of the Floquet-Bloch Hamiltonian. These general relations indicate how the topological characterization of Floquet systems can be entirely deduced from the stroboscopic time-evolution of the driven system. Importantly, we identify two physically distinguishable contributions to the Floquet-St\v{r}eda response: a quantized flow of charge between the edge and the bulk of the system, and an 'anomalous' quantized flow of energy between the system and the driving field, which provides new insight on the physical origin of the anomalous edge states. As byproducts, our theory provides: a general relation between Floquet winding numbers and the orbital magnetization of Floquet-Bloch bands; a local marker for Floquet winding numbers, which allows to access Floquet topology in inhomogeneous samples; an experimental protocol to extract these Floquet winding numbers from density-measurements in the presence of an engineered bath; as well as general expressions for these topological invariants in terms of the magnetic response of the Floquet density of states, opening a route for the topological characterization of interacting Floquet systems.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature polariton condensate in a two-dimensional hybrid perovskite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Layered 2D halide perovskites are chemically synthesized realizations of quantum well stacks with giant exciton oscillator strengths, tunable emission spectra and very large exciton binding energies. While these features render 2D halide perovskites a promising platform for room-temperature polaritonics, bosonic condensation and polariton lasing in 2D perovskites have so far remained elusive at ambient conditions. Here, we demonstrate room-temperature cavity exciton-polariton condensation in mechanically exfoliated crystals of the 2D Ruddlesden-Popper iodide perovskite $(BA)_{2}(MA)_{2}Pb_{3}I_{10}$ in an open optical microcavity. We observe a polariton condensation threshold of $P_{th}=6.76 fJ$ per pulse and detect a strong non-linear response. Interferometric measurements confirm the spontaneous emergence of spatial coherence across the condensate with an associated first-order autocorrelation reaching $g^{(1)}\approx 0.6$. Our results lay the foundation for a new class of room-temperature polariton lasers based on 2D halide perovskites with great potential for hetero-integration with other van-der-Waals materials and combination with photonic crystals or waveguides.</description>

      <title>Dirac points and topological phases in correlated altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a two-dimensional Hubbard model adapted to host altermagnetic states. Utilizing Hartree-Fock (HF) and dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), we uncover that the magnetic solutions of this model feature Dirac points in their spectrum. HF predicts a gap opening at a critical interaction strength, a result corroborated by DMFT calculations at zero temperature. However, at finite temperature and high interaction strengths, Dirac points re-emerge at high energies in the spectral function, even if they are absent in the non-interacting and HF-predicted band structures. Analytical arguments reveal that this phenomenon arises near Mott insulating solutions from the frequency dependence of the self-energy, a behavior not captured by static mean-field theory. We also propose perturbations to the model that can induce a topological gap in the spectrum, leading to a transition from topologically trivial to non-trivial states by varying doping, interaction strength, and temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically calculate the dynamic structure factor of the simplest two dimensional $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory. This provides an important benchmark for future experiments which will explore the dynamics of such models. As would be expected, the spectrum is gapped away from the critical point, and can be understood in terms of the elementary excitations.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the concept of composite topological order in multicomponent systems. In such a state topological order appears only in higher-than-usual composites, with no topological order in elementary fields. We propose that such a state can be realized in Bose-Fermi mixtures in ultracold atoms.</description>

      <title>Probing early phase coarsening in a rapidly quenched Bose gas using off-resonant matter-wave interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the evolution of spatial phase correlations in a rapidly quenched inhomogeneous Bose gas of rubidium using off-resonant matter-wave interferometry. We measure the phase coherence length $\ell$ of the sample and directly probe its increase during the early stage of condensate growth before vortices are formed. Once the vortices are formed stably in the quenched condensate, the measured value of $\ell$ is shown to be linearly proportional to the mean distance between the vortex. These results confirm the presence of phase coarsening prior to vortex formation, which is crucial for a quantitative understanding of the resultant defect density in samples undergoing critical phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Quantum soliton-trains of strongly correlated impurities in Bose-Einstein condensates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strongly correlated impurities immersed in a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) can form a periodic structure of tightly localized single atoms due to competing inter- and intra-species interactions, leading to a self-organized pinned state. In this work, we show numerically that the impurities in the self-pinned state form a soliton-train, as a consequence of a BEC-mediated attractive self-interaction and ordering due to the exclusion principle. The dynamics of the impurities possess similar characteristics to bright matter-wave solitons as they appear in attractive BECs, however in the few impurities case, the detailed nature of collisions is determined by their quantum statistics.</description>

      <title>Dissipation and Interaction-Controlled Non-Hermitian Skin Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian skin effects (NHSEs) have recently been investigated extensively at the single-particle level. When many-body interactions become dominant, novel non-Hermitian physical phenomena can emerge. In this work, we theoretically study NHSEs controlled by dissipation and interaction. We consider a 1D zigzag Bose-Hubbard lattice, subject to magnetic flux, staggered onsite single-particle loss, and uniform onsite two-particle loss. When the two-particle loss is small, two-body bound eigenstates (i.e., doublons) are all localized at the same boundary due to the interplay of the magnetic flux and staggered single-particle loss. While, for strong two-particle loss, the localization direction of doublons is unexpectedly reversed. This is attributed to the effective strong nonreciprocal hopping of doublons contributing from the virtual second-order and third-order hopping processes of particle pairs in combination with the magnetic flux, the strong two-particle loss, and the many-body interaction. Moreover, a two-particle gain can induce the same skin-localization of doublons, which can be utilized to dynamically observe the NHSE and its reversal of doublons controlled by interactions. Our results open up a new avenue for exploring novel non-Hermitian phenomena in many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Erasure-cooling, control, and hyper-entanglement of motion in optical tweezers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15580v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate how motional degrees of freedom in optical tweezers can be used as quantum information carriers. To this end, we first implement a species-agnostic cooling mechanism via conversion of motional excitations into erasures -- errors with a known location -- reminiscent of Maxwell's demon thought experiment. We find that this cooling mechanism fundamentally outperforms idealized traditional sideband cooling, which we experimentally demonstrate in specific scenarios. By coherently manipulating the motional state, we perform mid-circuit readout and mid-circuit erasure detection via local shelving into motional superposition states. We finally entangle the motion of two atoms in separate tweezers, and utilize this to generate hyper-entanglement by preparing a simultaneous Bell state of motional and optical qubits. This work shows how controlling motion enriches the toolbox of quantum information processing with neutral atoms, and opens unique prospects for metrology enhanced by mid-circuit readout and a large class of quantum operations enabled via hyper-entanglement.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal dynamics and the non-Hermitian skin effect of repulsively bound pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10449v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a Bose-Hubbard model coupled to an engineered environment which in the non-interacting limit is described by the celebrated Hatano-Nelson model. At strong interactions, two bosons occupying the same site form a so-called repulsively bound pair, or doublon. Using tensor-network simulations, we clearly identify a distinct doublon lightcone and show that the doublon inherits non-reciprocity from that of single particles. Applying the idea of reservoir engineering at the level of doublons, we introduce a new set of dissipators and we analytically show that then the doublon dynamics are governed by the Hatano-Nelson model. This brings about an interaction-induced non-Hermitian skin effect and non-reciprocal doublon motion. Combining features of the two models we study, we show that single particles and doublons can be made to spread with opposite directionality, opening intriguing possibilities for the study of dynamics in interacting non-reciprocal models.</description>
