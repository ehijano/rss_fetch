      <title>Quantifying data needs in surrogate modeling for flow fields in 2D stirred tanks with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stirred tanks are vital in chemical and biotechnological processes, particularly as bioreactors. Although computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is widely used to model the flow in stirred tanks, its high computational cost$-$especially in multi-query scenarios for process design and optimization$-$drives the need for efficient data-driven surrogate models. However, acquiring sufficiently large datasets can be costly. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer a promising solution to reduce data requirements while maintaining accuracy by embedding underlying physics into neural network (NN) training. This study quantifies the data requirements of vanilla PINNs for developing surrogate models of a flow field in a 2D stirred tank. We compare these requirements with classical supervised neural networks and boundary-informed neural networks (BINNs). Our findings demonstrate that surrogate models can achieve prediction errors around 3% across Reynolds numbers from 50 to 5000 using as few as six datapoints. Moreover, employing an approximation of the velocity profile in place of real data labels leads to prediction errors of around 2.5%. These results indicate that even with limited or approximate datasets, PINNs can be effectively trained to deliver high accuracy comparable to high-fidelity data.</description>

      <title>MNO : A Multi-modal Neural Operator for Parametric Nonlinear BVPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel Multimodal Neural Operator (MNO) architecture designed to learn solution operators for multi-parameter nonlinear boundary value problems (BVPs). Traditional neural operators primarily map either the PDE coefficients or source terms independently to the solution, limiting their flexibility and applicability. In contrast, our proposed MNO architecture generalizes these approaches by mapping multiple parameters including PDE coefficients, source terms, and boundary conditions to the solution space in a unified manner. Our MNO is motivated by the hierarchical nested bases of the Fast Multipole Method (FMM) and is constructed systematically through three key components: a parameter efficient Generalized FMM (GFMM) block, a Unimodal Neural Operator (UNO) built upon GFMM blocks for single parameter mappings, and most importantly, a multimodal fusion mechanism extending these components to learn the joint map. We demonstrate the multimodal generalization capacity of our approach on both linear and nonlinear BVPs. Our experiments show that the network effectively handles simultaneous variations in PDE coefficients and source or boundary terms.</description>

      <title>Universal Fourier Neural Operators for Micromechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: \noindent Solving cell problems in homogenization is hard, and available deep-learning frameworks fail to match the speed and generality of traditional computational frameworks. More to the point, it is generally unclear what to expect of machine-learning approaches, let alone single out which approaches are promising. In the work at hand, we advocate Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) for micromechanics, empowering them by insights from computational micromechanics methods based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT). We construct an FNO surrogate mimicking the basic scheme foundational for FFT-based methods and show that the resulting operator predicts solutions to cell problems with \emph{arbitrary} stiffness distribution only subject to a material-contrast constraint up to a desired accuracy. In particular, there are no restrictions on the material symmetry like isotropy, on the number of phases and on the geometry of the interfaces between materials. Also, the provided fidelity is sharp and uniform, providing explicit guarantees leveraging our physical empowerment of FNOs. To show the desired universal approximation property, we construct an FNO explicitly that requires no training to begin with. Still, the obtained neural operator complies with the same memory requirements as the basic scheme and comes with runtimes proportional to classical FFT solvers. In particular, large-scale problems with more than 100 million voxels are readily handled. The goal of this work is to underline the potential of FNOs for solving micromechanical problems, linking FFT-based methods to FNOs. This connection is expected to provide a fruitful exchange between both worlds.</description>

      <title>Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics with Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) is a method for discovering nonlinear dynamical system models from data. Quantifying uncertainty in SINDy models is essential for assessing their reliability, particularly in safety-critical applications. While various uncertainty quantification methods exist for SINDy, including Bayesian and ensemble approaches, this work explores the integration of Conformal Prediction, a framework that can provide valid prediction intervals with coverage guarantees based on minimal assumptions like data exchangeability. We introduce three applications of conformal prediction with Ensemble-SINDy (E-SINDy): (1) quantifying uncertainty in time series prediction, (2) model selection based on library feature importance, and (3) quantifying the uncertainty of identified model coefficients using feature conformal prediction. We demonstrate the three applications on stochastic predator-prey dynamics and several chaotic dynamical systems. We show that conformal prediction methods integrated with E-SINDy can reliably achieve desired target coverage for time series forecasting, effectively quantify feature importance, and produce more robust uncertainty intervals for model coefficients, even under non-Gaussian noise, compared to standard E-SINDy coefficient estimates.</description>

      <title>Thought Purity: Defense Paradigm For Chain-of-Thought Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While reinforcement learning-trained Large Reasoning Models (LRMs, e.g., Deepseek-R1) demonstrate advanced reasoning capabilities in the evolving Large Language Models (LLMs) domain, their susceptibility to security threats remains a critical vulnerability. This weakness is particularly evident in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generation processes, where adversarial methods like backdoor prompt attacks can systematically subvert the model's core reasoning mechanisms. The emerging Chain-of-Thought Attack (CoTA) reveals this vulnerability through exploiting prompt controllability, simultaneously degrading both CoT safety and task performance with low-cost interventions. To address this compounded security-performance vulnerability, we propose Thought Purity (TP): a defense paradigm that systematically strengthens resistance to malicious content while preserving operational efficacy. Our solution achieves this through three synergistic components: (1) a safety-optimized data processing pipeline (2) reinforcement learning-enhanced rule constraints (3) adaptive monitoring metrics. Our approach establishes the first comprehensive defense mechanism against CoTA vulnerabilities in reinforcement learning-aligned reasoning systems, significantly advancing the security-functionality equilibrium for next-generation AI architectures.</description>

      <title>Advancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Structured Enterprise and Internal Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Organizations increasingly rely on proprietary enterprise data, including HR records, structured reports, and tabular documents, for critical decision-making. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have strong generative capabilities, they are limited by static pretraining, short context windows, and challenges in processing heterogeneous data formats. Conventional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks address some of these gaps but often struggle with structured and semi-structured data.
  This work proposes an advanced RAG framework that combines hybrid retrieval strategies using dense embeddings (all-mpnet-base-v2) and BM25, enhanced by metadata-aware filtering with SpaCy NER and cross-encoder reranking. The framework applies semantic chunking to maintain textual coherence and retains tabular data structures to preserve row-column integrity. Quantized indexing optimizes retrieval efficiency, while human-in-the-loop feedback and conversation memory improve adaptability.
  Experiments on enterprise datasets show notable improvements: Precision@5 increased by 15 percent (90 versus 75), Recall@5 by 13 percent (87 versus 74), and Mean Reciprocal Rank by 16 percent (0.85 versus 0.69). Qualitative evaluations show higher scores in Faithfulness (4.6 versus 3.0), Completeness (4.2 versus 2.5), and Relevance (4.5 versus 3.2) on a 5-point Likert scale. These results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in delivering accurate, comprehensive, and contextually relevant responses for enterprise tasks. Future work includes extending to multimodal data and integrating agent-based retrieval. The source code will be released at https://github.com/CheerlaChandana/Enterprise-Chatbot</description>

      <title>Eyes on the Road, Mind Beyond Vision: Context-Aware Multi-modal Enhanced Risk Anticipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate accident anticipation remains challenging when driver cognition and dynamic road conditions are underrepresented in predictive models. In this paper, we propose CAMERA (Context-Aware Multi-modal Enhanced Risk Anticipation), a multi-modal framework integrating dashcam video, textual annotations, and driver attention maps for robust accident anticipation. Unlike existing methods that rely on static or environment-centric thresholds, CAMERA employs an adaptive mechanism guided by scene complexity and gaze entropy, reducing false alarms while maintaining high recall in dynamic, multi-agent traffic scenarios. A hierarchical fusion pipeline with Bi-GRU (Bidirectional GRU) captures spatio-temporal dependencies, while a Geo-Context Vision-Language module translates 3D spatial relationships into interpretable, human-centric alerts. Evaluations on the DADA-2000 and benchmarks show that CAMERA achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving accuracy and lead time. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of modeling driver attention, contextual description, and adaptive risk thresholds to enable more reliable accident anticipation.</description>

      <title>Fast Algorithms and Implementations for Computing the Minimum Distance of Quantum Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The distance of a stabilizer quantum code is a very important feature since it determines the number of errors that can be detected and corrected. We present three new fast algorithms and implementations for computing the symplectic distance of the associated classical code. Our new algorithms are based on the Brouwer-Zimmermann algorithm. Our experimental study shows that these new implementations are much faster than current state-of-the-art licensed implementations on single-core processors, multicore processors, and shared-memory multiprocessors. In the most computationally-demanding cases, the performance gain in the computational time can be larger than one order of magnitude. The experimental study also shows a good scalability on shared-memory parallel architectures.</description>
