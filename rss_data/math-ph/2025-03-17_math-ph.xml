      <title>The $n$-point Exceptional Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve an open problem in spectral geometry: the construction of finite-dimensional, discrete geometries coordinatized by non-simple, exceptional Jordan algebras. The approach taken is readily generalisable to broad classes of nonassociative geometries, opening the door to the spectral geometric desciption of gauge theories with exceptional symmetries. We showcase a proof-of-principle 2-point geometry corresponding to the internal space of an $F_4 \times F_4$ gauge theory with scalar content restricted by novel conditions arising from the associative properties of the coordinate algebra. We then formally establish a setting for generalising to n-point exceptional Jordan geometries with distinct points coupled together via an action on 1-forms constructed as split Jordan bimodules.</description>

      <title>Small distance behavior of one-particle Green's functions in electronic structure theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of many-particle perturbation theory, we develop an analytical approach that allows us to determine the small distance behavior of Green's functions and related quantities in electronic structure theory. As a case study, we consider the one-particle Green's function up to 2nd order in the perturbation approach. We derive explicit expressions for the leading order terms of the asymptotic small distance behavior. In particular, we demonstrate the appearance of a logarithmic term in the corresponding 2nd order Feynman diagrams. Our asymptotic analysis leads to an improved classification scheme for the diagrams, which takes into account not only the perturbation order, but also the asymptotic smoothness properties near their diagonals. Such a classification may be useful in the design of numerical algorithms and helps to improve their efficiency.</description>

      <title>Effective Soliton Velocities in the Toda Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the Toda lattice $(\boldsymbol{p}(t); \boldsymbol{q}(t))$ at thermal equilibrium, meaning that its variables $(p_i)$ and $(e^{q_i-q_{i+1}})$ are independent Gaussian and Gamma random variables, respectively. This model can be thought of a dense collection of many solitons. We establish a law of large numbers for the trajectory of these solitons, showing that they travel with approximately constant velocities, which are explicit. Our proof is based on a direct analysis of the asymptotic scattering relation, an equation (proven in previous work of the author) that approximately governs the dynamics of soliton locations. This makes use of a regularization argument that essentially linearizes this relation, together with concentration estimates for the Toda lattice's (random) Lax matrix.</description>

      <title>Essentials of the kinetic theory of multi-agent systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a critical collection of essential mathematical tools and techniques for the analysis of Boltzmann-type kinetic equations, which in recent years have established themselves as a flexible and powerful paradigm to model interacting multi-agent systems. We consider, in particular, scalar equations implementing linear symmetric interaction rules, for which we develop the theory of well-posedness, trend to equilibrium, and Fokker-Planck asymptotics by relying extensively on Fourier methods. We also outline the basics of Monte Carlo algorithms for the numerical solution of such equations. Finally, we elaborate the theory further for Boltzmann-type equations on graphs, a recent generalisation of the standard setting motivated by the modelling of networked multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>Simple Hamiltonians for Matrix Product State models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matrix Product States (MPS) and Tensor Networks provide a general framework for the construction of solvable models. The best-known example is the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) model, which is the ground state of a 2-body nearest-neighbor parent Hamiltonian. We show that such simple parent Hamiltonians for MPS models are, in fact, much more prevalent than hitherto known: The existence of a single example with a simple Hamiltonian for a given choice of dimensions already implies that any generic MPS with those dimensions possesses an equally simple Hamiltonian. We illustrate our finding by discussing a number of models with nearest-neighbor parent Hamiltonians, which generalize the AKLT model on various levels.</description>

      <title>Involutive scroll structures on solutions of 4D dispersionless integrable hierarchies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A rational normal scroll structure on an $(n+1)$-dimensional manifold $M$ is defined as a field of rational normal scrolls of degree $n-1$ in the projectivised cotangent bundle $\mathbb{P}T^*M$. We show that geometry of this kind naturally arises on solutions of various 4D dispersionless integrable hierarchies of heavenly type equations. In this context, rational normal scrolls coincide with the characteristic varieties (principal symbols) of the hierarchy. Furthermore, such structures automatically satisfy an additional property of involutivity. Our main result states that involutive scroll structures are themselves governed by a dispersionless integrable hierarchy, namely, the hierarchy of conformal self-duality equations.</description>

      <title>K\"ahler-Einstein metrics arising from micro-canonical measures and Hamiltonian dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce new probabilistic and variational constructions of (twisted) K\"ahler-Einstein metrics on complex projective algebraic varieties, drawing inspiration from Onsager's statistical mechanical model of turbulence in two-dimensional incompressible fluids. The probabilistic construction involves microcanonical measures associated with the level sets of the pluricomplex energy, which give rise to maximum entropy principles. These, in turn, yield novel characterizations of K\"ahler-Einstein metrics, as well of Fano varieties admitting such metrics. Additionally, connections to Hamiltonian dynamics are uncovered, resulting in a new evolution equation, that generalizes both the 2D incompressible Euler equation and the 2D semi-geostrophic equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modified Toda hierarchy is a two-component generalization of the 1st modified KP hierarchy, which has been widely applied to analyze constraints of the Toda hierarchy, including the B--Toda and C--Toda hierarchies. In this paper, we construct additional symmetries for the modified Toda hierarchy and derive the corresponding Adler-Shiota-van Moerbeke formula. In addition, we also show that $(N,M)$--bigraded modified Toda hierarchy(BMTH), which is a special reduction for modified Toda, possess additional symmetries that form a subalgebra of the Virasoro algebra.</description>

      <title>On the localization length of finite-volume random block Schr\"odinger operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a general class of random block Schr\"odinger operators (RBSOs) in dimensions 1 and 2, which naturally extend the Anderson model by replacing the random potential with a random block potential. Specifically, we focus on two RBSOs -- the block Anderson and Wegner orbital models -- defined on the $d$-dimensional torus $(\mathbb Z/L\mathbb Z)^d$. They take the form $H=V + \lambda \Psi$, where $V$ is a block potential with i.i.d. $W^d\times W^d$ Gaussian diagonal blocks, $\Psi$ describes interactions between neighboring blocks, and $\lambda&gt;0$ is a coupling parameter. We normalize the blocks of $\Psi$ so that each block has a Hilbert-Schmidt norm of the same order as the blocks of $V$. Assuming $W\ge L^\delta$ for a small constant $\delta&gt;0$ and $\lambda\gg W^{-d/2}$, we establish the following results. In dimension $d=2$, we prove delocalization and quantum unique ergodicity for bulk eigenvectors, which, combined with the localization result from arXiv:1608.02922 under the condition $\lambda\ll W^{-d/2}$, rigorously establishes the Anderson localization-delocalization transition as $\lambda$ crosses the critical threshold $W^{-d/2}$. In dimension $d=1$, we show that the localization length of bulk eigenvectors is at least of order $(W\lambda)^2$, which is conjectured to be the correct scaling for the localization length.</description>

      <title>Fused Specht Polynomials and $c=1$ Degenerate Conformal Blocks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a class of polynomials that we call fused Specht polynomials and use them to characterize irreducible representations of the fused Hecke algebra with parameter $q=-1$ in the space of polynomials. We apply the fused Specht polynomials to construct a basis for a space of holomorphic (chiral) conformal blocks with central charge $c=1$ which are degenerate at each point. In conformal field theory, this corresponds to all primary fields having conformal weight in the Kac table. The associated correlation functions are expected to give rise to conformally invariant boundary conditions for the Gaussian free field, which has also been verified in special cases.</description>

      <title>Exact Quantum Dynamics, Shortcuts to Adiabaticity, and Quantum Quenches in Strongly-Correlated Many-Body Systems: The Time-Dependent Jastrow Ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.14937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The description of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems far from equilibrium presents a fundamental challenge due to the vast amount of information it requires. We introduce a generalization of the Jastrow ansatz for time-dependent wavefunctions that offers an efficient and exact description of the time evolution of various strongly correlated systems. Previously known exact solutions are characterized by scale invariance, enforcing self-similar evolution of local correlations, such as the spatial density. However, we demonstrate that a complex-valued time-dependent Jastrow ansatz (TDJA) is not restricted to scale invariance and can describe a broader class of dynamical processes lacking this symmetry. The associated time evolution is equivalent to the implementation of a shortcut to adiabaticity (STA) via counterdiabatic driving along a continuous manifold of quantum states described by a real-valued TDJA, providing a framework for engineering exact STA in strongly correlated many-body quantum systems. We illustrate our findings in systems with inverse-square interactions, such as the Calogero-Sutherland and hyperbolic models, supplemented with pairwise logarithmic interactions, as well as in the long-range Lieb-Liniger model, where bosons experience both contact and Coulomb interactions in one dimension. Our results enable the study of quench dynamics in all these models and serve as a benchmark for numerical and quantum simulations of nonequilibrium strongly correlated systems with continuous variables.</description>

      <title>Majorana fermions solve the tetrahedron equations as well as higher simplex equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Yang-Baxter equations define quantum integrable models. The tetrahedron and higher simplex equations are multi-dimensional generalizations. Finding the solutions of these equations is a formidable task. In this work we develop a systematic method - constructing higher simplex operators [solutions of corresponding simplex equations] from lower simplex ones. We call it lifting. By starting from solutions of Yang-Baxter equations we can construct solutions of the tetrahedron equation and simplex equation in any dimension. We then generalize this by starting from a solution of any lower simplex equation and lifting it [construct solution] to another simplex equation in higher dimension. This process introduces several constraints among the different lower simplex operators that are lifted to form the higher simplex operators. We show that braided Yang-Baxter operators [solutions of Yang-Baxter equations independent of spectral parameters] constructed using Majorana fermions satisfy these constraints, thus solving the higher simplex equations. As a consequence these solutions help us understand the action of an higher simplex operator on Majorana fermions. Apart from these we show that solutions constructed using Dirac (complex) fermions and Clifford algebras also satisfy these constraints. Furthermore it is observed that the Clifford solutions give rise to positive Boltzmann weights resulting in the possibility of physical statistical mechanics models in higher dimensions. Finally we also show that anti-Yang-Baxter operators [solutions of Yang-Baxter-like equations with a negative sign on the right hand side] can also be lifted to higher simplex solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: ''Positive geometries'' are a class of semi-algebraic domains which admit a unique ''canonical form'': a logarithmic form whose residues match the boundary structure of the domain. The study of such geometries is motivated by recent progress in particle physics, where the corresponding canonical forms are interpreted as the integrands of scattering amplitudes. We recast these concepts in the language of mixed Hodge theory, and identify ''genus zero pairs'' of complex algebraic varieties as a natural and general framework for the study of positive geometries and their canonical forms. In this framework, we prove some basic properties of canonical forms which have previously been proved or conjectured in the literature. We give many examples and study in detail the case of arrangements of hyperplanes and convex polytopes.</description>

      <title>Partition functions of determinantal point processes on polarized K\"ahler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the asymptotic expansion of the partition functions of determinantal point processes defined on a polarized K\"ahler manifold. The full asymptotic expansion of the partition functions is derived in two ways: one using Bergman kernel asymptotics and the other using the Quillen anomaly formula along with the asymptotic expansion of the Ray-Singer analytic torsion. By combining these two expressions, we show that each coefficient is given by geometric functionals on K\"ahler metrics satisfying the cocycle identity, and its first variation is closely related to the asymptotic expansion of the Bergman kernel. In particular, these functionals naturally generalize the Mabuchi functional in K\"ahler geometry and the Liouville functional on Riemann surfaces. Furthermore, we show that a Futaki-type holomorphic invariant obstructs the existence of critical points for each geometric functional given by the coefficients of the asymptotic expansion. Finally, we verify some of our results through explicit computations, which hold without the polarization assumption.</description>

      <title>Linear Instability of the Prandtl Equations via Hypergeometric Functions and the Harmonic Oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a deep connection between the Prandtl equations linearised around a quadratic shear flow, confluent hypergeometric functions of the first kind, and the Schr\"odinger operator. Our first result concerns an ODE and a spectral condition derived in [10], associated with unstable quasi-eigenmodes of the Prandtl equations. We entirely determine the space of solutions in terms of Kummer's functions. By classifying their asymptotic behaviour, we verify that the spectral condition has a unique, explicitly determined pair of eigenvalue and eigenfunction, the latter being expressible as a combination of elementary functions. Secondly, we prove that any quasi-eigenmode solution of the linearised Prandtl equations around a quadratic shear flow can be explicitly determined from algebraic eigenfunctions of the Schr\"odinger operator with quadratic potential. We show finally that the obtained analytical formulation of the velocity align with previous numerical simulations in the literature.</description>

Abstract: Collective coherent (CC) errors are inevitable, as every physical qubit experiences evolution due to its kinetic Hamiltonian. Quantum error correction (QEC) codes are essential in protecting quantum information from both CC and stochastic Pauli errors. While stabilizer codes are designed to correct low-weight stochastic Pauli errors, they are less effective against high-weight errors. Constant excitation (CE) codes, however, are immune to CC errors by ensuring that codewords have constant excitation. However, this comes at the cost of increased qubit overhead, raising the expense of QEC hardware and logical qubit infrastructure. In this work, we propose a new family of CE stabilizer codes with parameters $[[2^{r+1}, 2^r-(r+1), 4]]$. Compared to the existing $[[20,1,4]]$ CE stabilizer code, our smallest instance, the $[[8,1,4]]$ CE stabilizer code, significantly reduces the number of physical qubits required. Furthermore, this new CE code family improves the asymptotics code rate from $\frac{1}{8}$ in our previous work~\cite{2412.16450} to $\frac{1}{2}$, offering a more efficient trade-off between error correction and qubit overhead.</description>
