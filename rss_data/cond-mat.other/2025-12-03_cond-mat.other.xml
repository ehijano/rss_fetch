      <title>Exciton spin structure in lead halide perovskite semiconductors explored via the spin dynamics in magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the spin structure and spin dynamics of excitons in bulk lead halide perovskite semiconductors with cubic, tetragonal, and orthorhombic crystal symmetry. The exciton spin structure and its modification by an external magnetic field are modeled for different regimes defined by the relative magnitude of the electron-hole exchange interaction (splitting between dark and bright states) and the Zeeman spin splitting. The effects of crystal symmetry and magnetic field orientation with respect to the crystal axes are considered for lead halide perovskite crystals with band gaps in the range 1.4 - 3.5 eV, having different ratios of electron and hole g-factors. For cubic symmetry, in a longitudinal magnetic field, our theory predicts quantum beats between the bright exciton states under linearly polarized excitation and detection, while the dark exciton remains optically inactive. In a transverse magnetic field, all exciton spin states become optically active and can be excited by circularly polarized light. Reduction of the crystal symmetry leads to a zero-field offset of the exciton Larmor precession frequencies, modifying the Zeeman splitting energy dependence on magnetic field. This theoretical framework allows for the extraction of the strength of the exchange interaction and the crystal symmetry. Experimentally, we measure the exciton spin coherence via time-resolved photoluminescence at a temperature of 1.6 K in longitudinal and transverse magnetic fields in orthorhombic MAPbI3 crystals. Polarization beats at the frequency of the bright exciton are observed in both configurations. Comparison with theory indicates that the excitons are in the strong exchange interaction regime, and the reduction of symmetry does not lead to a significant splitting of the exciton spin levels.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of magic dressing of $^3$He</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A common concern in high-precision neutron electric dipole moment (nEDM) experiments is that of magnetic field stability. For static fields, this problem can be mitigated through the use of a superconducting holding field coil, which when operated in persistent current mode serves to stabilize the magnetic field. However, such a solution is not viable when time-varying magnetic fields are present, as is the case for the spin dressing mode of the proposed nEDMSF (nEDM super-fluid) experiment. This experiment features an oscillating magnetic field to dress the gyromagnetic ratios of $^3$He and neutrons to the same value, a condition known as critical dressing. Fluctuations in the dressing field amplitude have the potential to disrupt this condition. Here, we investigate a modification to spin dressing, termed ``magic dressing,'' which renders the system insensitive to small variations in dressing field amplitude. We further demonstrate the utility of this method for the single spin-species case using a sample of polarized $^3$He. We find a dramatic increase in transverse relaxation time in the presence of magnetic field gradients.</description>

      <title>Electric-Field and Doping-Induced Non collinear Magnetic Interactions in Monolayer Ti$_2$Si</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) silicides are an emerging class of materials whose magnetic and relativistic properties remain largely unexplored. Using first-principles calculations, we investigate how electric-field modulation and transition-metal doping influence the magnetic exchange, magnetocrystalline anisotropy, and antisymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in monolayer Ti2Si. Pristine Ti2Si is a dynamically stable ferromagnetic metal with in-plane anisotropy and centrosymmetric bonding, which suppresses DMI even under strong perpendicular electric fields. To overcome this symmetry constraint, we introduce Pt and Co substitution at Ti sites. Co enhances the magnetic exchange, whereas Pt provides strong spin orbit coupling (SOC), and the combined chemical asymmetry breaks inversion symmetry sufficiently to induce a sizable DMI. A Wannier-based tight-binding model captures the orbital-resolved superexchange pathways and reveals a clear hierarchy between a weak Si-mediated channel and a dominant Pt-mediated interlayer channel. First-principles calculations confirm that the Pt-assisted pathway governs the magnitude and sign of the total DMI. Among all configurations, Pt0.5CoTi0.5Si exhibits the strongest chiral interaction, with its intralayer and interlayer contributions favoring opposite rotation senses, namely counterclockwise (CCW) and clockwise (CW). Our results establish chemically engineered Ti2Si monolayers as a promising platform for realizing and tuning chiral magnetic textures in 2D silicides.</description>

      <title>Topological Pseudospin Hall Effect and Multi-frequency Corner Modes in Kagome-based Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological phases and modes, including pseudospin-Hall-selective edge transport and corner states, provide robust control of wave propagation and modal confinement in classical wave platforms. Under a tight-binding framework, we theoretically investigate two lattice designs derived from the kagome lattice. These extended kagome lattices support a series of localized modes, including pseudospin-Hall-like topological edge states and corner modes in different bandgaps and frequencies, which were not only achieved under lower lattice symmetries than Wu-Hu lattices, but also enable more degrees of freedom in topological and localized modes. By introducing two types of extended kagome lattices with different topological properties, multiple interesting phenomena, including newly emerged multiple groups of corner states, parametric tunable pseudospin Hall effect, and type-II corner states without long-range interactions, are found in theoretical models, which are possible and viable to achieve in artificial classical systems such as photonic, acoustic, or electrical circuits.</description>

      <title>Modulation of DNA rheology by a transcription factor that forms aging microgels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proteins and nucleic acids form non-Newtonian liquids with complex rheological properties that contribute to their function in vivo. Here we investigate the rheology of the transcription factor NANOG, a key protein in sustaining embryonic stem cell self-renewal. We discover that at high concentrations NANOG forms macroscopic aging gels through its intrinsically disordered tryptophan-rich domain. By combining molecular dynamics simulations, mass photometry and Cryo-EM, we also discover that NANOG forms self-limiting micelle-like clusters which expose their DNA-binding domains. In dense solutions of DNA, NANOG micelle-like structures stabilize intermolecular entanglements and crosslinks, forming microgel-like structures. Our findings suggest that NANOG may contribute to regulate gene expression in a unconventional way: by restricting and stabilizing genome dynamics at key transcriptional sites through the formation of an aging microgel-like structure, potentially enabling mechanical memory in the gene network.</description>

      <title>Explicit error bounds with commutator scaling for time-dependent product and multi-product formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Product formula (PF), which approximates the time evolution under a many-body Hamiltonian by the product of local time evolution operators, is one of the central approaches for simulating quantum dynamics by quantum computers. It has been of great interest whether PFs have a bound of the error from the exact time evolution, which is expressed by commutators among local terms (called commutator scaling), since it brings the substantial suppression of the computational cost in the system size. Although recent studies have revealed the presence and the explicit formulas of the PF error bounds for time-independent systems, those for time-dependent Hamiltonians remain to be a difficult problem except for low-order PFs. In this paper, we derive an explicit error bound of generic PFs for smooth time-dependent Hamiltonians, which is expressed by commutators among local terms and their time derivatives. This error bound can also host the substantial suppression in the system size for generic local Hamiltonians with finite-, short-, and long-ranged interactions, thereby giving a much better estimate of gate counts. Our derivation employs Floquet theory; Embedding generic smooth time-dependent Hamiltonians into time-periodic ones, we map the time-dependent PF error to the time-independent one defined on an infinite-dimensional space. This approach allows to obtain the error bounds not only for the ordinary time-dependent PF but also for its various family. In particular, we also clarify the explicit error bound of a time-dependent multi-product formula, with which we can achieve much smaller error by a linear combination of time-dependent PFs. Our results will shed light on various applications of quantum computers, ranging from quantum simulation of nonequilibrium materials to faster algorithms exploiting time-dependent Hamiltonians like adiabatic state preparation.</description>

      <title>Spectral Bifurcation and Anomalous Supercurrent in Dissipative Topological Insulator-based Josephson Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09397v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay between topological protection and dissipation constitutes a critical frontier in the realization of hybrid quantum devices. Here, we investigate the transport signatures in a dissipative topological insulator-based Josephson junction, a platform that directly probes the competition between quantum coherence and loss. We model dissipation by coupling a `lossy' metallic lead to the junction, described effectively by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian derived using the Lindblad formalism. We observe that the junction exhibits an asymmetric complex Andreev spectrum, where the imaginary energy component imposes a finite lifetime on the quasi-bound states. Furthermore, beyond specific phase intervals, the real component of the spectrum bifurcates: one branch merges with the continuum, while the other penetrates just below the superconducting gap. Crucially, the characteristic zero-energy crossing shifts away from $\phi=\pi$ and acquires a non-zero imaginary component; consequently, the associated Majorana bound states acquire a finite lifetime, signaling a loss of robustness against dissipation. Finally, this spectral asymmetry drives an anomalous supercurrent, manifested as a non-vanishing current at zero phase difference. Our results reveal how dissipation fundamentally reshapes superconducting transport in topological junctions, opening new directions for dissipation-engineered quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Non-classical nucleation pathways in liquid condensation revealed by simulation and theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19473v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using state-of-the-art rare-event sampling simulations, we precisely characterize the nucleation of liquid droplets from a supersaturated Lennard-Jones gas and uncover a key physical feature: critical clusters nucleate with a density that differ substantially from that of the macroscopic equilibrium liquid. Our atomistic simulations also reveal a non-classical nucleation pathway showing simultaneous growth and densification in liquid condensation. We then exploit these insights to develop a two-variable nucleation theory, in which the cluster density is allowed to vary. Our accessible model based on the capillary approximation is able to quantitatively retrieve the numerical results in nucleation rate and critical cluster properties over a large range of supersaturation. Remarkably, the two-variable model successfully captures the observed nucleation pathway. The effectiveness of this integrated numerical and theoretical framework demonstrates that the cluster density is a decisive variable in nucleation, highlighting the limitations of the single-variable description while offering a robust foundation for its refinement.</description>

      <title>Approximate half-integer quantization in anomalous planar transport in $d$-wave altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate anomalous planar transport phenomena in a recently identified class of collinear magnetic materials known as $d$-wave altermagnets. The anomalous planar effects manifest in a configuration when the applied electric field/temperature gradient, magnetic field, and the measured Hall voltage are all co-planar, but the planar magnetic field is instrumental in breaking $\hat{C}_{4z}\hat{\mathcal{T}}$ symmetry of the $d$-wave altermagnet, where $\hat{\mathcal{T}}$ is the time reversal operator, resulting in a Zeeman gap at a shifted Dirac node and a nonzero Berry curvature monopole. We demonstrate that these systems exhibit nearly half-quantized anomalous planar Hall and planar thermal Hall effects at low temperatures that persist over a range of magnetic fields. The angular dependence of the planar transport reveals a $\cos2\phi$ dependence on the magnetic field direction, where $\phi$ is the azimuthal angle made by the magnetic field. We also discuss the anomalous planar Nernst effect, or transverse thermopower, and demonstrate that the Nernst conductivity peaks when the chemical potential lies just outside the induced Zeeman gap and vanishes within the gap. We further explore the dependence of all three coefficients on the polar and the azimuthal angle of the magnetic field when it is rotated in the full $3D$ space. Our results reveal the presence of approximately half-quantized anomalous planar thermal Hall plateau for a range of in-plane magnetic fields without requiring topological superconductivity and conducting Majorana modes, and can be probed in experiments in $d$-wave altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Multi-mode Deep Strong Coupling in a Multi Quantum Well Fabry-Perot Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present multi-mode deep-strong coupling in a multi-quantum well (N=166) heterostructure. The heterostructure itself acts as a Fabry-Perot cavity, for which the even cavity modes strongly couple to the cyclotron resonance to form Landau polaritons. The experimentally observed vacuum Rabi splitting is larger than the mode spacing and well into the deep-strong coupling regime ($\eta&gt;1$) resulting in a rich multi-mode polaritonic spectrum which is accurately reproduced by an all-to-all multi-photonic, multi-electronic Hopfield coupling model. Remarkably, light-matter decoupling is observed across the whole measurable spectrum, including in the low frequency limit ($\lambda&gt;&gt;L_{cav}$) where the normalized coupling strength reaches $\eta=8.1$. The system demonstrates a robust platform for exploring extreme coupling regimes and its chiral nature holds potential for chiral cavity and chiral mirror applications.</description>
