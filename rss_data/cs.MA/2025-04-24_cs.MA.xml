      <title>AGCo-MATA: Air-Ground Collaborative Multi-Agent Task Allocation in Mobile Crowdsensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid progress in intelligent unmanned systems has presented new opportunities for mobile crowd sensing (MCS). Today, heterogeneous air-ground collaborative multi-agent framework, which comprise unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), have presented superior flexibility and efficiency compared to traditional homogeneous frameworks in complex sensing tasks. Within this context, task allocation among different agents always play an important role in improving overall MCS quality. In order to better allocate tasks among heterogeneous collaborative agents, in this paper, we investigated two representative complex multi-agent task allocation scenarios with dual optimization objectives: (1) For AG-FAMT (Air-Ground Few Agents More Tasks) scenario, the objectives are to maximize the task completion while minimizing the total travel distance; (2) For AG-MAFT (Air-Ground More Agents Few Tasks) scenario, where the agents are allocated based on their locations, has the optimization objectives of minimizing the total travel distance while reducing travel time cost. To achieve this, we proposed a Multi-Task Minimum Cost Maximum Flow (MT-MCMF) optimization algorithm tailored for AG-FAMT, along with a multi-objective optimization algorithm called W-ILP designed for AG-MAFT, with a particular focus on optimizing the charging path planning of UAVs. Our experiments based on a large-scale real-world dataset demonstrated that the proposed two algorithms both outperform baseline approaches under varying experimental settings, including task quantity, task difficulty, and task distribution, providing a novel way to improve the overall quality of mobile crowdsensing tasks.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Agent, Laxity-Based Aggregation Strategy for Cost-Effective Electric Vehicle Charging and Local Transformer Overload Prevention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid electrification of transportation, driven by stringent decarbonization targets and supportive policies, poses significant challenges for distribution system operators (DSOs). When numerous electric vehicles (EVs) charge concurrently, local transformers risk overloading - a problem that current tariff-based strategies do not adequately address. This paper introduces an aggregator-based coordination mechanism that shifts EV charging from congested to underutilized periods using a rule-based scheduling algorithm. Unlike conventional methods that depend on complex real-time pricing signals or optimization-heavy solutions, the aggregator approach uses a simple yet effective "laxity" measure to prioritize charging flexibility. To assess technical and economic viability, a multi-agent simulation was developed to replicate residential user behavior and DSO constraints under the use of a 400 kVA low-voltage transformer. The results indicate that overloads are completely eliminated with minimal inconvenience to users, whose increased charging costs are offset by the aggregator at an annual total of under DKK 6000 - significantly lower than the cost of infrastructure reinforcement. This study contributes by (i) quantifying the compensation needed to prevent large-scale overloads, (ii) presenting a replicable, computationally feasible, rule-based aggregator model for DSOs, and (iii) comparing aggregator solutions to costly transformer upgrades, underscoring the aggregator's role as a viable tool for future distribution systems.</description>

      <title>Towards a HIPAA Compliant Agentic AI System in Healthcare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agentic AI systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) as their foundational reasoning engine, are transforming clinical workflows such as medical report generation and clinical summarization by autonomously analyzing sensitive healthcare data and executing decisions with minimal human oversight. However, their adoption demands strict compliance with regulatory frameworks such as Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), particularly when handling Protected Health Information (PHI). This work-in-progress paper introduces a HIPAA-compliant Agentic AI framework that enforces regulatory compliance through dynamic, context-aware policy enforcement. Our framework integrates three core mechanisms: (1) Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) for granular PHI governance, (2) a hybrid PHI sanitization pipeline combining regex patterns and BERT-based model to minimize leakage, and (3) immutable audit trails for compliance verification.</description>

      <title>PACE: A Framework for Learning and Control in Linear Incomplete-Information Differential Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of a two-player linear quadratic differential game with incomplete information, a scenario commonly encountered in multi-agent control, human-robot interaction (HRI), and approximation methods for solving general-sum differential games. While solutions to such linear differential games are typically obtained through coupled Riccati equations, the complexity increases when agents have incomplete information, particularly when neither is aware of the other's cost function. To tackle this challenge, we propose a model-based Peer-Aware Cost Estimation (PACE) framework for learning the cost parameters of the other agent. In PACE, each agent treats its peer as a learning agent rather than a stationary optimal agent, models their learning dynamics, and leverages this dynamic to infer the cost function parameters of the other agent. This approach enables agents to infer each other's objective function in real time based solely on their previous state observations and dynamically adapt their control policies. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical guarantee for the convergence of parameter estimation and the stability of system states in PACE. Additionally, in our numerical studies, we demonstrate how modeling the learning dynamics of the other agent benefits PACE, compared to approaches that approximate the other agent as having complete information, particularly in terms of stability and convergence speed.</description>

      <title>Communication-Efficient Personalized Distributed Learning with Data and Node Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To jointly tackle the challenges of data and node heterogeneity in decentralized learning, we propose a distributed strong lottery ticket hypothesis (DSLTH), based on which a communication-efficient personalized learning algorithm is developed. In the proposed method, each local model is represented as the Hadamard product of global real-valued parameters and a personalized binary mask for pruning. The local model is learned by updating and fusing the personalized binary masks while the real-valued parameters are fixed among different agents. To further reduce the complexity of hardware implementation, we incorporate a group sparse regularization term in the loss function, enabling the learned local model to achieve structured sparsity. Then, a binary mask aggregation algorithm is designed by introducing an intermediate aggregation tensor and adding a personalized fine-tuning step in each iteration, which constrains model updates towards the local data distribution. The proposed method effectively leverages the relativity among agents while meeting personalized requirements in heterogeneous node conditions. We also provide a theoretical proof for the DSLTH, establishing it as the foundation of the proposed method. Numerical simulations confirm the validity of the DSLTH and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>MARFT: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Fine-Tuning</title>

Abstract: LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in addressing complex, agentic tasks requiring multifaceted reasoning and collaboration, from generating high-quality presentation slides to conducting sophisticated scientific research. Meanwhile, RL has been widely recognized for its effectiveness in enhancing agent intelligence, but limited research has investigated the fine-tuning of LaMAS using foundational RL techniques. Moreover, the direct application of MARL methodologies to LaMAS introduces significant challenges, stemming from the unique characteristics and mechanisms inherent to LaMAS. To address these challenges, this article presents a comprehensive study of LLM-based MARL and proposes a novel paradigm termed Multi-Agent Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (MARFT). We introduce a universal algorithmic framework tailored for LaMAS, outlining the conceptual foundations, key distinctions, and practical implementation strategies. We begin by reviewing the evolution from RL to Reinforcement Fine-Tuning, setting the stage for a parallel analysis in the multi-agent domain. In the context of LaMAS, we elucidate critical differences between MARL and MARFT. These differences motivate a transition toward a novel, LaMAS-oriented formulation of RFT. Central to this work is the presentation of a robust and scalable MARFT framework. We detail the core algorithm and provide a complete, open-source implementation to facilitate adoption and further research. The latter sections of the paper explore real-world application perspectives and opening challenges in MARFT. By bridging theoretical underpinnings with practical methodologies, this work aims to serve as a roadmap for researchers seeking to advance MARFT toward resilient and adaptive solutions in agentic systems. Our implementation of the proposed framework is publicly available at: https://github.com/jwliao-ai/MARFT.</description>

      <title>Honeybee: Byzantine Tolerant Decentralized Peer Sampling with Verifiable Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16201v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Popular blockchains today have hundreds of thousands of nodes and need to be able to support sophisticated scaling solutions$\unicode{x2013}$such as sharding, data availability sampling, and layer-2 methods. Designing secure and efficient peer-to-peer (p2p) networking protocols at these scales to support the tight demands of the upper layer crypto-economic primitives is a highly non-trivial endeavor. We identify decentralized, uniform random sampling of nodes as a fundamental capability necessary for building robust p2p networks in emerging blockchain networks. Sampling algorithms used in practice today (primarily for address discovery) rely on either distributed hash tables (e.g., Kademlia) or sharing addresses with neighbors (e.g., GossipSub), and are not secure in a Sybil setting. We present Honeybee, a decentralized algorithm for sampling nodes that uses verifiable random walks and table consistency checks. Honeybee is secure against attacks even in the presence of an overwhelming number of Byzantine nodes (e.g., $\geq50\%$ of the network). We evaluate Honeybee through experiments and show that the quality of sampling achieved by Honeybee is significantly better compared to the state-of-the-art. Our proposed algorithm has implications for network design in both full nodes and light nodes.</description>
