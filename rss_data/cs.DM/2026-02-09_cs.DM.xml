      <title>Fast Makespan Minimization via Short ILPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Short integer linear programs are programs with a relatively small number of constraints. We show how recent improvements on the running-times of solvers for such programs can be used to obtain fast pseudo-polynomial time algorithms for makespan minimization on a fixed number of parallel machines, and other related variants. The running times of our algorithms are all of the form $\widetilde{O}(p^{O(1)}_{\max}+n)$ or $\widetilde{O}(p^{O(1)}_{\max} \cdot n)$, where $p_{\max}$ is the maximum processing time in the input. These improve upon the time complexity of previously known algorithms for moderate values of $p_{\max}$.</description>

      <title>Quickly excluding an annotated graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide proofs certifying that the structure theorem for vertex sets of bounded bidimensionality holds with polynomial bounds. The bidimensionality of vertex sets is a common generalisation of both treewidth and the face-cover-number of vertex sets in planar graphs. As such, it plays a crucial role in extensions of Courcelle's Theorem to $H$-minor-free graphs. Recently, bidimensionality and similar parameters have emerged as key for extensions of known parameterized algorithms for problems defined on a terminal set $R$. A prominent example for such a problem is Steiner Tree, which admits efficient algorithms on planar graphs whenever $R$ can be covered with few faces.
  Key to the algorithmic applications of bidimensionality is a structure theorem that explains how a graph $G$ can be decomposed into pieces where the behaviour of $R$ is highly controlled. One may see this structure theorem as a rooted analogue of Robertson and Seymour's celebrated Grid Theorem. Combining recent advances in obtaining polynomial bounds in the Graph Minors framework with new techniques for handling annotated vertex sets, we show that all parameters in the structure theorem above admit polynomial bounds. As an application, we also provide a sketch showing how our techniques imply polynomial bounds for the structure theorem for graphs excluding an apex minor.</description>

      <title>Almost All Vectorial Functions Have No Extended-Affine Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that asymptotically almost all vectorial functions over finite fields have trivial extended-affine stabilizers. As a consequence, the number of EA-equivalence classes is asymptotically equal to the naive estimate, namely the total number of functions divided by the size of the EA-group, with vanishing relative error. Furthermore, we derive upper bounds on collision probabilities for both extended-affine and CCZ equivalences. For EA-equivalence, we leverage the trivial-stabilizer result to establish a matching lower bound, yielding a tight asymptotic formula that shows two independently sampled functions are EA-equivalent with super-exponentially small probability. The results validate random sampling strategies for cryptographic primitive design and show that functions with nontrivial EA-symmetries form an exponentially rare subset.</description>

      <title>Induced Cycles of Many Lengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph and let $\mathrm{cl}(G)$ be the number of distinct induced cycle lengths in $G$. We show that for $c,t\in \mathbb N$, every graph $G$ that does not contain an induced subgraph isomorphic to $K_{t+1}$ or $K_{t,t}$ and satisfies $\mathrm{cl}(G) \le c$ has bounded treewidth. As a consequence, we obtain a polynomial-time algorithm for deciding whether a graph $G$ contains induced cycles of at least three distinct lengths.</description>

      <title>Metric Dimensions of March Madness Brackets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Say you and some friends decide to make brackets for March Madness and are told how each of your brackets scored. The question we ask is: when can you determine how the actual tournament went given your scores? We determine the exact minimum number of brackets needed to do this for any March Madness-style tournament regardless of the scoring system used, and more generally we prove effective bounds for the problem for arbitrary single-elimination tournaments.</description>

      <title>Ordinals and recursively defined functions on the reals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17210v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine sufficient conditions under which certain recursively defined functions are well defined for all real inputs. Given a function $f:\mathbb R\to\mathbb R$, call a decreasing sequence $x_1&gt;x_2&gt;x_3&gt;\cdots$ "$f$-bad" if $f(x_1)&gt;f(x_2)&gt;f(x_3)&gt;\cdots$, and call the function $f$ "ordinal decreasing" if there exist no infinite $f$-bad sequences. We prove the following result: Given ordinal decreasing functions $f,g_1,\ldots,g_k,s$ that are everywhere larger than $0$, define the recursive algorithm "$M(x)$: if $x&lt;0$ return $f(x)$, else return $g_1(-M(x-g_2(-M(x-\cdots-g_k(-M(x-s(x)))\cdots))))$". Then $M(x)$ halts and is ordinal decreasing for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$. The recursive algorithms $M$ and $M_n$ previously studied in the context of fusible numbers by Ericskon et al. (2022) and Bufetov et al. (2024), respectively, are special cases of this scheme.
  Moreover, given an ordinal decreasing function $f$, denote by $o(f)$ the ordinal height of the root of the tree of $f$-bad sequences. Then we prove that, for $k\ge 2$, the function $M(x)$ defined by the above algorithm satisfies $o(M)\le\varphi_{k-1}(\gamma+o(s)+1)$, where $\gamma$ is the smallest ordinal such that $\max\{o(s),o(f),o(g_1), \ldots, o(g_k)\} &lt;\varphi_{k-1}(\gamma)$.</description>

      <title>Projection-width as a structural parameter for discrete separable optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While several classes of integer linear optimization problems are known to be solvable in polynomial time, far fewer tractability results exist for integer nonlinear optimization. In this work, we narrow this gap by identifying a broad class of discrete nonlinear optimization problems that admit polynomial-time algorithms. Central to our approach is the notion of projection-width, a structural parameter for systems of separable constraints, defined via branch decompositions of variables and constraints. We show that several fundamental discrete optimization and counting problems can be solved in polynomial time when the projection-width is polynomially bounded, including optimization, counting, top-k, and weighted constraint violation problems. Our results subsume and generalize some of the strongest known tractability results across multiple research areas: integer linear optimization, binary polynomial optimization, and Boolean satisfiability. Although these results originated independently within different communities and for seemingly distinct problem classes, our framework unifies and significantly generalizes them under a single structural perspective.</description>
