      <title>Kelvin wave and soliton propagation in classical viscous vortex filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vortex filaments are highly rotating localized structures of fluids that admits several types of excitation. Here, we study them by using numerical simulations of the three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. We first address the propagation of Kelvin waves, helicoidal excitations propagating along the filament, and measure their dispersion relation which turns out to be in good agreement with the original Lord Kelvin predictions. Then, inspired by the connection between vortex line dynamics and an integrable system, we show numerically the existence of solitons propagating along vortex filaments and study the collision of two of such structures. Finally, we show numerically the experimental feasibility of studying vortex solitons in the lab, by proposing an experiment for their generation.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Signatures of Pinch-Off Cavities During Water-Entry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study experimentally, numerically, and theoretically investigates the cavity/bubble dynamics and radiated acoustics during the water entry of a centimeter-scale cylindrical projectile with a conical nose. Experiments were conducted in a laboratory tank, employing synchronized high-speed imaging and hydrophone measurements to characterize the cavity closure modes and their resultant acoustic signatures across a range of Froude numbers. The acoustic signal features a weak radiated signal upon impact, followed by significant pressure oscillations spanning more than 20 cycles in the flow field after cavity elongation and pinch-off. A numerical model based on the Finite Volume Method (FVM) successfully captures these physical processes. Subsequently, a semi-theoretical model that incorporates the projectile's boundary effect is developed from potential flow theory. The model not only yields a dominant cavity oscillation frequency that agrees well with experimental data, but also reveals that the boundary effect leads to a cavity oscillation frequency markedly higher than the Minnaert frequency of an equivalent-volume ellipsoidal bubble containing an internal rigid core. The dominant cavity frequency falls nearly linearly with Fr, governed by nose geometry and projectile inertia. This study clarifies the underlying physics connecting cavity dynamics during water entry to underwater acoustic radiation.</description>

      <title>On the spatial structure and intermittency of soot in a lab-scale gas turbine combustor: Insights from large-eddy simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a numerical investigation of soot formation in the Cambridge lab-scale gas turbine combustor. Large-eddy simulations (LES) of a swirl-stabilized ethylene flame are performed using the flamelet generated manifold method coupled with a discrete sectional model to account for soot formation, growth, and oxidation. The study aims to elucidate the mechanism governing the spatial structure and intermittency of soot, supported by comparisons with experimental data. The predicted soot distribution agrees well with measurements, with peak concentrations near the bluff body. Flow recirculation is identified as the key mechanism driving soot accumulation in fuel-rich regions, where surface reactions dominate soot mass growth. Soot intermittency arises from fluctuations in the flow field driven by interactions between the flame front and the recirculation vortex. Two soot modeling approaches are evaluated, differing in their treatment of soot model quantities: the first approach employs on-the-fly computation of source terms (FGM-C), while the second uses fully pre-tabulated source terms (FGM-T). Their predictive performance and computational cost are compared in the context of unsteady, sooting flames in swirl-stabilized combustors.</description>

      <title>From synthetic turbulence to true solutions: A deep diffusion model for discovering periodic orbits in the Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence has shown remarkable success in synthesizing data that mimic complex real-world systems, but its potential role in the discovery of mathematically meaningful structures in physical models remains underexplored. In this work, we demonstrate how a generative diffusion model can be used to uncover previously unknown solutions of a nonlinear partial differential equation: the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations in a turbulent regime. Trained on data from a direct numerical simulation of turbulence, the model learns to generate time series that resemble physically plausible trajectories. By carefully modifying the temporal structure of the model and enforcing the symmetries of the governing equations, we produce synthetic trajectories that are periodic in time, despite the fact that the training data did not contain periodic trajectories. These synthetic trajectories are then refined into true solutions using an iterative solver, yielding 111 new periodic orbits (POs) with very short periods. Our results reveal a previously unobserved richness in the PO structure of this system and suggest a broader role for generative AI: not as replacements for simulation and existing solvers, but as a complementary tool for navigating the complex solution spaces of nonlinear dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Maximum Likelihood Particle Tracking in Turbulent Flows via Sparse Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lagrangian particle tracking is essential for characterizing turbulent flows, but inferring particle acceleration from inherently noisy position data remains a significant challenge. Fluid particles in turbulence experience extreme, intermittent accelerations, resulting in heavy-tailed probability density functions (PDFs) that deviate strongly from Gaussian predictions. Existing filtering techniques, such as Gaussian kernels and penalized B-splines, implicitly assume Gaussian-distributed jerk, thereby penalizing sparse, high-magnitude acceleration changes and artificially suppressing the intermittent tails. In this work, we develop a novel maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) framework that explicitly accounts for this non-Gaussian intermittency. By formulating a modified Gaussian process to model the random incremental forcing, we introduce a sparse optimization scheme utilizing a convex 1-norm relaxation. To overcome the numerical stiffness associated with high-order difference operators, the problem is efficiently solved using an iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) algorithm. The proposed filter is evaluated against direct numerical simulation (DNS) data of homogeneous, isotropic turbulence (Re approx. 310). Results demonstrate that the IRLS approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art discrete MLE, continuous MLE, and B-spline methods, yielding systematic reductions in root-mean-squared error (RMSE) across position, velocity, and acceleration. Most importantly, the proposed framework succeeds in better recovering the heavy-tailed statistical structure of both acceleration and acceleration differences (jerk) across temporal scales, preserving the physical intermittency characteristic of high-Reynoldsnumber turbulent flows that baseline methods severely attenuate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.23134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the solution to the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations arising from a sum of Dirac masses in a particular co-rotating configuration. This configuration consists of a polygonal vortex crystal with or without a central vortex. By exploiting the symmetries and stability properties of the system, we describe and control the solution up to sub-diffusive time scales, prior to the expected onset of vortex merging.</description>

      <title>Rheological properties and shear-induced structures of ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently discovered ferroelectric nematic (NF) liquid crystals are fluids with a polar orientational order. The electric polarization vector can be aligned by an electric field and by surface anchoring. Here, we explore how the polarization field and effective viscosity of the NF materials are affected by shear flows. We explore three NF materials, abbreviated RM734, DIO, and a room-temperature FNLC919, all of which exhibit a paraelectric nematic (N) and the NF phase. All materials show an increase of the viscosity upon cooling, with an Arrhenius behavior. In DIO and FNLC919, the antiferroelectric SmZA phase shows a strong dependence of the effective viscosity on the shear rate: this viscosity is lower than the viscosity of the N and NF phases at high shear rates but is much higher when the shear rate is low. The behavior is associated with the layered structure of the SmZA phase. All mesophases exhibit shear-thinning behavior at low shear rates and a nearly Newtonian behavior at higher shear rates. In terms of alignment, we observe three regimes in the N and NF phases: flow-alignment at low shear rates, log-rolling regime with the director and polarization along the vorticity axis at high shear rates, and polydomain structures at intermediate rates. In the flow-aligning regime, the NF polarization does not tilt away from the shear direction, which is in sharp contrast to the flow-induced tilt of the N director. The effect is attributed to the avoidance of splay deformations and associated space charge in the flowing NF. The temperature and shear rate dependencies of the viscosity and the uncovered shear-induced structural effects of NF advance our understanding of these materials and potentially facilitate their applications.</description>

      <title>Efficient Real-Time Adaptation of ROMs for Unsteady Flows Using Data Assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an efficient retraining strategy for a parameterized Reduced Order Model (ROM) that attains accuracy comparable to full retraining while requiring only a fraction of the computational time and relying solely on sparse observations of the full system. The architecture employs an encode-process-decode structure: a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to perform dimensionality reduction, and a transformer network to evolve the latent states and model the dynamics. The ROM is parameterized by an external control variable, the Reynolds number in the Navier-Stokes setting, with the transformer exploiting attention mechanisms to capture both temporal dependencies and parameter effects. The probabilistic VAE enables stochastic sampling of trajectory ensembles, providing predictive means and uncertainty quantification through the first two moments. After initial training on a limited set of dynamical regimes, the model is adapted to out-of-sample parameter regions using only sparse data. Its probabilistic formulation naturally supports ensemble generation, which we employ within an ensemble Kalman filtering framework to assimilate data and reconstruct full-state trajectories from minimal observations. We further show that, for the dynamical system considered, the dominant source of error in out-of-sample forecasts stems from distortions of the latent manifold rather than changes in the latent dynamics. Consequently, retraining can be limited to the autoencoder, allowing for a lightweight, computationally efficient, real-time adaptation procedure with very sparse fine-tuning data.</description>

      <title>Flow birefringence measurement in a radial Hele-Shaw cell considering three-dimensional effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10261v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flow birefringence measurement is an emerging technique for visualizing stress fields in fluid flows. This study investigates flow birefringence in the steady radial Hele-Shaw flow. In the radial Hele-Shaw flow, stress is dominant along the gap direction, challenging the applicability of the conventional stress-optic law (SOL) with measurement from the gap direction. To overcome this problem, we used two types of flow birefringence measurement using radial Hele-Shaw cell and rheometer. We conduct flow birefringence measurements at various flow rates and compare the results with theoretical predictions. The observed phase retardation cannot be quantitatively explained using the conventional SOL, but is successfully described using the second-order SOL, which accounts for stress along the optical direction. The stress-optic coefficient in the second-order SOL was obtained by rheo-optical measurements. This study demonstrates that the combination of the second-order SOL and rheo-optical measurements is essential for an accurate interpretation of flow birefringence in Hele-Shaw flow, providing a noninvasive approach for stress field analysis in high-aspect-ratio geometries.</description>

      <title>Harnessing natural and mechanical airflows for surface-based atmospheric pollutant removal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11803v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Removal strategies for atmospheric pollutants are increasingly being considered to mitigate global warming and improve public health. However, the global potential of surface-based removal techniques has not yet been quantified based on limits of pollutant transport and removal rates. We evaluate the atmospheric pollutant transport to surfaces and assess the potential of surface-based removal technologies for global-scale deployment across a variety of configurations, including air interaction with the built environment, mechanical ventilation and convection systems, and over the global transportation fleet Cities provide the highest removal potential, with median annual estimates of 30 GtCO$_2$, 0.06 GtCH$_4$, 0.007 GtNO$_\text{x}$ and 0.0001 GtPM$_{2.5}$ transported to their total surface area. Cities, solar farms, HVAC systems and filters have the potential to exceed 1 GtCO$_2$/yr (1 GtCO$_2$e/yr for CH$_4$, 20-year GWP) of removal when literature-based CO$_2$-sorbent (CH$_4$-catalyst) efficiencies are applied across their total surface area. These values represent theoretical upper bounds and are intended for comparison across applications rather than application-specific deployment. HVAC filters have the potential to achieve materials costs as low as \$600 per tCO$_2$ removed (\$2000 per tCO$_2$e) when CO$_2$-sorption (CH$_4$-catalyst) technologies are incorporated into their fibre sheets and maintained through routine filter replacement, compared with \$3000 per tCO$_2$ (\$10000 per tCO$_2$e) for city surfaces, based on the literature values for these technologies' materials costs. These findings demonstrate that integrating surface-based pollutant removal technologies into infrastructure may offer a pathway to advance climate and health objectives, though further studies are needed to assess their feasibility in application, and application-implementation rates and cost.</description>

      <title>Modelling laminar flow in V-shaped filters integrated with catalyst technologies for atmospheric pollutant removal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atmospheric pollution from particulate matter, volatile organic compounds and greenhouse gases is a critical environmental and public health issue, leading to respiratory diseases and climate change. A potential mitigation strategy involves utilising ventilation systems, which process large volumes of indoor and outdoor air and remove particulate pollutants through filtration. However, the integration of catalytic technologies with filters in ventilation systems remains underexplored, despite their potential to simultaneously remove particulate matter and gases, as seen in flue gas treatment and automotive exhaust systems. In this study, we develop a predictive, long-wave model for V-shaped filters, with and without separators. The model, validated against experimental and numerical data, provides a framework for enhancing flow rates by increasing fibre diameter and porosity while reducing aspect ratio and filter thickness. These changes lead to increased permeability, which lowers energy requirements. However, they also reduce the pollutant removal efficiency, highlighting the trade-off between flow, filtration performance and operational costs. Leveraging the long-wave model alongside experimental results, we estimate the maximum potential removal rate ($4.5\times10^{-3}$ GtPM$_{2.5}$, $6.4\times10^{-3}$ GtNO$_{\text{x}}$, $2.0\times10^{-2}$ GtCH$_{4}$ per year; $1.6\times10^{0}$ GtCO$_{2}$e per year, 20-year GWP for CH$_4$) and minimum cost (\$$3.4\times10^{3}$ per tNO$_{\text{x}}$, \$$1.1\times10^{3}$ per tCH$_{4}$; \$$1.3\times10^{1}$ per tCO$_{2}$e) if a billion V-shaped filters integrated with catalytic enhancements were deployed in operation. These findings highlight the feasibility of catalytic filters as a scalable, high-efficiency solution for improving air quality and mitigating atmospheric pollution.</description>

      <title>Physics-based modelling of turbulence in wind-turbine wakes turbulence in neutral atmospheric boundary layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: So-called engineering or analytical wind farm flow solvers typically build upon two submodels: one for the velocity deficit and one for the wake-added turbulence intensity. While velocity deficit modelling has received considerable attention, wake-added turbulence models are less prevalent in comparison. Yet, accurate estimates of local turbulence intensity are essential for predicting flow interactions and energy yield, as turbine wakes are both sensitive to and sources of turbulence. Existing wake-added turbulence models are typically empirical or assume axial symmetry despite the inherently three-dimensional nature of turbulent wake fields. In this work, we present a physics-based model for wake-added turbulence intensity. Our approach is based on the analysis of the turbulent kinetic energy and the streamwise Reynolds stress budget, incorporating classical RANS modelling assumptions and far-wake approximations. The resulting model maintains a simple and practical form, demonstrating strong agreement with LES and wind tunnel measurements. Our model provides a more physically consistent and predictive tool for wind farm flow modelling and performance estimation.</description>

      <title>Laminar boundary layers over small-scale textured surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11471v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a model for steady, laminar boundary layers over small-scale textured surfaces. Although the texture is small relative to the boundary-layer thickness, it modifies the flow via a slip length. We use matched asymptotic expansions to simplify the problem, dividing the flow into outer, boundary-layer and inner regions. The far-field behaviour of the inner problem yields a slip boundary condition for the boundary layer. We derive an asymptotic solution valid when the slip length is small. For arbitrary slip lengths, we develop a numerical method combining Chebyshev collocation and finite differences. We apply this framework to canonical small-scale textured surfaces, including superhydrophobic surfaces and riblets, and utilise existing analytical slip formulae. However, the framework is expected to extend to liquid-infused, porous, compliant or deformable surfaces with a variety of regular or random textures. We demonstrate how slip modifies the boundary layer's velocity field, wall shear stress and displacement thickness across a range of surface configurations, and examine the linear stability of the resulting slip-modified boundary layers. Our approach enables computationally inexpensive modelling of a wide range of small-scale textured surfaces within laminar boundary-layer flows, providing predictive capability for drag, boundary-layer growth and transition across applications ranging from microfluidics to turbo-machinery and marine transport.</description>

Abstract: Resolving unsteady transport phenomena in geometrically complex domains is traditionally constrained by polynomial scaling of computational cost with spatial resolution. While methods based on tensor-network data representations or matrix-product states (MPS) data encodings have emerged as a technique to systematically reduce degrees of freedom, existing formulations do not extend to complex geometries and complex flow physics. Both capabilities are offered by lattice Boltzmann methods, for which we develop a generalized MPS formulation. This development marks a paradigm shift from classical methods that rely on explicit grid refinement for data reduction. Instead, our approach exploits non-local correlations in the MPS representation to systemically compress the global fluid state directly without modifying the underlying grid. We benchmark the proposed solver against classical LBM using three-dimensional flows through structured media and vascular geometries. The results confirm that the MPS formulation reproduces the reference solution with high fidelity while achieving compression ratios exceeding two orders of magnitude, positioning tensor networks or MPS encodings as a scalable paradigm for continuum mechanics on high-performance GPU hardware.</description>

Abstract: We are concerned with the low regularity of self-similar solutions of two-dimensional Riemann problems for the isentropic Euler system. We establish a general framework for the analysis of the local regularity of such solutions for a class of two-dimensional Riemann problems for the isentropic Euler system, which includes the regular shock reflection problem, the Prandtl reflection problem, the Lighthill diffraction problem, and the four-shock Riemann problem. We prove that the velocity is not in $H^1$ in the subsonic domain for the self-similar solutions of these problems in general. This indicates that the self-similar solutions of the Riemann problems with shocks for the isentropic Euler system are of much more complicated structure than those for the Euler system for potential flow; in particular, the velocity is not necessarily continuous in the subsonic domain. The proof is based on a regularization of the isentropic Euler system to derive the transport equation for the vorticity, a renormalization argument extended to the case of domains with boundary, and DiPerna-Lions-type commutator estimates.</description>
