      <title>The potential of Brillouin Spectroscopy for investigating the mechanical properties of hydrogels during dehydration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogels are attractive and versatile gel-based structures consisting of three-dimensional networks of hydrophilic polymers with unique properties that can retain a large amount of water and be tailor-designed according to specific requirements, and thus, suitable for numerous commercial areas (i.e., medicine, agriculture, electronics, cosmetics, etc.). However, since these materials can be very soft and flexible, mechanical characterization is challenging. This study explores the mechanical properties of a cellulose-based hydrogel using the optical, non-contact technique Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy (BLS). Two differently dried hydrogel samples were investigated and pre-characterized for their morphology by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and their mechanical performance by tensile testing. Then, BLS spectra were recorded to characterize the material's stiffness, indicating that the structural arrangement of the material due to the drying procedure (the density) is the main factor limiting the material's strength. By further analyzing the effect of moisture and the changes during drying, we characterize the mechanical behavior of organic hydrogel films and sponges and their dehydration evolution to understand the liquid-solid transition.</description>

      <title>Delayed recovery in a dense suspension of core-shell attractive particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft particulate glasses are dense suspensions of jammed particles that flow like liquids under external shear and recover their solid-like properties almost instantly upon flow cessation. Here, we consider a dense suspension of core-shell attractive particles whose polymer brush allows for a delayed recovery that we monitor by time-resolved mechanical spectroscopy. Viscoelastic spectra recorded upon flow cessation show a striking power-law behavior and can be rescaled onto a master curve that hints at a time-connectivity superposition principle. Additionally, the non-linear response of this soft glass, measured at various aging times, shows a ductile-to-brittle transition, which suggests that the interactions between the particles display a progressive repulsive-to-attractive transition. These results depict an original scenario for the delayed recovery involving a time-dependent interaction potential in which attractive hydrophobic forces are only activated when neighboring particles deform their polymer shell and come in close contact.</description>

      <title>Density Fluctuations, Solvation Thermodynamics and Coexistence Curves in Grand Canonical Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid transport across nanometric channels induced by electric, pressure and concentration gradients is ubiquitous in biological systems and fosters various applications. In this context, computer simulation setups with well-defined open-boundary equilibrium starting states are essential in understanding and assisting experimental studies. However, open-boundary computational methods are scarce and typically do not satisfy all the equilibrium conditions imposed by reality. Namely, in the absence of external gradients, 1) the system of interest (SoI) must be at thermodynamic and chemical equilibrium with an infinite reservoir of particles, 2) the fluctuations of the SoI in equilibrium should sample the grand canonical ensemble, 3) the local solvation thermodynamics, which is extremely sensitive to finite-size effects due to solvent depletion, should be correctly described. This point is particularly relevant for out-of-equilibrium systems. Finally, 4) the method should be robust enough to deal with phase transitions and coexistence conditions in the SoI. In this study, we demonstrate with prototypical liquid systems embedded into a reservoir of ideal gas particles that the adaptive resolution simulation (AdResS) method, coupled with particle insertion/deletion steps, satisfies all these requirements. Therefore, this AdResS setup is suitable for performing equilibrium and non-equilibrium simulations of open systems.</description>

      <title>Origin of granular axial segregation bands in a rotating tumbler: An interface-mixing driven Rayleigh-Taylor instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of large and small particle axial bands in long rotating tumblers is a long-standing question. Using DEM simulations, we show that this axial segregation is due to a Rayleigh-Taylor instability which is characterized by the fact that the density of a granular medium increases with mixing and decreases with segregation. For initially mixed particles, segregation and collisional diffusion in the flowing layer balance and lead to a three-layer system, with a layer of large particles over a layer of small particles, and, interposed between these layers, a layer of more densely packed mixed particles. The higher density mixed particle layer over the lower density small particle layer induces a Rayleigh-Taylor instability, evident as waviness in the interface between the layers. The waviness destabilizes into ascending plumes of small particles and descending plumes of mixed particles with large particles enriched near the surface, which become evident as small and large particle bands visible at the free surface. Rolls driven by segregation at the tilted interface between plumes maintain the pattern of frozen plumes. Published by the American Physical Society 2024</description>

      <title>Interplay of ethaline and water dynamics in a hydrated eutectic solvent: Deuteron and oxygen magnetic resonance studies of aqueous ethaline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of hydration on the reorientational dynamics of the deep eutectic solvent (DES) ethaline, a 2:1 molar mixture of ethylene glycol and choline chloride was studied. Its overall response was explored by means of shear mechanical rheology. To achieve component-selective insights into the dynamics of this material, isotope-edited deuteron and oxygen spin-lattice and spin-spin relaxometry as well as stimulated-echo spectroscopy were applied and yielded motional correlation times from above room temperature down to the highly vis-cous regime. For all temperatures the cholinium anion was found to reorient two times faster than ethylene glycol, while the water and the ethylene glycol molecules display very similar mobilities. While hydration enhances the component dynamics with respect to that of dry ethaline, the present findings reveal that it does not detectably increase the heterogeneity of the solvent. Merely, the timescale similarity that is found for the hydrogen bond donor and the water molecules over a particularly wide temperature range impressively attests to the stability of the native solvent structure in the "water-in-DES" regime.</description>

      <title>Spatially Selective Acoustic Pressure Reporting Using Antibubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrasound offers promising applications in biology and chemistry, but quantifying local ultrasound conditions remains challenging due to the lack of non-invasive measurement tools. We introduce antibubbles as novel optical reporters of local ultrasound pressure. These liquid-core, air-shell structures encapsulate fluorescent payloads, releasing them upon exposure to low-intensity ultrasound. We demonstrate their versatility by fabricating antibubbles with hydrophilic and hydrophobic payloads, revealing payload-dependent encapsulation efficiency and release dynamics. Using acoustic holograms, we showcase precise spatial control of payload release, enabling visualization of complex ultrasound fields. High-speed fluorescence imaging reveals a gentle, single-shot release mechanism occurring within 20-50 ultrasound cycles. It is thus possible to determine via an optical fluorescence marker what the applied ultrasound pressure was. This work thereby introduces a non-invasive method for mapping ultrasound fields in complex environments, potentially accelerating research in ultrasound-based therapies and processes. The long-term stability and versatility of these antibubble reporters suggest broad applicability in studying and optimizing ultrasound effects across various biological and chemical systems.</description>

      <title>Effective viscosity of a two dimensional passive suspension in a liquid crystal solvent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suspension of particles in a fluid solvent are ubiquitous in nature, for example, water mixed with sugar or bacteria self-propelling through mucus. Particles create local flow perturbations that can modify drastically the effective (homogenized) bulk properties of the fluid. Understanding the link between the properties of particles and the fluid solvent, and the effective properties of the medium is a classical problem in fluid mechanics. Here we study a special case of a two dimensional model of a suspension of undeformable particles in a liquid crystal solvent. In the dilute regime, we calculate asymptotic solutions of the perturbations of the velocity and director fields and derive an explicit formula for an effective shear viscosity of the liquid crystal medium. Such effective shear viscosity increases linearly with the area fraction of particles, similar to Einstein formula but with a different prefactor. We provide explicit asymptotic formulas for the dependence of this prefactor on the material parameters of the solvent. Finally, we identify a case of decreasing the effective viscosity by increasing the magnitude of the shear-flow alignment coefficient of the liquid crystal solvent.</description>

      <title>Stronger when wet: Water-resistant chitinous objects via zero-waste coordination with metal ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plastics have become integral to our society due to their durability and water stability, which is achieved through strong intermolecular interactions. However, these properties also make them persistent disruptors of ecological cycles, in contrast with biological structures, which work with their environments to achieve both excellent mechanical properties and ecological integration. This study takes inspiration from the arthropod cuticle to adapt Earth's second most abundant organic molecule for use in water. The process involves the vitrification of chitosan with small traces of nickel to create a dynamic network of intermolecular bonds using environmental water, resulting in a material that increases its strength to values well above commodity plastics when wet. The approach preserves the molecule's original chemistry and therefore its seamless integration into Earth's metabolism while avoiding the use of the strong organic solvents typically associated with biomolecules. The method demonstrates the potential for a paradigm shift in manufacturing, with zero waste production of both consumables and large objects that could meet the global demand for plastic.</description>

      <title>Flagellar damage and recovery in soil bacteria exposed to shear in long microchannels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The outermost structure of the bacterial flagellar motor is a long helicoidal filament, whose protein building blocks are produced and injected from the base, progressively elongating the filament and regenerating it in case it breaks. Here, we study the evolution of flagellar filaments in the soil bacterium $\textit{Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens}$ after being exposed to shear flows, for shear rates between 1 s$^{-1}$ and $10^5$ s$^{-1}$, and for durations between tens of milliseconds and minutes. We demonstrate that the average swimming speed and fraction of swimming cells decrease after exposition to shear, but both parameters can recover, at least partially, with time. These observations support the hypothesis that flagellar filaments are cut by shear flows, but that reversibly damaged flagellar motors can be restored thanks to filament regeneration. By fitting our observations with phenomenological expressions, we obtain the individual growth rates of the two different flagellar filaments that $\textit{B. diazoefficiens}$ possesses, showing that the lateral filaments have a recovery time of about 40 min while the subpolar one requires more than 4.5 h to regrow. Our work demonstrates that a simple monitoring of bacterial motility after exposition to shear can be used to characterise the process of flagellar filament growth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A material showing a sequence of three ferroelectric liquid crystalline phases below the paraelectric nematic phase has been synthesized and studied. The polar order of molecules appearing due to the dipole-dipole interactions in the NF phase is preserved also in the smectic phases: orthogonal SmAF and tilted SmCF. The ferroelectric ground state of both smectic phases is confirmed by their second harmonic generation activity and polarization switching. In the SmCF phase the polarization becomes oriented to the electric field by decreasing the tilt angle to zero. Although both smectic phases are ferroelectric in nature, their dielectric response is found to be very different.</description>

      <title>Achieving designed texture and flows in bulk active nematics using optimal control theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Being intrinsically nonequilibrium, active materials can potentially perform functions that would be thermodynamically forbidden in passive materials. However, active systems have diverse local attractors that correspond to distinct dynamical states, many of which exhibit chaotic turbulent-like dynamics and thus cannot perform work or useful functions. Designing such a system to choose a specific dynamical state is a formidable challenge. Motivated by recent advances enabling opto-genetic control of experimental active materials, we describe an optimal control theory framework that identifies a spatiotemporal sequence of light-generated activity that drives an active nematic system toward a prescribed dynamical steady-state. Active nematics are unstable to spontaneous defect proliferation and chaotic streaming dynamics in the absence of control. We demonstrate that optimal control theory can compute activity fields that redirect the dynamics into a variety of alternative dynamical programs and functions. This includes dynamically reconfiguring between states, and selecting and stabilizing emergent behaviors that do not correspond to attractors, and are hence unstable in the uncontrolled system. Our results provide a roadmap to leverage optical control methods to rationally design structure, dynamics, and function in a wide variety of active materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dry friction has been proposed as a rectifying mechanism allowing mass transport over a vibrating surface, even when vibrations are horizontal and unbiased. It has been suggested that the drift velocity will always saturate when the energy of the input oscillation increases, leading to a vanishing efficiency that would hinder the applicability of this phenomenon. Contrary to this conjecture, in this work we experimentally demonstrate that, by carefully controlling the forcing oscillations, this system can maintain a finite transport efficiency for any input energy. A minimal friction model explains the observed dependencies of the drift velocity on the signal parameters in the case of biharmonic base oscillations, which can be extended to obtain efficiency estimates for any periodic excitation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of mechanical interactions on the growth and self-organization of rod-shaped bacteria confined within square and circular geometries. Our results reveal that mechanical interactions are crucial in constraining cell growth and shaping the degree of ordering within bacterial colonies. Colonies with larger aspect ratios exhibit higher levels of nematic ordering, while the geometry of confinements significantly impacts colony organization. Compression influences force magnitudes within colonies, with larger division lengths encountering greater forces. These findings enhance our understanding of bacterial self-organization in confined environments, with implications for microbial ecology and biotechnology.</description>

      <title>Interfacial fatigue fracture of pressure sensitive adhesives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pressure sensitive adhesives (PSAs) are viscoelastic polymers that can form fast and robust adhesion with various adherends under fingertip pressure. The rapidly expanding application domain of PSAs, such as healthcare, wearable electronics, and flexible displays, requires PSAs to sustain prolonged loads throughout their lifetime, calling for fundamental studies on their fatigue behaviors. However, fatigue of PSAs has remained poorly investigated. Here we study interfacial fatigue fracture of PSAs, focusing on the cyclic interfacial crack propagation due to the gradual rupture of noncovalent bonds between a PSA and an adherend. We fabricate a model PSA made of a hysteresis-free poly(butyl acrylate) bulk elastomer dip-coated with a viscoelastic poly(butyl acrylate-co-isobornyl acrylate) sticky surface, both crosslinked by poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate. We adhere the fabricated PSA to a polyester strip to form a bilayer. The bilayer is covered by another polyester film as an inextensible backing layer. Using cyclic and monotonic peeling tests, we characterize the interfacial fatigue and fracture behaviors of the bilayer. From the experimental data, we obtain the interfacial fatigue threshold (4.6 J/m2) under cyclic peeling, the slow crack threshold (33.9 J/m2) under monotonic peeling, and the adhesion toughness (~ 400 J/m2) at a finite peeling speed. We develop a modified Lake-Thomas model to describe the interfacial fatigue threshold due to noncovalent bond breaking. The theoretical prediction (2.6 J/m2) agrees well with the experimental measurement (4.6 J/m2). Finally, we discuss possible additional dissipation mechanisms involved in the larger slow crack threshold and much larger adhesion toughness. It is hoped that this study will provide new fundamental knowledge for fracture mechanics of PSAs, as well as guidance for future tough and durable PSAs.</description>

      <title>The most severe imperfection governs the buckling strength of pressurized multi-defect hemispherical shells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a probabilistic investigation on the effect of systematically removing imperfections on the buckling behavior of pressurized thin, elastic, hemispherical shells containing a distribution of defects. We employ finite element simulations, which were previously validated against experiments, to assess the maximum buckling pressure, as measured by the knockdown factor, of these multi-defect shells. Specifically, we remove fractions of either the least or the most severe imperfections to quantify their influence on the buckling onset. We consider shells with a random distribution of defects whose mean amplitude and standard deviation are systematically explored while, for simplicity, fixing the width of the defect to a characteristic value. Our primary finding is that the most severe imperfection of a multi-defect shell dictates its buckling onset. Notably, shells containing a single imperfection corresponding to the maximum amplitude (the most severe) defect of shells with a distribution of imperfections exhibit an identical knockdown factor to the latter case. Our results suggest a simplified approach to studying the buckling of more realistic multi-defect shells, once their most severe defect has been identified, using a well-characterized single-defect description, akin to the weakest-link setting in extreme-value probabilistic problems.</description>
