      <title>Charting the course of \emph{Sargassum}: Incorporating nonlinear elastic interactions and life cycles in the Maxey--Riley model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surge of pelagic \emph{Sargassum} in the Intra-America Seas, particularly the Caribbean Sea, since the early 2010s has raised significant ecological concerns. This study emphasizes the need for a mechanistic understanding of \emph{Sargassum} dynamics to elucidate the ecological impacts and uncertainties associated with blooms. By introducing a novel transport model, physical components such as ocean currents and winds are integrated with biological aspects affecting the \emph{Sargassum} life cycle, including reproduction, grounded in an enhanced Maxey--Riley theory for floating particles. Nonlinear elastic forces among the particles are included to simulate interactions within and among \emph{Sargassum} rafts. This promotes aggregation, consistent with observations, within oceanic eddies, which facilitate their transport. This cannot be achieved by the so-called leeway approach to transport, which forms the basis of current \emph{Sargassum} modeling. Using satellite-derived data, the model is validated, outperforming the leeway model. Publicly accessible codes are provided to support further research and ecosystem management efforts. This comprehensive approach is expected to improve predictive capabilities and management strategies regarding \emph{Sargassum} dynamics in affected regions, thus contributing to a deeper understanding of marine ecosystem dynamics and resilience.</description>

      <title>QESM: A Leap Towards Quantum-Enhanced ML Emulation Framework for Earth and Climate Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current climate models often struggle with accuracy because they lack sufficient resolution, a limitation caused by computational constraints. This reduces the precision of weather forecasts and long-term climate predictions. To address this issue, we explored the use of quantum computing to enhance traditional machine learning (ML) models. We replaced conventional models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP), and Encoder-Decoder frameworks with their quantum versions: Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNN), Quantum Multilayer Perceptrons (QMLP), and Quantum Encoder-Decoders (QED). These quantum models proved to be more accurate in predicting climate-related outcomes compared to their classical counterparts. Using the ClimSim dataset, a large collection of climate data created specifically for ML-based climate prediction, we trained and tested these quantum models. Individually, the quantum models performed better, but their performance was further improved when we combined them using a meta-ensemble approach, which merged the strengths of each model to achieve the highest accuracy overall. This study demonstrates that quantum machine learning can significantly improve the resolution and accuracy of climate simulations. The results offer new possibilities for better predicting climate trends and weather events, which could have important implications for both scientific understanding and policy-making in the face of global climate challenges.</description>

      <title>Dynamical-generative downscaling of climate model ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regional high-resolution climate projections are crucial for many applications, such as agriculture, hydrology, and natural hazard risk assessment. Dynamical downscaling, the state-of-the-art method to produce localized future climate information, involves running a regional climate model (RCM) driven by an Earth System Model (ESM), but it is too computationally expensive to apply to large climate projection ensembles. We propose a novel approach combining dynamical downscaling with generative artificial intelligence to reduce the cost and improve the uncertainty estimates of downscaled climate projections. In our framework, an RCM dynamically downscales ESM output to an intermediate resolution, followed by a generative diffusion model that further refines the resolution to the target scale. This approach leverages the generalizability of physics-based models and the sampling efficiency of diffusion models, enabling the downscaling of large multi-model ensembles. We evaluate our method against dynamically-downscaled climate projections from the CMIP6 ensemble. Our results demonstrate its ability to provide more accurate uncertainty bounds on future regional climate than alternatives such as dynamical downscaling of smaller ensembles, or traditional empirical statistical downscaling methods. We also show that dynamical-generative downscaling results in significantly lower errors than bias correction and spatial disaggregation (BCSD), and captures more accurately the spectra and multivariate correlations of meteorological fields. These characteristics make the dynamical-generative framework a flexible, accurate, and efficient way to downscale large ensembles of climate projections, currently out of reach for pure dynamical downscaling.</description>

      <title>A simple emulator that enables interpretation of parameter-output relationships, applied to two climate model PPEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new additive method, nicknamed sage for Simplified Additive Gaussian processes Emulator, to emulate climate model Perturbed Parameter Ensembles (PPEs). It estimates the value of a climate model output as the sum of additive terms. Each additive term is the mean of a Gaussian Process, and corresponds to the impact of a parameter or parameter group on the variable of interest. This design caters to the sparsity of PPEs which are characterized by limited ensemble members and high dimensionality of the parameter space. sage quantifies the variability explained by different parameters and parameter groups, providing additional insights on the parameter-climate model output relationship. We apply the method to two climate model PPEs and compare it to a fully connected Neural Network. The two methods have comparable performance with both PPEs, but sage provides insights on parameter and parameter group importance as well as diagnostics useful for optimizing PPE design. Insights gained are valid regardless of the emulator method used, and have not been previously addressed. Our work highlights that analyzing the PPE used to train an emulator is different from analyzing data generated from an emulator trained on the PPE, as the former provides more insights on the data structure in the PPE which could help inform the emulator design.</description>

      <title>Tackling the Accuracy-Interpretability Trade-off in a Hierarchy of Machine Learning Models for the Prediction of Extreme Heatwaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When performing predictions that use Machine Learning (ML), we are mainly interested in performance and interpretability. This generates a natural trade-off, where complex models generally have higher skills but are harder to explain and thus trust. Interpretability is particularly important in the climate community, where we aim at gaining a physical understanding of the underlying phenomena. Even more so when the prediction concerns extreme weather events with high impact on society. In this paper, we perform probabilistic forecasts of extreme heatwaves over France, using a hierarchy of increasingly complex ML models, which allows us to find the best compromise between accuracy and interpretability. More precisely, we use models that range from a global Gaussian Approximation (GA) to deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), with the intermediate steps of a simple Intrinsically Interpretable Neural Network (IINN) and a model using the Scattering Transform (ScatNet). Our findings reveal that CNNs provide higher accuracy, but their black-box nature severely limits interpretability, even when using state-of-the-art Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) tools. In contrast, ScatNet achieves similar performance to CNNs while providing greater transparency, identifying key scales and patterns in the data that drive predictions. This study underscores the potential of interpretability in ML models for climate science, demonstrating that simpler models can rival the performance of their more complex counterparts, all the while being much easier to understand. This gained interpretability is crucial for building trust in model predictions and uncovering new scientific insights, ultimately advancing our understanding and management of extreme weather events.</description>

      <title>Sea Foam contains Hemoglycin from Cosmic Dust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-falling cosmic dust has left evidence of meteoritic polymer amide in stromatolites, both fossil and modern. In search of evidence for continued present day in-fall sea foam was collected from two beaches in Rhode Island and subjected to Folch extraction to concentrate amphiphilic components in a chloroform water-methanol interphase layer. Hemoglycin polymer amide molecules previously characterized by MALDI mass spectrometry in meteorites and stromatolites were identified in sea foam either directly, or via their fragmentation patterns. Residual isotope enrichment pointed to an extra-terrestrial origin. The unique resiliency of sea foam may be due to the formation of extended hemoglycin lattices that stabilize its closed-cell structure and its lightness can potentially be explained by photolytic hydrogen production.</description>

      <title>Deep Bayesian Filter for Bayes-faithful Data Assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: State estimation for nonlinear state space models (SSMs) is a challenging task. Existing assimilation methodologies predominantly assume Gaussian posteriors on physical space, where true posteriors become inevitably non-Gaussian. We propose Deep Bayesian Filtering (DBF) for data assimilation on nonlinear SSMs. DBF constructs new latent variables $h_t$ in addition to the original physical variables $z_t$ and assimilates observations $o_t$. By (i) constraining the state transition on the new latent space to be linear and (ii) learning a Gaussian inverse observation operator $r(h_t|o_t)$, posteriors remain Gaussian. Notably, the structured design of test distributions enables an analytical formula for the recursive computation, eliminating the accumulation of Monte Carlo sampling errors across time steps. DBF trains the Gaussian inverse observation operators $r(h_t|o_t)$ and other latent SSM parameters (e.g., dynamics matrix) by maximizing the evidence lower bound. Experiments demonstrate that DBF outperforms model-based approaches and latent assimilation methods in tasks where the true posterior distribution on physical space is significantly non-Gaussian.</description>
