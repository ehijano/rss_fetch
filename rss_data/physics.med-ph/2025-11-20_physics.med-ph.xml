      <title>Clinical Validation and Prospective Deployment of an Automated Deep Learning-Based Coronary Segmentation and Cardiac Toxicity Risk Prediction System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Importance: Coronary algorithm for cardiac sub structures and prospective real-time surveillance of cardiac dose exposure. Methods: Retro and prospective study to validate AI auto-segmentation. A 3D UNet was trained on 560 thoracic CT scans from a single institution (2003-2014) and validated internally (n=70). External validation was performed in 283 patients treated at an independent institution (2005-2020). Clinical implementation comprised (1) retrospective analysis of 3,399 lung cancer patients treated in 2014-2022 and (2) prospective surveillance of 1,386 consecutive patients in 2023. Geometric accuracy, concordance of dose-volume parameters; association of AI-derived substructure metrics with outcome; temporal dose trends; and the proportion of patients exceeding prespecified risk. Results: Median (inter-quartile range) Dice/ASSD were 0.95 (0.94-0.96)/1.1 mm for the heart and 0.87 (0.82-0.90)/1.9 mm for the LAD; the median absolute difference between AI and manual LAD V15 was 1%. AI-derived LAD V15 remained independently associated with MACE (sub distribution hazard ratio [HR], 1.03%; 95% CI, 1.01-1.05) and ACM (adjusted HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.00-1.03), internally and externally. Retrospective deployment showed a 32% relative decline in median LAD V15 from 2014 to 2022 (12% to 8%) and identified high- risk doses in 1,086 of 3,399 patients (32%). Prospective surveillance flagged 264 contemporary patients (19%) for potential cardiology referral. Conclusions: A validated AI system accurately segments cardiac substructures, reproduces dose-outcome relationships, enables large-scale surveillance, and point-of-care alerts for high-risk patients. Automated cardiac dose monitoring could facilitate adoption of coronary-sparing therapy and follow-up.</description>

      <title>On the phase aberration estimation using common mid-angle correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase aberrations, despite degrading ultrasound images, also encode valuable information about the spatial distribution of the speed of sound in tissue. In pulse-echo ultrasound, we can quantify them by exploiting speckle correlations. Among existing strategies, correlations between steered acquisitions that share a common mid-angle have proven particularly effective for inferring the speed of sound. Their phases can be linearly related to the phase aberrations undergone by both the incident and reflected wavefronts. This relationship has so far been demonstrated only through geometric arguments based on point reflectors. Here, we develop a rigorous theoretical formalism that extends this relationship to the speckle regime, completing the previously established linear model and clarifying its underlying assumptions. More importantly, we build on this formalism to analyze correlation-phase fluctuations arising from aberration-induced speckle decorrelation. The analysis reveals that phase variance is governed by the relative loss of coherence, which increases approximately linearly with the square of the correlation phases. Local correlation-phase estimates therefore become increasingly uncertain as their magnitude grows. Experimental measurements in a uniform tissue-mimicking phantom show excellent agreement with the predicted variance. Beyond providing a theoretical basis for advancing speed-of-sound imaging, this formalism establishes the accuracy limit of common-mid-angle correlation phases, offering a benchmark for evaluating more advanced aberration-estimation techniques.</description>

      <title>Qualitative and quantitative hard-tissue MRI with portable Halbach scanners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To demonstrate the feasibility of performing in vivo imaging and quantitative relaxation mapping of soft and hard tissues using a low-cost, portable MRI scanner, and to establish the methodological foundations for zero echo time (ZTE) imaging in systems affected by strong field inhomogeneities. Methods: A complete framework for artifact-free ZTE imaging at low field was developed, including: (i) RF pulse pre/counteremphasis calibration to minimize ring-down and electronics switching time; (ii) an extension of a recent single-point double-shot (SPDS) protocol for simultaneous B0 and B1 mapping; and (iii) a model-based reconstruction incorporating these field maps into the encoding matrix. ZTE imaging and variable flip angle (VFA) T1 mapping were performed on phantoms and in vivo human knees and ankles, and benchmarked against standard RARE and STIR acquisitions. Results: The optimized PETRA sequence produced 3D images of knees and ankles within clinically compatible times (&lt; 15 min), revealing hard tissues such as ligaments, tendons, cartilage, and bone that are invisible in spin-echo sequences. The extended SPDS method enabled accurate field mapping, while the VFA approach provided the first in vivo T1 measurements of hard tissues at B0 &lt; 0.1 T. Conclusions: The proposed framework broadens the range of pulse sequences feasible in portable low-field MRI and demonstrates the potential of ZTE for quantitative and structural imaging of musculoskeletal tissues in affordable Halbach-based systems.</description>

      <title>Membrane stepping optimization in Modulation Based Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modulation-based imaging (MoBI) is an X-ray phase-contrast technique that uses an intensity modulator (or membrane) in the beam. Although MoBI can be performed in a single shot, multiple exposures are typically needed to improve the quality of the result. The membrane is typically moved using a regular stepping pattern for convenience; however, the impact of the membrane movement scheme on image quality has not been fully investigated yet. In this work, we explore optimized movement strategies aiming at improving MoBI performance. An experimental study tested optimization schemes based on global and local standard deviation metrics, and compared them with regular and random stepping motions. The results demonstrated superior contrast-to-noise ratio and reduced angular sensitivity in the optimized approaches compared to conventional stepping. These results were consistent across different membrane types, with honeycomb membranes showing the highest compatibility with the optimization procedure. Noise power spectrum analysis further validated the advantages of the optimized motion strategies. Overall, the results demonstrate that an optimized membrane movement can significantly improve MoBI image quality without increasing experimental complexity.</description>
