      <title>Conformalised Conditional Normalising Flows for Joint Prediction Regions in time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal Prediction offers a powerful framework for quantifying uncertainty in machine learning models, enabling the construction of prediction sets with finite-sample validity guarantees. While easily adaptable to non-probabilistic models, applying conformal prediction to probabilistic generative models, such as Normalising Flows is not straightforward. This work proposes a novel method to conformalise conditional normalising flows, specifically addressing the problem of obtaining prediction regions for multi-step time series forecasting. Our approach leverages the flexibility of normalising flows to generate potentially disjoint prediction regions, leading to improved predictive efficiency in the presence of potential multimodal predictive distributions.</description>

      <title>Fast, Precise Thompson Sampling for Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thompson sampling (TS) has optimal regret and excellent empirical performance in multi-armed bandit problems. Yet, in Bayesian optimization, TS underperforms popular acquisition functions (e.g., EI, UCB). TS samples arms according to the probability that they are optimal. A recent algorithm, P-Star Sampler (PSS), performs such a sampling via Hit-and-Run. We present an improved version, Stagger Thompson Sampler (STS). STS more precisely locates the maximizer than does TS using less computation time. We demonstrate that STS outperforms TS, PSS, and other acquisition methods in numerical experiments of optimizations of several test functions across a broad range of dimension. Additionally, since PSS was originally presented not as a standalone acquisition method but as an input to a batching algorithm called Minimal Terminal Variance (MTV), we also demon-strate that STS matches PSS performance when used as the input to MTV.</description>

      <title>Spatio-Temporal Conformal Prediction for Power Outage Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, increasingly unpredictable and severe global weather patterns have frequently caused long-lasting power outages. Building resilience, the ability to withstand, adapt to, and recover from major disruptions, has become crucial for the power industry. To enable rapid recovery, accurately predicting future outage numbers is essential. Rather than relying on simple point estimates, we analyze extensive quarter-hourly outage data and develop a graph conformal prediction method that delivers accurate prediction regions for outage numbers across the states for a time period. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method through extensive numerical experiments in several states affected by extreme weather events that led to widespread outages.</description>

      <title>Training a neural netwok for data reduction and better generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The motivation for sparse learners is to compress the inputs (features) by selecting only the ones needed for good generalization. Linear models with LASSO-type regularization achieve this by setting the weights of irrelevant features to zero, effectively identifying and ignoring them. In artificial neural networks, this selective focus can be achieved by pruning the input layer. Given a cost function enhanced with a sparsity-promoting penalty, our proposal selects a regularization term $\lambda$ (without the use of cross-validation or a validation set) that creates a local minimum in the cost function at the origin where no features are selected. This local minimum acts as a baseline, meaning that if there is no strong enough signal to justify a feature inclusion, the local minimum remains at zero with a high prescribed probability. The method is flexible, applying to complex models ranging from shallow to deep artificial neural networks and supporting various cost functions and sparsity-promoting penalties. We empirically show a remarkable phase transition in the probability of retrieving the relevant features, as well as good generalization thanks to the choice of $\lambda$, the non-convex penalty and the optimization scheme developed. This approach can be seen as a form of compressed sensing for complex models, allowing us to distill high-dimensional data into a compact, interpretable subset of meaningful features.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Unified Skew-Normal Process with Neural Bayes Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent decades, statisticians have been increasingly encountering spatial data that exhibit non-Gaussian behaviors such as asymmetry and heavy-tailedness. As a result, the assumptions of symmetry and fixed tail weight in Gaussian processes have become restrictive and may fail to capture the intrinsic properties of the data. To address the limitations of the Gaussian models, a variety of skewed models has been proposed, of which the popularity has grown rapidly. These skewed models introduce parameters that govern skewness and tail weight. Among various proposals in the literature, unified skewed distributions, such as the Unified Skew-Normal (SUN), have received considerable attention. In this work, we revisit a more concise and intepretable re-parameterization of the SUN distribution and apply the distribution to random fields by constructing a generalized unified skew-normal (GSUN) spatial process. We demonstrate { that the GSUN is a valid spatial process by showing its vanishing correlation in large distances} and provide the corresponding spatial interpolation method. In addition, we develop an inference mechanism for the GSUN process using the concept of neural Bayes estimators with deep graphical attention networks (GATs) and encoder transformer. We show the superiority of our proposed estimator over the conventional CNN-based architectures regarding stability and accuracy by means of a simulation study and application to Pb-contaminated soil data. Furthermore, we show that the GSUN process is different from the conventional Gaussian processes and Tukey g-and-h processes, through the probability integral transform (PIT).</description>

      <title>On Statistical Rates of Conditional Diffusion Transformers: Approximation, Estimation and Minimax Optimality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the approximation and estimation rates of conditional diffusion transformers (DiTs) with classifier-free guidance. We present a comprehensive analysis for ``in-context'' conditional DiTs under four common data assumptions. We show that both conditional DiTs and their latent variants lead to the minimax optimality of unconditional DiTs under identified settings. Specifically, we discretize the input domains into infinitesimal grids and then perform a term-by-term Taylor expansion on the conditional diffusion score function under H\"older smooth data assumption. This enables fine-grained use of transformers' universal approximation through a more detailed piecewise constant approximation and hence obtains tighter bounds. Additionally, we extend our analysis to the latent setting under the linear latent subspace assumption. We not only show that latent conditional DiTs achieve lower bounds than conditional DiTs both in approximation and estimation, but also show the minimax optimality of latent unconditional DiTs. Our findings establish statistical limits for conditional and unconditional DiTs, and offer practical guidance toward developing more efficient and accurate DiT models.</description>

      <title>Frequency-Guided Posterior Sampling for Diffusion-Based Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image restoration aims to recover high-quality images from degraded observations. When the degradation process is known, the recovery problem can be formulated as an inverse problem, and in a Bayesian context, the goal is to sample a clean reconstruction given the degraded observation. Recently, modern pretrained diffusion models have been used for image restoration by modifying their sampling procedure to account for the degradation process. However, these methods often rely on certain approximations that can lead to significant errors and compromised sample quality. In this paper, we provide the first rigorous analysis of this approximation error for linear inverse problems under distributional assumptions on the space of natural images, demonstrating cases where previous works can fail dramatically. Motivated by our theoretical insights, we propose a simple modification to existing diffusion-based restoration methods. Our approach introduces a time-varying low-pass filter in the frequency domain of the measurements, progressively incorporating higher frequencies during the restoration process. We develop an adaptive curriculum for this frequency schedule based on the underlying data distribution. Our method significantly improves performance on challenging image restoration tasks including motion deblurring and image dehazing.</description>

      <title>FinML-Chain: A Blockchain-Integrated Dataset for Enhanced Financial Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning is critical for innovation and efficiency in financial markets, offering predictive models and data-driven decision-making. However, challenges such as missing data, lack of transparency, untimely updates, insecurity, and incompatible data sources limit its effectiveness. Blockchain technology, with its transparency, immutability, and real-time updates, addresses these challenges. We present a framework for integrating high-frequency on-chain data with low-frequency off-chain data, providing a benchmark for addressing novel research questions in economic mechanism design. This framework generates modular, extensible datasets for analyzing economic mechanisms such as the Transaction Fee Mechanism, enabling multi-modal insights and fairness-driven evaluations. Using four machine learning techniques, including linear regression, deep neural networks, XGBoost, and LSTM models, we demonstrate the framework's ability to produce datasets that advance financial research and improve understanding of blockchain-driven systems. Our contributions include: (1) proposing a research scenario for the Transaction Fee Mechanism and demonstrating how the framework addresses previously unexplored questions in economic mechanism design; (2) providing a benchmark for financial machine learning by open-sourcing a sample dataset generated by the framework and the code for the pipeline, enabling continuous dataset expansion; and (3) promoting reproducibility, transparency, and collaboration by fully open-sourcing the framework and its outputs. This initiative supports researchers in extending our work and developing innovative financial machine-learning models, fostering advancements at the intersection of machine learning, blockchain, and economics.</description>

      <title>PaRCE: Probabilistic and Reconstruction-based Competency Estimation for CNN-based Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are extremely popular and effective for image classification tasks but tend to be overly confident in their predictions. Various works have sought to quantify uncertainty associated with these models, detect out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs, or identify anomalous regions in an image, but limited work has sought to develop a holistic approach that can accurately estimate perception model confidence across various sources of uncertainty. We develop a probabilistic and reconstruction-based competency estimation (PaRCE) method and compare it to existing approaches for uncertainty quantification and OOD detection. We find that our method can best distinguish between correctly classified, misclassified, and OOD samples with anomalous regions, as well as between samples with visual image modifications resulting in high, medium, and low prediction accuracy. We describe how to extend our approach for anomaly localization tasks and demonstrate the ability of our approach to distinguish between regions in an image that are familiar to the perception model from those that are unfamiliar. We find that our method generates interpretable scores that most reliably capture a holistic notion of perception model confidence.</description>

      <title>Curvature in the Looking-Glass: Optimal Methods to Exploit Curvature of Expectation in the Loss Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Harnessing the local topography of the loss landscape is a central challenge in advanced optimization tasks. By accounting for the effect of potential parameter changes, we can alter the model more efficiently. Contrary to standard assumptions, we find that the Hessian does not always approximate loss curvature well, particularly near gradient discontinuities, which commonly arise in deep learning architectures.
  We present a new conceptual framework to understand how curvature of expected changes in loss emerges in architectures with many rectified linear units. Each ReLU creates a parameter boundary that, when crossed, induces a pseudorandom gradient perturbation. Our derivations show how these discontinuities combine to form a glass-like structure, similar to amorphous solids that contain microscopic domains of strong, but random, atomic alignment. By estimating the density of the resulting gradient variations, we can bound how the loss may change with parameter movement. Our analysis includes the optimal kernel and sample distribution for approximating glass density from ordinary gradient evaluations. We also derive the optimal modification to quasi-Newton steps that incorporate both glass and Hessian terms, as well as certain exactness properties that are possible with Nesterov-accelerated gradient updates.
  Our algorithm, Alice, tests these techniques to determine which curvature terms are most impactful for training a given architecture and dataset. Additional safeguards enforce stable exploitation through step bounds that expand on the functionality of Adam. These theoretical and experimental tools lay groundwork to improve future efforts (e.g., pruning and quantization) by providing new insight into the loss landscape.</description>

      <title>Can a Single Tree Outperform an Entire Forest?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The prevailing mindset is that a single decision tree underperforms classic random forests in testing accuracy, despite its advantages in interpretability and lightweight structure. This study challenges such a mindset by significantly improving the testing accuracy of an oblique regression tree through our gradient-based entire tree optimization framework, making its performance comparable to the classic random forest. Our approach reformulates tree training as a differentiable unconstrained optimization task, employing a scaled sigmoid approximation strategy. To ameliorate numerical instability, we propose an algorithmic scheme that solves a sequence of increasingly accurate approximations. Additionally, a subtree polish strategy is implemented to reduce approximation errors accumulated across the tree. Extensive experiments on 16 datasets demonstrate that our optimized tree outperforms the classic random forest by an average of $2.03\%$ improvements in testing accuracy.</description>

      <title>Optimal Estimation of Shared Singular Subspaces across Multiple Noisy Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating singular subspaces from noisy matrices is a fundamental problem with wide-ranging applications across various fields. Driven by the challenges of data integration and multi-view analysis, this study focuses on estimating shared (left) singular subspaces across multiple matrices within a low-rank matrix denoising framework. A common approach for this task is to perform singular value decomposition on the stacked matrix (Stack-SVD), which is formed by concatenating all the individual matrices. We establish that Stack-SVD achieves minimax rate-optimality when the true (left) singular subspaces of the signal matrices are identical. Our analysis reveals some phase transition phenomena in the estimation problem as a function of the underlying signal-to-noise ratio, highlighting how the interplay among multiple matrices collectively determines the fundamental limits of estimation. We then tackle the more complex scenario where the true singular subspaces are only partially shared across matrices. For various cases of partial sharing, we rigorously characterize the conditions under which Stack-SVD remains effective, achieves minimax optimality, or fails to deliver consistent estimates, offering theoretical insights into its practical applicability. To overcome Stack-SVD's limitations in partial sharing scenarios, we propose novel estimators and an efficient algorithm to identify shared and unshared singular vectors, and prove their minimax rate-optimality. Extensive simulation studies and real-world data applications demonstrate the numerous advantages of our proposed approaches.</description>

      <title>Emergenet: A Digital Twin of Sequence Evolution for Scalable Emergence Risk Assessment of Animal Influenza A Strains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite having triggered devastating pandemics in the past, our ability to quantitatively assess the emergence potential of individual strains of animal influenza viruses remains limited. This study introduces Emergenet, a tool to infer a digital twin of sequence evolution to chart how new variants might emerge in the wild. Our predictions based on Emergenets built only using 220,151 Hemagglutinnin (HA) sequences consistently outperform WHO seasonal vaccine recommendations for H1N1/H3N2 subtypes over two decades (average match-improvement: 3.73 AAs, 28.40\%), and are at par with state-of-the-art approaches that use more detailed phenotypic annotations. Finally, our generative models are used to scalably calculate the current odds of emergence of animal strains not yet in human circulation, which strongly correlates with CDC's expert-assessed Influenza Risk Assessment Tool (IRAT) scores (Pearson's $r = 0.721, p = 10^{-4}$). A minimum five orders of magnitude speedup over CDC's assessment (seconds vs months) then enabled us to analyze 6,354 animal strains collected post-2020 to identify 35 strains with high emergence scores ($&gt; 7.7$). The Emergenet framework opens the door to preemptive pandemic mitigation through targeted inoculation of animal hosts before the first human infection.</description>

      <title>Learning Hierarchical Polynomials of Multiple Nonlinear Features with Three-Layer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In deep learning theory, a critical question is to understand how neural networks learn hierarchical features. In this work, we study the learning of hierarchical polynomials of \textit{multiple nonlinear features} using three-layer neural networks. We examine a broad class of functions of the form $f^{\star}=g^{\star}\circ \bp$, where $\bp:\mathbb{R}^{d} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{r}$ represents multiple quadratic features with $r \ll d$ and $g^{\star}:\mathbb{R}^{r}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a polynomial of degree $p$. This can be viewed as a nonlinear generalization of the multi-index model \citep{damian2022neural}, and also an expansion upon previous work that focused only on a single nonlinear feature, i.e. $r = 1$ \citep{nichani2023provable,wang2023learning}.
  Our primary contribution shows that a three-layer neural network trained via layerwise gradient descent suffices for
  \begin{itemize}\item complete recovery of the space spanned by the nonlinear features
  \item efficient learning of the target function $f^{\star}=g^{\star}\circ \bp$ or transfer learning of $f=g\circ \bp$ with a different link function
  \end{itemize} within $\widetilde{\cO}(d^4)$ samples and polynomial time. For such hierarchical targets, our result substantially improves the sample complexity ${\Theta}(d^{2p})$ of the kernel methods, demonstrating the power of efficient feature learning. It is important to highlight that{ our results leverage novel techniques and thus manage to go beyond all prior settings} such as single-index and multi-index models as well as models depending just on one nonlinear feature, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of feature learning in deep learning.</description>

      <title>MiceBoneChallenge: Micro-CT public dataset and six solutions for automatic growth plate detection in micro-CT mice bone scans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting and quantifying bone changes in micro-CT scans of rodents is a common task in preclinical drug development studies. However, this task is manual, time-consuming and subject to inter- and intra-observer variability. In 2024, Anonymous Company organized an internal challenge to develop models for automatic bone quantification. We prepared and annotated a high-quality dataset of 3D $\mu$CT bone scans from $83$ mice. The challenge attracted over $80$ AI scientists from around the globe who formed $23$ teams. The participants were tasked with developing a solution to identify the plane where the bone growth happens, which is essential for fully automatic segmentation of trabecular bone. As a result, six computer vision solutions were developed that can accurately identify the location of the growth plate plane. The solutions achieved the mean absolute error of $1.91\pm0.87$ planes from the ground truth on the test set, an accuracy level acceptable for practical use by a radiologist. The annotated 3D scans dataset along with the six solutions and source code, is being made public, providing researchers with opportunities to develop and benchmark their own approaches. The code, trained models, and the data will be shared.</description>

      <title>Using Large Language Models for Expert Prior Elicitation in Predictive Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), trained on diverse data effectively acquire a breadth of information across various domains. However, their computational complexity, cost, and lack of transparency hinder their direct application for specialised tasks. In fields such as clinical research, acquiring expert annotations or prior knowledge about predictive models is often costly and time-consuming. This study proposes using LLMs to elicit expert prior distributions for predictive models. This approach also provides an alternative to in-context learning, where language models are tasked with making predictions directly. We compare LLM-elicited and uninformative priors, evaluate whether LLMs truthfully generate parameter distributions, and propose a model selection strategy for in-context learning and prior elicitation. Our findings show that LLM-elicited prior parameter distributions significantly reduce predictive error compared to uninformative priors in low-data settings. Applied to clinical problems, this translates to fewer required biological samples, lowering cost and resources. Prior elicitation also consistently outperforms and proves more reliable than in-context learning at a lower cost, making it a preferred alternative in our setting. We demonstrate the utility of this method across various use cases, including clinical applications. For infection prediction, using LLM-elicited priors reduced the number of required labels to achieve the same accuracy as an uninformative prior by 55%, at 200 days earlier in the study.</description>

      <title>Unlocking the Potential of Text-to-Image Diffusion with PAC-Bayesian Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have revolutionized generative modeling by producing high-fidelity, diverse, and visually realistic images from textual prompts. Despite these advances, existing models struggle with complex prompts involving multiple objects and attributes, often misaligning modifiers with their corresponding nouns or neglecting certain elements. Recent attention-based methods have improved object inclusion and linguistic binding, but still face challenges such as attribute misbinding and a lack of robust generalization guarantees. Leveraging the PAC-Bayes framework, we propose a Bayesian approach that designs custom priors over attention distributions to enforce desirable properties, including divergence between objects, alignment between modifiers and their corresponding nouns, minimal attention to irrelevant tokens, and regularization for better generalization. Our approach treats the attention mechanism as an interpretable component, enabling fine-grained control and improved attribute-object alignment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on standard benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple metrics. By integrating custom priors into the denoising process, our method enhances image quality and addresses long-standing challenges in T2I diffusion models, paving the way for more reliable and interpretable generative models.</description>

      <title>Learning Explainable Treatment Policies with Clinician-Informed Representations: A Practical Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital health interventions (DHIs) and remote patient monitoring (RPM) have shown great potential in improving chronic disease management through personalized care. However, barriers like limited efficacy and workload concerns hinder adoption of existing DHIs; while limited sample sizes and lack of interpretability limit the effectiveness and adoption of purely black-box algorithmic DHIs. In this paper, we address these challenges by developing a pipeline for learning explainable treatment policies for RPM-enabled DHIs. We apply our approach in the real-world setting of RPM using a DHI to improve glycemic control of youth with type 1 diabetes. Our main contribution is to reveal the importance of clinical domain knowledge in developing state and action representations for effective, efficient, and interpretable targeting policies. We observe that policies learned from clinician-informed representations are significantly more efficacious and efficient than policies learned from black-box representations. This work emphasizes the importance of collaboration between ML researchers and clinicians for developing effective DHIs in the real world.</description>

      <title>Anytime Acceleration of Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates stepsize-based acceleration of gradient descent with {\em anytime} convergence guarantees. For smooth (non-strongly) convex optimization, we propose a stepsize schedule that allows gradient descent to achieve convergence guarantees of $O(T^{-1.03})$ for any stopping time $T$, where the stepsize schedule is predetermined without prior knowledge of the stopping time. This result provides an affirmative answer to a COLT open problem \citep{kornowski2024open} regarding whether stepsize-based acceleration can yield anytime convergence rates of $o(T^{-1})$. We further extend our theory to yield anytime convergence guarantees of $\exp(-\Omega(T/\kappa^{0.97}))$ for smooth and strongly convex optimization, with $\kappa$ being the condition number.</description>

      <title>Keep it Tighter -- A Story on Analytical Mean Embeddings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.09516v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kernel techniques are among the most popular and flexible approaches in data science allowing to represent probability measures without loss of information under mild conditions. The resulting mapping called mean embedding gives rise to a divergence measure referred to as maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) with existing quadratic-time estimators (w.r.t. the sample size) and known convergence properties for bounded kernels. In this paper we focus on the problem of MMD estimation when the mean embedding of one of the underlying distributions is available analytically. Particularly, we consider distributions on the real line (motivated by financial applications) and prove tighter concentration for the proposed estimator under this semi-explicit setting; we also extend the result to the case of unbounded (exponential) kernel with minimax-optimal lower bounds. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach beyond synthetic example in three real-world examples relying on one-dimensional random variables: index replication and calibration on loss-given-default ratios and on S&amp;P 500 data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06388v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although Multi Armed Bandit (MAB) on one hand and the policy gradient approach on the other hand are among the most used frameworks of Reinforcement Learning, the theoretical properties of the policy gradient algorithm used for MAB have not been given enough attention. We investigate in this work the convergence of such a procedure for the situation when a $L2$ regularization term is present jointly with the 'softmax' parametrization. We prove convergence under appropriate technical hypotheses and test numerically the procedure including situations beyond the theoretical setting. The tests show that a time dependent regularized procedure can improve over the canonical approach especially when the initial guess is far from the solution.</description>

      <title>Investigating Self-Supervised Image Denoising with Denaturation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01124v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning for image denoising problems in the presence of denaturation for noisy data is a crucial approach in machine learning. However, theoretical understanding of the performance of the approach that uses denatured data is lacking. To provide better understanding of the approach, in this paper, we analyze a self-supervised denoising algorithm that uses denatured data in depth through theoretical analysis and numerical experiments. Through the theoretical analysis, we discuss that the algorithm finds desired solutions to the optimization problem with the population risk, while the guarantee for the empirical risk depends on the hardness of the denoising task in terms of denaturation levels. We also conduct several experiments to investigate the performance of an extended algorithm in practice. The results indicate that the algorithm training with denatured images works, and the empirical performance aligns with the theoretical results. These results suggest several insights for further improvement of self-supervised image denoising that uses denatured data in future directions.</description>

      <title>Annealing Flow Generative Model Towards Sampling High-Dimensional and Multi-Modal Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sampling from high dimensional, multimodal distributions remains a fundamental challenge across domains such as statistical Bayesian inference and physics based machine learning. In this paper, we propose Annealing Flow, a continuous normalizing flow based approach designed to sample from high dimensional and multimodal distributions. The key idea is to learn a continuous normalizing flow based transport map, guided by annealing, to transition samples from an easy to sample distribution to the target distribution, facilitating effective exploration of modes in high dimensional spaces. Unlike many existing methods, AF training does not rely on samples from the target distribution. AF ensures effective and balanced mode exploration, achieves linear complexity in sample size and dimensions, and circumvents inefficient mixing times. We demonstrate the superior performance of AF compared to state of the art methods through extensive experiments on various challenging distributions and real world datasets, particularly in high-dimensional and multimodal settings. We also highlight the potential of AF for sampling the least favorable distributions.</description>

      <title>Learning via Surrogate PAC-Bayes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: PAC-Bayes learning is a comprehensive setting for (i) studying the generalisation ability of learning algorithms and (ii) deriving new learning algorithms by optimising a generalisation bound. However, optimising generalisation bounds might not always be viable for tractable or computational reasons, or both. For example, iteratively querying the empirical risk might prove computationally expensive. In response, we introduce a novel principled strategy for building an iterative learning algorithm via the optimisation of a sequence of surrogate training objectives, inherited from PAC-Bayes generalisation bounds. The key argument is to replace the empirical risk (seen as a function of hypotheses) in the generalisation bound by its projection onto a constructible low dimensional functional space: these projections can be queried much more efficiently than the initial risk. On top of providing that generic recipe for learning via surrogate PAC-Bayes bounds, we (i) contribute theoretical results establishing that iteratively optimising our surrogates implies the optimisation of the original generalisation bounds, (ii) instantiate this strategy to the framework of meta-learning, introducing a meta-objective offering a closed form expression for meta-gradient, (iii) illustrate our approach with numerical experiments inspired by an industrial biochemical problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a data-driven strategy for minimizing/maximizing black-box functions based on probabilistic surrogate models. In the presence of safety constraints, the performance of BO crucially relies on tight probabilistic error bounds related to the uncertainty surrounding the surrogate model. For the case of Gaussian Process surrogates and Gaussian measurement noise, we present a novel error bound based on the recently proposed Wiener kernel regression. We prove that under rather mild assumptions, the proposed error bound is tighter than bounds previously documented in the literature which leads to enlarged safety regions. We draw upon a numerical example to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed error bound in safe BO.</description>

      <title>Dense ReLU Neural Networks for Temporal-spatial Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09961v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on fully connected deep neural networks utilizing the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function for nonparametric estimation. We derive non-asymptotic bounds that lead to convergence rates, addressing both temporal and spatial dependence in the observed measurements. By accounting for dependencies across time and space, our models better reflect the complexities of real-world data, enhancing both predictive performance and theoretical robustness. We also tackle the curse of dimensionality by modeling the data on a manifold, exploring the intrinsic dimensionality of high-dimensional data. We broaden existing theoretical findings of temporal-spatial analysis by applying them to neural networks in more general contexts and demonstrate that our proof techniques are effective for models with short-range dependence. Our empirical simulations across various synthetic response functions underscore the superior performance of our method, outperforming established approaches in the existing literature. These findings provide valuable insights into the strong capabilities of dense neural networks for temporal-spatial modeling across a broad range of function classes.</description>

      <title>Debiased Regression for Root-N-Consistent Conditional Mean Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11748v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces a debiasing method for regression estimators, including high-dimensional and nonparametric regression estimators. For example, nonparametric regression methods allow for the estimation of regression functions in a data-driven manner with minimal assumptions; however, these methods typically fail to achieve $\sqrt{n}$-consistency in their convergence rates, and many, including those in machine learning, lack guarantees that their estimators asymptotically follow a normal distribution. To address these challenges, we propose a debiasing technique for nonparametric estimators by adding a bias-correction term to the original estimators, extending the conventional one-step estimator used in semiparametric analysis. Specifically, for each data point, we estimate the conditional expected residual of the original nonparametric estimator, which can, for instance, be computed using kernel (Nadaraya-Watson) regression, and incorporate it as a bias-reduction term. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed estimator achieves $\sqrt{n}$-consistency and asymptotic normality under a mild convergence rate condition for both the original nonparametric estimator and the conditional expected residual estimator. Notably, this approach remains model-free as long as the original estimator and the conditional expected residual estimator satisfy the convergence rate condition. The proposed method offers several advantages, including improved estimation accuracy and simplified construction of confidence intervals.</description>

      <title>CatNet: Effective FDR Control in LSTM with Gaussian Mirrors and SHAP Feature Importance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce CatNet, an algorithm that effectively controls False Discovery Rate (FDR) and selects significant features in LSTM with the Gaussian Mirror (GM) method. To evaluate the feature importance of LSTM in time series, we introduce a vector of the derivative of the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to measure feature importance. We also propose a new kernel-based dependence measure to avoid multicollinearity in the GM algorithm, to make a robust feature selection with controlled FDR. We use simulated data to evaluate CatNet's performance in both linear models and LSTM models with different link functions. The algorithm effectively controls the FDR while maintaining a high statistical power in all cases. We also evaluate the algorithm's performance in different low-dimensional and high-dimensional cases, demonstrating its robustness in various input dimensions. To evaluate CatNet's performance in real world applications, we construct a multi-factor investment portfolio to forecast the prices of S\&amp;P 500 index components. The results demonstrate that our model achieves superior predictive accuracy compared to traditional LSTM models without feature selection and FDR control. Additionally, CatNet effectively captures common market-driving features, which helps informed decision-making in financial markets by enhancing the interpretability of predictions. Our study integrates of the Gaussian Mirror algorithm with LSTM models for the first time, and introduces SHAP values as a new feature importance metric for FDR control methods, marking a significant advancement in feature selection and error control for neural networks.</description>

      <title>Label Noise Robustness of Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.14295v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the robustness of conformal prediction, a powerful tool for uncertainty quantification, to label noise. Our analysis tackles both regression and classification problems, characterizing when and how it is possible to construct uncertainty sets that correctly cover the unobserved noiseless ground truth labels. We further extend our theory and formulate the requirements for correctly controlling a general loss function, such as the false negative proportion, with noisy labels. Our theory and experiments suggest that conformal prediction and risk-controlling techniques with noisy labels attain conservative risk over the clean ground truth labels whenever the noise is dispersive and increases variability. In other adversarial cases, we can also correct for noise of bounded size in the conformal prediction algorithm in order to ensure achieving the correct risk of the ground truth labels without score or data regularity.</description>

      <title>Universal approximation with complex-valued deep narrow neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16910v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the universality of complex-valued neural networks with bounded widths and arbitrary depths. Under mild assumptions, we give a full description of those activation functions $\varrho:\mathbb{C}\to \mathbb{C}$ that have the property that their associated networks are universal, i.e., are capable of approximating continuous functions to arbitrary accuracy on compact domains. Precisely, we show that deep narrow complex-valued networks are universal if and only if their activation function is neither holomorphic, nor antiholomorphic, nor $\mathbb{R}$-affine. This is a much larger class of functions than in the dual setting of arbitrary width and fixed depth. Unlike in the real case, the sufficient width differs significantly depending on the considered activation function. We show that a width of $2n+2m+5$ is always sufficient and that in general a width of $max\{2n,2m\}$ is necessary. We prove, however, that a width of $n+m+3$ suffices for a rich subclass of the admissible activation functions. Here, $n$ and $m$ denote the input and output dimensions of the considered networks. Moreover, for the case of smooth and non-polyharmonic activation functions, we provide a quantitative approximation bound in terms of the depth of the considered networks.</description>

      <title>Finite-Time Decoupled Convergence in Nonlinear Two-Time-Scale Stochastic Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03893v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In two-time-scale stochastic approximation (SA), two iterates are updated at varying speeds using different step sizes, with each update influencing the other. Previous studies on linear two-time-scale SA have shown that the convergence rates of the mean-square errors for these updates depend solely on their respective step sizes, a phenomenon termed decoupled convergence. However, achieving decoupled convergence in nonlinear SA remains less understood. Our research investigates the potential for finite-time decoupled convergence in nonlinear two-time-scale SA. We demonstrate that, under a nested local linearity assumption, finite-time decoupled convergence rates can be achieved with suitable step size selection. To derive this result, we conduct a convergence analysis of the matrix cross term between the iterates and leverage fourth-order moment convergence rates to control the higher-order error terms induced by local linearity. Additionally, a numerical example is provided to explore the possible necessity of local linearity for decoupled convergence.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Grained Symmetric Differential Equation Model for Learning Protein-Ligand Binding Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15122v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In drug discovery, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation for protein-ligand binding provides a powerful tool for predicting binding affinities, estimating transport properties, and exploring pocket sites. There has been a long history of improving the efficiency of MD simulations through better numerical methods and, more recently, by utilizing machine learning (ML) methods. Yet, challenges remain, such as accurate modeling of extended-timescale simulations. To address this issue, we propose NeuralMD, the first ML surrogate that can facilitate numerical MD and provide accurate simulations in protein-ligand binding dynamics. We propose a principled approach that incorporates a novel physics-informed multi-grained group symmetric framework. Specifically, we propose (1) the BindingNet model that satisfies group symmetry using vector frames and captures the multi-level protein-ligand interactions, and (2) an augmented neural differential equation solver that learns the trajectory under Newtonian mechanics. For the experiment, we design ten single-trajectory and three multi-trajectory binding simulation tasks. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of NeuralMD, achieving over 1K$\times$ speedup compared to standard numerical MD simulations. NeuralMD also outperforms all other ML approaches, achieving up to 15$\times$ reduction in reconstruction error and 70% increase in validity. Additionally, we qualitatively illustrate that the oscillations in the predicted trajectories align more closely with ground-truth dynamics than those of other machine-learning methods. We believe NeuralMD paves the foundation for a new research paradigm in simulating protein-ligand dynamics.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Secrets: How Masking Strategies Shape Time Series Imputation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time series imputation is a critical challenge in data mining, particularly in domains like healthcare and environmental monitoring, where missing data can compromise analytical outcomes. This study investigates the influence of diverse masking strategies, normalization timing, and missingness patterns on the performance of eleven state-of-the-art imputation models across three diverse datasets. Specifically, we evaluate the effects of pre-masking versus in-mini-batch masking, augmentation versus overlaying of artificial missingness, and pre-normalization versus post-normalization. Our findings reveal that masking strategies profoundly affect imputation accuracy, with dynamic masking providing robust augmentation benefits and overlay masking better simulating real-world missingness patterns. Sophisticated models, such as CSDI, exhibited sensitivity to preprocessing configurations, while simpler models like BRITS delivered consistent and efficient performance. We highlight the importance of aligning preprocessing pipelines and masking strategies with dataset characteristics to improve robustness under diverse conditions, including high missing rates. This study provides actionable insights for designing imputation pipelines and underscores the need for transparent and comprehensive experimental designs.</description>

      <title>Linguistic Collapse: Neural Collapse in (Large) Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17767v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural collapse ($\mathcal{NC}$) is a phenomenon observed in classification tasks where top-layer representations collapse into their class means, which become equinorm, equiangular and aligned with the classifiers. These behaviours -- associated with generalization and robustness -- would manifest under specific conditions: models are trained towards zero loss, with noise-free labels belonging to balanced classes, which do not outnumber the model's hidden dimension. Recent studies have explored $\mathcal{NC}$ in the absence of one or more of these conditions to extend and capitalize on the associated benefits of ideal geometries. Language modelling presents a curious frontier, as \textit{training by token prediction} constitutes a classification task where none of the conditions exist: the vocabulary is imbalanced and exceeds the embedding dimension; different tokens might correspond to similar contextual embeddings; and large language models (LLMs) in particular are typically only trained for a few epochs. This paper empirically investigates the impact of scaling the architectures and training of causal language models (CLMs) on their progression towards $\mathcal{NC}$. We find that $\mathcal{NC}$ properties that develop with scale (and regularization) are linked to generalization. Moreover, there is evidence of some relationship between $\mathcal{NC}$ and generalization independent of scale. Our work thereby underscores the generality of $\mathcal{NC}$ as it extends to the novel and more challenging setting of language modelling. Downstream, we seek to inspire further research on the phenomenon to deepen our understanding of LLMs -- and neural networks at large -- and improve existing architectures based on $\mathcal{NC}$-related properties.

      <title>LOLA: LLM-Assisted Online Learning Algorithm for Content Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02611v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern media firms require automated and efficient methods to identify content that is most engaging and appealing to users. Leveraging a large-scale dataset from Upworthy (a news publisher), which includes 17,681 headline A/B tests, we first investigate the ability of three pure-LLM approaches to identify the catchiest headline: prompt-based methods, embedding-based methods, and fine-tuned open-source LLMs. Prompt-based approaches perform poorly, while both OpenAI-embedding-based models and the fine-tuned Llama-3-8B achieve marginally higher accuracy than random predictions. In sum, none of the pure-LLM-based methods can predict the best-performing headline with high accuracy. We then introduce the LLM-Assisted Online Learning Algorithm (LOLA), a novel framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with adaptive experimentation to optimize content delivery. LOLA combines the best pure-LLM approach with the Upper Confidence Bound algorithm to allocate traffic and maximize clicks adaptively. Our numerical experiments on Upworthy data show that LOLA outperforms the standard A/B test method (the current status quo at Upworthy), pure bandit algorithms, and pure-LLM approaches, particularly in scenarios with limited experimental traffic. Our approach is scalable and applicable to content experiments across various settings where firms seek to optimize user engagement, including digital advertising and social media recommendations.</description>

      <title>Differentially private and decentralized randomized power method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The randomized power method has gained significant interest due to its simplicity and efficient handling of large-scale spectral analysis and recommendation tasks. As modern datasets contain sensitive private information, we need to give formal guarantees on the possible privacy leaks caused by this method. This paper focuses on enhancing privacy preserving variants of the method. We propose a strategy to reduce the variance of the noise introduced to achieve Differential Privacy (DP). We also adapt the method to a decentralized framework with a low computational and communication overhead, while preserving the accuracy. We leverage Secure Aggregation (a form of Multi-Party Computation) to allow the algorithm to perform computations using data distributed among multiple users or devices, without revealing individual data. We show that it is possible to use a noise scale in the decentralized setting that is similar to the one in the centralized setting. We improve upon existing convergence bounds for both the centralized and decentralized versions. The proposed method is especially relevant for decentralized applications such as distributed recommender systems, where privacy concerns are paramount.</description>
