      <title>Orthogonal Hyper-category Guided Multi-interest Elicitation for Micro-video Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Watching micro-videos is becoming a part of public daily life. Usually, user watching behaviors are thought to be rooted in their multiple different interests. In the paper, we propose a model named OPAL for micro-video matching, which elicits a user's multiple heterogeneous interests by disentangling multiple soft and hard interest embeddings from user interactions. Moreover, OPAL employs a two-stage training strategy, in which the pre-train is to generate soft interests from historical interactions under the guidance of orthogonal hyper-categories of micro-videos and the fine-tune is to reinforce the degree of disentanglement among the interests and learn the temporal evolution of each interest of each user. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets. The results show that OPAL not only returns diversified micro-videos but also outperforms six state-of-the-art models in terms of recall and hit rate.</description>

      <title>Denoising Long- and Short-term Interests for Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: User interests can be viewed over different time scales, mainly including stable long-term preferences and changing short-term intentions, and their combination facilitates the comprehensive sequential recommendation. However, existing work that focuses on different time scales of user modeling has ignored the negative effects of different time-scale noise, which hinders capturing actual user interests and cannot be resolved by conventional sequential denoising methods. In this paper, we propose a Long- and Short-term Interest Denoising Network (LSIDN), which employs different encoders and tailored denoising strategies to extract long- and short-term interests, respectively, achieving both comprehensive and robust user modeling. Specifically, we employ a session-level interest extraction and evolution strategy to avoid introducing inter-session behavioral noise into long-term interest modeling; we also adopt contrastive learning equipped with a homogeneous exchanging augmentation to alleviate the impact of unintentional behavioral noise on short-term interest modeling. Results of experiments on two public datasets show that LSIDN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models and achieves significant robustness.</description>

      <title>Strategic Coupon Allocation for Increasing Providers' Sales Experiences in Two-sided Marketplaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a two-sided marketplace, network effects are crucial for competitiveness, and platforms need to retain users through advanced customer relationship management as much as possible. Maintaining numerous providers' stable and active presence on the platform is highly important to enhance the marketplace's scale and diversity. The strongest motivation for providers to continue using the platform is to realize actual profits through sales. Then, we propose a personalized promotion to increase the number of successful providers with sales experiences on the platform. The main contributions of our research are twofold. First, we introduce a new perspective in provider management with the distribution of successful sales experiences. Second, we propose a personalized promotion optimization method to maximize the number of providers' sales experiences. By utilizing this approach, we ensure equal opportunities for providers to experience sales without being monopolized by a few providers. Through experiments using actual data on coupon distribution, we confirm that our method enables the implementation of coupon allocation strategies that significantly increase the total number of providers having sales experiences.</description>

      <title>Chemical Reaction Extraction for Chemical Knowledge Base</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The task of searching through patent documents is crucial for chemical patent recommendation and retrieval. This can be enhanced by creating a patent knowledge base (ChemPatKB) to aid in prior art searches and to provide a platform for domain experts to explore new innovations in chemical compound synthesis and use-cases. An essential foundational component of this KB is the extraction of important reaction snippets from long patents documents which facilitates multiple downstream tasks such as reaction co-reference resolution and chemical entity role identification. In this work, we explore the problem of extracting reactions spans from chemical patents in order to create a reactions resource database. We formulate this task as a paragraph-level sequence tagging problem, where the system is required to return a sequence of paragraphs that contain a description of a reaction. We propose several approaches and modifications of the baseline models and study how different methods generalize across different domains of chemical patents.</description>

      <title>Evidence-Based Temporal Fact Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated fact verification plays an essential role in fostering trust in the digital space. Despite the growing interest, the verification of temporal facts has not received much attention in the community. Temporal fact verification brings new challenges where cues of the temporal information need to be extracted and temporal reasoning involving various temporal aspects of the text must be applied. In this work, we propose an end-to-end solution for temporal fact verification that considers the temporal information in claims to obtain relevant evidence sentences and harness the power of large language model for temporal reasoning. Recognizing that temporal facts often involve events, we model these events in the claim and evidence sentences. We curate two temporal fact datasets to learn time-sensitive representations that encapsulate not only the semantic relationships among the events, but also their chronological proximity. This allows us to retrieve the top-k relevant evidence sentences and provide the context for a large language model to perform temporal reasoning and outputs whether a claim is supported or refuted by the retrieved evidence sentences. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly enhances the accuracy of temporal claim verification, thereby advancing current state-of-the-art in automated fact verification.</description>

      <title>Scalable Dynamic Embedding Size Search for Streaming Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems typically represent users and items by learning their embeddings, which are usually set to uniform dimensions and dominate the model parameters. However, real-world recommender systems often operate in streaming recommendation scenarios, where the number of users and items continues to grow, leading to substantial storage resource consumption for these embeddings. Although a few methods attempt to mitigate this by employing embedding size search strategies to assign different embedding dimensions in streaming recommendations, they assume that the embedding size grows with the frequency of users/items, which eventually still exceeds the predefined memory budget over time. To address this issue, this paper proposes to learn Scalable Lightweight Embeddings for streaming recommendation, called SCALL, which can adaptively adjust the embedding sizes of users/items within a given memory budget over time. Specifically, we propose to sample embedding sizes from a probabilistic distribution, with the guarantee to meet any predefined memory budget. By fixing the memory budget, the proposed embedding size sampling strategy can increase and decrease the embedding sizes in accordance to the frequency of the corresponding users or items. Furthermore, we develop a reinforcement learning-based search paradigm that models each state with mean pooling to keep the length of the state vectors fixed, invariant to the changing number of users and items. As a result, the proposed method can provide embedding sizes to unseen users and items. Comprehensive empirical evaluations on two public datasets affirm the advantageous effectiveness of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Efficient Retrieval with Learned Similarities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval plays a fundamental role in recommendation systems, search, and natural language processing by efficiently finding relevant items from a large corpus given a query. Dot products have been widely used as the similarity function in such retrieval tasks, thanks to Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) that enabled efficient retrieval based on dot products. However, state-of-the-art retrieval algorithms have migrated to learned similarities. Such algorithms vary in form; the queries can be represented with multiple embeddings, complex neural networks can be deployed, the item ids can be decoded directly from queries using beam search, and multiple approaches can be combined in hybrid solutions. Unfortunately, we lack efficient solutions for retrieval in these state-of-the-art setups. Our work investigates techniques for approximate nearest neighbor search with learned similarity functions. We first prove that Mixture-of-Logits (MoL) is a universal approximator, and can express all learned similarity functions. We next propose techniques to retrieve the approximate top K results using MoL with a tight bound. We finally compare our techniques with existing approaches, showing that MoL sets new state-of-the-art results on recommendation retrieval tasks, and our approximate top-k retrieval with learned similarities outperforms baselines by up to two orders of magnitude in latency, while achieving &gt; .99 recall rate of exact algorithms.</description>

      <title>Personalization of Dataset Retrieval Results using a Metadata-based Data Valuation Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel data valuation method for a Dataset Retrieval (DR) use case in Ireland's National mapping agency. To the best of our knowledge, data valuation has not yet been applied to Dataset Retrieval. By leveraging metadata and a user's preferences, we estimate the personal value of each dataset to facilitate dataset retrieval and filtering. We then validated the data value-based ranking against the stakeholders' ranking of the datasets. The proposed data valuation method and use case demonstrated that data valuation is promising for dataset retrieval. For instance, the outperforming dataset retrieval based on our approach obtained 0.8207 in terms of NDCG@5 (the truncated Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain at 5). This study is unique in its exploration of a data valuation-based approach to dataset retrieval and stands out because, unlike most existing methods, our approach is validated using the stakeholders ranking of the datasets.</description>

      <title>Dual Test-time Training for Out-of-distribution Recommender System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has been widely applied in recommender systems, which has achieved revolutionary progress recently. However, most existing learning-based methods assume that the user and item distributions remain unchanged between the training phase and the test phase. However, the distribution of user and item features can naturally shift in real-world scenarios, potentially resulting in a substantial decrease in recommendation performance. This phenomenon can be formulated as an Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) recommendation problem. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Dual Test-Time-Training framework for OOD Recommendation, termed DT3OR. In DT3OR, we incorporate a model adaptation mechanism during the test-time phase to carefully update the recommendation model, allowing the model to specially adapt to the shifting user and item features. To be specific, we propose a self-distillation task and a contrastive task to assist the model learning both the user's invariant interest preferences and the variant user/item characteristics during the test-time phase, thus facilitating a smooth adaptation to the shifting features. Furthermore, we provide theoretical analysis to support the rationale behind our dual test-time training framework. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first work to address OOD recommendation via a test-time-training strategy. We conduct experiments on three datasets with various backbones. Comprehensive experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of DT3OR compared to other state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>NV-Retriever: Improving text embedding models with effective hard-negative mining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text embedding models have been popular for information retrieval applications such as semantic search and Question-Answering systems based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Those models are typically Transformer models that are fine-tuned with contrastive learning objectives. Many papers introduced new embedding model architectures and training approaches, however, one of the key ingredients, the process of mining negative passages, remains poorly explored or described. One of the challenging aspects of fine-tuning embedding models is the selection of high quality hard-negative passages for contrastive learning. In this paper we propose a family of positive-aware mining methods that leverage the positive relevance score for more effective false negatives removal. We also provide a comprehensive ablation study on hard-negative mining methods over their configurations, exploring different teacher and base models. We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed methods by introducing the NV-Retriever-v1 model, which scores 60.9 on MTEB Retrieval (BEIR) benchmark and 0.65 points higher than previous methods. The model placed 1st when it was published to MTEB Retrieval on July 07, 2024.</description>

      <title>Observations on LLMs for Telecom Domain: Capabilities and Limitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.13102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The landscape for building conversational interfaces (chatbots) has witnessed a paradigm shift with recent developments in generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) based Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT by OpenAI (GPT3.5 and GPT4), Google's Bard, Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA), among others. In this paper, we analyze capabilities and limitations of incorporating such models in conversational interfaces for the telecommunication domain, specifically for enterprise wireless products and services. Using Cradlepoint's publicly available data for our experiments, we present a comparative analysis of the responses from such models for multiple use-cases including domain adaptation for terminology and product taxonomy, context continuity, robustness to input perturbations and errors. We believe this evaluation would provide useful insights to data scientists engaged in building customized conversational interfaces for domain-specific requirements.</description>

      <title>Auditing the Grid-Based Placement of Private Label Products on E-commerce Search Result Pages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: E-commerce platforms support the needs and livelihoods of their two most important stakeholders -- customers and producers/sellers. Multiple algorithmic systems, like ``search'' systems mediate the interactions between these stakeholders by connecting customers to producers with relevant items. Search results include (i) private label (PL) products that are manufactured/sold by the platform itself, as well as (ii) third-party products on advertised / sponsored and organic positions. In this paper, we systematically quantify the extent of PL product promotion on e-commerce search results for the two largest e-commerce platforms operating in India -- Amazon.in and Flipkart. By analyzing snapshots of search results across the two platforms, we discover high PL promotion on the initial result pages (~ 15% PLs are advertised on the first SERP of Amazon). Both platforms use different strategies to promote their PL products, such as placing more PLs on the advertised positions -- while Amazon places them on the first, middle, and last rows of the search results, Flipkart places them on the first two positions and the (entire) last column of the search results. We discover that these product placement strategies of both platforms conform with existing user attention strategies proposed in the literature. Finally, to supplement the findings from the collected data, we conduct a survey among 68 participants on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The click pattern from our survey shows that users strongly prefer to click on products placed at positions that correspond to the PL products on the search results of Amazon, but not so strongly on Flipkart. The click-through rate follows previously proposed theoretically grounded user attention distribution patterns in a two-dimensional layout.</description>

      <title>Assessing Brittleness of Image-Text Retrieval Benchmarks from Vision-Language Models Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image-text retrieval (ITR), an important task in information retrieval (IR), is driven by pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) that consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance. However, a significant challenge lies in the brittleness of existing ITR benchmarks. In standard datasets for the task, captions often provide broad summaries of scenes, neglecting detailed information about specific concepts. Additionally, the current evaluation setup assumes simplistic binary matches between images and texts and focuses on intra-modality rather than cross-modal relationships, which can lead to misinterpretations of model performance. Motivated by this gap, in this study, we focus on examining the brittleness of the ITR evaluation pipeline with a focus on concept granularity. We start by analyzing two common benchmarks, MS-COCO and Flickr30k, and compare them with their augmented versions, MS-COCO-FG and Flickr30k-FG, given a specified set of linguistic features capturing concept granularity. We discover that Flickr30k-FG and MS COCO-FG consistently achieve higher scores across all the selected features. To investigate the performance of VLMs on coarse and fine-grained datasets, we introduce a taxonomy of perturbations. We apply these perturbations to the selected datasets. We evaluate four state-of-the-art models - ALIGN, AltCLIP, CLIP, and GroupViT - on the standard and fine-grained datasets under zero-shot conditions, with and without the applied perturbations. The results demonstrate that although perturbations generally degrade model performance, the fine-grained datasets exhibit a smaller performance drop than their standard counterparts. Moreover, the relative performance drop across all setups is consistent across all models and datasets, indicating that the issue lies within the benchmarks. We conclude the paper by providing an agenda for improving ITR evaluation pipelines.</description>

      <title>MODRL-TA:A Multi-Objective Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for Traffic Allocation in E-Commerce Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traffic allocation is a process of redistributing natural traffic to products by adjusting their positions in the post-search phase, aimed at effectively fostering merchant growth, precisely meeting customer demands, and ensuring the maximization of interests across various parties within e-commerce platforms. Existing methods based on learning to rank neglect the long-term value of traffic allocation, whereas approaches of reinforcement learning suffer from balancing multiple objectives and the difficulties of cold starts within realworld data environments. To address the aforementioned issues, this paper propose a multi-objective deep reinforcement learning framework consisting of multi-objective Q-learning (MOQ), a decision fusion algorithm (DFM) based on the cross-entropy method(CEM), and a progressive data augmentation system(PDA). Specifically. MOQ constructs ensemble RL models, each dedicated to an objective, such as click-through rate, conversion rate, etc. These models individually determine the position of items as actions, aiming to estimate the long-term value of multiple objectives from an individual perspective. Then we employ DFM to dynamically adjust weights among objectives to maximize long-term value, addressing temporal dynamics in objective preferences in e-commerce scenarios. Initially, PDA trained MOQ with simulated data from offline logs. As experiments progressed, it strategically integrated real user interaction data, ultimately replacing the simulated dataset to alleviate distributional shifts and the cold start problem. Experimental results on real-world online e-commerce systems demonstrate the significant improvements of MODRL-TA, and we have successfully deployed MODRL-TA on an e-commerce search platform.</description>

      <title>Integrating AI Tutors in a Programming Course</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: RAGMan is an LLM-powered tutoring system that can support a variety of course-specific and homework-specific AI tutors. RAGMan leverages Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), as well as strict instructions, to ensure the alignment of the AI tutors' responses. By using RAGMan's AI tutors, students receive assistance with their specific homework assignments without directly obtaining solutions, while also having the ability to ask general programming-related questions.
  RAGMan was deployed as an optional resource in an introductory programming course with an enrollment of 455 students. It was configured as a set of five homework-specific AI tutors. This paper describes the interactions the students had with the AI tutors, the students' feedback, and a comparative grade analysis. Overall, about half of the students engaged with the AI tutors, and the vast majority of the interactions were legitimate homework questions. When students posed questions within the intended scope, the AI tutors delivered accurate responses 98% of the time. Within the students used AI tutors, 78% reported that the tutors helped their learning. Beyond AI tutors' ability to provide valuable suggestions, students reported appreciating them for fostering a safe learning environment free from judgment.</description>

      <title>MoRSE: Bridging the Gap in Cybersecurity Expertise with Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce MoRSE (Mixture of RAGs Security Experts), the first specialised AI chatbot for cybersecurity. MoRSE aims to provide comprehensive and complete knowledge about cybersecurity. MoRSE uses two RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) systems designed to retrieve and organize information from multidimensional cybersecurity contexts. MoRSE differs from traditional RAGs by using parallel retrievers that work together to retrieve semantically related information in different formats and structures. Unlike traditional Large Language Models (LLMs) that rely on Parametric Knowledge Bases, MoRSE retrieves relevant documents from Non-Parametric Knowledge Bases in response to user queries. Subsequently, MoRSE uses this information to generate accurate answers. In addition, MoRSE benefits from real-time updates to its knowledge bases, enabling continuous knowledge enrichment without retraining. We have evaluated the effectiveness of MoRSE against other state-of-the-art LLMs, evaluating the system on 600 cybersecurity specific questions. The experimental evaluation has shown that the improvement in terms of relevance and correctness of the answer is more than 10\% compared to known solutions such as GPT-4 and Mixtral 7x8.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Pre-training Framework for Sequential Recommendation via Contrastive Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.11879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current multimodal sequential recommendation models are often unable to effectively explore and capture correlations among behavior sequences of users and items across different modalities, either neglecting correlations among sequence representations or inadequately capturing associations between multimodal data and sequence data in their representations. To address this problem, we explore multimodal pre-training in the context of sequential recommendation, with the aim of enhancing fusion and utilization of multimodal information. We propose a novel Multimodal Pre-training for Sequential Recommendation (MP4SR) framework, which utilizes contrastive losses to capture the correlation among different modality sequences of users, as well as the correlation among different modality sequences of users and items. MP4SR consists of three key components: 1) multimodal feature extraction, 2) a backbone network, Multimodal Mixup Sequence Encoder (M2SE), and 3) pre-training tasks. After utilizing pre-trained encoders to generate initial multimodal features of items, M2SE adopts a complementary sequence mixup strategy to fuse different modality sequences, and leverages contrastive learning to capture modality interactions at the sequence-to-sequence and sequence-to-item levels. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that MP4SR outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both normal and cold-start settings. We further highlight the efficacy of incorporating multimodal pre-training in sequential recommendation representation learning, serving as an effective regularizer and optimizing the parameter space for the recommendation task.</description>

      <title>IISAN: Efficiently Adapting Multimodal Representation for Sequential Recommendation with Decoupled PEFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02059v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal foundation models are transformative in sequential recommender systems, leveraging powerful representation learning capabilities. While Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) is commonly used to adapt foundation models for recommendation tasks, most research prioritizes parameter efficiency, often overlooking critical factors like GPU memory efficiency and training speed. Addressing this gap, our paper introduces IISAN (Intra- and Inter-modal Side Adapted Network for Multimodal Representation), a simple plug-and-play architecture using a Decoupled PEFT structure and exploiting both intra- and inter-modal adaptation.
  IISAN matches the performance of full fine-tuning (FFT) and state-of-the-art PEFT. More importantly, it significantly reduces GPU memory usage - from 47GB to just 3GB for multimodal sequential recommendation tasks. Additionally, it accelerates training time per epoch from 443s to 22s compared to FFT. This is also a notable improvement over the Adapter and LoRA, which require 37-39 GB GPU memory and 350-380 seconds per epoch for training.
  Furthermore, we propose a new composite efficiency metric, TPME (Training-time, Parameter, and GPU Memory Efficiency) to alleviate the prevalent misconception that "parameter efficiency represents overall efficiency". TPME provides more comprehensive insights into practical efficiency comparisons between different methods. Besides, we give an accessible efficiency analysis of all PEFT and FFT approaches, which demonstrate the superiority of IISAN. We release our codes and other materials at https://github.com/GAIR-Lab/IISAN.</description>

      <title>ADMM Based Semi-Structured Pattern Pruning Framework For Transformer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08334v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: NLP(natural language processsing) has achieved great success through the transformer model.However, the model has hundreds of millions or billions parameters,which is huge burden for its deployment on personal computer or small scale of server.To deal with it, we either make the model's weight matrix relatively sparser, or compress attention layer. Pattern pruning ,one of the most important pruning methods, permits selecting fixed number of parameters in each divided pattern block and prunes it. However, the effect of pattern pruning is strictly limited by the sparsity within a region of weights in each layer. In this paper,we first introduced Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers(ADMM) based pattern pruning framework to reshape the distribution of activation map. Specifically, we propose to formulate the pattern pruning on transformer as a constrained optimization and use ADMM to optimize the problem. In this way, the initial dense feature maps is transformed to rather regionally sparsified ones.Therefore, we can then achieve higher compression ratio with better performance based on pattern pruning method. Additionally, this paper provides a theoretical derivations of the ADMM with local sparsity. Finally, we also extend the proposed ADMM based framework with SR-STE to demonstrate its generalization and to avoid gradient vanishing problem. We conduct extensive experiments on classification tasks over GLUE datasets. Significantly, we achieve 50% percent compression ratio while maintaining overall score 80.1 on GLUE dataset.</description>

      <title>Towards Robust Recommendation via Decision Boundary-aware Graph Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, graph contrastive learning (GCL) has received increasing attention in recommender systems due to its effectiveness in reducing bias caused by data sparsity. However, most existing GCL models rely on heuristic approaches and usually assume entity independence when constructing contrastive views. We argue that these methods struggle to strike a balance between semantic invariance and view hardness across the dynamic training process, both of which are critical factors in graph contrastive learning.
  To address the above issues, we propose a novel GCL-based recommendation framework RGCL, which effectively maintains the semantic invariance of contrastive pairs and dynamically adapts as the model capability evolves through the training process. Specifically, RGCL first introduces decision boundary-aware adversarial perturbations to constrain the exploration space of contrastive augmented views, avoiding the decrease of task-specific information. Furthermore, to incorporate global user-user and item-item collaboration relationships for guiding on the generation of hard contrastive views, we propose an adversarial-contrastive learning objective to construct a relation-aware view-generator. Besides, considering that unsupervised GCL could potentially narrower margins between data points and the decision boundary, resulting in decreased model robustness, we introduce the adversarial examples based on maximum perturbations to achieve margin maximization. We also provide theoretical analyses on the effectiveness of our designs. Through extensive experiments on five public datasets, we demonstrate the superiority of RGCL compared against twelve baseline models.</description>

      <title>Graph Signal Processing for Cross-Domain Recommendation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) extends conventional recommender systems by leveraging user-item interactions from dense domains to mitigate data sparsity and the cold start problem. While CDR offers substantial potential for enhancing recommendation performance, most existing CDR methods suffer from sensitivity to the ratio of overlapping users and intrinsic discrepancy between source and target domains. To overcome these limitations, in this work, we explore the application of graph signal processing (GSP) in CDR scenarios. We propose CGSP, a unified CDR framework based on GSP, which employs a cross-domain similarity graph constructed by flexibly combining target-only similarity and source-bridged similarity. By processing personalized graph signals computed for users from either the source or target domain, our framework effectively supports both inter-domain and intra-domain recommendations. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that CGSP consistently outperforms various encoder-based CDR approaches in both intra-domain and inter-domain recommendation scenarios, especially when the ratio of overlapping users is low, highlighting its significant practical implication in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>A Human-Inspired Reading Agent with Gist Memory of Very Long Contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09727v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are not only limited to some maximum context length, but also are not able to robustly consume long inputs. To address these limitations, we propose ReadAgent, an LLM agent system that increases effective context length up to 20x in our experiments. Inspired by how humans interactively read long documents, we implement ReadAgent as a simple prompting system that uses the advanced language capabilities of LLMs to (1) decide what content to store together in a memory episode, (2) compress those memory episodes into short episodic memories called gist memories, and (3) take actions to look up passages in the original text if ReadAgent needs to remind itself of relevant details to complete a task. We evaluate ReadAgent against baselines using retrieval methods, using the original long contexts, and using the gist memories. These evaluations are performed on three long-document reading comprehension tasks: QuALITY, NarrativeQA, and QMSum. ReadAgent outperforms the baselines on all three tasks while extending the effective context window by 3.5-20x.</description>

      <title>ImplicitAVE: An Open-Source Dataset and Multimodal LLMs Benchmark for Implicit Attribute Value Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing datasets for attribute value extraction (AVE) predominantly focus on explicit attribute values while neglecting the implicit ones, lack product images, are often not publicly available, and lack an in-depth human inspection across diverse domains. To address these limitations, we present ImplicitAVE, the first, publicly available multimodal dataset for implicit attribute value extraction. ImplicitAVE, sourced from the MAVE dataset, is carefully curated and expanded to include implicit AVE and multimodality, resulting in a refined dataset of 68k training and 1.6k testing data across five domains. We also explore the application of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to implicit AVE, establishing a comprehensive benchmark for MLLMs on the ImplicitAVE dataset. Six recent MLLMs with eleven variants are evaluated across diverse settings, revealing that implicit value extraction remains a challenging task for MLLMs. The contributions of this work include the development and release of ImplicitAVE, and the exploration and benchmarking of various MLLMs for implicit AVE, providing valuable insights and potential future research directions.

      <title>Paths of A Million People: Extracting Life Trajectories from Wikipedia</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The life trajectories of notable people have been studied to pinpoint the times and places of significant events such as birth, death, education, marriage, competition, work, speeches, scientific discoveries, artistic achievements, and battles. Understanding how these individuals interact with others provides valuable insights for broader research into human dynamics. However, the scarcity of trajectory data in terms of volume, density, and inter-person interactions, limits relevant studies from being comprehensive and interactive. We mine millions of biography pages from Wikipedia and tackle the generalization problem stemming from the variety and heterogeneity of the trajectory descriptions. Our ensemble model COSMOS, which combines the idea of semi-supervised learning and contrastive learning, achieves an F1 score of 85.95%. For this task, we also create a hand-curated dataset, WikiLifeTrajectory, consisting of 8,852 (person, time, location) triplets as ground truth. Besides, we perform an empirical analysis on the trajectories of 8,272 historians to demonstrate the validity of the extracted results. To facilitate the research on trajectory extractions and help the analytical studies to construct grand narratives, we make our code, the million-level extracted trajectories, and the WikiLifeTrajectory dataset publicly available.</description>

      <title>A Mechanism for Optimizing Media Recommender Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A mechanism is described that addresses the fundamental trade off between media producers who want to increase reach and consumers who provide attention based on the rate of utility received, and where overreach negatively impacts that rate. An optimal solution can be achieved when the media source considers the impact of overreach in a cost function used in determining the optimal distribution of content to maximize individual consumer utility and participation. The result is a Nash equilibrium between producer and consumer that is also Pareto efficient. Comparison with the literature on Recommender systems highlights the advantages of the mechanism, including identifying an optimal content volume for the consumer and improvements for optimizing with multiple objectives. A practical algorithm for generating the optimal distribution for each consumer is provided.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Entity-Level Hallucination in Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized how users access information, shifting from traditional search engines to direct question-and-answer interactions with LLMs. However, the widespread adoption of LLMs has revealed a significant challenge known as hallucination, wherein LLMs generate coherent yet factually inaccurate responses. This hallucination phenomenon has led to users' distrust in information retrieval systems based on LLMs. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes Dynamic Retrieval Augmentation based on hallucination Detection (DRAD) as a novel method to detect and mitigate hallucinations in LLMs. DRAD improves upon traditional retrieval augmentation by dynamically adapting the retrieval process based on real-time hallucination detection. It features two main components: Real-time Hallucination Detection (RHD) for identifying potential hallucinations without external models, and Self-correction based on External Knowledge (SEK) for correcting these errors using external knowledge. Experiment results show that DRAD demonstrates superior performance in both detecting and mitigating hallucinations in LLMs. All of our code and data are open-sourced at https://github.com/oneal2000/EntityHallucination.</description>
