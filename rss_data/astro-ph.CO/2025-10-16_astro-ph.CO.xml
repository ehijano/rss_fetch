      <title>Simulation budgeting for hybrid effective field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we forecast the number of, and requirements on, N-body simulations needed to train hybrid effective field theory (HEFT) emulators for a range of use cases, using a hybrid of HMcode and perturbation theory as a surrogate model. Our accuracy goals, determined with careful consideration of statistical and systematic uncertainties, are $1\%$ accurate in the high-likelihood range of cosmological parameters, and $2\%$ accurate over a broader parameter space volume for $k&lt;1 h Mpc^{-1}$ and $z&lt;3$. Focusing in part on the 8-parameter $w_0w_a$CDM+$m_\nu$ cosmological model, we find that $&lt;225$ simulations are required to meet our error goals over our wide parameter space, including models with rapidly evolving dark energy, given our simulation and emulator recommendations. For a more restricted parameter space volume, as few as 80 simulations are sufficient. We additionally present simulation forecasts for example use cases, and make the code used in our analyses publicly available. These results offer practical guidance for efficient emulator design and simulation budgeting in future cosmological analyses.</description>

      <title>Constraining Power of Wavelet vs. Power Spectrum Statistics for CMB Lensing and Weak Lensing with Learned Binning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present forecasts for constraints on the matter density ($\Omega_m$) and the amplitude of matter density fluctuations at 8h$^{-1}$Mpc ($\sigma_8$) from CMB lensing convergence maps and galaxy weak lensing convergence maps. For CMB lensing convergence auto statistics, we compare the angular power spectra ($C_\ell$'s) to the wavelet scattering transform (WST) coefficients. For CMB lensing convergence $\times$ galaxy weak lensing convergence statistics, we compare the cross angular power spectra to wavelet phase harmonics (WPH). This work also serves as the first application of WST and WPH to these probes. For CMB lensing convergence, we find that WST and $C_\ell$'s yield similar constraints in forecasts for the $\textit{Simons}$ Observatory and the South Pole Telescope. However, WST gives a tighter constraint on $\sigma_8$ by a factor of $1.7$ for $\textit{Planck}$ data. When CMB lensing convergence is crossed with galaxy weak lensing convergence projected from $\textit{Euclid}$ Data Release 2 (DR2), we find that WPH outperforms cross-$C_\ell$'s by factors between $2.4$ and $3.8$ for individual parameter constraints. To compare these different summary statistics we develop a novel learned binning approach. This method compresses summary statistics while maintaining interpretability. We find this leads to improved constraints compared to more naive binning schemes for $C_\ell$'s, WST, and most significantly WPH. By learning the binning and measuring constraints on distinct data sets, our method is robust to overfitting by construction.</description>

      <title>Probing Helium Reionization Through the $^{3}\mathrm{He}^{+}$ Hyperfine Transition Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the hyperfine transition of $^{3}\mathrm{He}^{+}$ as a promising probe of the IGM during the final stages of helium reionization. Utilising the most recent helium reionization simulation, we generate three-dimensional maps of the 3.5cm ($8.67$ GHz) differential brightness temperature and analyze its evolution. Our results show that the volume-averaged brightness temperature declines rapidly from $\sim 1 \mu$K at $z = 4$ to $\sim 2.5 \times 10^{-3} \mu$K by $z = 2.3$, tracing the HeII to HeIII transition driven by quasars. The power spectrum of the 3.5cm signal exhibits a scale-dependent evolution, peaking on small scales and declining as reionization progresses. We explore the cross-correlation of the 3.5cm transition line with the distribution of AGNs, which shows a transition from positive to negative correlation as ionized regions grow. We also examine the 3.5cm forest and demonstrate that absorption features persist down to $z \sim 2.90$, even when more than $85\%$ of HeII is ionized. Although current observational upper limits lie several orders of magnitude above theoretical predictions, future radio arrays such as $\mathrm{SKA-mid}$ offer promising prospects. Overall, this study highlights the $^{3}\mathrm{He}^{+}$ hyperfine transition as a sensitive tracer of the thermal and ionization history of the IGM during helium reionization.</description>

      <title>Towards field-level likelihood for projected fields: Evolved projected fields from initial projected fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolved cosmological matter density field is fully determined by the initial matter density field at fixed cosmological parameters. However, the two-dimensional cosmological projected matter density field, relevant for weak-lensing and photometric galaxy studies, is fully determined by the initial projected matter density field only at the linear order. At non-linear order, the entire volume of initial matter contributes. We study a model for the evolved projected density field that is deterministic in the initial projected density fields and probabilistic in the effects of the remaining modes in the initial conditions. We write down predictions for the mean evolved projected field model using Lagrangian perturbation theory. We run a suite of small N-body simulations with fixed projected initial conditions and measure the statistical properties of the ensemble of evolved projected fields. Measurements and theory are in good agreement and show that the information on the initial projected fields is exponentially suppresses on non-linear scales. Our model offers a potential approach to a field-level likelihood of projected fields.</description>

      <title>Probing cosmic velocities with the pairwise kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich signal in DESI Bright Galaxy Sample DR1 and ACT DR6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a measurement of the pairwise kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) signal using the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Bright Galaxy Sample (BGS) Data Release 1 (DR1) galaxy sample overlapping with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) CMB temperature map. Our analysis makes use of $1.6$ million galaxies with stellar masses $\log M_\star/M_\odot &gt; 10$, and we explore measurements across a range of aperture sizes ($2.1' &lt; \theta_{\rm ap} &lt; 3.5'$) and stellar mass selections. This statistic directly probes the velocity field of the large-scale structure, a unique observable of cosmic dynamics and modified gravity. In particular, at low redshifts, this quantity is especially interesting, as deviations from General Relativity are expected to be largest. Notably, our result represents the highest-significance low-redshift ($z \sim 0.3$) detection of the kSZ pairwise effect yet. In our most optimal configuration ($\theta_{\rm ap} = 3.3'$, $\log M_\star &gt; 11$), we achieve a $5\sigma$ detection. Assuming that an estimate of the optical depth and galaxy bias of the sample exists via e.g., external observables, this measurement constrains the fundamental cosmological combination $H_0 f \sigma_8^2$. A key challenge is the degeneracy with the galaxy optical depth. We address this by combining CMB lensing, which allows us to infer the halo mass and galaxy population properties, with hydrodynamical simulation estimates of the mean optical depth, $\bar \tau$. We stress that this is a proof-of-concept analysis; with BGS DR2 data we expect to improve the statistical precision by roughly a factor of two, paving the way toward robust tests of modified gravity with kSZ-informed velocity-field measurements at low redshift.</description>

      <title>Evidence for the dynamical dark energy with evolving Hubble constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hubble constant tension, together with the recent indications of dynamical dark energy proposed from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, poses significant challenges to the standard cosmological model. In this work, we perform a model-independent reconstruction of the dark-energy equation of state $w(z)$, jointly with an evolving Hubble constant $H_0(z)$. Using the DESI DR2 data combined with multiple type Ia supernova samples, we find that $w(z)$ varies with redshift and exhibits two potential phantom crossings at $z\sim0.5$ and $z\sim1.5$. Meanwhile, $H_0$ decreases continually from local to high redshift, alleviating the Hubble constant tension effectively. The joint $w(z)$-$H_0(z)$ model is strongly favored over the $w$CDM ($\Lambda$CDM) framework, with a logarithmic Bayes factor $\ln \boldsymbol{\mathcal B}= 5.04~(8.53)$. Across various prior assumptions and dataset combinations, we obtain consistent, data-driven reconstructions of both $w(z)$ and $H_0(z)$. Future BAO measurements from Euclid and next-generation CMB experiments will provide critical tests of these results and bring deeper insights into the nature of dark energy and the evolution of cosmic expansion.</description>

      <title>Built-in precision: Improving cluster cosmology through the self-calibration of a galaxy cluster sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the potential improvements in constraints on the dark energy equation of state parameter $w$ and matter density $\Omega_M$ from using clustering information along with number counts for future samples of thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich selected galaxy clusters. We quantify the relative improvement from including the clustering power spectrum information for three cluster sample sizes from 33,000 to 140,000 clusters and for three assumed priors on the mass slope and redshift evolution of the mass-observable relation. As expected, clustering information has the largest impact when (i) there are more clusters and (ii) the mass-observable priors are weaker. For current knowledge of the cluster mass-observable relationship, we find the addition of clustering information reduces the uncertainty on the dark energy equation of state, $\sigma(w)$, by factors of $1.023\pm 0.007$ to $1.0790\pm 0.011$, with larger improvements observed with more clusters. Clustering information is more important for the matter density, with $\sigma(\Omega_M)$ reduced by factors of $1.068 \pm 007$ to $1.145 \pm 0.012$. The improvement in $w$ constraints from adding clustering information largely vanishes after tightening priors on the mass-observable relationship by a factor of two. For weaker priors, we find clustering information improves the determination of the cluster mass slope and redshift evolution by factors of $1.389 \pm 0.041$ and $1.340 \pm 0.039$ respectively. These findings highlight that, with the anticipated surge in cluster detections from next generation surveys, self-calibration through clustering information will provide an independent cross-check on the mass slope and redshift evolution of the mass-observable relationship as well as enhancing the precision achievable from cluster cosmology.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Subhalo Mass Functions in Simulations from Galaxy Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing provides a powerful tool to directly infer the dark matter (DM) subhalo mass function (SHMF) in lens galaxies. However, comparing observationally inferred SHMFs to theoretical predictions remains challenging, as the predicted SHMF can vary significantly between galaxies - even within the same cosmological model - due to differences in the properties and environment of individual galaxies. We present a machine learning framework to infer the galaxy-specific predicted SHMF from galaxy images, conditioned on the assumed inverse warm DM particle mass $M^{-1}_{\rm DM}$. To train the model, we use 1024 high-resolution hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations from the DREAMS suite. Mock observations are generated using Synthesizer, excluding gas particle contributions, and SHMFs are computed with the Rockstar halo finder. Our neural network takes as input both the galaxy images and the inverse DM mass. This method enables scalable, image-based predictions for the theoretical DM SHMFs of individual galaxies, facilitating direct comparisons with observational measurements.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical uncertainties challenge 21-cm forecasts: A primordial black hole case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 21-cm signal is a powerful probe of the early Universe's thermal history and could provide a unique avenue for constraining exotic physics. Previous studies have forecasted stringent constraints on energy injections from exotic sources that heat, excite, and ionize the background gas and thereby modify the 21-cm signal. In this work, we quantify the substantial impact that astrophysical uncertainties have on the projected sensitivity to exotic energy injection. In particular, there are significant uncertainties in the minimum star-forming dark matter halo mass, the Lyman-$\alpha$ emission, and the X-ray emission, whose values characterize the fiducial astrophysical model when projecting bounds. As a case study, we investigate the energy injection of accreting primordial black holes of mass $\sim 1~M_\odot-10^3~M_\odot$, also taking into account uncertainties in the accretion model. We show that, depending on the chosen fiducial model and accretion uncertainties, the sensitivity of future 21-cm data could constrain the abundance of primordial black holes to be either slightly stronger, or significantly weaker, than current limits from the Cosmic Microwave Background.</description>

      <title>Modeling nonlinear scales for dynamical dark energy cosmologies with COLA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Upcoming galaxy surveys will bring a wealth of information about the clustering of matter, but modeling small-scale structure beyond $\Lambda$CDM remains computationally challenging. While accurate $N$-body emulators exist to model the matter power spectrum for $\Lambda$CDM and some limited extensions, it's unfeasible to generate $N$-body simulation suites for all candidate models. Motivated by recent hints of an evolving dark energy equation of state, we assess the viability of employing the COmoving Lagrangian Acceleration (COLA) method to generate simulation suites for the $w_0w_a$ dark energy model. We combine COLA simulations with an existing high-precision $\Lambda$CDM emulator to extend its predictions into new regions of parameter space. We assess the precision of our emulator at the level of the matter power spectrum, finding that our emulator can reproduce the nonlinear boosts from EuclidEmulator2 at less than $2\%$ error. Moreover, we perform an analysis of a simulated cosmic shear survey akin to the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) first year of observations, assessing the differences in parameter constraints between our COLA-based emulator and the benchmark emulator. We find our emulator to be in excellent agreement with the benchmark, achieving less than $0.3\sigma$ shifts in cosmological parameters. We compare our emulator's performance to a commonly used approach: assuming the $\Lambda$CDM boost can be employed for extended parameter spaces without modification. We find that our emulator yields a significantly smaller $\Delta\chi^2$ distribution, parameter constraint biases, and a more accurate figure of merit compared to this second approach. Our results demonstrate that COLA emulators provide a computationally efficient path forward for modeling nonlinear structure in extended cosmologies, offering a practical alternative to full $N$-body suites.</description>

      <title>Non-Minimally Coupled Quintessence in Light of DESI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a model of quintessence governed by an exponential potential and non-minimally coupled to gravity, in light of recent datasets, including cosmic microwave background, baryon acoustic oscillations, and supernovae distance moduli observations. Mainly focusing on the Palatini formulation of gravity, a phase space analysis reveals the existence of a late-time stable de Sitter attractor as long as the non-minimal coupling constant is negative, regardless of the value of the slope of the exponential. Fitting to CMB+DESI+DESY5 data, we find strong evidence for our model over $\Lambda$CDM, with a Bayes factor $\log B = 5.52$. Furthermore, the data seem to prefer dynamical dark energy at $&gt;3\sigma$ C.L. and a phantom crossing in the barotropic parameter of dark energy at $2-3\sigma$ C.L.. We find that the scalar field dynamics in the Palatini formalism provides marginally better agreement to the data compared to the metric formalism.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Subhalos and Higher Order Catastrophes in Gravitational Wave Lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing is an invaluable probe of the nature of dark matter, and the structures it forms. Lensed gravitational waves in particular allow for unparalleled sensitivity to small scale structures within the lenses, due to the precise time resolution in combination with the continuous monitoring of the entire sky. In this work, we show two distinct ways of using strongly lensed gravitational waves to identify the presence of dark matter subhalos: \emph{{i)}} through higher order caustics generating high relative magnification ($\mu_r &gt; 2$), short time delay image pairs that break the caustic universality relations of single dark matter halos, which occur for $\sim 1-10$ percent of strongly lensed events in our cold dark matter models, and \emph{ii)} through the presence of more than three highly magnified images, which occur for $\sim 0.01-1$ percent of the same simulated events. We find that these results are highly sensitive to the concentrations of subhalos in our simulations, and more mildly to their number densities. The presence of low-mass subhalos increases the probability of observing wave-optics lensing in lensed gravitational waves, which is studied by solving the diffraction integral with the stationary phase approximation, as well as numerically. We also report distinct quantitative and qualitative differences in the distributions of relative magnifications and time delays for subhalo populations with increased number densities or concentrations. With the upcoming detection of strongly lensed events by ground- and space- based detectors, comparisons against these simulated distributions will provide insight into the nature of dark matter.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supernova (SN) and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) distance measures have recently provided hints that the dark energy is not only dynamical but apparently evolves from normal to phantom dark energy between redshifts $0&lt;z&lt;1$. A normal axion dark energy component in the mass range just below the Hubble scale can mimic a phantom component by appearing as dark energy at $z=1$ and dark matter at $z=0$, raising the possibility of a phantom mirage. We show that there is a wide range of axion dark energy contributions that can resolve the SN-BAO tension as well as thawing quintessence does, leaving BAO tension with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) for the distance measures from $z\sim 1$ to recombination to be resolved at high redshifts. With axions, raising the optical depth to reionization to $\tau \approx 0.1$ works essentially as well as $w_0-w_a$ phantom dark energy for all but the lowE CMB data, with a remaining $\Delta\chi^2\sim -16$ compared with $\Lambda$CDM, whereas a small spatial curvature of $\Omega_K \sim 0.003$ can largely relax the full SN-BAO-CMB tension with a total $\Delta\chi^2 \sim -12$.</description>

      <title>Cross-correlation of Luminous Red Galaxies with ML-selected AGN in HSC-SSP III: HOD Parameters for Type I and Type II Quasars</title>

Abstract: Understanding the dark matter (DM) halo environment in which galaxies that host active galactic nuclei (AGN) reside is a window into the nature of supermassive black hole (SMBH) accretion. We apply halo occupation distribution (HOD) modeling tools to interpret the angular cross-correlation functions between $1.5\times10^6$ luminous red galaxies (LRGs) and our $\sim28,500$ Hyper Suprime-Cam + Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer-selected (and $L_{6 \mu m}$-limited) AGN to infer the halo properties of distinct quasar samples at physical scales $s&gt;0.1\,{\rm Mpc}$, for $z\in0.7-1.0$. We find that Type I (unobscured) and Type II (obscured) AGN cluster differently, both on small and large physical scales. The derived HODs imply that Type I AGN reside, on average, in substantially ($\sim3\times$) more massive halos ($M_h \sim 10^{13.4} M_\odot$) than Type II AGN ($M_h \sim 10^{12.9} M_\odot$) at $&gt;5\sigma$ significance. While Type II AGN show one-halo correlations similar to that of galaxies of their average halo mass, the Type I AGN intra-halo clustering signal is significantly shallower. We interpret this observation with HOD methods and find Type I AGN are significantly less likely ($f_{sat}\sim0.05^{+1}_{-0.05}\%$) to be found in satellite galaxies than Type II AGN. We find reddened + obscured AGN to have typical satellite fractions for their inferred average halo mass ($\sim10^{13} M_\odot$), with $f_{sat} \sim 20^{+10}_{-5}\%$. Taken together, these results pose a significant challenge to the strict unified AGN morphological model, and instead suggest that a quasar's spectral class is strongly correlated with its host galaxy's dark matter halo environment. These intriguing results have provided a more complex picture of the SMBH -- DM halo connection, and motivate future analyses of the intrinsic galaxy and accretion properties of AGN.</description>

      <title>Probing Quadratically Coupled Ultralight Dark Matter with Pulsar Timing Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultralight dark matter may couple quadratically to Standard Model particles. Such quadratic interactions give rise to both coherent and stochastic signals in pulsar timing array (PTA) observations. In this work, we characterize these signals, including the effects of dark matter propagation in a finite-density medium, and assess the sensitivity of current and upcoming PTA observations to their detection. For coherent signals, we find that the sensitivity of current PTA observations competes with and sometimes exceeds that of other probes, such as equivalence principle tests and atomic clocks. For stochastic signals, we find that PTA sensitivities underperform equivalence principle constraints for both existing and upcoming PTA data sets.</description>

      <title>No cosmological constraints on dark photon dark matter from resonant conversion: Impact of nonlinear plasma dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit and invalidate all dark photon dark matter constraints from resonant conversion of dark photons into photons (plasmons) in the early universe. These constraints rely on the resonant transfer of a substantial portion of the dark photon energy density into the SM plasma, heating the plasma in the process. We demonstrate that this resonant transfer saturates because of plasma nonlinearities. Dark photon dark matter resonantly converts into $k \simeq 0$ Langmuir waves in the early universe electron-ion plasma. Once the Langmuir-wave energy approaches the thermal energy of the plasma, nonlinear effects driven by the ponderomotive force become significant. In particular, we show using dedicated Particle-in-Cell simulations that large-amplitude $k = 0$ Langmuir waves excite higher-k Langmuir and ion acoustic waves, producing strong spatial variations in density and plasma frequency. These inhomogeneities suppress further resonant conversion, limiting the deposited energy to about the thermal energy of the electrons at the time of conversion, orders of magnitude below observable cosmological thresholds. Consequently, the dark photon dark matter constraints are weaker by factors of $3000$ to $10^7$ across ten orders of magnitude in dark photon mass.</description>

      <title>Resonant Loop Interferometers for High-Frequency Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves at kilohertz and higher frequencies offer a unique probe of the early Universe at temperatures well beyond the reach of the cosmic microwave background, corresponding to energy scales $\gtrsim 10^9$ GeV. Existing detector concepts fall many orders of magnitude short of the big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) bound on the stochastic background in this regime. We propose a new interferometric architecture based on closed optical loops, in which the gravitational-wave-induced phase shift accumulates coherently over many traversals. This produces sharp, narrowband resonances whose predictable comb structure provides a distinct experimental signature. For square or triangular loops with parameters compatible with the Einstein Telescope infrastructure, and finesse values of order 500, we project sensitivity that approaches and even surpasses the BBN bound up to tens of kilohertz after one year of integration. Such loop interferometers thus open a realistic and distinctive path toward exploring high-frequency stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Dynamic SBI: Round-free Sequential Simulation-Based Inference with Adaptive Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) is emerging as a new statistical paradigm for addressing complex scientific inference problems. By leveraging the representational power of deep neural networks, SBI can extract the most informative simulation features for the parameters of interest. Sequential SBI methods extend this approach by iteratively steering the simulation process towards the most relevant regions of parameter space. This is typically implemented through an algorithmic structure, in which simulation and network training alternate over multiple rounds. This strategy is particularly well suited for high-precision inference in high-dimensional settings, which are commonplace in physics applications with growing data volumes and increasing model fidelity. Here, we introduce dynamic SBI, which implements the core ideas of sequential methods in a round-free, asynchronous, and highly parallelisable manner. At its core is an adaptive dataset that is iteratively transformed during inference to resemble the target observation. Simulation and training proceed in parallel: trained networks are used both to filter out simulations incompatible with the data and to propose new, more promising ones. Compared to round-based sequential methods, this asynchronous structure can significantly reduce simulation costs and training overhead. We demonstrate that dynamic SBI achieves significant improvements in simulation and training efficiency while maintaining inference performance. We further validate our framework on two challenging astrophysical inference tasks: characterising the stochastic gravitational wave background and analysing strong gravitational lensing systems. Overall, this work presents a flexible and efficient new paradigm for sequential SBI.</description>

      <title>Quantum Damping of Cosmological Shear: A New Prediction from Loop Quantum Cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the dynamics of the Bianchi I universe in modified loop quantum cosmology (Model I, or mLQC-I), uncovering a robust mechanism for isotropization. As in the standard LQC, the classical singularities are resolved by quantum bounce. Remarkably, mLQC-I exhibits a distinctive feature: following the bounce, the shear is dynamically suppressed and decays rapidly to zero within the deep quantum regime. This occurs independently of the collapsing matter fields, leading to a natural quantum isotropization. Consequently, the three spatial directions expand rapidly to macroscopic scales, producing a homogeneous and isotropic universe directly from the quantum epoch without fine-tuning. Our findings demonstrate that mLQC-I not only resolves singularities but also provides a more effective pathway for suppressing anisotropies than other models, thereby reinforcing its viability as a description of the early universe.</description>

Abstract: The South Pole Telescope Shirokoff Line Intensity Mapper (SPT-SLIM) is a millimeter-wavelength line-intensity mapping experiment, which was deployed on the South Pole Telescope (SPT) during the 2024-2025 Austral summer season. This pathfinder experiment serves to demonstrate the on-sky operation of multi-pixel on-chip spectrometer technology. We report on the cryogenic performance of the SPT-SLIM receiver for the first year of commissioning observations. The SPT-SLIM receiver utilizes an Adiabatic Demagnetization Refrigerator (ADR) for cooling the focal plane of superconducting filterbank spectrometers to a temperature of 150 mK. We demonstrate stable thermal performance of the focal plane module during observations consistent with thermal modeling, enabling a cryogenic operating efficiency above 80%. We also report on the receiver control system design utilizing the Observatory Control System (OCS) platform for automated cryogenic operation on the SPT.</description>

Abstract: We present the methodology and results of the on-sky responsivity calibration of the South Pole Telescope Shirokoff Line Intensity Mapper (SPT-SLIM). SPT-SLIM is a pathfinder line intensity mapping experiment utilizing the on-chip spectrometer technology, and was first deployed during the 2024-2025 Austral Summer season on the South Pole Telescope. During the two-week on-sky operation of SPT-SLIM, we performed periodic measurements of the detector response as a function of the telescope elevation angle. Combining these data with atmospheric opacity measurements from an on-site atmospheric tipping radiometer, simulated South Pole atmospheric spectra, and measured detector spectral responses, we construct estimates for the responsivity of SPT-SLIM detectors to sky loading. We then use this model to calibrate observations of the moon taken by SPT-SLIM, cross-checking the result against the known brightness temperature of the Moon as a function of its phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a unified model of dark energy and inflation through the Markov-Mukhanov modification of the Einstein-Hilbert action, where the matter sector is coupled to gravity via a scalar coupling function depending only on the energy density of the matter content. We assume that the coupling function encodes the UV corrections to the standard model of cosmology and we determine the form of the coupling that allows for the dark energy component to be dynamical and act as the inflaton field in the early universe. Interestingly we show that our model, in order to account for inflation, prefers a dark energy equation of state with $w$ close but not equal to $-1$ in agreement with the latest DESI data.</description>

      <title>Exploring a cosmic ray inverse-Compton origin to the SZ-to-X-ray pressure deficit in the cool core cluster ZwCl 3146</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility that inverse-Compton (IC) scattering of cosmic microwave background photons by $\sim$GeV cosmic rays (CRs) injected by the central active galactic nucleus (AGN) in cool core (CC) clusters produces a non-negligible continuum-like X-ray signal that is easily misinterpreted as intracluster medium (ICM) thermal bremsstrahlung continuum. This is particularly relevant to the cooling flow problem--the lack of star formation relative to X-ray-inferred ICM cooling rates. Using ZwCl 3146, a relaxed CC system at $z = 0.291$, we compare pressure profiles derived via X-rays and the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect. While SZ measurements probe only thermal ICM electrons, additional CR-IC emission would appear to boost the X-ray-inferred pressure. Relative to unity, we measure a $\simeq30\%$ decrement in $P_{SZ}/P_X$ within 100 kpc of the ZwCl 3146 center at a statistical significance of $\simeq 3.3\sigma$, consistent with predicted deficits from CR-IC contamination in reasonable models of central AGN-driven CR injection. X-ray spectral fits of a two-component model with thermal ICM and CR-IC emission are consistent with CR-IC as the cause of this deficit. We test alternative explanations and systematics that could drive such a decrement, with the leading order systematics associated with halo triaxiality. Collectively, these systematics are unlikely to produce a $P_{SZ}/P_X$ decrement $\gtrsim10\%$. While our results establish that non-negligible CR-IC emission is plausible in ZwCl 3146, we stress that more detailed studies of larger cluster samples are required to robustly assess whether CR-IC is relevant to the cooling flow problem.</description>

      <title>Asking Fast Radio Bursts for More than Reionization History</title>

Abstract: We propose different estimators to probe the intergalactic medium (IGM) during epoch of reionization (EoR) using the dispersion measure (${\rm DM}$) of the fast radio bursts. We consider three different reionization histories, which we can distinguish with a total of $\lesssim 1000\,{\rm DM}$ measurements during EoR if their redshifts are known. We note that the redshift derivatives of ${\rm DM}$ are also directly sensitive to the reionization history. The major point of this work is to explore the variance in the ${\rm DM}$ measurements and the information encoded in them. We find that the all-sky average $\overline{{\rm DM}}(z)$ gets biased from the line-of-sight (LoS) fluctuations in the ${\rm DM}$ measurements introduced by the ionization of IGM during EoR. We find that the ratio $\sigma_{\rm DM}/\overline{{\rm DM}}$ depends directly on the ionization bubble sizes as well as the reionization history. On the other hand, we also find that angular variance (coined as $\textit{structure function}$) of ${\rm DM}$ encodes the information about the duration of reionization and the typical bubble sizes as well. We establish the usefulness of variances in ${\rm DM}$ using toy models of reionization and later verify it with the realistic reionization simulations.</description>

      <title>Effects of Galaxy Cluster Structure on Lensed Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lenses come in many forms, but are typically divided into two populations: galaxies, and groups and clusters of galaxies. The largest objects in the Universe (i.e. galaxy clusters) are highly irregular and composed of many components due to a history of (or active) hierarchical mergers. In this work, we analyze the discrepancies in the observables of strongly lensed gravitational wave transients in both scenarios, namely relative magnifications, time delays, and image multiplicities. We compare the detection rates between the single spherical dark matter halo models found in the literature, and publicly available state-of-the-art cluster lens models. We find there to be approximately an order of magnitude fewer detection of strongly lensed transients in the realistic model case, likely caused by their loss of overall strong lensing optical depth. We also report detection rates in the weak lensing or single-image regime. Additionally, we find a systemic shift towards lower time delays between the brightest image pairs in the cases of the realistic models, as well as higher fractions of positive versus negative parity images, which was previously reported in the literature. This deviation in the joint relative magnification factor-time delay distribution will hinder the feasibility of the reconstruction of cluster-scale lenses through gravitational wave transients alone, but can still provide a lower limit on the lens mass.</description>

Abstract: The Largest Cluster Statistics\,(LCS) analysis of the redshifted 21\,cm maps has been demonstrated to be an efficient and robust method for following the time evolution of the largest ionized regions\,(LIRs) during the Epoch of Reionization\,(EoR). The LCS can, in principle, constrain the reionization model and history by quantifying the morphology of neutral hydrogen\,(\HI) distribution during the different stages of the EoR. Specifically, the percolation transition of ionized regions, quantified and constrained via LCS, provides a crucial insight about the underlying reionization model. The previous LCS analysis of EoR 21\,cm maps demonstrates that the convolution of the synthesized beam of the radio interferometric arrays, e.g. SKA1-Low with the target signal, shifts the apparent percolation transition of ionized regions towards the lower redshifts. In this study, we present an optimal thresholding strategy to reduce this bias in the recovered percolation transition. We assess the robustness of LCS analysis of the 21\,cm maps, considering the effects of antenna-based gain calibration errors and instrumental noise for SKA1-Low. This analysis is performed using synthetic observations simulated by the \textsc{21cmE2E} pipeline, considering SKA1-Low AA4 configuration within a radius of 2\,km from the array centre. Our findings suggest that a minimum of $2000$\,hours of observation (SNR $\gtrapprox 3$) are required for the LCS analysis to credibly suppress the confusion introduced by thermal noise. Further, we also demonstrate that for a maximum antenna-based calibration error tolerance of $\sim 0.02\%$ (post calibration), the reionization history can be recovered in a robust and relatively unbiased manner using the LCS.</description>

      <title>Multi-copy Axion Transfer Function and Observational Implications of Effective de Broglie Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-light axions are well-motivated dark matter candidates predicted by the String Axiverse, offering potential solutions to the small-scale challenges faced by conventional heavy particle CDM. In this work, we explore the generic multi-axion scenario motivated in the String Axiverse context and investigate its astronomical implications in both the linear and nonlinear regimes. In the linear regime, we provide a simplified prescription for multi-copy axion transfer functions, and introduce the notion of effective mass ($m_{eff}^{-2}=\sum_i w_i m_i^{-2}$ with $\{ w_i\}$ being fractional contributions of different copies to cosmic matter density) that governs the suppression to Large Scale Structure (LSS), including the turnover scale of the galaxy luminosity function (LF). On galactic scales, individual copies decouple from the collective behavior seen for LSS, leading to different galaxy groups each dominated by different copies (Pozo et al. 2025). This explains the preference for $\sim 10^{-22}$eV axions from local, galactic scale observation despite stringent mass constraints set by existing UV LF turnover searches. In the non-linear regime within galaxy halos, we show that similar notion of effective masses or de Broglie scales govern the collective wave interference, influencing the net stellar heating rates and the substructure-induced spread of JWST transients near critical curves. Distinctive to the multi-copy scenario, the effective mass within galaxy halos is generically anticipated to be radially decreasing following the stronger concentration of heavier copies to the galactic center. Such a spatial variation leads to radially increasing spreading scales for micro-lensed transients at different radial positions, a signature that may be tested with future JWST lensing observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the next few years, the upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will be gathering data for the High Latitude Time Domain Survey (HLTDS) that will be used to significantly improve the Type Ia supernova measurement of the dark energy equation of state parameters w0 and wa. Here we generate a catalog-level simulation of the in-guide strategy recommended by the HLTDS definition committee, and determine dark energy parameter constraints using a detailed analysis that includes light curve fitting, photometric redshifts and classification, BEAMS formalism, systematic uncertainties, and cosmology fitting. After analysis and selection requirements, the sample includes 10,000 Roman SNe Ia that we combine with 4,400 events from LSST. The resulting dark energy figure of merit is well above the NASA mission requirement of 326, with the caveat that SN Ia model training systematics have not been included.</description>

      <title>Does DESI DR2 challenge $\Lambda$CDM paradigm ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21607v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although debate on DESI DR1 systematics remains, DESI DR2 is consistent with DR1 and strengthens its trends. In our analysis, the LRG1 point at $z_{\mathrm{eff}}=0.510$ and the LRG3+ELG1 point at $z_{\mathrm{eff}}=0.934$ are in tension with the $\Lambda$CDM-anchored $\Omega_m$ inferred from Planck and SNe Ia (Pantheon$^{+}$, Union3, DES-SN5YR): for LRG1 the tensions are $2.42\sigma$, $1.91\sigma$, $2.19\sigma$, and $2.99\sigma$; for LRG3+ELG1 they are $2.60\sigma$, $2.24\sigma$, $2.51\sigma$, and $2.96\sigma$. Across redshift bins DR2 shows improved agreement relative to DR1, with the $\Omega_m$ tension dropping from $2.20\sigma$ to $1.84\sigma$. Nevertheless, DR2 alone is not decisive against $\Lambda$CDM, and the apparent deviation is driven mainly by LRG1 and LRG2. In a $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM fit using all tracers we find a posterior mean with $w_0&gt;-1$, consistent with dynamical dark energy and nominally challenging $\Lambda$CDM. Removing LRG1 and/or LRG2 restores $\Lambda$CDM concordance ($\omega_0\to-1$); moreover, $\omega_0^{\mathrm{(LRG2)}}&gt;w_0^{\mathrm{(LRG1)}}$, indicating that LRG2 drives the trend more strongly. Model selection via the natural-log Bayes factor $\ln\mathrm{BF}\equiv\ln(Z_{\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}}/Z_{\omega_0\omega_a\mathrm{CDM}})$ yields weak evidence for $\Lambda$CDM when LRG1, LRG2, or both are removed, and is inconclusive for the full sample. Hence the data do not require the extra $\omega_a$ freedom, and the apparent $\omega_0&gt;-1$ preference should be interpreted cautiously as a reflection of the $\omega_0$$\omega_a$ degeneracy with limited per-tracer information.</description>

      <title>Excursion Set Approach to Primordial Black Holes: Cloud-in-Cloud and Mass Function Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The abundance and mass function of primordial black holes (PBHs) are often estimated using the Press-Schechter (PS) formalism. In the case of halo formation, the PS formalism suffers from the miscounting of regions collapsing into halos, known as the cloud-in-cloud problem, which is usually corrected by introducing a multiplicative `fudge factor 2'. By analogy, this factor has sometimes been applied to PBH calculations, although its validity has remained unsettled. We reformulate the PS approach for PBHs (forming during radiation-dominated epoch) within the excursion-set framework, where the smoothed density contrast undergoes a stochastic random walk as the smoothing scale varies and collapse is identified with the first threshold crossing. While the halo case is described by a Markovian process, we show that the PBH case is non-Markovian, even when the sharp-k filter Window function is adopted. Decomposing the total collapse probability into two distinct components of the stochastic motion, we numerically confirm that their contributions are exactly equal in the case of halo formation, justifying the fudge factor. For PBHs, however, we demonstrate that this equality no longer holds, and consistent inclusion of both contributions is essential to ensure a positive-definite mass function. Our results clarify the origin of the ambiguity surrounding the fudge factor and establish a robust theoretical foundation for PBH abundance calculations.</description>

      <title>Flavor solitons in dense neutrino gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a dense neutrino gas in the "fast-flavor limit" (vanishing neutrino masses). For the first time, we identify exact solutions of the nonlinear wave equation in the form of solitons. They can propagate with both sub- or superluminal speed, the latter not violating causality. The soliton with infinite speed is a homogeneous solution and coincides with the usual fast-flavor pendulum except that it swings only once instead of being periodic. The subluminal soliton in the static limit corresponds to a one-swing "spatial pendulum". A necessary condition for such solutions to exist is a ``crossed'' neutrino angle distribution. Based on the Nyquist criterion, we derive a new sufficient condition without solving the dispersion relation. The solitons are very fragile: they are as unstable as the homogeneous neutrino gas alone. Moreover, in the presence of matter, only the solution survives that is homogeneous in a frame comoving with the matter current. Generally, the matter effect cannot be eliminated by transformations in flavor space, but instead has a real physical impact.</description>

      <title>Learned harmonic mean estimation of the Bayesian evidence with normalizing flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05969v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the learned harmonic mean estimator with normalizing flows - a robust, scalable and flexible estimator of the Bayesian evidence for model comparison. Since the estimator is agnostic to sampling strategy and simply requires posterior samples, it can be applied to compute the evidence using any Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling technique, including saved down MCMC chains, or any variational inference approach. The learned harmonic mean estimator was recently introduced, where machine learning techniques were developed to learn a suitable internal importance sampling target distribution to solve the issue of exploding variance of the original harmonic mean estimator. In this article we present the use of normalizing flows as the internal machine learning technique within the learned harmonic mean estimator. Normalizing flows can be elegantly coupled with the learned harmonic mean to provide an approach that is more robust, flexible and scalable than the machine learning models considered previously. We perform a series of numerical experiments, applying our method to benchmark problems and to a cosmological example in up to 21 dimensions. We find the learned harmonic mean estimator is in agreement with ground truth values and nested sampling estimates. The open-source harmonic Python package implementing the learned harmonic mean, now with normalizing flows included, is publicly available.</description>

      <title>From kinetic gases to an exponentially expanding universe - The Finsler-Friedmann equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational field of a kinetic gas beyond its usual derivation from the second moment of the one-particle distribution function (1PDF), that serves as energy-momentum tensor in the Einstein equations. This standard procedure raises the question why the other moments of the 1PDF (which are needed to fully characterize the kinematical properties of the gas) do not contribute to the gravitational field and what could be their relevance in addressing the dark energy problem? Using the canonical coupling of the entire 1PDF to Finsler spacetime geometry via the Finsler gravity equation, we show that these higher moments contribute non-trivially. A Finslerian geometric description of our universe allows us to determine not only the scale factor but also of the causal structure dynamically. We find that already a Finslerian vacuum solution naturally permits an exponential expanding universe, without the need for a cosmological constant or any additional quantities. This solution possesses a causal structure which is a mild deformation of the causal structure of Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) geometry; close to the rest frame defined by cosmological time (i.e., for slowly moving objects), the causal structures of the two geometries are nearly indistinguishable.</description>

      <title>Prospects of detecting cosmic ray up-scattered dark matter with DUNE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detection of sub-GeV dark matter (DM) particles in direct detection experiments is inherently difficult, as their low kinetic energies in the galactic halo are insufficient to produce observable recoils of the heavy nuclei in the detectors. On the other hand, whenever DM particles interact with nucleons, they can be accelerated by scattering with galactic cosmic rays. These cosmic-ray-boosted DM particles can then interact not only through coherent elastic scattering with nuclei, but also through scattering with individual nucleons in the detectors and produce outgoing particles at MeV to GeV kinetic energies. The resulting signal spectrum overlaps with the detection capabilities of modern neutrino experiments. One future experiment is the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) at the Sanford Underground Research Facility. Our study shows that DUNE has a unique ability to search for cosmic-ray boosted DM with sensitivity comparable to dedicated direct detection experiments in the case of spin-independent interactions. Importantly, DUNE's sensitivity reaches similar values of DM-nucleon cross sections also in the case of spin-dependent interactions, offering a key advantage over traditional direct detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Cosmological scalar perturbations for a metric reconstructed from group field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While homogeneous cosmologies have long been studied in the group field theory (GFT) approach to quantum gravity, including a quantum description of cosmological perturbations is highly non-trivial. Here we apply a recent proposal for reconstructing an effective spacetime metric in GFT to the case of a metric with small inhomogeneities over a homogeneous background. We detail the procedure and give general expressions for cosmological scalar perturbations defined in terms of the GFT energy-momentum tensor. These include all the scalar components of standard perturbation theory and hence can be used to define gauge-invariant quantities. This is a major advantage of the effective metric approach compared to previous GFT studies limited to volume perturbations. We compute these perturbations explicitly for a particular Fock coherent state. While it was previously shown that such a state can be interpreted as an approximately flat homogeneous cosmology at late times, here we find that, in a very simple example, inhomogeneities do not follow the dynamics of general relativity in the semiclassical regime. More specifically, restricting ourselves to a specific coherent state in a simple (free) GFT, we study two types of perturbative GFT modes, squeezed and oscillating modes. For squeezed modes we find perturbation equations with Euclidean signature and a late-time limit that differs from general relativistic perturbation equations. Oscillating modes satisfy different dynamical equations that also differ from those of general relativity, but show a Lorentzian signature. Considering that our results were obtained within a number of simplifying assumptions [...], we discuss how going beyond these assumptions could lead to a more desirable phenomenology. Overall, our analysis should be understood as a first step in understanding cosmological perturbations within the effective GFT metric.</description>

      <title>Running scalar spectral index in warm natural inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23448v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The validity of inflation models is mainly evaluated according to the consistency of the predicted scalar spectral index $n_{\mathrm{s}}$, the tensor scalar ratio $r$, and the running scalar spectral index $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ with cosmic microwave background observations. In warm inflation (WI) scenarios, one can find exact analytical solutions for $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ in principle, but long expressions may be obtained. Previous studies for WI scenarios have only shown approximate analytical solutions or numerical results for $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$. In this study, we present a general analytical expression of $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ without approximation in WI. By providing an analytical expression, even if it is mathematically redundant, we believe that $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ will be studied across a broader range of WI models in the future. The obtained analytical expression of $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ is used in the study of warm natural inflation (WNI). Although $n_{\mathrm{s}}$ and $r$ have been previously investigated, $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ is omitted in previous studies on WNI. Our study of $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ completes previous phenomenological studies on WNI. In particular, the lower limit of the symmetry-breaking scale in WNI becomes more concrete in this study.</description>

      <title>The X-ray$-$UV Luminosity Relation of eROSITA Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-linear relation between the UV and X-ray luminosity in quasars has been studied for decades. However, as we lack a comprehensive model able to explain it, its investigation still relies on observational efforts. This work focuses on optically selected quasars detected by eROSITA. We present the properties of the sources collected in the eROSITA early data release (eFEDS) and those resulting from the first six months of eROSITA all-sky survey (eRASS1). We focus on the subset of quasars bright enough in the optical/UV band to avoid an ''Eddington bias'' towards X-ray brighter-than-average spectral energy distributions. The final samples include 1,248 and 519 sources for eFEDS and eRASS1, up to redshift $z\approx3$ and $z\approx1.5$, respectively. We found that the X-ray$-$UV luminosity relation shows no significant evolution with redshift, and its slope is in perfect agreement with previous compilations of quasar samples. The intrinsic dispersion of the relation is about 0.2 dex, which is small enough for possible cosmological applications. However, the limited redshift range and statistics of the current samples do not allow us to obtain significant cosmological constraints yet. We show how this is going to change with the future releases of the eROSITA data.</description>

      <title>LAP1-B is the First Observed System Consistent with Theoretical Predictions for Population III Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Nakajima et al. (2025) presented James Webb Space Telescope observations of the $z=6.6$ Population III (Pop III) candidate LAP1-B, which is gravitationally lensed by galaxy cluster MACS J0416. We argue that this is the first object to agree with three key theoretical predictions for Pop III stars: (1) formation in extremely low-metallicity halos with virial temperatures ranging from $T_{\rm vir}\sim 10^3-10^4~{\rm K}$, (2) a top-heavy initial mass function, and (3) formation of low-mass clusters with ${\sim}{\rm a ~few}\times 1000~M_\odot$ in massive Pop III stars. LAP1-B is consistent with recently formed Pop III stars hosted in a $\sim 5\times 10^7~M_\odot$ dark matter halo, some of which have enriched their surrounding gas either with supernovae or stellar winds. We use the semi-analytic model of Visbal et al. (2020) to predict the abundance of Pop III clusters observable at the high magnification provided by the foreground galaxy cluster MACS J0416. Using fiducial parameters unmodified from previous work, we expect about one observable Pop III galaxy similar to LAP1-B in the range $z=6-7$. At earlier times, the intrinsic abundance is higher, but Pop III systems would not have been detected because of their increased luminosity distance and lower mass dark matter halos, which would host fewer stars. Thus, we find that LAP1-B was found at the redshift theoretically expected, given current observable limits, despite the fact that most Pop III systems form much earlier.</description>

      <title>Higher-order gravity models: corrections up to cubic curvature invariants and inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a higher-order gravity model including all corrections up to mass dimension six. Starting from the Jordan frame, we derive the field equations and specialize to the FLRW background, where the dynamics take the form of a four-dimensional autonomous system. Focusing on the $R+R^{2}+RR_{\mu\nu}R^{\mu\nu}$ case, we obtain linearized equations in the parameter $\gamma_{0}$ and analyze the resulting phase space. The model exhibits the main desirable features of an inflationary regime, with a slow-roll attractor and a stable critical point corresponding to the end of inflation. Analytical expressions for the scalar spectral index $n_{s}$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ show that the model is consistent with Planck, BICEP/Keck, and BAO data if $|\gamma_{0}|\lesssim 10^{-3}$. Moreover, negative values of $\gamma_{0}$ restore compatibility with recent ACT, Planck, and DESI results, suggesting that higher-order corrections may be relevant in refining inflationary cosmology.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computing Tools for Fast Detection of Gravitational Waves in the Context of LISA Space Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12929v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The field of gravitational wave (GW) detection is progressing rapidly, with several next-generation observatories on the horizon, including LISA. GW data is challenging to analyze due to highly variable signals shaped by source properties and the presence of complex noise. These factors emphasize the need for robust, advanced analysis tools. In this context, we have initiated the development of a low-latency GW detection pipeline based on quantum neural networks (QNNs). Previously, we demonstrated that QNNs can recognize GWs simulated using post-Newtonian approximations in the Newtonian limit. We then extended this work using data from the LISA Consortium, training QNNs to distinguish between noisy GW signals and pure noise. Currently, we are evaluating performance on the Sangria LISA Data Challenge dataset and comparing it against classical methods. Our results show that QNNs can reliably distinguish GW signals embedded in noise, achieving classification accuracies above 98\%. Notably, our QNN identified 5 out of 6 mergers in the Sangria blind dataset. The remaining merger, characterized by the lowest amplitude, highlights an area for future improvement in model sensitivity. This can potentially be addressed using additional mock training datasets, which we are preparing, and by testing different QNN architectures and ansatzes.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Schwarzschild solutions in $f(R)$ gravity and their observable effects on the photon sphere of black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate asymptotic Schwarzschild exterior solutions in the context of modified gravity theories, specifically within the framework of $f(R)$ gravity, where the asymptotic behavior recovers the standard Schwarzschild solution of General Relativity. Unlike previous studies that rely mainly on analytical approximations, our approach combines asymptotic analysis with numerical integration of the underlying differential equations. Using these solutions, we analyze strong lensing effects to obtain the photon sphere radius and the corresponding capture parameter. Considering rings produced by total reflection, we define the photon sphere width as the difference between the first total reflection and the capture parameter; and study how it is modified in the $f(R)$ scenario. Our results show that the photon sphere width increases in the presence of $f(R)$-type modifications, indicating deviations from GR that could be observable in the strong-field regime.</description>
