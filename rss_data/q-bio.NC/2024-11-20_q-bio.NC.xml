      <title>Homogenized $\textit{C. elegans}$ Neural Activity and Connectivity Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12091v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is renewed interest in modeling and understanding the nervous system of the nematode $\textit{Caenorhabditis elegans}$ ($\textit{C. elegans}$). This is particularly interesting as this model system provides a path to bridge the gap between structure and function, from nervous system connectivity to physiology. However, the many existing physiology datasets, both recording and stimulation, as well as connectome datasets, are in distinct formats, requiring extra processing steps before modeling or other analysis can commence. Here we present a homogenized dataset of neural activity, including during stimulation, compiled from 11 neuroimaging experiments and from 10 connectome reconstructions. The physiology datasets, collected under varying experimental protocols, all measure neural activity via calcium fluorescence in labeled subsets of the worm's 300 neurons. Our preprocessing pipeline standardizes these datasets by consistently ordering labeled neurons and resampling traces to a common sampling frequency. The resulting dataset includes neural recordings from approximately 900 worms and 250 uniquely labeled neurons. The connectome datasets, collected from electron microscopy (EM) reconstructions, all contain the entire nervous system of the worm, preprocessed into a graph of connections across the neurons. Using our collection of datasets is facilitated through easy data sharing on HuggingFace. We believe that our joint dataset of physiology and connectivity will facilitate modeling, for example in terms of recurrent neural network or transformer architectures, making it easier to check how well models generalize across animals and labs.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Trait-State Model for Decoding Dyadic Social Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traits are patterns of brain signals and behaviors that are stable over time but differ across individuals, whereas states are phasic patterns that vary over time, are influenced by the environment, yet oscillate around the traits. The quality of a social interaction depends on the traits and states of the interacting agents. However, it remains unclear how to decipher both traits and states from the same set of brain signals. To explore the hidden neural traits and states in relation to the behavioral ones during social interactions, we developed a pipeline to extract latent dimensions of the brain from electroencephalogram (EEG) data collected during a team flow task. Our pipeline involved two stages of dimensionality reduction: first, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), followed by linear discriminant analysis (LDA). This pipeline resulted in an interpretable, seven-dimensional EEG latent space that revealed a trait-state hierarchical structure, with macro-segregation capturing neural traits and micro-segregation capturing neural states. Out of the seven latent dimensions, we found that three that significantly contributed to variations across individuals and task states. Using representational similarity analysis, we mapped the EEG latent space to a skill-cognition space, establishing a connection between hidden neural signatures and social interaction behaviors. Our method demonstrates the feasibility of representing both traits and states within a single model that correlates with changes in social behavior.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Fusion Analytics Framework for fMRI Connectivity: Self-Attention Mechanism and Latent Space Item-Response Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.01581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There have been several attempts to use deep learning based on brain fMRI signals to classify cognitive impairment diseases. However, deep learning is a hidden black box model that makes it difficult to interpret the process of classification. To address this issue, we propose a novel analytical framework that interprets the classification result from deep learning processes. We first derive the region of interest (ROI) functional connectivity network (FCN) by embedding functions based on their similar signal patterns. Then, using the self-attention equipped deep learning model, we classify diseases based on their FCN. Finally, in order to interpret the classification results, we employ a latent space item-response interaction network model to identify the significant functions that exhibit distinct connectivity patterns when compared to other diseases. The application of this proposed framework to the four types of cognitive impairment shows that our approach is valid for determining the significant ROI functions.</description>
