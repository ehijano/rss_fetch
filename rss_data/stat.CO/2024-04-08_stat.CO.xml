      <title>BARMPy: Bayesian Additive Regression Models Python Package</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We make Bayesian Additive Regression Networks (BARN) available as a Python package, \texttt{barmpy}, with documentation at \url{https://dvbuntu.github.io/barmpy/} for general machine learning practitioners. Our object-oriented design is compatible with SciKit-Learn, allowing usage of their tools like cross-validation. To ease learning to use \texttt{barmpy}, we produce a companion tutorial that expands on reference information in the documentation. Any interested user can \texttt{pip install barmpy} from the official PyPi repository. \texttt{barmpy} also serves as a baseline Python library for generic Bayesian Additive Regression Models.</description>

      <title>New methods for computing the generalized chi-square distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present several exact and approximate mathematical methods and open-source software to compute the cdf, pdf and inverse cdf of the generalized chi-square distribution, which appears in Bayesian classification problems. Some methods are geared for speed, while others are designed to be accurate far into the tails, using which we can also measure large values of the discriminability index $d'$ between multinormals. We compare the accuracy and speed of these methods against the best existing methods.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Training of Convex Regularizers using Maximum Likelihood Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised learning is a training approach in the situation where ground truth data is unavailable, such as inverse imaging problems. We present an unsupervised Bayesian training approach to learning convex neural network regularizers using a fixed noisy dataset, based on a dual Markov chain estimation method. Compared to classical supervised adversarial regularization methods, where there is access to both clean images as well as unlimited to noisy copies, we demonstrate close performance on natural image Gaussian deconvolution and Poisson denoising tasks.</description>

      <title>Fitting ARMA Time Series Models without Identification: A Proximal Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2002.06777v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fitting autoregressive moving average (ARMA) time series models requires model identification before parameter estimation. Model identification involves determining the order of the autoregressive and moving average components which is generally performed by inspection of the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions or other offline methods. In this work, we regularize the parameter estimation optimization problem with a non-smooth hierarchical sparsity-inducing penalty based on two path graphs that allow performing model identification and parameter estimation simultaneously. A proximal block coordinate descent algorithm is then proposed to solve the underlying optimization problem efficiently. The resulting model satisfies the required stationarity and invertibility conditions for ARMA models. Numerical results supporting the proposed method are also presented.</description>

      <title>A tool set for random number generation on GPUs in R</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.06604v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the R package clrng which leverages the gpuR package and is able to generate random numbers in parallel on a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) with the clRNG (OpenCL) library. Parallel processing with GPU's can speed up computationally intensive tasks, which when combined with R, it can largely improve R's downsides in terms of slow speed, memory usage and computation mode. clrng enables reproducible research by setting random initial seeds for streams on GPU and CPU, and can thus accelerate several types of statistical simulation and modelling. The random number generator in clrng guarantees independent parallel samples even when R is used interactively in an ad-hoc manner, with sessions being interrupted and restored. This package is portable and flexible, developers can use its random number generation kernel for various other purposes and applications.</description>

      <title>Multilevel Importance Sampling for Rare Events Associated With the McKean--Vlasov Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.03225v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work combines multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) with importance sampling to estimate rare-event quantities that can be expressed as the expectation of a Lipschitz observable of the solution to a broad class of McKean--Vlasov stochastic differential equations. We extend the double loop Monte Carlo (DLMC) estimator introduced in this context in (Ben Rached et al., 2023) to the multilevel setting. We formulate a novel multilevel DLMC estimator and perform a comprehensive cost-error analysis yielding new and improved complexity results. Crucially, we devise an antithetic sampler to estimate level differences guaranteeing reduced computational complexity for the multilevel DLMC estimator compared with the single-level DLMC estimator. To address rare events, we apply the importance sampling scheme, obtained via stochastic optimal control in (Ben Rached et al., 2023), over all levels of the multilevel DLMC estimator. Combining importance sampling and multilevel DLMC reduces computational complexity by one order and drastically reduces the associated constant compared to the single-level DLMC estimator without importance sampling. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed multilevel DLMC estimator on the Kuramoto model from statistical physics with Lipschitz observables, confirming the reduced complexity from $\mathcal{O}(\mathrm{TOL}_{\mathrm{r}}^{-4})$ for the single-level DLMC estimator to $\mathcal{O}(\mathrm{TOL}_{\mathrm{r}}^{-3})$ while providing a feasible estimate of rare-event quantities up to prescribed relative error tolerance $\mathrm{TOL}_{\mathrm{r}}$.</description>

      <title>Skewed Bernstein-von Mises theorem and skew-modal approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.03038v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian approximations are routinely employed in Bayesian statistics to ease inference when the target posterior is intractable. Although these approximations are asymptotically justified by Bernstein-von Mises type results, in practice the expected Gaussian behavior may poorly represent the shape of the posterior, thus affecting approximation accuracy. Motivated by these considerations, we derive an improved class of closed-form approximations of posterior distributions which arise from a new treatment of a third-order version of the Laplace method yielding approximations in a tractable family of skew-symmetric distributions. Under general assumptions which account for misspecified models and non-i.i.d. settings, this family of approximations is shown to have a total variation distance from the target posterior whose rate of convergence improves by at least one order of magnitude the one established by the classical Bernstein-von Mises theorem. Specializing this result to the case of regular parametric models shows that the same improvement in approximation accuracy can be also derived for polynomially bounded posterior functionals. Unlike other higher-order approximations, our results prove that it is possible to derive closed-form and valid densities which are expected to provide, in practice, a more accurate, yet similarly-tractable, alternative to Gaussian approximations of the target posterior, while inheriting its limiting frequentist properties. We strengthen such arguments by developing a practical skew-modal approximation for both joint and marginal posteriors that achieves the same theoretical guarantees of its theoretical counterpart by replacing the unknown model parameters with the corresponding MAP estimate. Empirical studies confirm that our theoretical results closely match the remarkable performance observed in practice, even in finite, possibly small, sample regimes.</description>

      <title>Electron-Tunnelling-Noise Programmable Random Variate Accelerator for Monte Carlo Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16421v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article presents an electron tunneling noise programmable random variate accelerator for accelerating the sampling stage of Monte Carlo simulations. We used the LiteX framework to generate a FemtoRV imfc RISC-V instruction set soft processor and deploy it on a Digilent Arty-100T FPGA development board. The RISC-V soft processor augmented with our programmable random variate accelerator achieves an average speedup of 8.70 times and a median speedup of 8.68 times for a suite of twelve different benchmark applications when compared to GNU Scientific Library software random number generation. These speedups are achievable because the benchmarks spend an average of 90.0 % of their execution time generating random samples. The results of the Monte Carlo benchmark programs run over the programmable random variate accelerator have an average Wasserstein distance of 1.48 times and a median Wasserstein distance of 1.41 times that of the results produced by the GNU Scientific Library random number generators. The soft processor samples the electron tunneling noise source using the hardened XADC block in the FPGA. The flexibility of the LiteX framework allows for the deployment of any LiteX-supported soft processor with an electron tunneling noise programmable random variate accelerator on any LiteX-supported development board that contains an FPGA with an XADC.</description>
