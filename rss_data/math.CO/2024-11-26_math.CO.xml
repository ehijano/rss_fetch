      <title>Defective correspondence coloring of planar graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defective coloring (also known as relaxed or improper coloring) is a generalization of proper coloring defined as follows: for $d \in \mathbb{N}$, a coloring of a graph is $d$-defective if every vertex is colored the same as at most $d$ of its neighbors. We investigate defective coloring of planar graphs in the context of correspondence coloring, a generalization of list coloring introduced by Dvo\v{r}\'ak and Postle. First we show there exists a planar graph that is not $3$-defective $3$-correspondable, strengthening a recent result of Cho, Choi, Kim, Park, Shan, and Zhu. Then we construct a planar graph that is $1$-defective $3$-correspondable but not $4$-correspondable, thereby extending a recent result of Ma, Xu, and Zhu from list coloring to correspondence coloring. Finally we show all outerplanar graphs are $3$-defective $2$-correspondence colorable, with 3 defects being best possible.</description>

      <title>The Polymatroid Representation of a Greedoid, and Associated Galois Connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The greedoid is a significant abstraction of the matroid allowing for a more flexible analysis of structures in which the greedy algorithm "works." However, their diverse structure imposes difficulties towards their application in combinatorial optimization [Sze21]. In response, we revisit the polymatroid greedoid [KL85a] to characterize it by properties approximating those of matroids, by using the submodularity of its polymatroid representation in particular. Towards doing so, our main contribution is a full description of this class. Specifically, we show that a greedoid is a polymatroid greedoid if and only if it is an optimistic interval greedoid whose kernels are closed under intersection. This constitutes the first necessary and sufficient characterization of the polymatroid greedoid in terms of its combinatorial attributes, thereby resolving a central open question of Korte and Lov\'asz [KL85a]. Here, we introduce the optimism property to approximate properties of a matroid's continuations which are implied by the closure axioms of its span, which no longer hold for greedoids. And, because the kernels of an interval greedoid are in many ways an extension of a matroid's closed sets, our direction of necessity is a direct generalization of Birkhoff and Edmond's characterization of the meet in the lattice of a matroid's closed sets [Bir35, Edm03]. Towards achieving this result, our main technical insights arise from relating the lattice of flats of a polymatroid greedoid to that of the closed sets of its representation through order preserving mappings. Specifically, we will show the novel insight that the notion of polymatroid representation considered in [KL85a] is equivalent to the existence of a certain Galois connection. As a consequence, the representation of a greedoid via a polymatroid is an order theoretic concept in disguise.</description>

      <title>Phase transition of degenerate Tur\'{a}n problems in $p$-norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a positive real number $p$, the $p$-norm $\left\lVert G \right\rVert_p$ of a graph $G$ is the sum of the $p$-th powers of all vertex degrees. We study the maximum $p$-norm $\mathrm{ex}_{p}(n,F)$ of $F$-free graphs on $n$ vertices, focusing on the case where $F$ is a bipartite graph. The case $p = 1$ corresponds to the classical degenerate Tur\'{a}n problem, which has yielded numerous results indicating that extremal constructions tend to exhibit certain pseudorandom properties. In contrast, results such as those by Caro--Yuster, Nikiforov, and Gerbner suggest that for large $p$, extremal constructions often display a star-like structure.
  It is natural to conjecture that for every bipartite graph $F$, there exists a threshold $p_F$ such that for $p&lt; p_{F}$, the order of $\mathrm{ex}_{p}(n,F)$ is governed by pseudorandom constructions, while for $p &gt; p_{F}$, it is governed by star-like constructions. We confirm this conjecture by determining the exact value of $p_{F}$, under a mild assumption on the growth rate of $\mathrm{ex}(n,F)$. Our results extend to $r$-uniform hypergraphs as well.
  We also prove a general upper bound that is tight up to a $\log n$ factor for $\mathrm{ex}_{p}(n,F)$ when $p = p_{F}$. We conjecture that this $\log n$ factor is unnecessary and prove this conjecture for several classes of well-studied bipartite graphs, including one-side degree-bounded graphs and families of short even cycles.
  Our proofs involve $p$-norm adaptions of fundamental tools from degenerate Tur\'{a}n problems, including the Erd\H{o}s--Simonovits Regularization Theorem and the Dependent Random Choice.</description>

      <title>3-uniform monotone paths and multicolor Ramsey numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The monotone path $P_{n+2}$ is an ordered 3-uniform hypergraph whose vertex set has size $n+2$ and edge set consists of all consecutive triples. In this note, we consider the collection $\mathcal{J}_n$ of ordered 3-uniform hypergraphs named monotone paths with $n$ jumps, and we prove the following relation \begin{equation*} r(3;n) \leq R(P_{n+2},\mathcal{J}_n) \leq 4^n \cdot r(3;n), \end{equation*} where $r(3;n)$ is the multicolor Ramsey number for triangles and $R(P_{n+2},\mathcal{J}_n)$ is the hypergraph Ramsey number for $P_{n+2}$ versus any member of $\mathcal{J}_n$. In particular, whether $r(3;n)$ is exponential, which is a very old problem of Erd\H{o}s, is equivalent to whether $R(P_{n+2},\mathcal{J}_n)$ is exponential.</description>

      <title>Extremal results on $k$-stepwise irregular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a positive integer $k\ge 1$, a graph $G$ is $k$-stepwise irregular ($k$-SI graph) if the degrees of every pair of adjacent vertices differ by exactly $k$. Such graphs are necessarily bipartite. Using graph products it is demonstrated that for any $k\ge 1$ and any $d \ge 2$ there exists a $k$-SI graph of diameter $d$. A sharp upper bound for the maximum degree of a $k$-SI graph of a given order is proved. The size of $k$-SI graphs is bounded in general and in the special case when $\gcd(\Delta(G), k) = 1$. Along the way the degree complexity of a graph is introduced and used.</description>

      <title>The Heawood approach to Tait colorings and defining vertex sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a simple biconnected planar cubic graph, we associate each its vertex among $2n$ ones with the so-called spin, i.e., a variable which takes on values $\pm 1$. P. J. Heawood has proved that a Tait coloring, accurate to the choice of a color for one edge, is equivalent to the choice of spin values so as to make the sum of these value at vertices of any face be a multiple of~3. We treat faces, which satisfy this condition, as {\it proper}. The condition that guarantee the propriety of faces define a system of linear equations (SLE) with respect to variables, which take on nonzero values in the field ${\mathbb F}_3$. We say that a set of vertices is {\it defining} if values of spins of these vertices uniquely define values of the rest spins. In particular, so is the set of vertices which correspond to all free variables of the SLE. We actualize the approach proposed by P. J. Heawood by proposing a geometric proof of the fact that for a non-bipartite graph the rank of the SLE equals $n+1$. Moreover, we also geometrically describe the necessary condition for the minimality of the defining set. This implies that in the case of a non-bipartite graph there exist defining subsets consisting of $n-1$ vertices. As a simple corollary, we conclude that the number of Tait colorings in this case does not exceed $3\cdot 2^{n-1}$. Though this estimate is not exact, it is by half better than the known one. We also prove that the number of Tait colorings for a graph $CL_n$, which is bipartite for even $n$ and non-bipartite for an odd one, equals $2^n+8$ and $2^n-2$, correspondingly.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically optimal constant weight codes with even distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $q$-ary code $C$ of length $n$ is a set of $n$-dimensional vectors (code words) with entries in $\{0, \ldots, q-1\}$. We say $C$ has constant weight $w$ if each code word has exactly $w$ nonzero entries. We say $C$ has minimum distance $d$ if any two distinct code words in $C$ differ in at least $d$ entries. We let $A_q(n, d, w)$ be the largest possible cardinality of any $q$-ary code of length $n$ with constant weight $w$ and minimum distance $d$. Very recently, Liu and Shangguan gave an asymptotically sharp estimate for $A_q(n, d, w)$ where $q, d, w$ are fixed, $d$ is odd and $n \rightarrow \infty$. In this note we answer a question of Liu and Shangguan by obtaining such an estimate in the case where $d$ is even.</description>

      <title>Exact extremal non-trivial cross-intersecting families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two families $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ of sets are called cross-intersecting if each pair of sets $A\in \mathcal{A}$ and $B\in \mathcal{B}$ has nonempty intersection. Let $\cal{A}$ and ${\cal B}$ be two cross-intersecting families of $k$-subsets and $\ell$-subsets of $[n]$. Matsumoto and Tokushige [J. Combin. Theory Ser. A 52 (1989) 90--97] studied the extremal problem of the size $|\cal{A}||\cal{B}|$ and obtained the uniqueness of extremal families whenever $n\ge 2 \ell\ge 2k$, building on the work of Pyber. This paper will explore the second extremal size of $|\cal{A}||\cal{B}|$ and obtain that if $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ are not the subfamilies of Matsumoto--Tokushige's extremal families, then, for $n\ge 2\ell &gt;2k$ or $n&gt; 2\ell=2k$, \begin{itemize} \item[1)]either $|\cal{A}||\cal{B}|\le \left({\binom{n-1}{k-1}}+{\binom{n-2 }{k-1}}\right){\binom{n-2}{\ell-2}}$ with the unique extremal families (up to isomorphism)
  \[\mbox{$\mathcal{A}=\{A\in {\binom{[n]}{k}}: 1\in A \: \rm{ or} \: 2\in A\}$ \quad and \quad $\mathcal{B}=\{B\in {\binom{[n]}{\ell}}: [2] \subseteq B\}$};\] \item[2)] or $|\cal{A}||\cal{B}|\le \left({\binom{n-1}{k-1}}+1\right)\left({\binom{n-1}{\ell-1}}-{\binom{n-k-1}{\ell-1}}\right)$ with the unique extremal families (up to isomorphism)
  \[\mbox{$\mathcal{A}=\{A\in {\binom{[n]}{k}}: 1\in A\}\cup \{[2,k+1] \}$\quad and \quad $\mathcal{B}=\{B\in {\binom{[n]}{\ell}}: 1\in B, B\cap [2,k+1]\neq \emptyset \}$.}\] \end{itemize} The bound ``$n\ge 2\ell &gt;2k$ or $n&gt; 2\ell=2k$" is sharp for $n$. To achieve the above results, we establish some size-sensitive inequalities for cross-intersecting families. As by-products, we will recover the main results of Frankl and Kupavskii [European J. Combin. 62 (2017) 263--271].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Answering a question of Donald Knuth, we find the bivariate exponential generating function for "up-up-or-down-down'' permutations of odd length according to their last entry. An up-up-or-down-down permutation is a permutation $a_1a_2\cdots a_n$ satisfying $a_{2i-1}&lt;a_{2i}$ if and only if $a_{2i}&lt;a_{2i+1}$ for $1\le i &lt;n/2$. Equivalently, an up-up-or-down-down permutation is one in which every peak and every valley is odd.</description>

      <title>Tur\'an-type problems on $[a,b]$-factors of graphs, and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a set of graphs $\mathcal{H}$, we say that a graph $G$ is \textit{$\mathcal{H}$-free} if it does not contain any member of $\mathcal{H}$ as a subgraph. Let $\text{ex}(n,\mathcal{H})$ (resp. $\text{ex}_{sp}(n,\mathcal{H})$) denote the maximum size (resp. spectral radius) of an $n$-vertex $\mathcal{H}$-free graph. Denote by $\text{Ex}(n, \mathcal{H})$ the set of all $n$-vertex $\mathcal{H}$-free graphs with $\text{ex}(n, \mathcal{H})$ edges. Similarly, let $\mathrm{Ex}_{sp}(n,\mathcal{H})$ be the set of all $n$-vertex $\mathcal{H}$-free graphs with spectral radius $\text{ex}_{sp}(n, \mathcal{H})$. For positive integers $a, b$ with $a\leqslant b$, an $[a,b]$-factor of a graph $G$ is a spanning subgraph $F$ of $G$ such that $a\leqslant d_F(v)\leqslant b$ for all $v\in V(G)$, where $d_F(v)$ denotes the degree of the vertex $v$ in $F.$ Let $\mathcal{F}_{a,b}$ be the set of all the $[a,b]$-factors of an $n$-vertex complete graph $K_n$. In this paper, we determine the Tur\'an number $\text{ex}(n,\mathcal{F}_{a,b})$ and the spectral Tur\'an number $\text{ex}_{sp}(n,\mathcal{F}_{a,b}),$ respectively. Furthermore, the bipartite analogue of $\text{ex}(n,\mathcal{F}_{a,b})$ (resp. $\text{ex}_{sp}(n,\mathcal{F}_{a,b})$) is also obtained. All the corresponding extremal graphs are identified. Consequently, one sees that $\mathrm{Ex}_{sp}(n,\mathcal{F}_{a,b})\subseteq \text{Ex}(n, \mathcal{F}_{a,b})$ holds for graphs and bipartite graphs. This partially answers an open problem proposed by Liu and Ning \cite{LN2023}. Our results may deduce a main result of Fan and Lin \cite{FL2022}.</description>

      <title>Local and global patterns of rank 3 $G$-fans of totally-infinite type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We focus on the $G$-fans associated with cluster patterns whose initial exchange matrices are of infinite type. We study the asymptotic behavior of the $g$-vectors around the initial $G$-cone under the alternating mutations for two indices of infinite type. In the rank 3 case, we classify them into several patterns. As an application, the incompleteness of the $G$-fans of infinite type is proved. We observed that the local pattern of a rank 3 $G$-fan of totally-infinite type classified by the above types correlates with its global pattern. Following the classification of the local patterns (together with the Markov constant), we present several prototypical examples of the global patterns of the rank 3 $G$-fans of totally-infinite type, many of which are new in the literature.</description>

      <title>On the number of small Steiner triple systems with Veblen points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of Schreier extensions of loops was introduced in the general case in [11] and, more recently, it has been explored in the context of Steiner loops in [6]. In the latter case, it gives a powerful method for constructing Steiner triple systems containing Veblen points. Counting all Steiner triple systems of order v is an open problem for v&gt;21. In this paper, we investigate the number of Steiner triple systems of order 19, 27 and 31 containing Veblen points and we present some examples.</description>

      <title>Fractional chromatic number vs. Hall ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$, its Hall ratio $\rho(G)=\max_{H\subseteq G}\frac{|V(H)|}{\alpha(H)}$ forms a natural lower bound on its fractional chromatic number $\chi_f(G)$. A recent line of research studied the fundamental question of whether $\chi_f(G)$ can be bounded in terms of a (linear) function of $\rho(G)$. In a breakthrough-result, Dvo\v{r}\'{a}k, Ossona de Mendez and Wu gave a strong negative answer by proving the existence of graphs with bounded Hall ratio and arbitrarily large fractional chromatic number. In this paper, we solve two natural follow-up problems that were raised by Dvo\v{r}\'{a}k et al.
  The first problem concerns determining the growth of $g(n)$, defined as the maximum ratio $\frac{\chi_f(G)}{\rho(G)}$ among all $n$-vertex graphs. Dvo\v{r}\'{a}k et al. obtained the bounds $\Omega(\log\log n) \le g(n)\le O(\log n)$, leaving an exponential gap between the lower and upper bound. We almost fully resolve this problem by proving that the truth is close to the upper bound, i.e., $g(n)=(\log n)^{1-o(1)}$.
  The second problem posed by Dvo\v{r}\'{a}k et al. asks for the existence of graphs with bounded Hall ratio, arbitrarily large fractional chromatic number and such that every subgraph contains an independent set that touches a constant fraction of its edges. We affirmatively solve this second problem by showing that such graphs indeed exist.</description>

      <title>Simple operators and $q$-Whittaker coefficients of power sum symmetric functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a new proof of a theorem of Bender, Coley, Robbins and Rumsey on counting subspaces with a given profile with respect to a simple operator. Counting such subspaces is equivalent to the problem of determining the $q$-Whittaker coefficients in the expansion of the power sum symmetric function. As a consequence we obtain a result of Chen and Tseng which answers a problem of Niederreiter on splitting subspaces.</description>

      <title>Counting non-attacking chess pieces placements: Bishops and Anassas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By assuming a collapsibility definition, we derive some recurrences for counting non-attacking placements of two types of chess pieces with unbounded straight-line moves, specifically the Bishop and the Anassa, placed on a square board. Then we ansatz the closed-form solutions for the recurrences and derive exact expressions for the respective quasi-polynomial coefficients. The main results are simplifications to the known expressions for the Bishop and a general counting formula for the Anassa.</description>

      <title>Complexity between graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the notion of complexity $\text{C}(G,H)$ of two graphs $G$ and $H$, along with basic results for this numerical invariant. This was motivated by the Data Migration Problem. This invariant $\text{C}(G,H)$ is a number that measures \aspas{complexity} of the question: when is there a homomorphism $G\to H$? More precisely, $\text{C}(G,H)$ is the minimal number $\ell$ such that there are $\ell$ different subgraphs $G_j$ of $G$ such that $G=G_1\cup\cdots\cup G_\ell$ and for each $G_j$, there is a homomorphism $G_j\to H$. The complexity $\text{C}(-,-)$ is a graph invariant. Additionally, $\text{C}(G,H)$ provides a obstruction to the existence of homomorphisms. We explore the sub-additivity of the complexity $\text{C}(-,-)$ and study the complexity for products. We present a relation between $\text{C}(G,H)$ and the chromatic numbers $\chi(G),\chi(H)$. Specifically, we present a lower and an upper bounds for the complexity in terms of the chromatic number. We compute $\text{C}(K_j,K_i)$ and demonstrate a triangular inequality. Furthermore, we apply our theory to solve an example related to Data Migration. A primary objective of this paper is to present a well-defined methodology that can help manage the complexity of data migration tasks.</description>

      <title>Bow Metrics and Hyperbolicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A ($\lambda,\mu$)-bow metric was defined in (Dragan &amp; Ducoffe, 2023) as a far reaching generalization of an $\alpha_i$-metric (which is equivalent to a ($0,i$)-bow metric). A graph $G=(V,E)$ is said to satisfy ($\lambda,\mu$)-bow metric if for every four vertices $u,v,w,x$ of $G$ the following holds: if two shortest paths $P(u,w)$ and $P(v,x)$ share a common shortest subpath $P(v,w)$ of length more than $\lambda$ (that is, they overlap by more than $\lambda$), then the distance between $u$ and $x$ is at least $d_G(u,v)+d_G(v,w)+d_G(w,x)-\mu$. ($\lambda,\mu$)-Bow metric can also be considered for all geodesic metric spaces. It was shown by Dragan &amp; Ducoffe that every $\delta$-hyperbolic graph (in fact, every $\delta$-hyperbolic geodesic metric space) satisfies ($\delta, 2\delta$)-bow metric. Thus, ($\lambda,\mu$)-bow metric is a common generalization of hyperbolicity and of $\alpha_i$-metric. In this paper, we investigate an intriguing question whether ($\lambda,\mu$)-bow metric implies hyperbolicity in graphs. Note that, this is not the case for general geodesic metric spaces as Euclidean spaces satisfy ($0,0$)-bow metric whereas they have unbounded hyperbolicity. We conjecture that, in graphs, ($\lambda,\mu$)-bow metric indeed implies hyperbolicity and show that our conjecture is true for several large families of graphs.</description>

      <title>Generalizing the Bierbrauer-Friedman bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize mixed-level orthogonal arrays it terms of algebraic designs in a special multigraph. We prove a mixed-level analog of the Bierbrauer-Friedman (BF) bound for pure-level orthogonal arrays. For the case when the numbers of levels are powers of the same prime number, we characterize, in terms of multispreads, additive mixed-level orthogonal arrays attaining the BF bound. For pure-level orthogonal arrays, we consider versions of the BF bound obtained by replacing the Hamming graph by its polynomial generalization and show that in some cases this gives a new bound.
  Keywords: orthogonal array, algebraic $t$-design, mixed orthogonal array, completely-regular code, equitable partition, intriguing set, Hamming graph, Bierbrauer-Friedman bound, additive codes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The M-convexity of dual Schubert polynomials was first proven by Huh, Matherne, M\'esz\'aros, and St. Dizier in 2022. We give a full characterization of the supports of dual Schubert polynomials, which yields an elementary alternative proof of the M-convexity result, and furthermore strengthens it by explicitly characterizing the vertices of their Newton polytopes combinatorially.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the discrete quantum walk that assigns negative identity coins to marked vertices and Grover coins to the unmarked ones. We find combinatorial bases for the eigenspaces of the transtion matrix, and derive a formula for the average vertex mixing matrix. We then explore properties of this matrix when the marked vertices or unmarked vertices are neighborhood-equitable in the vertex-deleted subgraph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integer programs (IPs) on constraint matrices with bounded subdeterminants are conjectured to be solvable in polynomial time. We give a strongly polynomial time algorithm to solve IPs where the constraint matrix has bounded subdeterminants and at most two non-zeros per row after removing a constant number of rows and columns. This result extends the work by Fiorini, Joret, Weltge \&amp; Yuditsky (J. ACM 2024) by allowing for additional, unifying constraints and variables.</description>

      <title>Advances in Algorithmic Meta Theorems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tractability results for the model checking problem of logics yield powerful algorithmic meta theorems of the form: Every computational problem expressible in a logic $L$ can be solved efficiently on every class $\mathscr{C}$ of structures satisfying certain conditions. The most prominent logics studied in the field are (counting) monadic second-order logic (C)MSO, and first-order logic FO and its extensions. The complexity of CMSO model checking in general and of FO model checking on monotone graph classes is very well understood. In recent years there has been a rapid and exciting development of new algorithmic meta theorems. On the one hand there has been major progress for FO model checking on hereditary graph classes. This progress was driven by the development of a combinatorial structure theory for the logically defined monadically stable and monadically dependent graph classes, as well as by the advent of the new width measure twinwidth. On the other hand, new algorithmic meta theorems for new logics with expressive power between FO and CMSO offer a new unifying view on methods like the irrelevant vertex technique and recursive understanding. In this paper we overview the recent advances in algorithmic meta theorems and provide rough sketches for the methods to prove them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we define the edge zeta function of weighted complex. We also present the formula for the edge zeta function of the standard non-uniform complex $\operatorname{PGL}(3,\mathbb{F}_q[t])\backslash\operatorname{PGL}(3,\mathbb{F}_q(\!(t^{-1})\!))/\operatorname{PGL}(3,\mathbb{F}_q[\![t^{-1}]\!])$, arising from the group $\operatorname{PGL}_3$, as a rational function. Applying trunction in a specific direction is one of the main ingredient. As a result, we obtain the exact formula for the number of closed cycles coming from geodesics in the building.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite solvable group and let $\Delta(G)$ be the character degree graph of $G$. In this paper, we obtain the metric dimension of certain character degree graphs. Specifically, we calculate the metric dimension for a regular character degree graph, a character degree graph with a diameter of $2$ that is not a block, a character degree graph with a diameter of $3$ that also has a cut vertex and a character degree graph with Fitting height $2.$ We also consider two related parameters, base size and adjacency dimension, and their relation to metric dimension for character degree graphs of solvable groups.</description>

Abstract: We investigate near-factorizations of nonabelian groups, concentrating on dihedral groups. We show that some known constructions of near-factorizations in dihedral groups yield equivalent near-factorizations. In fact, there are very few known examples of nonequivalent near-factorizations in dihedral or other nonabelian groups; we provide some new examples with the aid of the computer. We also analyse a construction for near-factorizations in dihedral groups from near-factorizations in cyclic groups, due to P\^{e}cher, and we investigate when nonequivalent near-factorizations can be obtained by this method.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness and explicit computation of mates in near-factorizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a "mate'' $B$ of a set $A$ in a near-factorization $(A,B)$ of a finite group $G$ is unique. Further, we describe how to compute the mate $B$ very efficiently using an explicit formula for $B$. We use this approach to give an alternate proof of a theorem of Wu, Yang and Feng, which states that a strong circular external difference family cannot have more than two sets. We prove some new structural properties of near-factorizations in certain classes of groups. Then we examine all the noncyclic abelian groups of order less than $200$ in a search for a possible nontrivial near-factorization. All of these possibilities are ruled out, either by theoretical criteria or by exhaustive computer searches. (In contrast, near-factorizations in cyclic or dihedral groups are known to exist by previous results.) We also look briefly at nontrivial near-factorizations of index $\lambda &gt; 1$ in noncyclic abelian groups. Various examples are found with $\lambda = 2$ by computer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that for a discrete, countable, and amenable group $G$, if the direct product $G^2=G \times G$ is finitely colored then $\{ g \in G : \text{exists } (x,y) \in G^2 \text{ such that } \{ (x,y),(xg,y),(xg,yg)\} \text{ is monochromatic} \}$, is left IP$^{\ast}$. This partially solves a conjecture of V. Bergelson and R. McCutcheon. Moreover, we prove that the result holds for $G^m$ if $G$ is an FC-group, i.e., all conjugacy classes of $G$ are finite.</description>

      <title>Finding hypergraph immersion is fixed-parameter tractable</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Immersion minor is an important variant of graph minor, defined through an injective mapping from vertices in a smaller graph $H$ to vertices in a larger graph $G$ where adjacent elements of the former are connected in the latter by edge-disjoint paths. Here, we consider the immersion problem in the emerging field of hypergraphs. We first define hypergraph immersion by extending the injective mapping to hypergraphs. We then prove that finding a hypergraph immersion is fixed-parameter tractable, namely, there exists an $O(N^6)$ polynomial-time algorithm to determine whether a fixed hypergraph $H$ can be immersed in a hypergraph $G$ with $N$ vertices. Additionally, we present the dual hypergraph immersion problem and provide further characteristics of the algorithmic complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study approximation algorithms for the forest cover and bounded forest cover problems. A probabilistic $2+\epsilon$ approximation algorithm for the forest cover problem is given using the method of dual fitting. A deterministic algorithm with a 2-approximation ratio that rounds the optimal solution to a linear program is given next. The 2-approximation for the forest cover is then used to give a 6-approximation for the bounded forest cover problem. The use of the probabilistic method to develop the $2+\epsilon$ approximation algorithm may be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: We give an alternative probabilistic proof of the sharp Assouad--Nagata dimension bound of a doubling metric space. Some partial rigidity results and application to scalar curvature are also discussed. An important technical tool in our arguments is the notion of padded decomposition, which origins in computer science and is extended to general separable metric space by us. Along the way we extend the sharp upper bound of asymptotic dimension of graphs with polynomial growth to noncollapsed locally compact metric measure spaces with polynomial volume growth, which sheds lights on broader applications of probabilistic methods in metric geometry.</description>

      <title>A sharper Ramsey theorem for constrained drawings</title>

      <description>arXiv:1909.08489v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$ and a collection $\mathcal C$ of subsets of $\mathbb{R}^d$ indexed by the subsets of vertices of $G$, a constrained drawing of $G$ is a drawing, where each edge is drawn inside some set from $\mathcal C$, in such a way that non-adjacent edges are drawn in sets with disjoint indices. In this paper we prove a Ramsey type result for such drawings. Furthermore we show how the result can be used to obtain Helly type theorems.
  More precisely, we prove the following. For each $n$ and $b$, there is $N=O(b^{2n-3})$ with the following properties: If $G$ is a drawing of a graph on $N$ vertices and $\mathcal C$ is a collection of sets of $\mathbb{R}^d$ such that each $(b+1)$-tuple $T$ of vertices lies in a set indexed by $T$ and contains at least one edge in $T$, then in $G$, we can find a constrained copy of the complete graph $K_n$.
  As a direct consequence we obtain the following Helly type result: For each $d$, there is a polynomial $h(b)$ of degree at most $2d+3$ such that the following holds. For every family $\mathcal F$ of sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$, its Helly number is at most $h(b)$, provided that the intersection of any non-empty subfamily has at most $b$ path-connected components, and trivial homology groups $H_1$, $H_2$, .... $H_{\lceil d/2\rceil-1}$. This dramatically improves the original theorem by Matou\v{s}ek which had stronger assumption and a tower-like bound on $h(b)$. Under the same assumptions, our technique can also be used to bound Radon numbers.</description>

      <title>An inverse Grassmannian Littlewood-Richardson rule and extensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.11185v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chow rings of flag varieties have bases of Schubert cycles $\sigma_u$, indexed by permutations. A major problem of algebraic combinatorics is to give a positive combinatorial formula for the structure constants of this basis. The celebrated Littlewood-Richardson rules solve this problem for special products $\sigma_u \cdot \sigma_v$ where $u$ and $v$ are $p$-Grassmannian permutations.
  Building on work of Wyser, we introduce backstable clans to prove such a rule for the problem of computing the product $\sigma_u \cdot \sigma_v$ when $u$ is $p$-inverse Grassmannian and $v$ is $q$-inverse Grassmannian. By establishing several new families of linear relations among structure constants, we further extend this result to obtain a positive combinatorial rule for $\sigma_u \cdot \sigma_v$ in the case that $u$ is covered in weak Bruhat order by a $p$-inverse Grassmannian permutation and $v$ is a $q$-inverse Grassmannian permutation.</description>

      <title>Fast construction on a restricted budget</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.07251v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a model of a controlled random graph process. In this model, the edges of the complete graph $K_n$ are ordered randomly and then revealed, one by one, to a player called Builder. He must decide, immediately and irrevocably, whether to purchase each observed edge. The observation time is bounded by parameter $t$, and the total budget of purchased edges is bounded by parameter $b$. Builder's goal is to devise a strategy that, with high probability, allows him to construct a graph of purchased edges possessing a target graph property $\mathcal{P}$, all within the limitations of observation time and total budget. We show the following: (a) Builder has a strategy to achieve $k$-vertex-connectivity at the hitting time for this property by purchasing at most $c_kn$ edges for an explicit $c_k&lt;k$; and a strategy to achieve minimum degree $k$ (slightly) after the threshold for minimum degree $k$ by purchasing at most $(1+\varepsilon)kn/2$ edges (which is optimal). (b) Builder has a strategy to create a Hamilton cycle at the hitting time for Hamiltonicity by purchasing at most $Cn$ edges for an absolute constant $C&gt;1$; this is optimal in the sense that $C$ cannot be arbitrarily close to $1$. This substantially extends the classical hitting time result for Hamiltonicity due to Ajtai--Koml\'os--Szemer\'edi and Bollob\'as. (c) Builder has a strategy to create a perfect matching by time $(1+\varepsilon)n\log{n}/2$ while purchasing at most $(1+\varepsilon)n/2$ edges (which is optimal). (d) Builder has a strategy to create a copy of a given $k$-vertex tree if $t\ge b\gg\max\{(n/t)^{k-2},1\}$, and this is optimal; (e) For $\ell=2k+1$ or $\ell=2k+2$, Builder has a strategy to create a copy of a cycle of length $\ell$ if $b\gg\max \{n^{k+2}/t^{k+1},n/\sqrt{t}\}$, and this is optimal.</description>

      <title>The "Power of Few" Phenomenon: The Sparse Case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.05605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The "majority dynamics" process on a social network begins with an initial phase, where the individuals are split into two competing parties, Red and Blue. Every day, everyone updates their affiliation to match the majority among those of their friends. While studying this process on Erdos-Renyi G(n, p) random graph (with constant density), the authors discovered the "Power of Few" phenomenon, showing that a very small advantage to one side already guarantees that everybody will unanimously join that side after just a few days with overwhelming probability. For example, when p = 1/2, then 10 extra members guarantee this unanimity with a 90% chance, regardless of the value of n. In this paper, we study this phenomenon for sparse random graphs. It is clear that below the connectivity threshold, the phenomenon ceases to hold, as the isolated vertices never change their colors. We show that it holds for every density above the threshold. To make the process more realistic, we also assume that individuals can randomly activate their accounts to post their opinions and observe their neighbors (just as we do on social media). We prove that the phenomenon is robust under this assumption.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.03688v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a parametric framework for obtaining obstruction characterizations of graph parameters with respect to a quasi-ordering $\leqslant$ on graphs. At the center of this framework lies the concept of a $\leqslant$-parametric graph: a non $\leqslant$-decreasing sequence $\mathscr{G} = \langle \mathscr{G}_{t} \rangle_{t \in \mathbb{N}}$ of graphs indexed by non-negative integers. Parametric graphs allow us to define combinatorial objects that capture the approximate behaviour of graph parameters. A finite set $\mathfrak{G}$ of $\leqslant$-parametric graphs is a $\leqslant$-universal obstruction for a parameter $\mathsf{p}$ if there exists a function $f \colon \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ such that, for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$ and every graph $G$, 1) if $\mathsf{p}(G) \leq k$, then for every $\mathscr{G} \in \mathfrak{G},$ $\mathscr{G}_{f(k)} \not\leqslant G$, and 2) if for every $\mathscr{G} \in \mathfrak{G},$ $\mathscr{G}_{k} \not\leqslant G$, then $\mathsf{p}(G) \leq f(k).$ To solidify our point of view, we identify sufficient order-theoretic conditions that guarantee the existence of universal obstructions and in this case we examine algorithmic implications on the existence of fixed-parameter tractable algorithms. Our parametric framework has further implications related to finite obstruction characterizations of properties of graph classes. A $\leqslant$-class property is defined as any set of $\leqslant$-closed graph classes that is closed under set inclusion. By combining our parametric framework with established results from order theory, we derive a precise order-theoretic characterization that ensures $\leqslant$-class properties can be described in terms of the exclusion of a finite set of $\leqslant$-parametric graphs.</description>

      <title>The distribution of the maximum protection number in simply generated trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.09427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The protection number of a vertex $v$ in a tree is the length of the shortest path from $v$ to any leaf contained in the maximal subtree where $v$ is the root. In this paper, we determine the distribution of the maximum protection number of a vertex in simply generated trees, thereby refining a recent result of Devroye, Goh and Zhao. Two different cases can be observed: if the given family of trees allows vertices of outdegree $1$, then the maximum protection number is on average logarithmic in the tree size, with a discrete double-exponential limiting distribution. If no such vertices are allowed, the maximum protection number is doubly logarithmic in the tree size and concentrated on at most two values. These results are obtained by studying the singular behaviour of the generating functions of trees with bounded protection number. While a general distributional result by Prodinger and Wagner can be used in the first case, we prove a variant of that result in the second case.</description>

Abstract: We prove that every $n$-vertex complete simple topological graph generates at least $\Omega(n)$ pairwise disjoint $4$-faces. This improves upon a recent result by Hubard and Suk. As an immediate corollary, every $n$-vertex complete simple topological graph drawn in the unit square generates a $4$-face with area at most $O(1/n)$. This can be seen as a topological variant of the Heilbronn problem for quadrilaterals. We construct examples showing that our result is asymptotically tight. We also discuss the similar problem for $k$-faces with arbitrary $k\geq 3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a configuration of pebbles on the vertices of a graph $G$, a pebbling move removes two pebbles from a vertex and puts one pebble on an adjacent vertex. The pebbling number of a graph $G$ is the smallest number of pebbles required such that, given an arbitrary initial configuration of pebbles, one pebble can be moved to any vertex of $G$ through some sequence of pebbling moves. Through constructing a non-tree weight function for $Q_4$, we improve the weight function technique, introduced by Hurlbert and extended by Cranston et al., that gives an upper bound for the pebbling number of graphs. Then, we propose a conjecture on weight functions for the $n$-dimensional cube. We also construct a set of valid weight functions for variations of lollipop graphs, extending previously known constructions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13341v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The seminal papers of Edmonds \cite{Egy}, Nash-Williams \cite{NW} and Tutte \cite{Tu} have laid the foundations of the theories of packing arborescences and packing trees. The directed version has been extensively investigated, resulting in a great number of generalizations. In contrast, the undirected version has been marginally considered. The aim of this paper is to further develop the theories of packing trees and forests. Our main result on graphs characterizes the existence of a packing of $k$ forests, $F_1, \ldots, F_k$, in a graph $G$ such that each vertex of $G$ belongs to exactly $h$ of the forests, and in addition, each $F_i$ has between $\ell(i)$ and $\ell'(i)$ connected components and the total number of connected components in the packing is between $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Finally, we extend this result to hypergraphs and dypergraphs, the latter giving a generalization of a theorem of B\'erczi and Frank \cite{BF3}.</description>

Abstract: A complete partition of a graph $G$ is a partition of the vertex set such that there is at least one edge between any two parts. The largest $r$ such that $G$ has a complete partition into $r$ parts, each of which is an independent set, is the achromatic number of $G$. We determine the achromatic number of polarity graphs of biaffine planes coming from generalized polygons. Our colorings of a family of unitary polarity graphs are used to solve a problem of Axenovich and Martin on complete partitions of $C_4$-free graphs. Furthermore, these colorings prove that there are sequences of graphs which are optimally complete and have unbounded degree, a problem that had been studied for the sequence of hypercubes independently by Roichman, and Ahlswede, Bezrukov, Blokhuis, Metsch, and Moorhouse.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plane partitions in the totally symmetric self-complementary symmetry class (TSSCPP) are known to be equinumerous with n x n alternating sign matrices, but no explicit bijection is known. In this paper, we give a bijection from these plane partitions to {0,1,-1}-matrices we call magog matrices, some of which are alternating sign matrices. We explore enumerative properties of these matrices related to natural statistics such as inversion number and number of negative ones. We then investigate the polytope defined as their convex hull. We show that all the magog matrices are extreme and give a partial inequality description. Finally, we define another TSSCPP polytope as the convex hull of TSSCPP boolean triangles and determine its dimension, inequalities, vertices, and facets.</description>

      <title>Central measures of the jump graph for Young--Fibonacci graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For fixed $k$, we consider the subgraph $YF_k=(V_k,E_k)$ of the famous Young--Fibonacci graph formed by the words with at most $k$ 2-s. The jump graph is a graded graph is defined as follows: each level is identified with $V_k$, and an edge between two vertices $(v_1,i)$ and $(v_{2},i+1)$, $v_1,v_2\in V_k$, of neighbouring levels us drawn iff $v_2$ is a descendant of $v_1$ in $YF_k$. The goal of this paper is to describe all central measures on the path space of $YF_k$.</description>

      <title>Graphs that admit a Hamilton path are cup-stackable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06189v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fay, Hurlbert and Tennant recently introduced a one-player game on a finite connected graph $G$, which they called cup stacking. Stacks of cups are placed at the vertices of $G$, and are transferred between vertices via stacking moves, subject to certain constraints, with the goal of stacking all cups at a single target vertex. If this is possible for every target vertex of $G$, then $G$ is called stackable. In this paper, we prove that if $G$ admits a Hamilton path, then $G$ is stackable, which confirms several of the conjectures raised by Fay, Hurlbert and Tennant. Furthermore, we prove stackability for certain powers of bipartite graphs, and we construct graphs of arbitrarily large minimum degree and connectivity that do not allow stacking onto any of their vertices.</description>

      <title>Maximum Nim and Josephus Problem algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we study a Josephus problem algorithm. Let $n,k$ be positive integers and $g_k(n) = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{k-1} \right\rfloor +1$, where $ \left\lfloor \ \ \right\rfloor$ is a floor function. Suppose that there exists $p$ such that $g_{k}^{p-1}(0) &lt; n(k-1) \leq g_{k}^{p}(0)$, where $g_{k}^p$ is the $p$-th functional power of $g_k$. Then, the last number that remains is $nk-h2_{k}^{p}(0)$ in the Josephus problem of $n$ numbers, where every $k$-th numbers are removed. This algorithm is based on Maximum Nim with the rule function $f_k(n)=\left\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \right\rfloor$. Using the present article's result, we can build a new algorithm for Josephus problem.</description>

      <title>Diverse beam search to find densest-known planar unit distance graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of determining the maximum number of edges in a unit distance graph (UDG) of $n$ vertices using computer search. An unsolved problem of Paul Erd\H{o}s asks the maximum number of edges $u(n)$ a UDG of $n$ vertices can have. Those UDGs that attain $u(n)$ are called "maximally dense." In this paper, we seek to demonstrate a computer algorithm to generate dense UDGs for vertex counts up to at least 100. Via beam search with an added visitation metric, our algorithm finds all known maximally dense UDGs up to isomorphism at the push of a button. In addition, for $15 &lt; n$, where $u(n)$ is unknown, i) the algorithm finds all previously published densest UDGs up to isomorphism for $15 &lt; n \le 30$, and ii) the rate of growth of $u(n)/n$ remains similar for $30 &lt; n$. The code and database of over 60 million UDGs found by our algorithm will be open-sourced at time of publication.</description>

      <title>A new framework for identifying most reliable graphs and a correction to the $K_{3,3}$-theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a multigraph $G$, the all-terminal reliability $R(G,p)$ is the probability that $G$ remains connected under percolation with parameter $p$. Fixing the number of vertices $n$ and edges $m$, we investigate which graphs maximize $R(G,p)$ -- such graphs are called optimal -- paying particular attention to uniqueness and to whether the answer depends upon $p$. We generalize the concept of a distillation and build a framework with which we identify all optimal graphs for which $m-n\in\{1,2,3\}$. These graphs are uniformly optimal in $p$. Most have been previously identified, but with serious problems, especially when $m-n=3$. We obtain partial results for $m-n\in\{4,5\}$.
  For $m-n=3$, the optimal graphs were incorrectly identified by Wang in 1994, in the infinite number of cases where $m\equiv5\pmod{9}$ and $m\geq14$. This erroneous result concerns subdivisions of $K_{3,3}$ and has been cited extensively, without any mistake being detected. While the optimal graphs were correctly described for other $m$, the proof is fundamentally flawed. Our proof of the rectified statement is self-contained.
  For $m-n=4$, the optimal graphs were recently shown to depend upon $p$ for infinitely many $m$. We find a new such set of $m$-values, which gives a different perspective on why this phenomenon occurs and leads us to conjecture that uniformly optimal graphs exist only for finitely many $m$. However, for $m-n=5$, we conjecture that there are again infinitely many uniformly optimal graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analysis of a coin-tossing problem posed by Daniel Litt which has generated some popular interest. We demonstrate a recursive identity which leads to relatively simple formulas for the excess number of wins for one player over the other together with its increments as the number of coin tosses increases. Formulas and recursive algorithms are provided to calculate the number of sequences with any given point-score difference.</description>

      <title>Independent set sequence of some linear hypertrees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The independent set sequence of trees has been well studied, with much effort devoted to the (still open) question of Alavi, Malde, Schwenk and Erd\H{o}s on whether the independent set sequence of any tree is unimodal.
  Much less attention has been given to the independent set sequence of hypertrees. Here we study some natural first questions in this realm. We show that the strong independent set sequences of linear hyperpaths and of linear hyperstars are unimodal (actually, log-concave). For uniform linear hyperpaths we obtain explicit expressions for the number of strong independent sets of each possible size, both via generating functions and via combinatorial arguments. We also show log-concavity of the strong independent set sequences of uniform linear hypercombs.</description>

      <title>The Ehrhart $h^*$-polynomials of positroid polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A positroid is a matroid realized by a matrix such that all maximal minors are non-negative. Positroid polytopes are matroid polytopes of positroids. In particular, they are lattice polytopes. The Ehrhart polynomial of a lattice polytope counts the number of integer points in the dilation of that polytope. The Ehrhart series is the generating function of the Ehrhart polynomial, a rational function with a numerator called the $h*$-polynomial. We give explicit formulas for the $h^*$-polynomials of an arbitrary positroid polytope regarding permutation descents. We also compute the $h^*$-polynomial of any positroid polytope with some facets removed and relate it to the descents of permutations. Our result generalizes that of Early, Kim, and Li for hypersimplices.</description>

      <title>A refined graph container lemma and applications to the hard-core model on bipartite expanders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a refined version of a graph container lemma due to Galvin and discuss several applications related to the hard-core model on bipartite expander graphs. Given a graph $G$ and $\lambda&gt;0$, the hard-core model on $G$ at activity $\lambda$ is the probability distribution $\mu_{G,\lambda}$ on independent sets in $G$ given by $\mu_{G,\lambda}(I)\propto \lambda^{|I|}$. As one of our main applications, we show that the hard-core model at activity $\lambda$ on the hypercube $Q_d$ exhibits a `structured phase' for $\lambda= \Omega( \log^2 d/d^{1/2})$ in the following sense: in a typical sample from $\mu_{Q_d,\lambda}$, most vertices are contained in one side of the bipartition of $Q_d$. This improves upon a result of Galvin which establishes the same for $\lambda=\Omega(\log d/ d^{1/3})$. As another application, we establish a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for the hard-core model on a $d$-regular bipartite $\alpha$-expander, with $\alpha&gt;0$ fixed, when $\lambda= \Omega( \log^2 d/d^{1/2})$. This improves upon the bound $\lambda=\Omega(\log d/ d^{1/4})$ due to the first author, Perkins and Potukuchi. We discuss similar improvements to results of Galvin-Tetali, Balogh-Garcia-Li and Kronenberg-Spinka.</description>

      <title>A new lower bound for the multicolor Ramsey number $r_k(K_{2, t + 1})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this short note, we provide a new infinite family of $K_{2, t+1}$-free graphs for each prime power $t$. Using these graphs, we show that it is possible to partition the edges of $K_n$ into parts, such that each part is isomorphic to our $K_{2, t+1}$-free graph. This yields an improved lower bound to the multicolor Ramsey number $r_k(K_{2, t+1})$ when $k$ and $t$ are powers of the same prime. For these values of $k$ and $t$, our coloring implies that $$ tk^2 + 1 \leq r_k(K_{2, t+1}) \leq tk^2 + k + 2. $$ where the upper bound is due to Chung and Graham.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we focus on various aspects of singular complex plane curves, mostly in the context of their homological properties and the associated combinatorial structures. We formulate some challenging open problems that can point to new directions in research, for example by introducing weak Ziegler pairs of curve arrangements. Moreover, we construct new examples of different Ziegler pairs, in both the classical and the weak sense, and present new geometric approaches to construction problems of singular plane curves.</description>

      <title>A simple algorithm for checking equivalence of counting functions on free monoids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note we propose a new algorithm for checking whether two counting functions on a free monoid $M_r$ of rank $r$ are equivalent modulo a bounded function. The previously known algorithm has time complexity $O(n)$ for all ranks $r&gt;2$, however in case $r=2$ it was estimated only as $O(n^2)$. Here we apply a new approach, based on explicit basis expansion and weighted rectangles summation, which allows us to construct a much simpler algorithm with time complexity $O(n)$ for any $r\geq 2$.</description>

      <title>First memoir on the asymptotics of certain infinite products</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The product sides of the Rogers--Ramanujan identities and alike often appear to be "transparently modular" (functions). The old work by Rogers (1894) and recent work by Rosengren make use (somewhat implicitly) of this fact for proving the identities with the help of underlying modular equations$-$the main challenge is verifying the latter for the sum sides. Here we speculate on the potentials of using the asymptotics of such $q$-identities or their finite versions for proving them.</description>
