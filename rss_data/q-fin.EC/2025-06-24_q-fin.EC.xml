      <title>Social Group Bias in AI Finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial institutions increasingly rely on large language models (LLMs) for high-stakes decision-making. However, these models risk perpetuating harmful biases if deployed without careful oversight. This paper investigates racial bias in LLMs specifically through the lens of credit decision-making tasks, operating on the premise that biases identified here are indicative of broader concerns across financial applications. We introduce a reproducible, counterfactual testing framework that evaluates how models respond to simulated mortgage applicants identical in all attributes except race. Our results reveal significant race-based discrepancies, exceeding historically observed bias levels. Leveraging layer-wise analysis, we track the propagation of sensitive attributes through internal model representations. Building on this, we deploy a control-vector intervention that effectively reduces racial disparities by up to 70% (33% on average) without impairing overall model performance. Our approach provides a transparent and practical toolkit for the identification and mitigation of bias in financial LLM deployments.</description>

      <title>An AI-powered Tool for Central Bank Business Liaisons: Quantitative Indicators and On-demand Insights from Firms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a world of increasing policy uncertainty, central banks are relying more on soft information sources to complement traditional economic statistics and model-based forecasts. One valuable source of soft information comes from intelligence gathered through central bank liaison programs -- structured programs in which central bank staff regularly talk with firms to gather insights. This paper introduces a new text analytics and retrieval tool that efficiently processes, organises, and analyses liaison intelligence gathered from firms using modern natural language processing techniques. The textual dataset spans 25 years, integrates new information as soon as it becomes available, and covers a wide range of business sizes and industries. The tool uses both traditional text analysis techniques and powerful language models to provide analysts and researchers with three key capabilities: (1) quickly querying the entire history of business liaison meeting notes; (2) zooming in on particular topics to examine their frequency (topic exposure) and analysing the associated tone and uncertainty of the discussion; and (3) extracting precise numerical values from the text, such as firms' reported figures for wages and prices growth. We demonstrate how these capabilities are useful for assessing economic conditions by generating text-based indicators of wages growth and incorporating them into a nowcasting model. We find that adding these text-based features to current best-in-class predictive models, combined with the use of machine learning methods designed to handle many predictors, significantly improves the performance of nowcasts for wages growth. Predictive gains are driven by a small number of features, indicating a sparse signal in contrast to other predictive problems in macroeconomics, where the signal is typically dense.</description>

      <title>The Theory of Economic Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Economic complexity estimates rely on eigenvectors derived from matrices of specialization to explain differences in economic growth, inequality, and sustainability. Yet, despite their widespread use, we still lack a principled theory that can deduce these eigenvectors from first principles and place them in the context of a mechanistic model. Here, we calculate these eigenvectors analytically for a model where the output of an economy in an activity increases with the probability the economy is endowed with the factors required by the activity. We show that the eigenvector known as the Economic Complexity Index or ECI is a monotonic function of the probability that an economy is endowed with a factor, and that in a multi-factor model, it is an estimate of the average endowment across all factors. We then generalize this result to other production functions and to a short-run equilibrium framework with prices, wages, and consumption. We find that our main result does not depend on the introduction of prices or wages, and that the derived wage function is consistent with the convergence of economies with a similar level of complexity. Finally, we use this model to explain the shape of networks of related activities, such as the product space and the research space. These findings solve long standing theoretical puzzles in the economic complexity literature and validate the idea that metrics of economic complexity are estimates of an economy being endowed with multiple factors.</description>

      <title>AI is the Strategy: From Agentic AI to Autonomous Business Models onto Strategy in the Age of AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article develops the concept of Autonomous Business Models (ABMs) as a distinct managerial and strategic logic in the age of agentic AI. While most firms still operate within human-driven or AI-augmented models, we argue that we are now entering a phase where agentic AI (systems capable of initiating, coordinating, and adapting actions autonomously) can increasingly execute the core mechanisms of value creation, delivery, and capture. This shift reframes AI not as a tool to support strategy, but as the strategy itself. Using two illustrative cases, getswan.ai, an Israeli startup pursuing autonomy by design, and a hypothetical reconfiguration of Ryanair as an AI-driven incumbent, we depict the evolution from augmented to autonomous business models. We show how ABMs reshape competitive advantage through agentic execution, continuous adaptation, and the gradual offloading of human decision-making. This transition introduces new forms of competition between AI-led firms, which we term synthetic competition, where strategic interactions occur at rapid, machine-level speed and scale. It also challenges foundational assumptions in strategy, organizational design, and governance. By positioning agentic AI as the central actor in business model execution, the article invites us to rethink strategic management in an era where firms increasingly run themselves.</description>

      <title>Income, health, and spurious cointegration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data for many nations show a long-run increase, over many decades, of income, indexed by GDP per capita, and population health, indexed by mortality or life expectancy at birth (LEB). However, the short-run and long-run relationships between these variables have been interpreted in different ways, and many controversies remain open. It has been claimed that population health and income are cointegrated, and that this demonstrates a positive long-run effect of income on population health. We show, however, that an empirically tested cointegration between LEB and GDP per capita is not a sound method to infer a causal link. For a given country it is easy to find computer-generated data or time series of real observations, related or unrelated to the country, that according to standard methods, are also cointegrated with the country's LEB. More generally, given a trending time series, it is easy to find other series, observational or artificial, that appear cointegrated with it. Thus, standard cointegration methodology, often used in empirical investigations, cannot distinguish whether cointegration relationships are spurious or causal.</description>

      <title>Market-Based Portfolio Variance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The investor, who holds his portfolio and doesn't trade his shares, at current time can use the time series of the market trades that were made during the averaging interval with the securities of his portfolio to assess the current variance of the portfolio. We show how the time series of trades with the securities of the portfolio determine the time series of trades with the portfolio as a single market security. The time series of portfolio trades determine the return and variance of the portfolio in the same form as the time series of trades with securities determine their returns and variances. The description of any portfolio and any single market security is equal. The time series of portfolio trades define the decomposition of the portfolio variance by its securities. If the volumes of trades with all securities are assumed constant, the decomposition of the portfolio variance coincides with Markowitz's (1952) expression of variance. However, the real markets expose random volumes of trades. The portfolio variance that accounts for the randomness of trade volumes is a polynomial of the 4th degree in the variables of relative amounts invested into securities and with the coefficients different from covariances of securities returns. We discuss the possible origin of the latent and unintended assumption that Markowitz (1952) made to derive his result. Our description of the portfolio variance that accounts for the randomness of real trade volumes could help the portfolio managers and the majors like BlackRock's Aladdin and Asimov, JP Morgan, and the U.S. Fed to adjust their models and forecasts to the reality of random markets.</description>

      <title>Does the Expansion of Medicaid Lead to Income Adjustment -- Evidence from SIPP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines whether Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) led to strategic income reductions to qualify for coverage. Using monthly data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (2013 to 2019) and a regression discontinuity design, this paper finds that childless households in expansion states with earnings just above the eligibility threshold reduced their lowest monthly earnings by 39 percentage points of the Federal Poverty Level (roughly 700 dollars for a two-person household) relative to those just below. The effect intensified as the mandate penalty increased and diminished after its repeal. Evidence suggests earnings adjustments along both intensive and extensive margins. The paper reinforces the validity of using the lowest monthly earning to identify Medicaid eligibility and provides the first evidence of a substantial labor supply response to the ACA</description>

      <title>Human-AI Interactions and Societal Pitfalls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10448v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When working with generative artificial intelligence (AI), users may see productivity gains, but the AI-generated content may not match their preferences exactly. To study this effect, we introduce a Bayesian framework in which heterogeneous users choose how much information to share with the AI, facing a trade-off between output fidelity and communication cost. We show that the interplay between these individual-level decisions and AI training may lead to societal challenges. Outputs may become more homogenized, especially when the AI is trained on AI-generated content, potentially triggering a homogenization death spiral. And any AI bias may propagate to become societal bias. A solution to the homogenization and bias issues is to reduce human-AI interaction frictions and enable users to flexibly share information, leading to personalized outputs without sacrificing productivity.</description>
