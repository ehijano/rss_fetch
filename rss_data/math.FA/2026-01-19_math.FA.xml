      <title>Fredholm Theory on Twisted Hilbert Scales: A Frame-Theoretic Approach to Half-Integer Fourier Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a Hilbert scale on $L^2([0,1])$ via a unitary twist operator that maps the standard Fourier basis to half-integer frequency exponentials. The resulting weighted spaces, equipped with norms indexed by $(1+|k+\tfrac{1}{2}|^2)^s$, admit a canonical diagonal operator with the compact resolvent and spectrum $\{k+\tfrac{1}{2}\}_{k\in\mathbb{Z}}$. We prove that this operator defines a Fredholm mapping between adjacent scale levels with index zero, provide an explicit solution to an antiperiodic boundary value problem illustrating the framework, and compute the zeta-regularized determinant $\det_\zeta(|\widetilde{A}|) = 2$ using the Hurwitz zeta function. We establish stability under bounded perturbations and verify the well-definedness of spectral flow. The framework is developed entirely through functional-analytic methods without differential operators or boundary value problems. The construction is motivated by twisted spinor boundary conditions on non-orientable manifolds, though the present work is formulated abstractly in operator-theoretic language.</description>

      <title>Banach lattices with upper $p$-estimates: Renorming and factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notions of $p$-convexity and concavity are fundamental tools for studying Banach lattices, as they partition the class of Banach lattices into a scale of spaces with $L_p$-like properties. Upper and lower $p$-estimates provide a refinement of this scale, modeled by the Lorentz spaces $L_{p,\infty}$ and $L_{p,1}$, respectively. In this article, we provide a comprehensive treatment of Banach lattices with upper $p$-estimates. In particular, we show that many well-known theorems about $p$-convex Banach lattices have analogues in the upper $p$-estimate setting, including the ability to represent all such spaces inside of infinity sums of model spaces, to canonically factor the convex operators and identify their associated operator ideals, as well as to give a precise description of the free objects and push-outs. Proving these results is far from straightforward and will require the development of a variety of new tools that avoid convexification and concavification procedures. In fact, we will identify many fundamental differences between the theories of $p$-convexity and upper $p$-estimates, particularly with regards to isometric problems and renormings.</description>

      <title>Self-adjoint extensions with compact resolvent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $T$ be a densely defined closed symmetric operator with equal deficiency indices in a separable complex Hilbert space $H$. In this paper, we prove that $T$ has a self-adjoint extension with compact resolvent if and only if the domain $D(T)$ of $T$ is compactly embedded in $H$ w.r.t. the graph norm on $D(T)$. If it is the case, we also prove that all self-adjoint extensions with compact resolvent can be parameterized by unitary operators $U$ on a certain Hilbert space such that $U-Id$ is compact.</description>

      <title>Ring isomorphisms in norm between Banach algebras of continuous complex-valued functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ and $Y$ be compact Hausdorff spaces, and let $C(X)$ and $C(Y)$ denote the commutative Banach algebras of all continuous complex-valued functions on $X$ and $Y$, respectively. We study bijective maps $T$ from $C(X)$ onto $C(Y)$ which preserve the ring structure in the norm in the following sense: \[ \|T(f+g)\|=\|T(f)+T(g)\|,\quad \|T(fg)\|=\|T(f)T(g)\| \qquad(f,g\in C(X)). \] Our main objective is to clarify whether such maps must necessarily be induced by homeomorphisms between the underlying spaces. Under the additional assumption that $T(\overline{f})=\overline{T(f)}$ for $f\in C(X)$, we prove that $T$ is a real-linear isometry. As a consequence, we obtain a concrete representation of such maps as weighted composition operators.</description>

      <title>Operators and POVMs generated by Parseval frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a Parseval frame in a Hilbert space
  and let $E$ be a set of real numbers. From these data, we construct an operator $H_{E,e}$ and a positive operator-valued measure (POVM) $F_{E,e}$. This paper investigates in detail the relationship between the operator $H_{E, e}$ and the POVM $F_{E,e}$. Our results extend the classical correspondence between a self-adjoint operator generated by an orthonormal basis and its associated projection-valued (spectral) measure.</description>

      <title>Stability of global wave front sets by perturbations of frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the Gabor wave front set of ultradistributions in the frame of ultradifferentiable functions. We prove that such a wave front set, defined through a Gabor frame on a regular lattice, is not affected by perturbations of the frame, in two different cases: when we consider $\varepsilon$-perturbations of Christensen type, and when we consider nonstationary Gabor frames.</description>

      <title>Frame eversion and contextual geometric rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove rigidity results describing contextually-constrained maps defined on Grassmannians and manifolds of ordered independent line tuples in finite-dimensional vector or Hilbert spaces. One statement in the spirit of the Fundamental Theorem of Projective Geometry classifies maps between full Grassmannians of two $n$-dimensional Hilbert spaces, $n\ge 3$, preserving dimension and lattice operations for pairs with commuting orthogonal projections, as precisely those induced by semilinear injections unique up to scaling.
  In a different but related direction, denote the manifolds of ordered orthogonal (linearly-independent) $n$-tuples of lines in an $n$-dimensional Hilbert space $V$ by $\mathbb{F}^{\perp}(V)$ (respectively $\mathbb{F}(V)$) and, for partitions $\pi$ of the set $\{1..n\}$, call two tuples $\pi$-linked if the spans along $\pi$-blocks agree. A Wigner-style rigidity theorem proves that the symmetric maps $\mathbb{F}^{\perp}(\mathbb{C}^n)\to \mathbb{F}(\mathbb{C}^n)$, $n\ge 3$ respecting $\pi$-linkage are precisely those induced by semilinear injections, hence by linear or conjugate-linear maps if also assumed measurable. On the other hand, in the $\mathbb{F}(\mathbb{C}^n)$-defined analogue the only other possibility is a qualitatively new type of purely-contextual-global symmetry transforming a tuple $(\ell_i)_i$ of lines into $\left(\left(\bigoplus_{j\ne i}\ell_j\right)^{\perp}\right)_i$.</description>

      <title>The classification of $C(K)$ spaces for countable compacta by positive isomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the classification of spaces of continuous functions $C(K)$ under positive linear maps. For infinite countable compacta, we show that whenever $C(K)$ and $C(L)$ are isomorphic, there exists an isomorphism $T:C(K)\to C(L)$ satisfying either $T\geq 0$ or $T^{-1}\geq 0$. We also prove that for any compact spaces $K$ and $L$, the existence of a positive embedding $T: C(K) \to C(L)$ implies that the Cantor-Bendixson height of $K$ does not exceed the height of $L$. Furthermore, we introduce a one-sided positive Banach-Mazur distance and obtain new estimates for both the classical and positive distances. Notably, we prove the exact formula $d_{BM}(C(\omega^{\omega^\alpha}), C(\omega^{\omega^\alpha n})) = n+\sqrt{(n-1)(n+3)}$.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Dirichlet Laplacian on a perturbed twisted tube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that the spectrum of the Dirichlet Laplacian for a compact perturbation of a three-dimensional, periodically twisted tube is unstable with respect to domain deformations. This means that if the periodically twisted tube is unperturbed, then the spectrum of the Dirichlet Laplacian is purely essential. On the other hand, the perturbation of this domain produces eigenvalues below the essential spectrum. This paper considers the Dirichlet-Laplace operator with a magnetic field. We explicitly prove that the spectrum of the magnetic Laplacian is stable under small and local deformations of the domain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the theory of structured deformations to the setting of linearized elasticity by providing an integral representation for the underlying energy that features bulk and surface contributions. Our derivation is obtained both via a direct approach by means of a global method for relaxation in BD and via an approximation from nonlinear elastic energies associated to {nonsimple} materials.</description>

      <title>New matrix perturbation bounds with relative norm: Perturbation of eigenspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20207v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matrix perturbation bounds (such as Weyl and Davis-Kahan) are used abundantly in many areas of mathematics and data science. Many bounds (such as the above two) involve the spectral norm of the noise matrix and are sharp in worst case analysis.
  In order to refine these classical bounds, we introduce a new parameter, which we refer to as the relative norm. This parameter measures the strength of the action of the noise matrix on the relevant eigenvectors of the ground matrix. It has turned out that in a number of situations, we can use the relative norm as a replacement for the spectral norm. This has led to a number of notable improvements under certain sets of assumptions, which are frequently met in practice. For instance, our new results apply very well in the case when the noise matrix is random.
  For the purpose of our study, we introduce a new method of analysis, which combines the classical contour integral argument with new (combinatorial) ideas. This method is robust and of independent interest.
  In the current paper, we focus on the perturbation of eigenspaces (Davis-Kahan type results). Perturbation bounds for eigenspaces are essential in statistics and theoretical computer science, and thus deserve a special treatment. Furthermore, this will lay the ground for the more technical treatment of general matrix functionals, which appears in a future paper.</description>

      <title>Complex abstract Wiener spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real abstract Wiener spaces (AWS) were originally defined by Gross using measurable norms, as a generalisation of the theory of advanced integral calculus in infinite dimensions as introduced by Cameron and Martin. In this paper we present a rigorous, complete and self-contained general framework for $\mathbb{K}$-AWS, where $\mathbb{K} \in \{\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}\}$ using the language of characteristic functions instead of measurable norms. In particular, we will prove that $X$ is a centred resp. proper $H$-valued Gaussian field over $\mathbb{K}$ iff the covariance function can be written in terms of some non-negative, self-adjoint trace class operator, and that the existence and uniqueness of $X$ is equivalent to the $\mathbb{K}$-AWS. Finally we will relate the $\mathbb{C}$-AWS to the $\mathbb{R}$-AWS by way of a real structure, which is a real linear, complex anti-linear involution on a complex vector space. This allows for a commutative relation between the real and complex Gaussian fields and the real and complex abstract Wiener spaces. We will construct specific examples which fall under this framework like the complex Brownian motion, complex Feynman-Kac formula and complex fractional Gaussian fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove existence and finite degeneracy of ground states of energy forms satisfying logarithmic Sobolev inequalities with respect to non vacuum states of Clifford algebras. We then derive the stability of the ground state with respect to certain unbounded perturbations of the energy form. Finally, we show how this provides an infinitesimal approach to existence and uniqueness of the ground state of Hamiltonians considered by L. Gross in QFT, describing spin $1/2$ Dirac particles subject to interactions with an external scalar field.</description>
