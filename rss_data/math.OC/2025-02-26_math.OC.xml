      <title>A Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) for Garment Line Balancing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This applied research article explores the application of Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) to address line-balancing challenges in the garment industry, focusing on optimizing production processes under multiple constraints. By integrating MILP with Lean Methodology principles, the study demonstrates significant improvements in operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness. The case study, conducted in collaboration with Prof Dr Ray WM Kong, highlights the successful implementation of MILP using IBM CPLEX Studio to optimize production order quantities across online and offline operations. The results reveal a remarkable reduction in labour costs, exceeding 50%, while effectively managing resource capacity and demand constraints. This study not only validates the theoretical underpinnings of MILP in resolving line-balancing issues but also underscores its practical applicability in modernizing garment production. The findings contribute valuable insights into the potential of advanced optimization techniques to enhance competitiveness and sustainability in the garment industry. This abstract succinctly captures the essence of the research, emphasizing the methodology, results, and significance of the study.</description>

      <title>A stochastic smoothing framework for nonconvex-nonconcave min-sum-max problems with applications to Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Applications such as adversarially robust training and Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization (WDRO) can be naturally formulated as min-sum-max optimization problems. While this formulation can be rewritten as an equivalent min-max problem, the summation of max terms introduces computational challenges, including increased complexity and memory demands, which must be addressed. These challenges are particularly evident in WDRO, where existing tractable algorithms often rely on restrictive assumptions on the objective function, limiting their applicability to state-of-the-art machine learning problems such as the training of deep neural networks. This study introduces a novel stochastic smoothing framework based on the \mbox{log-sum-exp} function, efficiently approximating the max operator in min-sum-max problems. By leveraging the Clarke regularity of the max operator, we develop an iterative smoothing algorithm that addresses these computational difficulties and guarantees almost surely convergence to a Clarke/directional stationary point. We further prove that the proposed algorithm finds an $\epsilon$-scaled Clarke stationary point of the original problem, with a worst-case iteration complexity of $\widetilde{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms or is competitive with state-of-the-art methods in solving the newsvendor problem, deep learning regression, and adversarially robust deep learning. The results highlight that our method yields more accurate and robust solutions in these challenging problem settings.</description>

      <title>Lower Complexity Bounds of First-order Methods for Affinely Constrained Composite Non-convex Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many recent studies on first-order methods (FOMs) focus on \emph{composite non-convex non-smooth} optimization with linear and/or nonlinear function constraints. Upper (or worst-case) complexity bounds have been established for these methods. However, little can be claimed about their optimality as no lower bound is known, except for a few special \emph{smooth non-convex} cases. In this paper, we make the first attempt to establish lower complexity bounds of FOMs for solving a class of composite non-convex non-smooth optimization with linear constraints. Assuming two different first-order oracles, we establish lower complexity bounds of FOMs to produce a (near) $\epsilon$-stationary point of a problem (and its reformulation) in the considered problem class, for any given tolerance $\epsilon&gt;0$. Our lower bounds indicate that the existence of a non-smooth convex regularizer can evidently increase the difficulty of an affinely constrained regularized problem over its nonregularized counterpart. In addition, we show that our lower bound of FOMs with the second oracle is tight, with a difference of up to a logarithmic factor from an upper complexity bound established in the extended arXiv version of this paper.</description>

      <title>Distributed Nash Equilibrium Seeking for Constrained Aggregative Games over Jointly Connected and Weight-Balanced Switching Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The property of the communication network and the constraints on the strategic space are two factors that determine the complexity of the distributed Nash equilibrium (DNE) seeking problem. The DNE seeking problem of aggregative games has been studied for unconstrained case over all types of communication networks and for various types of constrained games over static and connected communication networks. In this paper, we investigate the DNE seeking problem for constrained aggregative games over jointly connected and weight-balanced switching networks, which can be directed and disconnected at every time instant. By integrating the projected gradient technique and the dynamic average consensus algorithm, we convert our problem to the stability problem of a well-defined time-varying nonlinear system. By constructing a time-varying Lyapunov's function candidate for this time-varying nonlinear system, we conduct a rigorous Lyapunov's analysis to conclude the exponential stability of this system and hence solve our problem.</description>

      <title>The Golden Ratio Primal-Dual Algorithm with Two New Stepsize Rules for Convex-Concave Saddle Point Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present two stepsize rules for the extended Golden Ratio primal-dual algorithm (E-GRPDA) designed to address structured convex optimization problems in finite-dimensional real Hilbert spaces. The first rule features a nonincreasing primal stepsize that remains bounded below by a positive constant and is updated adaptively at each iteration, eliminating the need for the Lipschitz constant of the gradient of the function and the norm of the operator involved. The second stepsize rule is adaptive, adjusting based on the local smoothness of the smooth component function and the local estimate of the norm of the operator. In other words, we present an adaptive version of the E-GRPDA algorithm. Importantly, both methods avoid the use of backtracking to estimate the operator norm. We prove that E-GRPDA achieves an ergodic sublinear convergence rate with both stepsize rules, evaluated using the primal-dual gap function. Additionally, we establish an R-linear convergence rate for E-GRPDA with the first stepsize rule, under some standard assumptions and with appropriately chosen parameters. Through numerical experiments on various convex optimization problems, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches and compare their performance to the existing ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper is devoted to the existence of weak Pareto solutions and the weak sharp minima at infinity property for a general class of constrained nonsmooth vector optimization problems with unbounded constraint set via asymptotic cones and generalized asymptotic functions. Then we show that these conditions are useful for studying the solution stability of nonconvex vector optimization problems with linear perturbation. We also provide some applications for a subclass of nonsmooth robustly quasiconvex vector optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Kinetic variable-sample methods for stochastic optimization problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss variable-sample strategies and consensus- and kinetic-based particle optimization methods for problems where the cost function represents the expected value of a random mapping. Variable-sample strategies replace the expected value by an approximation at each iteration of the optimization algorithm. We introduce a novel variable-sample inspired time-discrete consensus-type algorithm and demonstrate its computational efficiency. Subsequently, we present an alternative time-continuous kinetic-based description of the algorithm, which allows us to exploit tools of kinetic theory to conduct a comprehensive theoretical analysis. Finally, we test the consistency of the proposed modelling approaches through several numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Single-Source Localization as an Eigenvalue Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for solving the single-source localization problem, specifically addressing the case of trilateration. We formulate the problem as a weighted least-squares problem in the squared distances and demonstrate how suitable weights are chosen to accommodate different noise distributions. By transforming this formulation into an eigenvalue problem, we leverage existing eigensolvers to achieve a fast, numerically stable, and easily implemented solver. Furthermore, our theoretical analysis establishes that the globally optimal solution corresponds to the largest real eigenvalue, drawing parallels to the existing literature on the trust-region subproblem. Unlike previous works, we give special treatment to degenerate cases, where multiple and possibly infinitely many solutions exist. We provide a geometric interpretation of the solution sets and design the proposed method to handle these cases gracefully. Finally, we validate against a range of state-of-the-art methods using synthetic and real data, demonstrating how the proposed method is among the fastest and most numerically stable.</description>

      <title>The Electric Location-Routing Problem: Improved Formulations and Effects of Nonlinear Charging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric Location-Routing models (ELRP) can contribute to the effective planning of electric vehicles (EVs) fleets and charging infrastructure within EV logistic networks because it simultaneously combines routing and location decisions to find optimal solutions to the network design. This study introduces ELRP models that incorporate nonlinear charging process, multiple charging station types and develop new improved formulations to the problem. Existing ELRP models commonly assume a linear charging process and employ a node-based formulation for tracking EV energy and time consumption. In contrast, we propose novel formulations offering alternative approaches for modeling EV energy, time consumption, and nonlinear charging. Through extensive computational experiments, our analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the new formulations, reducing the average gap from 29.1% to 11.9%, yielding improved solutions for 28 out of 74 instances compared to the node-based formulation. Moreover, our findings provide valuable insights into the strategic implications of nonlinear charging in ELRP decision-making, offering new perspectives for planning charging infrastructure in EV logistic networks.</description>

      <title>A hybrid heuristic algorithm for the resource-constrained project scheduling problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a hybrid metaheuristic for the resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP), which integrates a genetic algorithm (GA) and a neighborhood search strategy (NS). The RCPSP consists of a set of activities that follow precedence relationship and consume resources. The resources are renewable, and the amount of the resources is limited. The objective of RCPSP is to find a schedule of the activities to minimize the project makespan. The algorithm uses two crossovers in the GA and two neighborhoods in the NS, as well as a resource ranking heuristic. The computational results with instances from the PCPLIB library validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. We have obtained some of the best average deviations of the solutions from the critical path lower bound. The best heuristic solutions have been updated for some instances from PCPLIB.</description>

      <title>Attractiveness and equal treatment in a group draw</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: National teams from different continents can play against each other only in afew sports competitions. Therefore, a reasonable aim is maximising the number of intercontinental games in world cups, as done in basketball and football, in contrast to handball and volleyball. However, this objective requires additional draw constraints that imply the violation of equal treatment. In addition, the standard draw mechanism is non-uniformly distributed on the set of valid assignments, which may lead to further distortions. Our paper analyses this novel trade-off between attractiveness and fairness through the example of the 2025 World Men's Handball Championship. We introduce a measure of inequality, which enables considering 32 sets of reasonable geographical restrictions to determine the Pareto frontier. The proposed methodology can be used by policy-makers to select the optimal set of draw constraints.</description>

      <title>Convergence rate for linear minimizer-estimators in the moment-sum-of-squares hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective Positivstellens\"atze provide convergence rates for the moment-sum-of-squares (SoS) hierarchy for polynomial optimization (POP). In this paper, we add a qualitative property to the recent advances in those effective Positivstellens\"atze. We consider optimal solutions to the moment relaxations in the moment-SoS hierarchy and investigate the measures they converge to. It has been established that those limit measures are the probability measures on the set of optimal points of the underlying POP. We complement this result by showing that these measures are approached with a convergence rate that transfers from the (recent) effective Positivstellens\"atze. As a special case, this covers estimating the minimizer of the underlying POP via linear pseudo-moments. Finally, we analyze the same situation for another SoS hierarchy - the upper bound hierarchy - and show how convexity can be leveraged.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of Optimal Gait Families for Steering Kinematic Locomoting Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motion planning for locomotion systems typically requires translating high-level rigid-body tasks into low-level joint trajectories-a process that is straightforward for car-like robots with fixed, unbounded actuation inputs but more challenging for systems like snake robots, where the mapping depends on the current configuration and is constrained by joint limits. In this paper, we focus on generating continuous families of optimal gaits-collections of gaits parameterized by step size or steering rate-to enhance controllability and maneuverability. We uncover the underlying geometric structure of these optimal gait families and propose methods for constructing them using both global and local search strategies, where the local method and the global method compensate each other. The global search approach is robust to nonsmooth behavior, albeit yielding reduced-order solutions, while the local search provides higher accuracy but can be unstable near nonsmooth regions. To demonstrate our framework, we generate optimal gait families for viscous and perfect-fluid three-link swimmers. This work lays a foundation for integrating low-level joint controllers with higher-level motion planners in complex locomotion systems.</description>

      <title>Local minimizers in $3$d of vector Allen-Cahn with a quadruple junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For $\Omega$ a perturbation of the unit ball in $\mathbb{R}^3$, we establish the existence of a sequence of local minimizers for the vector Allen-Cahn energy. The sequence converges in $L^1$ to a partition of $\Omega$ whose skeleton is given by a tetrahedral cone and thus contains a quadruple point. This is accomplished by proving that the partition is an isolated local minimizer of the associated $\Gamma$-limit of the sequence of Allen-Cahn functionals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work deals with the generation of theoretical correlation matrices with specific sparsity patterns, associated to graph structures. We present a novel approach based on convex optimization, offering greater flexibility compared to existing techniques, notably by controlling the mean of the entry distribution in the generated correlation matrices. This allows for the generation of correlation matrices that better represent realistic data and can be used to benchmark statistical methods for graph inference.</description>

      <title>Generalized Decision Focused Learning under Imprecise Uncertainty--Theoretical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decision Focused Learning has emerged as a critical paradigm for integrating machine learning with downstream optimisation. Despite its promise, existing methodologies predominantly rely on probabilistic models and focus narrowly on task objectives, overlooking the nuanced challenges posed by epistemic uncertainty, non-probabilistic modelling approaches, and the integration of uncertainty into optimisation constraints. This paper bridges these gaps by introducing innovative frameworks: (i) a non-probabilistic lens for epistemic uncertainty representation, leveraging intervals (the least informative uncertainty model), Contamination (hybrid model), and probability boxes (the most informative uncertainty model); (ii) methodologies to incorporate uncertainty into constraints, expanding Decision-Focused Learning's utility in constrained environments; (iii) the adoption of Imprecise Decision Theory for ambiguity-rich decision-making contexts; and (iv) strategies for addressing sparse data challenges. Empirical evaluations on benchmark optimisation problems demonstrate the efficacy of these approaches in improving decision quality and robustness and dealing with said gaps.</description>

      <title>Social Dynamics: Parameter Estimate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to estimate some parameters of simple social harmonic oscillations modelling U.S. Presidential Approval and Macropartisanship. The harmonic oscillations are simplest solutions of equations of the deterministic social dynamics (Zhdanov M., 2024), relating social bodies positions in the Bayesian space of assessments to noncoercive driving forces acting on these social bodies. In some limits, such as individuals assessing each other, the space may be reduced to just sets of scores, ratings, or indexes used to measure social variables like rates of presidential approval or consumer sentiments. Thereby, relations are established between forces of social attraction and elasticity, considered in the presented paper, and assessments of social bodies including individuals, by other social bodies. The results are applied to estimate parameters of social bodies and their motions from survey data on Presidential Approval, U.S. Senator Approval, and Macropartisanship and provide one more perspective on some well-known issues like what moves macropartisanship and why presidential approval fluctuates.</description>

      <title>Existence of Viscosity Solutions to Abstract Cauchy Problems via Nonlinear Semigroups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we provide conditions for nonlinear monotone semigroups on locally convex vector lattices to give rise to a generalized notion of viscosity solutions to a related nonlinear partial differential equation. The semigroup needs to satisfy a convexity estimate, so called $K$-convexity, w.r.t. another family of operators, defined on a potentially larger locally convex vector lattice. We then show that, under mild continuity requirements on the bounding family of operators, the semigroup yields viscosity solutions to the abstract Cauchy problem given in terms of its generator in the larger locally convex vector lattice. We apply our results to drift control problems for infinite-dimensional L\'evy processes and robust optimal control problems for infinite-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes.</description>

      <title>Controllability and Displacement Analysis of a Three-Link Elastic Microswimmer: A Geometric Control Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the dynamics and controllability of a Purcell three-link microswimmer equipped with passive elastic torsional coils at its joints. By controlling the spontaneous curvature, we analyse the swimmers motion using both linear and weakly nonlinear approaches. Linear analysis reveals steady harmonic solutions for small-amplitude controls but does not predict any net displacement, whereas weakly nonlinear analysis predicts translation along the orientation of the central link. Using geometric control theory, we prove that the system is small time locally controllable near equilibrium and derive displacement estimates for periodic piecewise constant controls, which are validated through numerical simulations. These findings indicate that oscillatory controls can enable motion in all directions near equilibrium. This work offers foundational insights into the controllability of elastic microswimmers, paving the way for advanced motion planning and control strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate $N$-player stochastic differential games with regime switching, where the player dynamics are modulated by a finite-state Markov chain. We analyze the associated Nash system, which consists of a system of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations, and establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions to this system, thereby proving the existence of a unique Nash equilibrium. Additionally, we examine the mean field game problem under the same regime-switching framework. We derive a connection between the Nash equilibrium of the MFG and forward-backward stochastic differential equation with jumps, and demonstrate the unique solvability of this equation. Finally, we explore the propagation of chaos and show that the optimal control obtained from the MFG serves as an approximate Nash equilibrium for the $N$-player problem.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Newton methods for minimizing a quadratic function subject to uncertainty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2109.00072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate quasi-Newton methods for minimizing a strictly convex quadratic function which is subject to errors in the evaluation of the gradients. The methods all give identical behavior in exact arithmetic, generating minimizers of Krylov subspaces of increasing dimensions, thereby having finite termination. A BFGS quasi-Newton method is empirically known to behave very well on a quadratic problem subject to small errors. We also investigate large-error scenarios, in which the expected behavior is not so clear. In particular, we are interested in the behavior of quasi-Newton matrices that differ from the identity by a low-rank matrix, such as a memoryless BFGS method. Our numerical results indicate that for large errors, a memory-less quasi-Newton method often outperforms a BFGS method. We also consider a more advanced model for generating search directions, based on solving a chance-constrained optimization problem. Our results indicate that such a model often gives a slight advantage in final accuracy, although the computational cost is significantly higher.</description>

      <title>A Primal-Dual Extension of the Goemans--Williamson Algorithm for the Weighted Fractional Cut-Covering Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a weighted generalization of the fractional cut-covering problem, which we relate to the maximum cut problem via antiblocker and gauge duality. This relationship allows us to introduce a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation whose solutions may be rounded into fractional cut covers by sampling via the random hyperplane technique. We then provide a $1/\alpha_{\scriptscriptstyle \mathrm{GW}}$-approximation algorithm for the weighted fractional cut-covering problem, where $\alpha_{\scriptscriptstyle \mathrm{GW}} \approx 0.878$ is the approximation factor of the celebrated Goemans--Williamson algorithm for the maximum cut problem. Nearly optimal solutions of the SDPs in our duality framework allow one to consider instances of the maximum cut and the fractional cut-covering problems as primal-dual pairs, where cuts and fractional cut covers simultaneously certify each other's approximation quality. We exploit this relationship to introduce new combinatorial certificates for both problems, as well as a randomized polynomial-time algorithm for producing such certificates. In~particular, we~show how the Goemans--Williamson algorithm implicitly approximates a weighted instance of the fractional cut-covering problem, and how our new algorithm explicitly approximates a weighted instance of the maximum cut problem. We conclude by discussing the role played by geometric representations of graphs in our results, and by proving our algorithms and analyses to be optimal in several aspects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the trade-off between exploitation and exploration in reinforcement learning, we study a continuous-time entropy-regularized mean variance portfolio selection problem in the presence of jumps. We propose an exploratory SDE for the wealth process associated with multiple risky assets which exhibit L\'evy jumps. In contrast to the existing literature, we study the limiting behavior of the natural discrete-time formulation of the wealth process associated to a randomized control in order to derive the continuous-time dynamics. We then show that an optimal distributional control of the continuous-time entropy-regularized exploratory mean-variance problem is Gaussian. The respective optimal wealth process solves a linear SDE whose representation is explicitly obtained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13681v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article introduces a new transcription, change point localization, and mesh refinement scheme for direct optimization-based solutions and for uniform approximation of optimal control trajectories associated with a class of nonlinear constrained optimal control problems (OCPs). The base transcription algorithm for which we establish the refinement algorithm is a direct multiple shooting technique -- $\mathsf{QuITO}$ $\textsf{v.2}$ (Quasi-Interpolation based Trajectory Optimization). The mesh refinement technique consists of two steps -- localization of certain irregular regions in an optimal control trajectory via wavelets, followed by a targeted $h$-refinement approach around such regions of irregularity. Theoretical approximation guarantees on uniform grids are presented for optimal controls with certain regularity properties, along with guarantees of localization of change points by wavelet transform. Numerical illustrations are provided for control profiles involving discontinuities to show the effectiveness of the localization and refinement strategy. We also announce, and make freely available, a new software package based on $\mathsf{QuITO}$ $\textsf{v.2}$ along with all its functionalities for completeness. The package is available at: https://github.com/chatterjee-d/QuITOv2.git.</description>

      <title>Distributed Saddle-Point Dynamics in Multilayer Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multilayer networks provide a more advanced and comprehensive framework for modeling real-world systems compared to traditional single-layer and multiplex networks. Unlike single-layer models, multilayer networks have multiple interacting layers, each with unique topological features. In this paper, we generalize previously developed results for distributed optimization in multiplex networks to the more general case of multilayer networks by employing a tensor formalism to represent multilayer networks and their tensor-Laplacian diffusion dynamics. Although multiplex networks are a special case of multilayer networks, where each layer has the same number of replica nodes connected one-to-one, this generalized framework removes the need for replica nodes, allowing variability in both topology and number of nodes across layers. This approach provides a fully generalized structure for distributed optimization in multilayer networks and enables more complex interlayer connections. We derive the multilayer combinatorial Laplacian tensor and extend the distributed gradient descent algorithm. We provide a theoretical analysis of the convergence of algorithms. Numerical examples validate our approach, and we explore the impact of heterogeneous layer topologies and complex interlayer dynamics on consensus time, underscoring their implications for real-world multilayer systems.</description>

      <title>Improving Surrogate Model Robustness to Perturbations for Dynamical Systems Through Machine Learning and Data Assimilation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09762v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many real-world systems are modelled using complex ordinary differential equations (ODEs). However, the dimensionality of these systems can make them challenging to analyze. Dimensionality reduction techniques like Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) can be used in such cases. However, these reduced order models are susceptible to perturbations in the input. We propose a novel framework that combines machine learning and data assimilation techniques to improving surrogate models to handle perturbations in input data effectively. Through rigorous experiments on dynamical systems modelled on graphs, we demonstrate that our framework substantially improves the accuracy of surrogate models under input perturbations. Furthermore, we evaluate the framework's efficacy on alternative surrogate models, including neural ODEs, and the empirical results consistently show enhanced performance.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we consider the solution of monotone inverse problems using the particular example of a parameter identification problem for a semilinear parabolic PDE. For the regularized solution of this problem, we introduce a total variation based regularization method requiring the solution of a monotone inclusion problem. We show well-posedness in the sense of inverse problems of the resulting regularization scheme. In addition, we introduce and analyze a numerical algorithm for the solution of this inclusion problem using a nested inertial primal dual method. We demonstrate by means of numerical examples the convergence of both the numerical algorithm and the regularization method.</description>

      <title>Learning-to-Optimize with PAC-Bayesian Guarantees: Theoretical Considerations and Practical Implementation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the PAC-Bayesian theory for the setting of learning-to-optimize. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first framework to learn optimization algorithms with provable generalization guarantees (PAC-Bayesian bounds) and explicit trade-off between convergence guarantees and convergence speed, which contrasts with the typical worst-case analysis. Our learned optimization algorithms provably outperform related ones derived from a (deterministic) worst-case analysis. The results rely on PAC-Bayesian bounds for general, possibly unbounded loss-functions based on exponential families. Then, we reformulate the learning procedure into a one-dimensional minimization problem and study the possibility to find a global minimum. Furthermore, we provide a concrete algorithmic realization of the framework and new methodologies for learning-to-optimize, and we conduct four practically relevant experiments to support our theory. With this, we showcase that the provided learning framework yields optimization algorithms that provably outperform the state-of-the-art by orders of magnitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12589v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the factorizability and geometry of transition matrices of multivariate Markov chains. Specifically, we demonstrate that the induced chains on factors of a product space can be regarded as information projections with respect to the Kullback-Leibler divergence. This perspective yields Han-Shearer type inequalities and submodularity of the entropy rate of Markov chains, as well as applications in the context of large deviations and mixing time comparison. As a concrete algorithmic application, we introduce a projection sampler based on the swapping algorithm, which resamples the highest-temperature coordinate at stationarity at each step. We prove that such practice accelerates the mixing time by multiplicative factors related to the number of temperatures and the dimension of the underlying state space when compared with the original swapping algorithm.</description>

Abstract: Factored Markov Decision Processes (fMDPs) are a class of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) in which the states (and actions) can be factored into a set of state (and action) variables and can be encoded compactly using a factored representation. In this paper, we consider a setting where the state of the fMDP is not directly observable, and the agent relies on a set of potential sensors to gather information. Each sensor has a selection cost and the designer must select a subset of sensors under a limited budget. We formulate the problem of selecting a set of sensors for fMDPs (under a budget) to maximize the infinite-horizon discounted return provided by the optimal policy. We show the fundamental result that it is NP-hard to approximate this problem to within any non-trivial factor. Our inapproximability results for optimal sensor selection also extend to a general class of Partially Observable MDPs (POMDPs). We then study the dual problem of budgeted actuator selection (at design-time) to maximize the expected return under the optimal policy. Again, we show that it is NP-hard to approximate this problem to within any non-trivial factor. Furthermore, with explicit examples, we show the failure of greedy algorithms for both the sensor and actuator selection problems and provide insights into the factors that cause these problems to be challenging. Despite this, through extensive simulations, we show the practical effectiveness and near-optimal performance of the greedy algorithm for actuator and sensor selection in many real-world and randomly generated instances.</description>

      <title>Non-maximizing policies that fulfill multi-criterion aspirations in expectation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04385</link>

Abstract: In dynamic programming and reinforcement learning, the policy for the sequential decision making of an agent in a stochastic environment is usually determined by expressing the goal as a scalar reward function and seeking a policy that maximizes the expected total reward. However, many goals that humans care about naturally concern multiple aspects of the world, and it may not be obvious how to condense those into a single reward function. Furthermore, maximization suffers from specification gaming, where the obtained policy achieves a high expected total reward in an unintended way, often taking extreme or nonsensical actions.
  Here we consider finite acyclic Markov Decision Processes with multiple distinct evaluation metrics, which do not necessarily represent quantities that the user wants to be maximized. We assume the task of the agent is to ensure that the vector of expected totals of the evaluation metrics falls into some given convex set, called the aspiration set. Our algorithm guarantees that this task is fulfilled by using simplices to approximate feasibility sets and propagate aspirations forward while ensuring they remain feasible. It has complexity linear in the number of possible state-action-successor triples and polynomial in the number of evaluation metrics. Moreover, the explicitly non-maximizing nature of the chosen policy and goals yields additional degrees of freedom, which can be used to apply heuristic safety criteria to the choice of actions. We discuss several such safety criteria that aim to steer the agent towards more conservative behavior.</description>

      <title>Parallel Execution Fee Mechanisms</title>

Abstract: This paper investigates how pricing schemes can achieve efficient allocations in blockchain systems featuring multiple transaction queues under a global capacity constraint. I model a capacity-constrained blockchain where users submit transactions to different queues -- each representing a submarket with unique demand characteristics -- and decide to participate based on posted prices and expected delays. I find that revenue maximization tends to allocate capacity to the highest-paying queue, whereas welfare maximization generally serves all queues. Optimal relative pricing of different queues depends on factors such as market size, demand elasticity, and the balance between local and global congestion. My results have implications for the implementation of local congestion pricing for evolving blockchain architectures, including parallel transaction execution, directed acyclic graph (DAG)-based systems, and multiple concurrent proposers.</description>

      <title>Distributing Intelligence in 6G Programmable Data Planes for Effective In-Network Intrusion Prevention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24013</link>

Abstract: The problem of attacks on new generation network infrastructures is becoming increasingly relevant, given the widening of the attack surface of these networks resulting from the greater number of devices that will access them in the future (sensors, actuators, vehicles, household appliances, etc.). Approaches to the design of intrusion detection systems must evolve and go beyond the traditional concept of perimeter control to build on new paradigms that exploit the typical characteristics of future 5G and 6G networks, such as in-network computing and intelligent programmable data planes. The aim of this research is to propose a disruptive paradigm in which devices in a typical data plane of a future programmable network have anomaly detection capabilities and cooperate in a fully distributed fashion to act as an ML-enabled Intrusion Prevention System ``embedded" into the network. The reported proof-of-concept experiments demonstrate that the proposed paradigm allows working effectively and with a good level of precision while occupying overall less CPU and RAM resources of the devices involved.</description>

      <title>Sparse Hyperparametric Itakura-Saito NMF via Bi-Level Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The selection of penalty hyperparameters is a critical aspect in Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF), since these values control the trade-off between the reconstruction accuracy and the adherence to desired constraints. In this work, we focus on an NMF problem involving the Itakura-Saito (IS) divergence, effective for extracting low spectral density components from spectrograms of mixed signals, enhanced with sparsity constraints. We propose a new algorithm called SHINBO, which introduces a bi-level optimization framework to automatically and adaptively tune the row-dependent penalty hyperparameters, enhancing the ability of IS-NMF to isolate sparse, periodic signals against noise. Experimental results showed SHINBO ensures precise spectral decomposition and demonstrates superior performance in both synthetic and real-world applications. For the latter, SHINBO is particularly useful, as noninvasive vibration-based fault detection in rolling bearings, where the desired signal components often reside in high-frequency subbands but are obscured by stronger, spectrally broader noise. By addressing the critical issue of hyperparameter selection, SHINBO advances the state-of-the-art in signal recovery for complex, noise-dominated environments.</description>
