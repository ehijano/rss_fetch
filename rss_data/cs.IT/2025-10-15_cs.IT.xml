      <title>Approximate Proximal Operators for Analog Compressed Sensing Using PN-junction Diode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to realize analog compressed sensing, the paper considers approximate proximal operators of the $\ell_1$ and minimax concave penalty (MCP) regularization functions. Specifically, we propose to realize the approximate functions by an electric analog circuit using forward voltage-current (V-I) characteristics of the PN-junction diodes. To confirm the validity of the proposed approach, we employ the proposed approximate proximal operators for the $\ell_1$ and MCP regularization functions in compressed sensing with the proximal gradient method. The sparse reconstruction performance of the algorithms using the proposed approximate proximal operators is demonstrated via computer simulations taking into account the impact of additive noise introduced by analog devices.</description>

      <title>FedLoDrop: Federated LoRA with Dropout for Generalized LLM Fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning (FT) large language models (LLMs) is crucial for adapting general-purpose models to specific tasks, enhancing accuracy and relevance with minimal resources. To further enhance generalization ability while reducing training costs, this paper proposes Federated LoRA with Dropout (FedLoDrop), a new framework that applies dropout to the rows and columns of the trainable matrix in Federated LoRA. A generalization error bound and convergence analysis under sparsity regularization are obtained, which elucidate the fundamental trade-off between underfitting and overfitting. The error bound reveals that a higher dropout rate increases model sparsity, thereby lowering the upper bound of pointwise hypothesis stability (PHS). While this reduces the gap between empirical and generalization errors, it also incurs a higher empirical error, which, together with the gap, determines the overall generalization error. On the other hand, though dropout reduces communication costs, deploying FedLoDrop at the network edge still faces challenges due to limited network resources. To address this issue, an optimization problem is formulated to minimize the upper bound of the generalization error, by jointly optimizing the dropout rate and resource allocation subject to the latency and per-device energy consumption constraints. To solve this problem, a branch-and-bound (B\&amp;B)-based method is proposed to obtain its globally optimal solution. Moreover, to reduce the high computational complexity of the B\&amp;B-based method, a penalized successive convex approximation (P-SCA)-based algorithm is proposed to efficiently obtain its high-quality suboptimal solution. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in mitigating overfitting and improving the generalization capability.</description>

      <title>Hybrid centralized-distributed precoding in fronthaul-constrained CF-mMIMO systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a fronthaul-limited cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) system and propose a hybrid centralized-distributed precoding strategy that dynamically adapts to varying fronthaul and spectral efficiency (SE) requirements. The proposed approach divides users into two groups: one served by centralized precoding and the other by distributed precoding. We formulate a novel optimization problem for user grouping and power control aimed at maximizing the sum SE, subject to fronthaul and per-access point (AP) power constraints. To tackle the problem, we transform it into a tractable form and propose efficient solution algorithms. Numerical results confirm the hybrid scheme's versatility and superior performance, consistently outperforming fully centralized and distributed approaches across diverse system configurations.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions of the Additive Uniform Noise Channel with Peak Amplitude and Cost Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under which condition is quantization optimal? We address this question in the context of the additive uniform noise channel under peak amplitude and cost constraints. We compute analytically the capacity-achieving input distribution as a function of the noise level, the average cost constraint, and the curvature of the cost function. We find that when the cost function is concave, the capacity-achieving input distribution is discrete, whereas when the cost function is convex and the cost constraint is active, the support of the capacity-achieving input distribution spans the entire interval. For the cases of a discrete capacity-achieving input distribution, we derive the analytical expressions for the capacity of the channel.</description>

      <title>CoNet-Rx: Collaborative Neural Networks for OFDM Receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) based methods for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) radio receivers demonstrated higher signal detection performance compared to the traditional receivers. However, the existing DL-based models, usually adapted from computer vision, aren't well suited for wireless communications. These models require high computational resources and memory, and have significant inference delays, limiting their use in resource-constrained settings. Additionally, reducing network size to ease resource demands often leads to notable performance degradation. This paper introduces collaborative networks (CoNet), a novel neural network (NN) architecture designed for OFDM receivers. CoNet uses multiple small ResNet or CNN subnetworks to simultaneously process signal features from different perspectives like capturing channel correlations and interference patterns. These subnetworks fuse their outputs through interaction operations (e.g., element-wise multiplication), significantly enhancing detection performance. Simulation results show CoNet significantly outperforms traditional architectures like residual networks (ResNets) in bit error rate (BER) and reduces inference delay when both nets have the same size and the same computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Depth One Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz as an Approximate Gibbs Distribution Sampler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study numerically investigates the thermal sampling properties of QAOA, the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz which was generalized from the original Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm. Specifically, the ability of QAOA to sample from the Gibbs distribution, equivalently the Boltzmann distribution, defined by a classical Ising model, specifically a fully connected disordered spin glass (Sherrington-Kirkpatrick) model. We focus on two different QAOA mixers; the standard transverse field X mixer, and the Grover mixer. At a QAOA depth of one we examine, for a single full QAOA parameter search space period, the energy landscape, the Shannon entropy landscape of the QAOA probability distribution, and the tradeoff between Boltzmann distribution sampling temperature and error rate (how close to the true Boltzmann distribution is the QAOA distribution). We find that at very high temperatures one-round Grover mixer QAOA can sample from the Boltzmann distribution more accurately than the standard X mixer QAOA at one round. Both X mixer and Grover mixer depth one QAOA can serve as approximate Boltzmann distribution samplers, and how good this approximation is depends heavily on the QAOA angle choice.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Temperature Induced by Adopted Regular Universal Turing Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that an effective temperature naturally emerges from the algorithmic structure of a regular universal Turing machine (UTM), without introducing any external physical parameter. In particular, the redundancy growth of the machine's wrapper language induces a Boltzmann--like exponential weighting over program lengths, yielding a canonical ensemble interpretation of algorithmic probability. This establishes a formal bridge between algorithmic information theory and statistical mechanics, in which the adopted UTM determines the intrinsic ``algorithmic temperature.'' We further show that this temperature approaches its maximal limit under the universal mixture (Solomonoff distribution), and discuss its epistemic meaning as the resolution level of an observer.</description>

      <title>On the Walsh spectra of quadratic APN functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: APN functions play a central role as building blocks in the design of many block ciphers, serving as optimal functions to resist differential attacks. One of the most important properties of APN functions is their linearity, which is directly related to the Walsh spectrum of the function. In this paper, we establish two novel connections that allow us to derive strong conditions on the Walsh spectra of quadratic APN functions. We prove that the Walsh transform of a quadratic APN function $F$ operating on $n=2k$ bits is uniquely associated with a vector space partition of $\mathbb{F}_2^n$ and a specific blocking set in the corresponding projective space $PG(n-1,2)$. These connections allow us to prove a variety of results on the Walsh spectrum of $F$. We prove for instance that $F$ can have at most one component function of amplitude larger than $2^{\frac{3}{4}n}$. We also find the first nontrivial upper bound on the number of bent component functions of a quadratic APN function, and and provide conditions for a function to be CCZ-equivalent to a permutation, based on its number of bent components.</description>

      <title>Tight Quantum Time-Space Tradeoffs for Permutation Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In permutation inversion, we are given a permutation $\pi : [N] \rightarrow [N]$, and want to prepare some advice of size $S$, such that we can efficiently invert any image in time $T$. This is a fundamental cryptographic problem with profound connections to communication complexity and circuit lower bounds.
  In the classical setting, a tight $ST = \tilde{\Theta}(N)$ bound has been established since the seminal work of Hellman (1980) and Yao (1990). In the quantum setting, a lower bound of $ST^2 = \tilde{\Omega}(N)$ is proved by Nayebi, Aaronson, Belovs, and Trevisan (2015) against classical advice, and by Hhan, Xagawa and Yamakawa (2019) against quantum advice. It left open an intriguing possibility that Grover's search can be sped up to time $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{N / S})$.
  In this work, we prove an $ST + T^2 = \Omega(N)$ lower bound for permutation inversion with even quantum advice. This bound matches the best known attacks and shows that Grover's search and the classical Hellman's algorithm cannot be further sped up.
  Our proof combines recent techniques by Liu (2023) and by Rosmanis (2022). Specifically, we first reduce the permutation inversion problem against quantum advice to a variant by Liu's technique, then we analyze this variant via representation theory inspired by Rosmanis (2022).</description>

      <title>Beyond-Diagonal RIS Architecture Design and Optimization under Physics-Consistent Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a promising technology for future wireless communication systems. Conventional RIS is constrained to a diagonal scattering matrix, which limits its flexibility. Recently, beyond-diagonal RIS (BD-RIS) has been proposed as a more general RIS architecture class that allows inter-element connections and shows great potential for performance improvement. Despite extensive progress on BD-RIS, most existing studies rely on simplified channel models that ignore practical electromagnetic (EM) effects such as mutual coupling and impedance mismatching. To address this gap, this paper investigates the architecture design and optimization of BD-RIS under the general physics-consistent model derived with multiport network theory in recent literature. Building on a compact reformulation of this model, we show that band-connected RIS achieves the same channel-shaping capability as fully-connected RIS, which extends existing results obtained for conventional channel models. We then develop optimization methods under the general physics-consistent model; specifically, we derive closed-form solutions for single-input single-output (SISO) systems, propose a globally optimal semidefinite relaxation (SDR)-based algorithm for single-stream multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems, and design an efficient alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based algorithm for multiuser MIMO systems. Using the proposed algorithms, we conduct comprehensive simulations to evaluate the impact of various EM effects and approximations, including mutual coupling among RIS antennas and the commonly adopted unilateral approximation, on system performance.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Agent-Based Model Dynamics via $\epsilon$-Machines and Kolmogorov-Style Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a two-level information-theoretic framework for characterizing the informational organization of Agent-Based Model (ABM) dynamics within the broader paradigm of Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS). At the macro level, a pooled $\epsilon$-machine is reconstructed as a reference model that summarizes the system-wide informational regime. At the micro level, $\epsilon$-machines are reconstructed for each caregiver-elder dyad and variable, and are complemented with algorithm-agnostic Kolmogorov-style measures, including normalized LZ78 complexity and bits per symbol from lossless compression. The resulting feature set $\{h_{\mu}, C_{\mu}, E, \mathrm{LZ78}, \mathrm{bps}\}$ enables distributional analysis, stratified comparisons, and unsupervised clustering across agents and scenarios. This dual-scale design preserves agent heterogeneity while providing an interpretable macro-level baseline, aligning ABM practice with CAS principles of emergence, feedback, and adaptation. A case study on caregiver-elder interactions illustrates the framework's implementation; the results and discussion will be completed following final simulation runs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A defining property of complex systems is that they have multiscale structure. How does this multiscale structure come about? We argue that within systems there emerges a hierarchy of scales that contribute to a system's causal workings. An intuitive example is how a computer can be described at the level of its hardware circuitry (its microscale) but also its machine code (a mesoscale) and all the way up at its operating system (its macroscale). Here we show that even simple systems possess this kind of emergent hierarchy, which usually forms over only a small subset of the super-exponentially many possible scales of description. To capture this formally, we extend the theory of causal emergence (version 2.0) so as to analyze how causal contributions span the full multiscale structure of a system. Our analysis reveals that systems can be classified along a taxonomy of emergence, such as being either top-heavy or bottom-heavy in their causal workings. From this new taxonomy of emergence, we derive a measure of complexity based on a literal notion of scale-freeness (here, when causation is spread equally across the scales of a system) and compare this to the standard network science definition of scale-freeness based on degree distribution, showing the two are closely related. Finally, we demonstrate the ability to engineer not just the degree of emergence in a system, but to control it with pinpoint precision.</description>

      <title>WW-FL: Secure and Private Large-Scale Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.09904v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is an efficient approach for large-scale distributed machine learning that promises data privacy by keeping training data on client devices. However, recent research has uncovered vulnerabilities in FL, impacting both security and privacy through poisoning attacks and the potential disclosure of sensitive information in individual model updates as well as the aggregated global model. This paper explores the inadequacies of existing FL protection measures when applied independently, and the challenges of creating effective compositions.
  Addressing these issues, we propose WW-FL, an innovative framework that combines secure multi-party computation (MPC) with hierarchical FL to guarantee data and global model privacy. One notable feature of WW-FL is its capability to prevent malicious clients from directly poisoning model parameters, confining them to less destructive data poisoning attacks. We furthermore provide a PyTorch-based FL implementation integrated with Meta's CrypTen MPC framework to systematically measure the performance and robustness of WW-FL. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that WW-FL is a promising solution for secure and private large-scale federated learning.</description>

Abstract: Given an inner product space $V$ and a group $G$ of linear isometries, max filtering offers a rich class of convex $G$-invariant maps. In this paper, we identify sufficient conditions under which these maps are locally bilipschitz on $R(G)$, the set of orbits with maximal dimension, with respect to the quotient metric on the orbit space $V/G$. Central to our proof is a desingularization theorem, which applies to open, dense neighborhoods around each orbit in $R(G)/G$ and may be of independent interest.
  As an application, we provide guarantees for stable weighted phase retrieval. That is, we construct componentwise convex bilipschitz embeddings of weighted complex (resp.\ quaternionic) projective spaces. These spaces arise as quotients of direct sums of nontrivial unitary irreducible complex (resp.\ quaternionic) representations of the group of unit complex numbers $S^1\cong \operatorname{SO}(2)$ (resp.\ unit quaternions $S^3\cong \operatorname{SU}(2)$).
  We also discuss the relevance of such embeddings to a nearest-neighbor problem in single-particle cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), a leading technique for resolving the spatial structure of biological molecules.</description>

      <title>One-shot distillation with constant overhead using catalysts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum resource distillation is a fundamental task in quantum information science and technology. Minimizing the overhead of distillation is crucial for the realization of quantum computation and other technologies. Here we explicitly demonstrate how, for general quantum resources, suitably designed quantum catalysts (i.e., auxiliary systems that remain unchanged before and after the process) enable distillation with constant overhead in the practical one-shot setting, thereby overcoming the established logarithmic lower bound for one-shot distillation overhead. In particular, for magic state distillation, our catalysis method paves a path for tackling the diverging batch size problem associated with code-based low-overhead protocols by enabling arbitrary reduction of the protocol size for any desired accuracy. Notably, this first yields constant-overhead magic state distillation methods with controllable protocol size. Furthermore, we demonstrate a tunable spacetime trade-off between overhead and success probability enabled by catalysts which offers significant versatility for practical implementation. Finally, we extend catalysis techniques to dynamical quantum resources and show that channel mutual information determines one-shot catalytic channel transformation, thereby advancing our understanding for both dynamical catalysis and information theory.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Sequence Model: Sample Complexities of Testing, Estimation and LFHT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16734v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Gaussian sequence model, i.e. $X \sim N(\mathbf{\theta}, I_\infty)$, where $\mathbf{\theta} \in \Gamma \subset \ell_2$ is assumed to be convex and compact. We show that goodness-of-fit testing sample complexity is lower bounded by the square-root of the estimation complexity, whenever $\Gamma$ is orthosymmetric. This lower bound is tight when $\Gamma$ is also quadratically convex (as shown by [Donoho et al. 1990, Neykov 2023]). We also completely characterize likelihood-free hypothesis testing (LFHT) complexity for $\ell_p$-bodies, discovering new types of tradeoff between the numbers of simulation and observation samples, compared to the case of ellipsoids (p = 2) studied in [Gerber and Polyanskiy 2024].</description>

      <title>A Generalized Information Bottleneck Theory of Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Information Bottleneck (IB) principle offers a compelling theoretical framework to understand how neural networks (NNs) learn. However, its practical utility has been constrained by unresolved theoretical ambiguities and significant challenges in accurate estimation. In this paper, we present a \textit{Generalized Information Bottleneck (GIB)} framework that reformulates the original IB principle through the lens of synergy, i.e., the information obtainable only through joint processing of features. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence demonstrating that synergistic functions achieve superior generalization compared to their non-synergistic counterparts. Building on these foundations we re-formulate the IB using a computable definition of synergy based on the average interaction information (II) of each feature with those remaining. We demonstrate that the original IB objective is upper bounded by our GIB in the case of perfect estimation, ensuring compatibility with existing IB theory while addressing its limitations. Our experimental results demonstrate that GIB consistently exhibits compression phases across a wide range of architectures (including those with \textit{ReLU} activations where the standard IB fails), while yielding interpretable dynamics in both CNNs and Transformers and aligning more closely with our understanding of adversarial robustness.</description>

      <title>Quantum $f$-divergences and Their Local Behaviour: An Analysis via Relative Expansion Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Any reasonable measure of distinguishability of quantum states must satisfy a data processing inequality, that is, it must not increase under the action of a quantum channel. We can ask about the proportion of information lost or preserved and this leads us to study contraction and expansion coefficients respectively, which can be combined into a single \emph{relative expansion coefficient}. We focus on two prominent families: (i) standard quantum $f$ divergences and (ii) their local (second-order) behaviour, which induces a monotone Riemannian semi-norm (that is linked to the $\chi^2$ divergence). Building on prior work, we identify new families of $f$ for which the global ($f$ divergence) and local (Riemannian) relative expansion coefficients coincide for every pair of channels, and we clarify how exceptional such exact coincidences are. Beyond equality, we introduce an \emph{equivalence} framework that transfers qualitative properties such as strict positivity uniformly across different relative expansion coefficients.
  Leveraging the link between equality in the data processing inequality (DPI) and channel reversibility, we apply our framework of relative expansion coefficients to approximate recoverability of quantum information. Using our relative expansion results for primitive channels, we prove a reverse quantum Markov convergence theorem, converting positive expansion coefficients into quantitative lower bounds on the convergence rate.</description>

      <title>The Algorithmic Regulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10300v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The regulator theorem states that, under certain conditions, any optimal controller must embody a model of the system it regulates, grounding the idea that controllers embed, explicitly or implicitly, internal models of the controlled. This principle underpins neuroscience and predictive brain theories like the Free-Energy Principle or Kolmogorov/Algorithmic Agent theory. However, the theorem is only proven in limited settings. Here, we treat the deterministic, closed, coupled world-regulator system $(W,R)$ as a single self-delimiting program $p$ via a constant-size wrapper that produces the world output string~$x$ fed to the regulator. We analyze regulation from the viewpoint of the algorithmic complexity of the output, $K(x)$. We define $R$ to be a \emph{good algorithmic regulator} if it \emph{reduces} the algorithmic complexity of the readout relative to a null (unregulated) baseline $\varnothing$, i.e., \[ \Delta = K\big(O_{W,\varnothing}\big) - K\big(O_{W,R}\big) &gt; 0. \] We then prove that the larger $\Delta$ is, the more world-regulator pairs with high mutual algorithmic information are favored. More precisely, a complexity gap $\Delta &gt; 0$ yields \[ \Pr\big((W,R)\mid x\big) \le C\,2^{\,M(W{:}R)}\,2^{-\Delta}, \] making low $M(W{:}R)$ exponentially unlikely as $\Delta$ grows. This is an AIT version of the idea that ``the regulator contains a model of the world.'' The framework is distribution-free, applies to individual sequences, and complements the Internal Model Principle. Beyond this necessity claim, the same coding-theorem calculus singles out a \emph{canonical scalar objective} and implicates a \emph{planner}. On the realized episode, a regulator behaves \emph{as if} it minimized the conditional description length of the readout.</description>

      <title>Toward Efficient and Privacy-Aware eHealth Systems: An Integrated Sensing, Computing, and Semantic Communication Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-time and contactless monitoring of vital signs, such as respiration and heartbeat, alongside reliable communication, is essential for modern healthcare systems, especially in remote and privacy-sensitive environments. Traditional wireless communication and sensing networks fall short in meeting all the stringent demands of eHealth, including accurate sensing, high data efficiency, and privacy preservation. To overcome the challenges, we propose a novel integrated sensing, computing, and semantic communication (ISCSC) framework. In the proposed system, a service robot utilises radar to detect patient positions and monitor their vital signs, while sending updates to the medical devices. Instead of transmitting raw physiological information, the robot computes and communicates semantically extracted health features to medical devices. This semantic processing improves data throughput and preserves the clinical relevance of the messages, while enhancing data privacy by avoiding the transmission of sensitive data. Leveraging the estimated patient locations, the robot employs an interacting multiple model (IMM) filter to actively track patient motion, thereby enabling robust beam steering for continuous and reliable monitoring. We then propose a joint optimisation of the beamforming matrices and the semantic extraction ratio, subject to computing capability and power budget constraints, with the objective of maximising both the semantic secrecy rate and sensing accuracy. Simulation results validate that the ISCSC framework achieves superior sensing accuracy, improved semantic transmission efficiency, and enhanced privacy preservation compared to conventional joint sensing and communication methods.</description>
