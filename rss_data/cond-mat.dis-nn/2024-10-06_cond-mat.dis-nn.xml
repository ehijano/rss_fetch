      <title>Analysis of local structure of mechanical and thermal rearrangements in glasses with the atomic cluster expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the structural signatures of excitations in amorphous materials with the atomic cluster expansion (ACE), a universal and complete linear basis of descriptors of the atomic environment. Body-orderd linear classifiers are constructed that distinguish between active and inactive particles in three different model glass formers, in which structural relaxation occurs either through spontaneous thermal activation or by simple shear. We find that in binary mixtures, maximum prediction accuracy is already achieved with very few two-body correlations, while a polymer glass requires both two- and three-body correlations. Trends are robust across both activation mechanisms.</description>

      <title>The scaling behaviour of localised and extended states in one-dimensional tight-binding models with disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate two one-dimensional tight-binding models with disorder that have extended states at zero energy. We use exact and partial diagonalisation of the Hamiltonian to obtain the eigenmodes and the associated participation ratios, and the transfer-matrix method to determine the localisation length. The first model has no on-site disorder, but random couplings. While the participation ratio remains finite at zero energy, the localisation length diverges logarithmically as the energy goes to zero. We provide an intuitive derivation of this logarithmic divergence based on the weak coupling of the two sublattices. The second model has a conserved quantity as the row sums of the Hamiltonian are zero. This model can be represented as a harmonic chain with random couplings, or as a diffusion model on a lattice with random links. We find, in agreement with existing analytical calculations, that the number of system-spanning eigenmodes increases proportionally to the square root of the system size, and we related this power law to other power laws that characterise the scaling behaviour of the eigenmodes, the participation ratio, the localisation length, and their dependence on energy and system size. When disorder is so strong that the smallest hopping terms can be arbitrarily close to zero, all these power laws change, and we show a crossover between the two scaling regimes. All these results are explained by intuitive arguments based on scaling.</description>

      <title>Global and Local Topological Crystalline Markers for Rotation-Symmetric Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crystalline symmetry can be used to predict bulk and surface properties of topological phases. For non-interacting cases, symmetry-eigenvalue analysis of Bloch states at high symmetry points in the Brillouin zone simplifies the calculation of topological quantities. However, when open boundaries are present, and only the point group part of the symmetry group remains, it is unclear how to utilize crystalline symmetries to diagnose band topology. In this work, we introduce topological crystalline markers to characterize bulk topology in $C_n$-symmetric ($n=2,3,4,6$) crystalline insulators and superconductors with and without translation symmetry. These markers are expressed using a crystalline symmetry operator and the ground state projector, and are defined locally in position space. First, we provide a general method to calculate topological markers in periodic systems with an arbitrary number of unit cells. This includes cases where momentum quantization does not span all necessary high-symmetry points for computing the topological quantities, which we address using twisted boundary conditions. Second, we map these markers to the Chern number, bulk polarization, and sector charge for two-dimensional $C_n$-symmetric insulators in symmetry classes A, AI, AII, and superconductors in class D. Finally, we show how to numerically calculate the markers in finite-size systems with translation-symmetry (and even rotation-symmetry) breaking defects, and how to diagnose the bulk topology from the marker. Our results demonstrate how to compute bulk topological crystalline invariants locally in position space, thereby providing broader scope to diagnosing bulk crystalline topology that works even in inhomogeneous systems where there is no global rotation symmetry.</description>

      <title>Formation of Representations in Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding neural representations will help open the black box of neural networks and advance our scientific understanding of modern AI systems. However, how complex, structured, and transferable representations emerge in modern neural networks has remained a mystery. Building on previous results, we propose the Canonical Representation Hypothesis (CRH), which posits a set of six alignment relations to universally govern the formation of representations in most hidden layers of a neural network. Under the CRH, the latent representations (R), weights (W), and neuron gradients (G) become mutually aligned during training. This alignment implies that neural networks naturally learn compact representations, where neurons and weights are invariant to task-irrelevant transformations. We then show that the breaking of CRH leads to the emergence of reciprocal power-law relations between R, W, and G, which we refer to as the Polynomial Alignment Hypothesis (PAH). We present a minimal-assumption theory demonstrating that the balance between gradient noise and regularization is crucial for the emergence the canonical representation. The CRH and PAH lead to an exciting possibility of unifying major key deep learning phenomena, including neural collapse and the neural feature ansatz, in a single framework.</description>

      <title>Exactly solvable quantum spin-glass model with 1RSB-fullRSB transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel quantum spin-glass model, a Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with a transverse mean-field type random magnet. We rigorously derive the exact expression of the free energy of this model at the entire parameter region. The obtained exact solution implies the existence of a 1RSB-fullRSB transition at low temperatures. Our technique can be applied to general classical spin models, telling that any solvable classical spin model has its solvable quantum counterpart.</description>

      <title>Predicting macroscopic properties of amorphous monolayer carbon via pair correlation function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Establishing the structure-property relationship in amorphous materials has been a long-term grand challenge due to the lack of a unified description of the degree of disorder. In this work, we develop SPRamNet, a neural network based machine-learning pipeline that effectively predicts structure-property relationship of amorphous material via global descriptors. Applying SPRamNet on the recently discovered amorphous monolayer carbon, we successfully predict the thermal and electronic properties. More importantly, we reveal that a short range of pair correlation function can readily encode sufficiently rich information of the structure of amorphous material. Utilizing powerful machine learning architectures, the encoded information can be decoded to reconstruct macroscopic properties involving many-body and long-range interactions. Establishing this hidden relationship offers a unified description of the degree of disorder and eliminates the heavy burden of measuring atomic structure, opening a new avenue in studying amorphous materials.</description>

      <title>A low-dimensional model for adaptive networks of spiking neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze a large ensemble of Quadratic Integrate-and-Fire (QIF) neurons with heterogeneous input currents and adaptation variables. For a particular class of adaptation, which we call quadratic spike-frequency adaptation (QSFA), the high-dimensional system admits an exact reduction to a low-dimensional system of ordinary differential equations for three mean-field variables: the population's firing rate, the mean membrane potential, and a mean adaptation variable. These low-dimensional firing rate equations (FRE) reveal an important generic feature of heterogeneous networks with spike frequency adaptation: Both the center and the width of the distribution of the neurons' firing frequencies are reduced, and this largely favors the emergence of collective synchronization in the network. These results are confirmed by the bifurcation analysis of the FRE, which faithfully describe the collective dynamics of the spiking neuron network, including collective oscillations, bursting, and macroscopic chaos.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation-dissipation theorems and the measurement of the Onsager coefficients for two-phase flow in porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new methodology for the experimental measurement of the Onsager coefficients of porous media flows by application of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. The experimental setup consists of a steady-state flow condition in which two incompressible fluids are simultaneously injected into a modified Hele-Shaw cell. The cell is transparent and allows direct visualization of the dynamics via regular optical imaging methods. The fluctuations in the phase saturations are obtained and, by computing the temporal correlations of their time derivatives, we gain access to the Onsager coefficients. This work gives experimental grounding to recent theoretical development on the applications of the fluctuation-dissipation theorems to porous media flows.</description>

      <title>Infinite Limits of Multi-head Transformer Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze various scaling limits of the training dynamics of transformer models in the feature learning regime. We identify the set of parameterizations that admit well-defined infinite width and depth limits, allowing the attention layers to update throughout training--a relevant notion of feature learning in these models. We then use tools from dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) to analyze various infinite limits (infinite key/query dimension, infinite heads, and infinite depth) which have different statistical descriptions depending on which infinite limit is taken and how attention layers are scaled. We provide numerical evidence of convergence to the limits and discuss how the parameterization qualitatively influences learned features.</description>

      <title>Subspace-thermal discrete time crystals from phase transitions between different n-tuple discrete time crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02848v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new Floquet time crystal model that responds in arbitrary multiples of the driving period. Such an $n$-tuple discrete time crystal is theoretically constructed by permuting spins in a disordered chain and is well suited for experiment implementations. Transitions between these time crystals with different periods give rise to a novel phase of matter that we call subspace-thermal discrete time crystals, where states within subspaces are fully thermalized at an early time. However, the whole system still robustly responds to the periodic driving subharmonically, with a period being the greatest common divisor of the original two periods. Existing theoretical analysis from many-body localization fails to understand the rigidity of such subspace-thermal time crystal phases. To resolve this, we develop a new theoretical framework from the perspective of the robust $2\pi/n$ quasi-energy gap. Its robustness is analytically proved, under a reasonable conjecture, by a new perturbation theory for unitary operators. The proof applies beyond the models considered here to other existing discrete time crystals realized by kicking disordered systems, thus offering a systematic way to construct new discrete time crystal models. We also introduce the notion of DTC-charges that allow us to probe the observables that spontaneously break the time-translation symmetry in both the regular discrete time crystals and subspace-thermal discrete time crystals. Moreover, our discrete time crystal models can be generalized to higher spin magnitudes or qudits, as well as higher spatial dimensions.</description>
