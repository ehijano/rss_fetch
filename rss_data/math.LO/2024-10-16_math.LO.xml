      <title>Improving Cauchy's Theorem in Constructive Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In his constructive development of complex analysis, Errett Bishop used restrictive notions of homotopy and simple connectedness. Working in Bishop-style constructive mathematics, we prove Cauchy's integral theorem using the standard notions of such properties. In consequence, Bishop's theorems in Chapters 5 of [1, 2] hold under our more normal, less restrictive, definitions.</description>

      <title>Proof-theoretic Semantics for First-order Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sandqvist gave a proof-theoretic semantics (P-tS) for classical logic (CL) that explicates the meaning of the connectives without assuming bivalance. Later, he gave a semantics for intuitionistic propositional logic (IPL). While soundness in both cases is proved through standard techniques, the proof completeness for CL is complex and somewhat obscure, but clear and simple for IPL. Makinson gave a simplified proof of completeness for classical propositional logic (CPL) by directly relating the the P-tS to the logic's extant truth-functional semantics. In this paper, we give an elementary, constructive, and native -- in the sense that it does not presuppose the model-theoretic interpretation of classical logic -- proof of completeness the P-tS of CL using the techniques applies for IPL. Simultaneously, we give a proof of soundness and completeness for first-order intuitionistic logic (IL).</description>

      <title>Elementary equivalence of endomorphism rings and automorphism groups of periodic Abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that the endomorphism rings End A and End A' of periodic infinite Abelian groups A and A' are elementarily equivalent if and only if the endomorphism rings of their p-components are elementarily equivalent for all primes p. Additionally, we show that the automorphism groups Aut A and Aut A' of periodic Abelian groups A and A' that do not have 2-components and do not contain cocyclic p-components are elementarily equivalent if and only if, for any prime p, the corresponding p-components A_p and A_p' of A and A' are equivalent in second-order logic if they are not reduced, and are equivalent in second-order logic bounded by the cardinalities of their basic subgroups if they are reduced. For such groups A and A', their automorphism groups are elementarily equivalent if and only if their endomorphism rings are elementarily equivalent, and the automorphism groups of the corresponding p-components for all primes p are elementarily equivalent.</description>

      <title>Normalisation for Negative Free Logics without and with Definite Descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proves normalisation theorems for intuitionist and classical negative free logic, without and with the $\invertediota$ operator for definite descriptions. Rules specific to free logic give rise to new kinds of maximal formulas additional to those familiar from standard intuitionist and classical logic. When $\invertediota$ is added it must be ensured that reduction procedures involving replacements of parameters by terms do not introduce new maximal formulas of higher degree than the ones removed. The problem is solved by a rule that permits restricting these terms in the rules for $\forall$, $\exists$ and $\invertediota$ to parameters or constants. A restricted subformula property for deductions in systems without $\invertediota$ is considered. It is improved upon by an alternative formalisation of free logic building on an idea of Ja\'skowski's. In the classical system the rules for $\invertediota$ require treatment known from normalisation for classical logic with $\lor$ or $\exists$. The philosophical significance of the results is also indicated.</description>

      <title>Logical Structure on Inverse Functor Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by recent work on the categorical semantics of dependent type theories, we investigate the following question: When is logical structure (crucially, dependent-product and subobject-classifier structure) induced from a category to categories of diagrams in it? Our work offers several answers, providing a variety of conditions on both the category itself and the indexing category of diagrams. Additionally, motivated by homotopical considerations, we investigate the case when the indexing category is equipped with a class of weak equivalences and study conditions under which the localization map induces a structure-preserving functor between presheaf categories.</description>

      <title>Measurable splittings and the measured group theoretic structure of wreath products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a countable group that admits an essential measurable splitting (for instance, any group measure equivalent to a free product of nontrivial groups).
  We show that, for any two nontrivial measure equivalent groups $A$ and $B$, the wreath product groups $A\wr\Gamma$ and $B\wr\Gamma$ are orbit equivalent -- this is interesting even in the case when the groups $A$ and $B$ are finite.
  On the other hand, we show that certain wreath product actions are not even stably orbit equivalent if $\Gamma$ is instead assumed to be a sofic icc group that is Bernoulli superrigid, and $A$ and $B$ have different cardinalities.</description>

      <title>Relation algebras containing Thompson groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The connections between Tarski's relation algebras and Thompson's groups F, T, V, and his monoid M are reviewed here, along with Jonsson-Tarski algebras, fork algebras, true pairing algebras, and tabular relation algebras. All of these algebras are related to the finitization problem and to Tarski's formalization of set theory without variables.
  Most of the technical details occur in the variety of J-algebras, which is obtained from relation algebras by omitting union and complementation and adopting a set of axioms created by Jonsson. Every relation algebra or J-algebra that contains a pair of conjugated quasiprojections satisfying the Domain and Unicity conditions, such as those that arise from Jonsson-Tarski algebras or fork algebras, will also contain homomorphic images of F, T, V, and M.
  The representability of tabular relation algebras is extended here to J-algebras, using a notion of tabularity that is equivalent among relation algebras to the original definition.</description>

      <title>Conjugating trivial automorphisms of $\mathcal P(\mathbb N)/\mathrm{Fin}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A trivial automorphism of the Boolean algebra $\mathcal P(\mathbb N) / \mathrm{Fin}$ is an automorphism induced by the action of some function $\mathbb N \rightarrow \mathbb N$. In models of forcing axioms all automorphisms are trivial, and therefore two trivial automorphisms are conjugate if and only if they have the same (modulo finite) cycle structure. We show that the Continuum Hypothesis implies that two trivial automorphisms are conjugate if and only if there are neither first-order obstructions nor index obstructions for their conjugacy. This is equivalent to given trivial automorphisms being conugate in some forcing extension of the universe.
  To each automorphism $\alpha$ of $\mathcal P(\mathbb N) / \mathrm{Fin}$ we associate the first-order structure $\mathfrak{A}_\alpha=(\mathcal P(\mathbb N) / \mathrm{Fin},\alpha)$ and compute the existential theories of these structures.
  These results are applied to resolve a question of Braga, Farah, and Vignati and prove that there are coarse metric spaces $X$ and $Y$ such that the isomorphism between their uniform Roe coronas is independent from $\mathsf{ZFC}$.</description>
