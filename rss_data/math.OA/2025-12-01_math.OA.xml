      <title>Delocalised traces on Hecke algebras of right-angled, hyperbolic type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For every Hecke C*-algebra of right-angled, hyperbolic type, we construct a smooth subalgebra to which traces associated with arbitrary conjugacy classes in the associated Coxeter group extend. We calculate the pairing with K-theory of the delocalised traces arising this way, showing that it is faithful on K-theory.</description>

      <title>Quantum graphs in infinite-dimensions: Hilbert--Schmidts and Hilbert modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop two approaches to Quantum (or Non-commutative) Graphs based on arbitrary von Neumann algebras $M\subseteq\mathcal B(H)$: one looking at operator bimodules of Hilbert--Schmidt (instead of bounded) operators, and the second looking at Quantum Adjacency Operators. Hilbert--Schmidt Quantum Graphs relate to Weaver's picture of Quantum Graphs in a complex way: by defining certain hull operations, we find a bijection between certain subsets of both objects. Given a nfs weight $\varphi$ on $M$ the operator-valued weight $\varphi^{-1}$ can be defined, as considered by Wasilewski for direct sums of matrix algebras. We show how to build a natural self-dual Hilbert $C^*$-module from this, which mediates a bijection between HS Quantum Relations and projections $e\in M\bar\otimes M^{\text{op}}$. When $e$ is integrable for the slice-map $\operatorname{id}\otimes\varphi^{\text{op}}$ there is a related normal CP map $A\colon M\to M$: this is a Quantum Adjacency Operator, which has a Kraus operator representation built from the HS Quantum Relation. When $e$ and its tensor swap map are both integrable, we find certain symmetries of $A$. We illustrate our theory by a careful consideration of certain examples, including detailed links with the finite-dimensional setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing new techniques at the interface of geometric group theory and von Neumann algebras, we identify the first examples of ICC groups $G$ whose von Neumann algebras are McDuff and exhibit a new rigidity phenomenon, termed McDuff superrigidity: an arbitrary group $H$ satisfying $\mathcal{L}(H)\cong \mathcal{L}(G)$ decomposes as $H \cong G\times A$ for an ICC amenable group $A$.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Forms, Real Zeros and Echoes of the Spectral Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a real distribution $\mathcal{D}$ on the interval $[0,L]$ with $\tilde{\mathcal{ D}}$ the associated even distribution on the interval $[-L, L]$, we prove that if the associated quadratic form with Schwartz kernel $\tilde{\mathcal{D}}(x - y)$ defines a lower-bounded selfadjoint operator on $L^2([-\frac{L}{2}, \frac{L}{2}])$, whose lowest spectral value $\lambda$ is a simple, isolated eigenvalue with even eigenfunction $\xi$, then all the zeros of the entire function $\widehat \xi(z)$, the Fourier transform of $\xi$, lie on the real line. The proof proceeds in five steps. (1) We give a C*-algebraic proof of a corollary of Carath\'eodory-Fej\'er's 1911 structure Theorem for Toeplitz matrices: if $T \in M_n(\mathbb{C})$ is a Hermitian, positive semidefinite Toeplitz matrix of rank $n - 1$, and $\xi \in \ker T$, then the polynomial $P(z) = \sum \xi_j z^j$ has all its zeros on the unit circle. (2) We formulate and prove a continuous analogue of this result, replacing the Toeplitz matrix with a convolution operator with continuous kernel $h(x - y)$, and the polynomial $P(z)$ with the Fourier transform of the eigenfunction corresponding to the largest eigenvalue. (3) We analyze finite-dimensional truncations of the quadratic forms defined by real, even distributions $\mathcal{D}$ on $[-L, L]$, and observe that the resulting matrices exhibit a structure previously encountered in perturbative expansions of the spectral action. (4) We establish an analogue of Carath\'eodory-Fej\'er's corollary for matrices of this specific structure, thereby extending the zero localization result beyond the classical Toeplitz setting. (5) Finally, we apply a classical theorem of Hurwitz concerning the zeros of uniform limits of holomorphic functions to deduce the general result stated above.</description>

      <title>$K$-theory of ghostly ideals for $\ell^p$-coarsely embeddable spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a metric space with bounded geometry. We show that if $X$ admits a coarse embedding into an $\ell^p$-space ($1 \le p &lt; \infty$), then the canonical inclusion from any geometric ideal to the corresponding ghostly ideal induces an isomorphism in $K$-theory. Our approach relies on the construction of twisted Roe algebras, avoiding the use of groupoid techniques. As consequences, we deduce the relative (maximal) coarse Baum-Connes conjectures for such spaces, as well as the Operator Norm Localization property for finite rank projections ($ONL_{\mathcal{P}_{Fin}}$).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a geometric account of Harish-Chandra's principle that a tempered irreducible representation of a real reductive group is either square-integrable modulo center, or embeddable in a representation that is parabolically induced from such a representation. Our approach uses the Satake compactification, an associated groupoid that was constructed in the first paper of this series, and its $C^*$-algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The (maximal) Satake compactification associated to a real reductive group $G$ is the closure of the symmetric space of all maximal compact subgroups of $G$ within the compact space of all closed subgroups of $G$. We shall present three different views of a groupoid that may be associated to the Satake compactification. To begin, we shall define our Satake groupoid, as we shall call it, as a topological groupoid, and as a special case of a general construction of Omar Mohsen. Then we shall give a Lie-theoretic account of the Satake groupoid, borrowing from work of Toshio Oshima. Finally we shall identify the Satake groupoid with the purely geometric $b$-groupoid of the Satake compactification, using the structure of the compactification as a smooth manifold with corners. In a subsequent paper we shall use the Satake groupoid to present a new proof of Harish-Chandra's principle, that all the tempered irreducible representations of $G$ may be constructed from discrete series representations using parabolic induction.</description>

      <title>Zeta Spectral Triples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and investigate a strategy toward a proof of the Riemann Hypothesis based on a spectral realization of its non-trivial zeros. Our approach constructs self-adjoint operators obtained as rank-one perturbations of the spectral triple associated with the scaling operator on the interval $[\lambda^{-1}, \lambda]$. The construction only involves the Euler products over the primes $p \leq x = \lambda^2$ and produces self-adjoint operators whose spectra coincide, with striking numerical accuracy, with the lowest non-trivial zeros of $\zeta(1/2 + i s)$, even for small values of $x$.
  The theoretical foundation rests on the framework introduced in "Spectral triples and zeta-cycles" (Enseign. Math. 69 (2023), no. 1-2, 93-148), together with the extension in "Quadratic Forms, Real Zeros and Echoes of the Spectral Action" (Commun. Math. Phys. (2025)) of the classical Caratheodory-Fejer theorem for Toeplitz matrices, which guarantees the necessary self-adjointness.
  Numerical experiments show that the spectra of the operators converge towards the zeros of $\zeta(1/2 + i s)$ as the parameters $N, \lambda \to \infty$. A rigorous proof of this convergence would establish the Riemann Hypothesis. We further compute the regularized determinants of these operators and discuss the analytic role they play in controlling and potentially proving the above result by showing that, suitably normalized, they converge towards the Riemann $\Xi$ function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on the free-probability stochastic control framework introduced in arXiv:2502.17329, we connect optimal control problems for $n \times n$ random matrix ensembles with their infinite-dimensional, free-probability analogues. Under natural convexity hypotheses, we prove that the non-commutative value function captures the large-$n$ limit of the corresponding finite-matrix control problems. As an application, we give a new perspective on the Laplace principle for convex functionals in the theory of large deviations for random matrices.</description>

      <title>On a Rokhlin property for abelian group actions on C$^*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study the so-called abelian Rokhlin property for actions of locally compact, abelian groups on C$^*$-algebras. We propose a unifying framework for obtaining various duality results related to this property. The abelian Rokhlin property coincides with the known Rokhlin property for actions by the reals (i.e., flows), but is not identical to the known Rokhlin property in general. The main duality result we obtain is a generalisation of a duality for flows proved by Kishimoto in the case of Kirchberg algebras. We consider also a slight weakening of the abelian Rokhlin property, which allows us to show that all traces on the crossed product C$^*$-algebra are canonically induced from invariant traces on the the coefficient C$^*$-algebra.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Systems with Bounded Condition and $C^{*}$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study abstract dynamical systems with discrete phase spaces. One example of such a system is induced by the $3 x{+}1$-map on the set of all natural numbers, also known as the Collatz map. Our main focus is on dynamical systems induced by maps on countable discrete sets that satisfy a bounded condition. When these maps satisfy the bounded and a separating conditions, a minimality of the induced dynamical systems is equivalent to the irreducibility of certain $C^{*}$-algebras on certain Hilbert spaces. For a map $f$ on a general discrete phase space, we consider $f$-invariant sets and investigate their properties. When the phase space is countable and the map satisfies the bounded condition, we construct an order-preserving injection from the family of $f$-invariant sets to the family of reducing subspaces for the corresponding $C^{*}$-algebra. By introducing the totally uniqueness condition for $f$, we show that this injection is a bijection if $f$ satisfies this condition. This condition is crucial in providing a symbolic representation of the dynamical system induced by $f$, and we discuss the relationship between this symbolic representation and that of a topological dynamical system.</description>

      <title>Characterizing convex trace ranges in finite atomic von Neumann algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper is devoted to characterizing convex trace ranges in finite atomic von Neumann algebras. The main result provides us with the necessary and sufficient condition for the range of a faithful normal trace on a finite atomic von Neumann algebra to be convex. In order to prove this result we will prove the following result, which has independent interest. Let ${\bf a}=(a_1, \ldots, a_n, \ldots)$ be a non-increasing positive sequence such that $\sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty a_n=1.$ Then each real number $0\le r \le 1$ can be represented in the form \( r=\sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty \varepsilon_n a_n, \,\,\, \varepsilon_n \in \{0,1\}, n\ge 1, \) if and only if the sequence ${\bf a}$ satisfies \(a_n \le 1-\sum\limits_{k=1}^n a_k \) for all $n\ge 1.$ A set $K$ of all sequences that satisfy the last property can be represented as a convex weak-compact subset of $\ell_1 = c_0^*$. We will describe the set of all extreme points of $K.$</description>
