      <title>Inverse Engineering of Optical Constants in Photochromic Micron-Scale Hybrid Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photochromic materials enable dynamic optical modulation through reversible transitions between distinct absorption states, with broad potential for smart windows, adaptive optics, and reconfigurable photonic devices. Micron-scale photochromic hybrid films present a particularly attractive platform for these applications, combining straightforward preparation with substantial optical modulation and scalability for high-volume fabrication. However, rational design of such films remains fundamentally constrained by the absence of well-defined optical constants. Unlike homogeneous thin films, micron-scale hybrid photochromic materials comprise active particles dispersed non-uniformly within polymer matrices. Conventional first-principles electromagnetic simulations face substantial computational costs and discrepancies between simulated and experimental particle distributions. Here, we introduce a data-driven framework that extracts effective optical constants directly from minimal experimental transmittance measurements. Our dual-state effective model approximates the complex inhomogeneous photochromic layer as a compressed homogeneous medium characterized by pseudo-refractive indices and pseudo-extinction coefficients for both pristine and UV-irradiated states. Through systematic optimization against experimental data from tungsten oxide-polyvinylpyrrolidone hybrid films, we determine wavelength-dependent pseudo-optical constants and compression ratios that enable accurate prediction of optical modulation within the tested thickness range. Our methodology establishes a framework for engineering hybrid photochromic systems and demonstrates how data-driven modeling can overcome limitations in characterizing complex nanostructured materials.</description>

      <title>Piezoelectric MEMS Phase Modulator for Silicon Nitride Platform in the Visible Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active photonic integrated circuits (PICs) in the visible spectrum are essential for on-chip applications, requiring low-loss waveguides with broad transparency and efficient, low-power phase modulation. Here, we demonstrate a compact, ultra-low-power phase modulator based on a silicon nitride (Si$_3$N$_4$) waveguide integrated with thin-film lead zirconate titanate (PZT) that actuates a bridge-type MEMS. The suspended actuator exploits PZT's strong piezoelectric effect to induce mechanically driven phase shifts, enabling efficient modulation in a Mach--Zehnder interferometer. For 3~mm and 5~mm modulators, phase shifts of $1.45\pi$ and $2.5\pi$ are achieved at 10~V, corresponding to a scalability metric ($V_{\pi}\cdot L$) of 2.25~V$\cdot$cm at 635~nm. This represents an order-of-magnitude improvement in scalability over stress-optic PZT modulators. The devices also exhibit ultralow power consumption ($\sim 12\,\mathrm{nW}$), $\sim 5\,\mathrm{ms}$ rise time, and optical loss $&lt; 0.75\,\mathrm{dB/cm}$. Furthermore, we demonstrate on-chip beam shaping.</description>

      <title>AIFL: A Global Daily Streamflow Forecasting Model Using Deterministic LSTM Pre-trained on ERA5-Land and Fine-tuned on IFS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable global streamflow forecasting is essential for flood preparedness and water resource management, yet data-driven models often suffer from a performance gap when transitioning from historical reanalysis to operational forecast products. This paper introduces AIFL (Artificial Intelligence for Floods), a deterministic LSTM-based model designed for global daily streamflow forecasting. Trained on 18,588 basins curated from the CARAVAN dataset, AIFL utilises a novel two-stage training strategy to bridge the reanalysis-to-forecast domain shift. The model is first pre-trained on 40 years of ERA5-Land reanalysis (1980-2019) to capture robust hydrological processes, then fine-tuned on operational Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) control forecasts (2016-2019) to adapt to the specific error structures and biases of operational numerical weather prediction. To our knowledge, this is the first global model trained end-to-end within the CARAVAN ecosystem. On an independent temporal test set (2021-2024), AIFL achieves high predictive skill with a median modified Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE') of 0.66 and a median Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) of 0.53. Benchmarking results show that AIFL is highly competitive with current state-of-the-art global systems, achieving comparable accuracy while maintaining a transparent and reproducible forcing pipeline. The model demonstrates exceptional reliability in extreme-event detection, providing a streamlined and operationally robust baseline for the global hydrological community.</description>

      <title>Event Topology-based Visual Microphone for Amplitude and Frequency Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate vibration measurement is vital for analyzing dynamic systems across science and engineering, yet noncontact methods often balance precision against practicality. Event cameras offer high-speed, low-light sensing, but existing approaches fail to recover vibration amplitude and frequency with sufficient accuracy. We present an event topology-based visual microphone that reconstructs vibrations directly from raw event streams without external illumination. By integrating the Mapper algorithm from topological data analysis with hierarchical density-based clustering, our framework captures the intrinsic structure of event data to recover both amplitude and frequency with high fidelity. Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements over prior methods and enable simultaneous recovery of multiple sound sources from a single event stream, advancing the frontier of passive, illumination-free vibration sensing.</description>

      <title>From cathode to anode: Understanding lithium loss in 21700-type Ni-rich NCM||Graphite-SiOx cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Moving to larger cell formats in lithium-ion batteries increases overall useable energy but introduces inhomogeneities that influence aging. This study investigates degradation in 21700-type cells with NCM cathodes and graphite/SiOx anodes under cyclic aging, using in operando neutron diffraction, neutron depth profiling, and X-ray computed tomography. Prolonged cycling causes lithium loss, observed on the cathode side as reduced NCM unit cell change during cycling. On the anode side, this loss appears as diminished formation of the fully lithiated LiC6 phase. Differential voltage analysis during aging reveals not only lithium inventory loss but also active anode material loss. Diffraction data confirm this through shifts in the LiC12 transition and LiC6 onset to lower capacities, requiring less lithium to trigger the transitions. Lithium concentration profiles across electrode positions show depletion in the cathode, while elevated concentrations in the anode indicate increased solid-electrolyte interphase formation, suggesting lithium consumed from the cathode deposits on the anode side. CT measurements show that intrinsic inhomogeneities inside the cells have a stronger influence on the macroscopic structure than aging-induced changes, indicating that the observed capacity fade primarily originates from microscopic degradation processes within the electrodes. Overall, the combined techniques provide direct evidence of lithium loss, active material degradation, and spatially dependent aging mechanisms in large-format cylindrical cells.</description>

      <title>Compositional and morphological study of a Nuragic bronze figurine with neutron diffraction and neutron tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nuragic figurines are rare and unique examples of the mastery achieved by Sardinian craftsmen in the early Iron Age. These bronze artefacts were most likely cast using the lost wax technique: the shapes were moulded with relative ease, and even complex figures could be represented. However, the manufacturing process was not always a single-step procedure: in some cases, the parts of the model were moulded separately and then assembled together. Therefore, the analytical study of Nuragic bronzes can help to understand the specific casting methods and to evaluate the techniques implemented by Sardinian craftsmen to produce such complex objects. In recent years, Time of Flight Neutron Diffraction (Tof-ND) and Neutron Imaging (NI) have proven to be among the most effective methods for non-invasive studies. Neutron diffraction and neutron imaging provide complementary quantitative and morphological information that can be the key to understanding the casting processes. In this work, the results of the analysis of a bronze figurine will be reported. The statuette represents a Nuragic warrior and was made available by the Soprintendenza Archeologia Belle Arti e Paesaggio per le province di Sassari e Nuoro (Sassari,Italy).</description>
