      <title>Characterizing second-order topological insulators via entanglement topological invariant in two-dimensional systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher-order topological insulators have attracted significant interest in recent years. However, identifying a universal topological invariant capable of characterizing higher-order topology remains challenging. Here, we propose a entanglement topological invariant designed to characterize secondorder topological systems. This entanglement topological invariant captures the entanglement of topological corner states under open boundary conditions by employing a bipartite entanglement entropy method. In several representative models, the entanglement topological invariant assumes a nonzero value exclusively in the presence of second-order topology, with its magnitude exactly matching the number of topologically protected corner states. Consequently, the proposed entanglement topological invariant not only provides a clear criterion for detecting higher-order topology, but also offers a quantitative measure for the related corner states. Our study establishes a universal and precise method for characterizing higher-order topological phases, opening avenues for their fundamental understanding and future investigations.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation-induced giant magnetoresistance in charge-neutral graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Johnson-Nyquist noise associated with the intrinsic conductivity of the electron liquid, induces fluctuations of the electron density in charge-neutral graphene devices. In the presence of external electric and magnetic fields, the fluctuations of charge density and electric current induce a fluctuating hydrodynamic flow. We show that the resulting advection of charge produces a fluctuation contribution to the macroscopic conductivity of the system, $\sigma_{\mathrm{fl}}$, and develop a quantitative theory of $\sigma_{\mathrm{fl}}$. At zero magnetic field, $\sigma_{\mathrm{fl}}$ diverges logarithmically with the system size and becomes rapidly suppressed at relatively small fields. This results in giant magnetoresistance of the system.</description>

      <title>Direct Epitaxial Growth and Deterministic Device Integration of high-quality Telecom O-Band InGaAs Quantum Dots on Silicon Substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are key building blocks for photonic quantum technologies, enabling practical sources of non-classical light. A central challenge for scalable integration is the direct epitaxial growth of high-quality emitters on industry-compatible silicon platforms. Furthermore, for long-distance fiber-based quantum communication, emission in the telecom O- or C-band is essential. Here, we demonstrate the direct growth of high-quality InGaAs/GaAs QDs emitting in the telecom O-band using a strain-reducing layer approach on silicon. Deterministic integration of individual QDs into circular Bragg grating resonators is achieved via in-situ electron-beam lithography. The resulting devices exhibit strong out-coupling enhancement, with photon extraction efficiencies up to $(40 \pm 2)\%$, in excellent agreement with numerical simulations. These results highlight the high material quality of both the epitaxial platform and the photonic nanostructure, as well as the precise lateral positioning of the emitter within 20~nm of the resonator center. At cryogenic temperature (4~K) and low excitation power ($0.027\times P_\text{sat}$), the devices show excellent single-photon purity, exceeding 99\%. Operation at elevated temperatures of 40~K and 77~K, compatible with compact Stirling cryo-coolers and liquid-nitrogen cooling, reveals robust performance, with single-photon purity maintained at $(88.4 \pm 0.6)\%$ at 77~K. These results demonstrate a practical and scalable route toward silicon-based quantum light sources and provide a promising path for cost-effective fabrication and seamless integration of quantum photonics with classical electronics, representing an important step toward large-scale, chip-based quantum information systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vacuum quantum fluctuations are an inescapable and fundamental feature of modern physics. By integrating cavity-enhanced or surface-modified vacuum quantum fluctuations with low-dimensional materials, a new paradigm-vacuumronics-emerges, enabling unprecedented control over both material properties and photonic responses at the micro- and nanoscale. This synergy opens novel pathways for engineering quantum light-matter interactions, advancing applications in quantum photonics, nanoscale optoelectronics, and quantum material design.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Electrical Control of Single Magnetic Bubbles in Nanostructured Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localized particle-like spin textures have been found to exhibit emergent electromagnetic properties, which hold promise for the development of intriguing spintronic devices. Among these textures, magnetic bubbles represent localized spin configurations that could serve as data bits. However, the precise methods for their electrical manipulation remain uncertain. Here, we demonstrate the deterministic electrical manipulations and detections of single magnetic bubbles in kagome-latticed Fe3Sn2 magnetic nanostructured cells. The current-induced dynamics of magnetic bubbles were explored using nanosecond pulsed currents. We show single pulsed currents with low and high densities can be applied for the creation and deletion of a single bubble, respectively. The mutual writing-deleting operations on single bubbles are attributed to the thermal heating and non-thermal spin-transfer torque effects in combination with micromagnetic simulations. We also realized the in-situ detection of a single bubble using the anisotropic magnetoresistance effect through a standard four-probe method. Our results could propel the development of bubble-based spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Stable skyrmion bundles at room temperature and zero magnetic field in a chiral magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological spin textures are characterized by topological magnetic charges, Q, which govern their electromagnetic properties. Recent studies have achieved skyrmion bundles with arbitrary integer values of Q, opening possibilities for exploring topological spintronics based on Q. However, the realization of stable skyrmion bundles in chiral magnets at room temperature and zero magnetic field - the prerequisite for realistic device applications - has remained elusive. Here, through the combination of pulsed currents and reversed magnetic fields, we experimentally achieve skyrmion bundles with different integer Q values - reaching a maximum of 24 at above room temperature and zero magnetic field - in the chiral magnet Co8Zn10Mn2. We demonstrate the field-driven annihilation of high-Q bundles and present a phase diagram as a function of temperature and field. Our experimental findings are consistently corroborated by micromagnetic simulations, which reveal the nature of the skyrmion bundle as that of skyrmion tubes encircled by a fractional Hopfion.</description>

      <title>Cascade of topological phase transitions and revival of topological zero modes in imperfect double helical liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two parallel helical edge channels hosting interacting electrons, when proximitized by local and nonlocal pairings, can host time-reversal-invariant pairs of topological zero modes at the system corners. Here we show that realistic imperfections substantially enrich the physics of such proximitized double helical liquids. Specifically, we analyze this platform and its fractional counterparts in the presence of pairing and interaction asymmetries between the two channels, as well as random spin-flip terms arising from either magnetic disorder or coexisting charge disorder and external magnetic fields. Using renormalization-group analysis, we determine how Coulomb interactions, pairings, and magnetic disorder collectively influence the transport behavior and topological properties of the double helical liquid. As the system transitions from class DIII to class BDI, an additional topological phase supporting a single Majorana zero mode per corner emerges. We further show how additional pairing or Coulomb asymmetry influences the stability of various topological phases and uncovers a revival of Majorana zero modes and cascades of transitions through topological phases characterized by a $\mathbb {Z}$ invariant, which are accessible through controlling the electrical screening effect. In contrast to conventional understanding, disorder is not merely detrimental, as it in general allows for a tuning knob that qualitatively reshapes the topological superconductivity in imperfect helical liquids.</description>

      <title>Surface acoustic wave-driven valley current generation in intervalley coherent states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments have reported valley-gauge-symmetry-broken phases, identified as intervalley coherent (IVC) states. Exploration of anomalous responses, particularly those analogous to superconductivity, has become an urgent theoretical issue. In this study, we show that the IVC order gives rise to anomalous valley-current generation driven by surface acoustic waves (SAWs). The anomalous valley current exhibits a characteristic power-law dependence for low-frequency SAWs. Furthermore, we demonstrate by numerical analysis that the IVC order significantly enhances valley-current generation in rhombohedral graphene. These results open a pathway toward exploring exotic phenomena emerging from valley-gauge-symmetry breaking, in close analogy with gauge-symmetry breaking in superconductors.</description>

      <title>Excitation energies and UV-Vis absorption spectra from INDO/s+ML</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The semi-empirical INDO/s method is popular for studies of excitation energies and absorption of molecules due to its low computational requirement, making it possible to make predictions for large systems. However, its accuracy is generally low, particularly, when compared with the typical accuracy of other methods such as time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). Here, we present machine learning (ML) models that correct the INDO/s results with negligible increases in the amount of computing resources needed. While INDO/s excitations energies have an average error of about 1.1 eV relative to TDDFT energies, the added ML corrections reduce the error to 0.2 eV. Furthermore, this combination of INDO/s and ML produces UV-Vis absorption spectra that are in good agreement with the TDDFT predictions.</description>

      <title>The Feynman paradox in a spherical axion insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a small charged probe near a spherical topological insulator causes the latter to rotate around a symmetry axis defined by the center of the sphere and the position of the charge outside the latter. The rotation occurs when the distance from the charge to the center of the sphere is changed. This phenomenon occurs due to induced static fields and is a consequence of the axion electrodynamics underlying the electromagnetic response of a topological insulator. Assuming a regime where the charged probe can be regarded as a point charge $q=Ne$, where $N$ is a positive integer and $e$ is the elementary electric charge, we obtain that the rotation frequency is given by $\omega=(N\alpha)^2\Upsilon(\epsilon,d/a)/I$, where $I$ is the moment of inertia, $\alpha$ is the fine-structure constant, and the function $\Upsilon$ depends on the dielectric constant $\epsilon$ and the relative distance $d/a$ of the charge from the center of the sphere of radius $a$. Since the point charge also induces Hall currents on the surface, we compute also their associated angular momentum. This allows us to derive an exact expression for the electronic velocity on the surface as a function of $a/d$.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale magnetometry of a synthetic three-dimensional spin texture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multilayered synthetic antiferromagnets (SAFs) are artificial three-dimensional (3D) architectures engineered to create novel, complex, and stable spin textures. Non-invasive and quantitative nanoscale magnetic imaging of the two-dimensional stray field profile at the sample surface is essential for understanding the fundamental properties of the spin-structure and being able to tailor them to achieve new functionalities. However, the deterministic detection of spin textures and their quantitative characterization on the nanoscale remain challenging. Here, we use nitrogen-vacancy scanning probe microscopy (NV-SPM) under ambient conditions to perform the first quantitative vector-field magnetometry measurements in the multilayered SAF [(Co/Pt)$_5$/Co/Ru]$_3$/(Co/Pt)$_6$. We investigate nanoscale static and dynamic properties of antiferromagnetic domains with boundaries hosting ``one-dimensional'' ferromagnetic stripes with ~ 100 nm of width and periodic modulation of the magnetization. By employing NV-SPM measurements in different imaging modes and involving NV-probes with various crystallographic orientations, we demonstrated distinct fingerprints emerging from GHz-range spin noise and constant stray fields on the order of several mT. This provides quantitative insights into the structure of domains and domain walls, as well as, into magnetic noise associated with thermal spin-waves. Our work opens up new opportunities for quantitative vector-field magnetometry of modern magnetic materials with tailored 3D spin textures and stray field profiles, and potentially novel spin-wave dispersions--in a quantitative and non-invasive manner, with exceptional magnetic sensitivity and nanometer scale spatial resolution.</description>

      <title>Thermally-controlled interlayer exchange and field-induced anisotropy in synthetic antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interlayer exchange in synthetic antiferromagnets incorporating thin paramagnetic spacers can be controlled thermally. The spacer provides an additional ferromagnetic contribution that renormalizes the otherwise temperature-independent interlayer coupling. As a result, the system shows antiferromagnetic alignment at high temperatures and ferromagnetic alignment at low temperatures. This behavior is observed in Fe(2 nm)/Cr(0.4 nm)/Fe$_{17.5}$Cr$_{82.5}$(0.9 nm)/Cr(0.4 nm)/Fe(2 nm) multilayers with the inner spacer Fe$_{17.5}$Cr$_{82.5}$ paramagnetic at and above room temperature, and is shown to be due to the spacer being significantly magnetically polarized on lowering the temperature toward its Curie point. Although the Fe layers lack intrinsic magnetocrystalline anisotropy, the magnetization reversal demonstrates a field-induced uniaxial anisotropy of antiferromagnetic character. The resulting reversal process resembles that of a metamagnet with a spin-flip transition.</description>

      <title>Edge states of a Bi$_2$Se$_3$ nanosheet in a perpendicular magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional wisdom dictates that the conducting edge states of two-dimensional topological insulators of the Bi$_2$Se$_3$ family are protected by time-reversal symmetry. However, theoretical bulk calculations and a recent experiment show that the edge states persist in the presence of large external magnetic fields. To address this apparent contradiction, we have developed an analytical description for the edge-state wave function of a semi-infinite sample in a perpendicular magnetic field. Our description relies on the usual bulk Landau levels, together with additional states arising due to the presence of the hard wall, which are unnormalizable in the infinite system. The analytical wave functions agree extremely well with numerical calculations and can be used to directly analyze the behavior of the edge states in a magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Brightening of dark trions in monolayer WS$_2$ via localization of surface plasmons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optically inactive dark trions in two-dimensional semiconductors are poised to play a stellar role in future quantum technologies due to their long lifetimes, about two orders of magnitude greater than those of their bright counterparts. In monolayer (ML) tungsten disulphide (WS$_2$), accessing these states via optical activation remains challenging, specially at elevated temperatures. Here, we demonstrate the brightening of dark trions from ML WS$_2$ in the temperature range, 83 K-115 K, via localized surface plasmon modes in a disordered gold substrate. The resulting photoluminescence (PL) spectrum reveals a distinct spectral doublet with the twin peaks separated by ~ 45 meV. We propose that the peaks represent semi-dark and bright trion states, the origin of which lies in intervalley electron-electron scatterings. We also report on the experimental evidence of a negative degree of circular polarization in ML WS$_2$ at the energy of the semi-dark trion state.</description>

      <title>Topological Engineering of a Frustrated Antiferromagnetic Triradical in Aza-Triangulene Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-shell nanographenes provide a versatile platform to host unconventional magnetic states within their {\pi}-conjugated networks. Particularly appealing are graphene architectures that incorporate spatially separated radicals and tunable interactions, offering a scalable route toward spin-based quantum architectures. Triangulenes are ideal for this purpose, as their radical count scales with size, although strong hybridization prevents individual spin control. Here, we realize a radical reconfiguration strategy that transforms a single-radical aza-triangulene into a frustrated antiferromagnetic triradical by covalently extending it with armchair anthene moieties of increasing length. Scanning tunnelling spectroscopy reveals edge-localized Kondo resonances and a doublet-to-quartet spin excitation, evidencing the emergence of correlated spins. Multi-reference electronic-structure calculations trace the progressive increase in polyradical character with anthene length, driven by the clustering of frontier states within a narrow energy window. Consequently, the initial single-radical doublet reorganizes into a frustrated triradical with weakly coupled edge spins, a molecular analog of a three-qubit quantum register.</description>

      <title>Shaping chaos in bilayer graphene cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bilayer graphene (BLG) cavities, where electrons are confined in finite graphene flakes, provide a suitable platform to study quantum chaotic phenomena in condensed matter systems due to the trigonal warping of the Fermi surface. Here, we investigate the effect of the misalignment between the BLG lattice and the cavity geometry, introduced by rotating the boundary relative to the lattice, which can drive the system towards chaos. Based on a tight-binding model, eigenenergy level statistics reveals that rotation leads to level repulsion following Wigner-Dyson statistics, while corresponding eigenstate analysis indicates a transition from near-integrability to spatially uncorrelated random waves. Analysis of the semiclassical ray-dynamics with the trigonal-warped dispersion unveils an ergodic phase space structure, providing a quantum-classical correspondence of the onset of chaos. These findings establish an avenue to quantum chaotic phenomena in BLG cavities with potential applications in quantum device engineering.</description>

      <title>Pair-density-wave in quarter-metals from a repulsive fermionic interaction in graphene heterostructures: A renormalization group study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic bands in chirally stacked $n$ layer carbon-based honeycomb heterostructures, encompassing rhombohedral ($n \geq 3$), Bernal bilayer ($n=2$), and monolayer ($n=1$) graphene, possess four-fold valley and spin degeneracy. Such systems with $n \geq 2$, when subject to external perpendicular electric displacement fields, feature a fully degenerate metal at high doping, a spin non-degenerate but valley degenerate half-metal at moderate doping, and a non-degenerate quarter-metal at low doping. Due to the fully polarized nature of the quasiparticles in the quarter-metal, realized around one particular valley otherwise chosen spontaneously, it can sustain a single local superconducting ground state, representing a pair-density-wave that is chiral and odd parity in nature. From a leading order renormalization group analysis, here we show that repulsive density-density interaction among such polarized fermionic excitations can foster the pair-density-wave phase at low temperatures. Possible connections with experimentally observed superconducting states in the close vicinity of the quarter-metal in some members of such graphene heterostructures family are discussed.</description>

      <title>Reaching Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev physics by shaking the Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model has attracted widespread attention due to its relevance to diverse areas of physics, such as high temperature superconductivity, black holes, and quantum chaos. The model is, however, extremely challenging to realize experimentally. In this work, we show how a particular form of Floquet engineering, termed ``kinetic driving'', effectively eliminates single-particle processes and creates quasi-random all-to-all interactions when applied to models of Hubbard type. For the specific case of the Bose-Hubbard model, we explicitly verify that the driven system indeed reproduces SYK physics by direct comparison of the spectral form factor and out-of-time ordered correlation functions (OTOCs). Our findings indicate that a cold-atom realization of kinetic driving -- achieved through modulation of hopping amplitudes in an optical lattice -- offers a practical and accurate platform for quantum simulation of the SYK model.</description>

      <title>Low-temperature dissipative conductivity of superconductors with paramagnetic impurities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In s-wave superconductors with a small concentration of magnetic impurities, the only electronic excitations that remain available at low temperatures are the excitations of the system of localized spins. We discuss a new mechanism of interaction between electromagnetic waves and the localized spins in disordered superconductors. A supercurrent induces randomly distributed spin density of the itinerant electrons, which couples to the impurity spins by exchange interaction. Acceleration of the Cooper pair condensate by the external AC electric field of frequency $\omega$ creates a strong, time-dependent exchange field acting on the localized spins, which is inversely proportional to $\omega$. As a result, the low-frequency dissipative part of the conductivity saturates to a nonzero value. We use the fluctuation-dissipation theorem to evaluate the spectrum of equilibrium current fluctuations associated with the fluctuation in the spin subsystem. We also predict that in the presence of a DC magnetic field parallel to the superconducting film, the system of spins exhibits a large positive magnetoconductance.</description>

      <title>Momentum-space non-Hermitian skin effect in an exciton-polariton system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Localization of a macroscopic number of eigenstates on a real-space boundary, known as the non-Hermitian skin effect, is one of the striking topological features emerging from non-Hermiticity. Realizing this effect typically requires periodic (lattice) systems with asymmetry of intersite coupling, which is not readily available in many physical platforms. Instead, it is meticulously engineered, e.g., in photonics, which results in complex structures requiring precise fabrication steps. Here, we propose a simpler mechanism: introducing an asymmetric, purely imaginary potential in a topologically trivial system induces momentum-space localization akin to the skin effect. We experimentally demonstrate this localization using exciton polaritons, hybrid light-matter quasi-particles in a simple engineered `round box' trap, pumped by a laser pump offset from the trap center. The effect disappears if the pump is concentric with the trap. The localization persists and becomes stronger at higher densities of polaritons, when a non-equilibrium Bose-Einstein condensate is formed and the system becomes nonlinear. Our approach offers a new route to realizing skin effects in continuous, non-periodic systems and exploring the interplay of non-Hermiticity, topology, and nonlinearity in macroscopic quantum states.</description>

      <title>Optomagnonic generation of entangled travelling fields with different polarizations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optomagnonic coupling between magnons and optical photons is an essential component for building remote quantum networks based on magnonics. Here we show that such a coupling, manifested as the magnon-induced Brillouin light scattering, can be exploited to entangle two propagating optical fields. The protocol employs two pairs of the whispering gallery modes coupled to the same magnon mode in a YIG sphere. In each pair a strong pump field is applied to activate either Stokes or anti-Stokes scattering. Due to the magnon mode involving in the two scattering processes and as a mediation, Stokes and anti-Stokes photons of different polarizations get entangled. The entanglement can be extracted by filtering the travelling output fields centered at the Stokes and anti-Stokes sidebands. Optimal conditions are identified under which strong output entanglement can be achieved.</description>

      <title>Generation of mechanical cat-like states via optomagnomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an optomagnomechanical approach for preparing a cat-like superposition state of mechanical motion. Our protocol consists of two steps and is based on the magnomechanical system where the magnetostrictively induced displacement further couples to an optical cavity mode via radiation pressure. We first prepare a squeezed mechanical state by driving the magnomechanical system with a two-tone microwave field. We then switch off the microwave drives and send a weak red-detuned optical pulse to the optical cavity to weakly activate the optomechanical anti-Stokes scattering. We show that $k$ phonons can be subtracted from the prepared squeezed state, conditioned on the detection of $k$ anti-Stokes photons from the cavity output field, which prepares the mechanical motion in a cat-like state. The work provides a new avenue for preparing mechanical superposition states by combining opto- and magnomechanics and may find applications in the study of macroscopic quantum states and the test of collapse theories.</description>

      <title>Electric-Field-Controlled Altermagnetic Transition for Neuromorphic Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets represent a novel magnetic phase with transformative potential for ultrafast spintronics, yet efficient control of their magnetic states remains challenging. We demonstrate an ultra-low-power electric-field control of altermagnetism in MnTe through strain-mediated coupling in MnTe/PMN-PT heterostructures with negligible Joule heating. Application of +6 kV/cm electric fields induces piezoelectric strain in PMN-PT, modulating the N\'eel temperature from 310 to 328 K. As a result, around the magnetic phase transition, the altermagnetic spin splitting of MnTe is reversibly switched "on" and "off" by the electric fields. Meanwhile, the piezoelectric strain generates lattice distortions and magnetic structure changes in MnTe, enabling up to 9.7% resistance modulation around the magnetic phase transition temperature. Leveraging this effect, we implement programmable resistance states in a Hopfield neuromorphic network, achieving 100% pattern recognition accuracy at &lt;=40% noise levels. This approach establishes the electric-field control as a low-power strategy for altermagnetic manipulation while demonstrating the viability of altermagnetic materials for energy-efficient neuromorphic computing beyond conventional charge-based architectures.</description>

      <title>Understanding Surface-Induced Decoherence of NV Centers in Diamond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nitrogen vacancy centers (NV) in proximity to diamond surfaces are promising nanoscale quantum sensors. However, their coherence properties are negatively affected by magnetic and electric surface noise, whose origin and detailed impact have remained elusive. Using atomistic models of diamond surfaces derived with density functional theory, together with decoherence time calculations with cluster correlation expansion methods, we quantify the effects of surface crystallographic orientation and functionalization, and of the density of unpaired electrons on the NV Hahn-echo time $T_2$. We determine a crossover depth at which $T_2$ ceases to be limited by surface nuclear spins and recovers the bulk-limited value. We find that for static surface-electron baths, the ratio between the NV depth and the separation between surface electron spins determines a transition from fast-fluctuating to quasi-static noise, leading to a dependence of $T_2$ on orientation for specific surfaces. We also find that the modulation of $T_2$ by spin-phonon relaxations leads to motional-narrowing at sub-microsecond relaxation times. Importantly, our calculations show that it is only when accounting for surface-spin in-sequence hopping that measured $T_2$ values as a function of depth can be reproduced, thus highlighting the importance of hopping-mediated models to describe the surface spin noise affecting NV sensors. Overall, our work provides clear guidelines for engineering diamond surfaces to achieve enhanced NV coherence for quantum sensing and information processing applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While 2D materials have enormous potential for future device technologies, many challenges must be overcome before they can be deployed at an industrial scale. One of these challenges is identifying the right semiconductor/insulator combination that ensures high performance, stability, and reliability. In contrast to conventional 2D interfaces, which suffer from van der Waals gaps or covalent bonding issues, zippered structures such as the high-mobility 2D semiconductor Bi$_2$O$_2$Se and its native high-$\kappa$ oxide Bi$_2$SeO$_5$ offer high-quality interfaces, good scalability, and excellent device performance. While most prior work has focused mainly on basic device behavior, here we also thoroughly assess the stability and reliability of this material system using a multiscale approach that integrates electrical characterization, density functional theory, and TCAD simulations, linking atomistic states to device-scale reliability. By analyzing four transistor design generations (top-gated, fin, and two gate-all-around FETs), we provide realistic predictions for how this system performs at the ultimate scaling limit. We identify oxygen-related defects in the oxide as the main contributors to hysteresis and recoverable threshold shifts, and we propose mitigation strategies through encapsulation or oxygen-rich annealing. Benchmarking the extracted material parameters against IRDS 2037 requirements, we demonstrate that Bi$_2$O$_2$Se/Bi$_2$SeO$_5$ transistors can achieve high drain and low gate currents at ultra-scaled conditions. These findings position this material system as a technologically credible and manufacturing-relevant pathway for future nanoelectronics.</description>

Abstract: The homogeneous electron gas is a cornerstone of quantum condensed matter physics, providing the foundation for developing density functional theory and understanding electronic phases in semiconductors. However, theoretical understanding of strongly-correlated electrons in realistic semiconductor systems remains limited. In this work, we develop a neural network based variational approach to study quantum wells in three dimensional geometry for a variety of electron densities and well thicknesses. Starting from first principles, our unbiased AI-powered method reveals metallic and crystalline phases with both monolayer and bilayer charge distributions. In the emergent bilayer, we discover a new quantum phase of matter: the electronic quasicrystal.</description>

Abstract: A non-Hermitian generalization of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model driven by a periodic external potential is investigated, and its topological features are explored. We find that the bi-orthonormal geometric phase acts as a topological index, well capturing the presence/absence of the zero modes. The model is observed to display trivial and non-trivial insulator phases and a topologically non-trivial M${\"o}$bius metallic phase. The driving field amplitude is shown to be a control parameter causing topological phase transitions in this model. While the system displays zero modes in the metallic phase apart from the non-trivial insulator phase, the metallic zero modes are not robust, as the ones found in the insulating phase. We further find that zero modes' energy converges slowly to zero as a function of the number of dimers in the M${\"o}$bius metallic phase compared to the non-trivial insulating phase.</description>

Abstract: The nonlinear Hall effect has recently garnered significant attention as a powerful probe of Fermi surface quantum geometry in metals. While current studies mainly focus on the nonlinear Hall response driven by quasi-static electric fields of low frequencies, the extension of the response to higher frequencies is another promising frontier, which introduces quantum geometry into inter-band transitions. Here, we demonstrate that a specific nonlinear Hall response, namely the second harmonic Hall (SHH) response, can arise from inter-band transitions. We establish the quantum geometric origin of the SHH response and show that inter-band quantum geometry dominates the SHH response when driven near inter-band resonance. Crucially, we find that the inter-band SHH response in insulators exhibits strong frequecy dispersion, manifesting the breakdown of Kleinman's conjecture in nonlinear optics. This connects the SHH response to the breakdown of Kleinman's conjecture and reveals that frequency dispersive insulators generally allow the SHH response. Furthermore, we predict a giant SHH susceptibility in gated strained bilayer graphene and propose that one can apply the polarization resolved second harmonic microscopy to detect the SHH response there.</description>

      <title>Quantitative imaging of nonlinear spin-wave propagation using diamond quantum sensors</title>

Abstract: Spin waves propagating in magnetic materials exhibit nonlinear behavior at large amplitudes due to the competition between excitation and relaxation, providing an attractive platform for exploring nonlinear wave dynamics. In particular, spin waves with a non-zero wavenumber that carry momentum undergo nonlinear relaxation and experience wavenumber modulation in the nonlinear regime. This nonlinearity has been observed experimentally, for example in S. R. Lake et al., Phys. Rev. Appl. 17, 034010 (2022), but a quantitative comparison with theory has not yet been carried out. Here, We image nonlinear spin-wave propagation in two yttrium iron garnet thin films with distinct spin-wave decay rates using a wide-field quantum diamond microscope. We obtain quantitative distributions of spin-wave amplitude and phase as a function of the excitation microwave strength. As a result, we observe a threshold in the spin-wave amplitude beyond which nonlinear effects become evident and confirm that this threshold is consistent with theoretical predictions based on four-magnon scattering for both samples. Moreover, as the amplitude of the spin waves increases, we observe modulation of the wavenumber across the field of view. We attribute this modulation primarily to a reduction in the saturation magnetization caused by incoherent spin waves generated by multi-magnon scattering. Our quantitative measurements provide a pathway for visualizing nonlinear spin-wave dynamics and are crucial for deepening our understanding of the underlying mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality in optically induced lattices of exciton-polariton condensates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10187v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate space-time coherence in one-dimensional lattices of exciton-polariton condensates formed by fully reconfigurable non-resonant optical pumping. Starting from an open-dissipative Gross-Pitaevskii equation with deterministic reservoir kinetics and stochastic condensate noise, we derive a discrete complex-field model that incorporates coherent tunnelling, reservoir-mediated dissipative coupling and gain-saturation non-linearity. Adiabatic elimination of fast density fluctuations reveals a wedge-shaped region in the complex hopping plane where the coarse-grained phase dynamics reduces to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation. By computing high-resolution phase diagrams of the temporal and spatial scaling exponents we pinpoint the boundaries separating the KPZ domain from the Edwards-Wilkinson (EW) regime. Large-scale graphics processing unit (GPU) simulations of chains containing up to $N=2000$ condensates confirm these predictions: inside the wedge the exponents converge to $\beta_{N}=\textbf{0.329}(3)\!\approx\!1/3$ and $\chi_{N}=\textbf{0.504}(4)\!\approx\!1/2$, whereas outside it the dynamics moves away from KPZ and ultimately flows toward the EW fixed point, although finite system size and finite observation time may yield intermediate effective exponents. These results pave the way to the implementation of ultrafast KPZ-simulators based on one-dimensional arrays of exciton-polariton condensates.</description>

      <title>Chirality and polarization of inertial antiferromagnetic resonances driven by spin-orbit torques</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is widely accepted that the handedness of a resonant mode is an intrinsic property. We show that, by tailoring the polarization and handedness of alternating spin-orbit torques used as the driving force, the polarization state and handedness of inertial resonant modes in an antiferromagnet (AFM) can be actively controlled. In contrast with ferromagnets, whose resonant-mode polarization is essentially fixed, AFM inertial modes can continuously evolve from elliptic through circular to linear polarization as the driving polarization is varied. We further identify an inertia-dependent critical degree of driving polarization at which the mode becomes linearly polarized while its handedness reverses.</description>

Abstract: We study a one-dimensional topological model featuring a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger type pattern of nearest-neighbor couplings in combination with the longer-range interactions exponentially decaying with the distance. We demonstrate that even relatively weak long-range couplings can trigger the topological transition if their range is large enough. This provides an additional facet in the control of topological phases.</description>

      <title>Domain Wall Control of Topological Qubits in the Kitaev SSH Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zero energy states in one dimensional SSH Kitaev hybrid systems have emerged as promising candidates for topological qubits. In our work, we show that introducing a domain wall into a chain with anisotropic superconducting correlations provides a powerful way to control both the number and the nature of these boundary modes. The defect acts as a digital knob: its presence or absence flips the parity of zero modes and thus decides whether an isolated Majorana exists at the chain ends. This on/off mechanism is significantly more robust and simpler than fine-tuning global parameters such as chemical potential or hopping amplitudes. Moreover, anisotropy provides an additional lever to calibrate the effect of the defect, opening a pathway to architectures where topological qubits can be locally addressed by domain walls. This proposal reframes defects not as imperfections, but as useful resources for quantum information and computation.</description>

      <title>Eigenstructure Analysis of Bloch Wave and Multislice Formulations for Dynamical Scattering in Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the eigenstructure of matrix formulations used for modeling scattering processes within materials in transmission electron microscopy. Dynamical scattering is crucial for describing the interaction between an electron wave and the material under investigation. Unlike the Bloch wave formulation, which defines the transmission function via the scattering matrix, the traditional multislice method is lacking a pure transmission function due to the entanglement of electron waves with the propagation function. To address this, we reformulate the multislice method into a matrix framework, which we refer to as the transmission matrix. This allows a direct comparison to the scattering matrix derived from Bloch waves in terms of their eigenstructures. Through theory, we demonstrate their equivalence with eigenvectors related by a two-dimensional Fourier matrix, given that the eigenvalue angles differ by modulo $2\pi n$ (integer $n$). We numerically verify our findings as well as demonstrate the application of the eigenstructure for the estimation of the mean inner potential.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Anyon Clusters in Fractional Quantum Hall Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20257v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In fractional quantum Hall fluids, the quasiparticle excitations are anyons with fractional charges and statistics. Effective interactions among the anyons can be induced by either model or realistic electron-electron (e-e) interactions. Without losing the generality, we investigate such phenomena for the Laughlin 1/3 and Moore-Read (MR) non-Abelian phases. Anyons display rich internal dynamics in both cases that will lead to interesting experimental consequences. In particular, bound states of two Laughlin anyons are preferred under short-range e-e interactions, leading to 2e/3 -- instead of e/3 -- effective charge carriers at low temperatures, which have been seen in several experiments. MR phases host two topologically distinct fusion channels: 1 and psi. The different effective interactions of e/4 anyons in the two sectors suggest the vanishing of the degeneracy of fusion channels when the e-e interaction is no longer its model Hamiltonian, in which case different bound states could also appear. This indicates the possibility of energetically manipulating the two types of anyons by tuning the bare e-e interactions. We point out that the results of recently developed high-resolution STM measurements will be affected by the effective anyon interactions, where anyons are clustered together after the tunneling of electrons. The low-lying parts of the local density of states affected by various anyon clusters are simulated for both Abelian and non-Abelian systems with (screened) Coulomb interactions.</description>

      <title>From hidden order to skyrmions: Quantum Hall states in an extended Hofstadter-Fermi-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay between topology and strong interactions gives rise to a variety of exotic quantum phases, including fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states and their lattice analogs - fractional Chern insulators (FCIs). Such topologically ordered states host fractionalized excitations and, for spinful systems, are often accompanied by ferromagnetism and skyrmions. Here, we study a Hofstadter-Hubbard model of spinful fermions on a square lattice, extended by nearest-neighbor interactions. Using large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we demonstrate the emergence of a spin-polarized $\frac{1}{3}$-Laughlin-like FCI phase, characterized by a quantized many-body Chern number, a finite charge gap, and hidden off-diagonal long-range order. We further investigate the quantum Hall ferromagnet at $\nu=1$ and its skyrmionic excitations upon doping. In particular, we find that nearest-neighbor repulsion is sufficient to stabilize both particle- and hole-skyrmions in the ground state around $\nu=1$, whereas we do not find such textures around $\nu=\frac{1}{3}$. The diagnostic toolbox presented in this work, based on local densities, correlation functions, and spin-resolved observables, is directly applicable in quantum gas microscopy experiments. Our results open new pathways for experimental exploration of FCIs with spin textures in both ultracold atom and electronic systems.</description>

Abstract: Certain topological systems with time-varying Hamiltonian enable quantized and disorder-robust transport of excitations. Here, we introduce the modification of the celebrated Thouless pump when the on-site energies remain fixed, while the nearest and next-nearest neighbor couplings vary in time. We demonstrate quantized transport of excitations and propose an experimental implementation using an array of evanescently coupled optical waveguides.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19378v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a general theory of radiative heat exchange between dipoles with time-modulated optical properties. This framework extends fluctuational electrodynamics beyond equilibrium by incorporating nonstationary correlations and memory effects induced by temporal modulation. Closed-form expressions for the heat currents in modulated many-body systems are obtained, together with a generalized Landauer-like formulation of the pairwise exchanges, where the transmission coefficient accounts for all inelastic frequency-conversion channels. Near-resonant modulation redistributes and amplifies thermal fluctuations across Floquet sidebands, acting as a parametric amplifier of thermal radiation and enabling active, frequency-selective control of nanoscale heat transfer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tunable Josephson harmonics open new avenues for qubit design. We demonstrate a superconducting circuit element consisting of a tunnel junction in series with a SQUID loop, yielding a Josephson potential whose harmonic content is strongly tunable by magnetic flux. Through spectroscopy of the first four qubit transitions, together with an effective single-mode model renormalized by the internal mode, we resolve a second harmonic with an amplitude up to $\sim10\%$ of the fundamental. We identify a flux sweet spot where the dispersive shift vanishes, achieved by balancing the dispersive couplings to the internal and qubit modes. This highly tunable element provides a route toward protected qubits and customizable nonlinear microwave devices.</description>
