      <title>Dynamical Phase Transitions Across Slow and Fast Regimes in a Two-Tone Driven Duffing Resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The response of nonlinear resonators to multifrequency driving reveals rich dynamics beyond conventional single-tone theory. We study a Duffing resonator under bichromatic excitation and identify a competition between the two drives, governed by their detuning and relative amplitudes. In the slow-beating regime, where the tones are closely spaced, the secondary drive acts as a modulation that induces dynamical phase transitions between coexisting stationary states. We introduce the cycle-averaged amplitude as an order parameter and map the resulting phase diagram as a function of the drive detuning and amplitude ratio, capturing the pronounced asymmetry observed for blue versus red detuning in experiment. We devise a model to link the onset of these transitions to the resonance properties around the nonlinear stationary mode of the system. Our results provide a framework for controlling driven nonlinear systems, enabling state manipulation, and sensing in nanomechanical, optical, and superconducting circuit platforms.</description>

      <title>Current Cross-Correlation Spectroscopy of Majorana Bound States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The clock speed of topological quantum computers based on Majorana zero mode (MZM)-supporting nanoscale devices is determined by the time taken for electrons to traverse the device. We employ the time-dependent Landauer-B{\"u}ttiker transport theory for current cross-lead correlations in a superconducting nanowire junction hosting MZMs. From the time-dependent quantum noise, we are able to extract traversal times for electrons crossing the system. After demonstrating a linear scaling of traversal times with nanowire length, we present a heuristic formula for the traversal times which accurately captures their behaviour. We then connect our framework to a proposed experimental verification of this discriminant between spurious and genuine MZMs utilizing time-resolved transport measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon nitride membranes are a powerful and ubiquitous optomechanical resonator technology, enabling high mechanical Q, low optical loss, and enhanced optomechanical coupling via a panoply of strain-, phononic-, and photonic-crystal engineering techniques. Fabrication and characterization of silicon nitride membranes has become a form of tacit knowledge in optomechanics research groups. Here we present a video run-through of the design, fabrication, and characterization of a contemporary silicon nitride membrane resonator (specifically, a centimeter-scale Si3N4 nanoribbon supporting $Q&gt;10^8$ torsion modes). Our tutorial can serve as a starting point or refresher for practitioners in the field.</description>

      <title>Nanofluidic logic based on chiral skyrmion flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle-like chiral magnetic skyrmions can flow in nanotracks and behave like chiral fluids. Using interacting flows to perform logical operations is an important topic in microfluidics and nanofluidics. Here, we report a basic nanofluidic logic computing system based on chiral magnetic skyrmions flowing in parallel pipelines connected by an H-shaped junction. The flow behaviors could be manipulated by adjusting the spin polarization angle, which controls the intrinsic skyrmion Hall angle. We demonstrate that within certain range of the spin polarization angle, fully developed skyrmion flows could lead to fluidic logical operations, which significantly reduce the complexity of skyrmion logic as there is no need for deterministic creation, precise control, and detection of a single isolated skyrmion. Our results suggest that the chiral flow behaviors of magnetic quasiparticles may offer possibilities for spintronic and nanofluidic functions.</description>

      <title>Embedding independent length scale of flat bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In flat band systems with quenched kinetic energy, most of the conventional length scales related to the band dispersion become ineffectual. Although a few geometric length scales, such as the quantum-metric length, can still be defined, because of their embedding dependence, i.e., the dependence on the choice of orbital positions used to construct the tight-binding model, they cannot serve as a universal length scale of the flat band systems. Here, we introduce an embedding-independent length scale $\xi_\text{flat}$ of a flat band that is defined as the localization length of an in-gap state proximate to the flat band. Because $\xi_\text{flat}$ is derived from the intrinsic localization of compact localized states, it is solely determined by the Hamiltonian and provides a robust foundation for embedding-independent observables. We show analytically that the superconducting coherence length in a flat-band superconductor is given by $\xi_\text{flat}$ in the weak-coupling limit, thereby identifying $\xi_\text{flat}$ as the relevant length scale for many-body phenomena. Numerical simulations on various lattice models confirm all theoretical predictions, including the correspondence between $\xi_\text{flat}$ and the superconducting coherence length. Our results highlight $\xi_\text{flat}$ as a universal length scale for flat bands and open a pathway to embedding-independent characterization of strongly interacting flat-band materials.</description>

      <title>Acoustic orbital Hall effect and orbital pumping in light-metal-ferromagnet bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbital currents provide a new degree of freedom for controlling magnetism, yet their interaction with lattice dynamics remains largely unexplored. Here we report a systematic investigation of the acoustic orbital Hall effect in light metals such as Ti and Cr, where surface acoustic waves generate orbital currents through phonon-orbital coupling. The acoustic orbital current in Ti exhibits higher efficiency and longer diffusion length compared to the acoustic spin current in Pt. The sign and magnitude of the rectified acoustic voltages in nonmagnetic (Ti, Cr)/ferromagnetic (Ni, Co, Fe$_x$Co$_{1-x}$) bilayers are determined by the product of orbital-to-spin conversion and magnetoelastic coupling efficiencies of the ferromagnet. Additionally, we find evidence for acoustic orbital pumping, whereby the excitation of ferromagnetic resonance by surface acoustic waves injects an orbital current from the ferromagnet into the nonmagnet. These results establish lattice dynamics as an efficient driver of orbital transport, opening opportunities for low-dissipation orbitronic devices that harness and sense phonons.</description>

      <title>Theory of In-Plane-Magnetic-Field-Dependent Excitonic Spectra in Atomically Thin Semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The linear absorption spectrum of excitons in TMDC monolayers under the influence of an in-plane magnetic field is theoretically studied. We demonstrate that in-plane magnetic fields induce a hybridization between spin-bright and spin-dark exciton transitions, resulting in a brightening of spin-dark excitons. We analytically investigate spectral features including resonance energy shifts, broadening and amplitudes ratios. In particular, for a MoSe$_2$ monolayer with radiatively-limited linewidth, we find a complex interplay of dark-bright splitting and linewidth difference of both involved spin-bright and spin-dark excitons.</description>

      <title>Noises in a two-channel charge Kondo model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate fluctuations of electric and heat currents, along with their cross-correlations, in a two-channel charge Kondo circuit driven by either a voltage bias or a temperature gradient applied across the weak link. The ratios of voltage-driven electric/heat noise to the applied voltage $V$ exhibit oscillations with the gate voltage $N$, resembling the behavior of the thermoelectric coefficient $G_T$. In contrast, the ratios of temperature-driven electric/heat noise to the temperature difference $\Delta T$ vary with $N$ in a manner analogous to the thermal coefficient $G_H$ or the electric conductance $G$. The mixed noise, which is defined as the correlation function between electric and heat currents, displays behavior opposite to that of the above noises. The logarithmic temperature dependence of these noises signals non-Fermi-liquid behavior, while their oscillations with gate voltage reflect the roles of particle-hole and time-reversal symmetries in thermoelectric transport. Our results demonstrate that the fundamental relations linking voltage- and temperature-induced noises to thermoelectric transport across a tunnel junction persist beyond the Fermi-liquid paradigm.</description>

      <title>Self-Consistent Theoretical Framework for Third-Order Nonlinear Susceptibility in CdSe/ZnS--MOF Quantum Dot Composites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a fully theoretical and self consistent framework for calculating the third-order nonlinear susceptibility of CdSe/ZnS--MOF composite quantum dots. The approach unifies finite-potential quantum confinement,the Liouville von Neumann density matrix expansion to third order, and effective-medium electrodynamics (Maxwell--Garnett and Bruggeman) within a single Hamiltonian-based model, requiring no empirical fitting. Electron hole quantized states and dipole matrix elements are obtained under the effective-mass approximation with BenDaniel--Duke boundary conditions; closed analytic forms for(including Lorentzian/Voigt broadening) follow from the response expansion. Homogenization yields macroscopic scaling laws that link microscopic descriptors (core radius, shell thickness, dielectric mismatch) to bulk coefficients and. A Kramers--Kronig consistency check confirms causality and analyticity of the computed spectra with small residuals. The formalism provides a predictive, parameter-transparent route to engineer third-order nonlinearity in hybrid quantum materials,clarifying how size and environment govern the magnitude and dispersion of.</description>

      <title>Model for charge-carriers spectra in topological semimetals of TaAs family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a four-bands model describing the electron energy spectra near the Weyl points in the topological semimetals of the TaAs family (TaAs, TaP, NbAs, NbP). This model takes into account the fact that these Weyl points result from the band-contact lines which would exist in the mirror-reflection planes of these materials if the spin-orbit interaction were absent in them. Within this model, we obtain conditions for the existence of the Weyl points, determine their positions in the Brillouin zone, and derive the explicit formula for dispersion of the bands along the straight line connecting the two close Weyl points with opposite topological charges. Using NbP as an example, the values of the parameters defining the model spectrum are found. The obtained results show that for the semimetals of the TaAs family, the charge-carriers spectrum in the vicinity of the two close Weyl points can be analyzed without complex band-structure calculations.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Hall effect in metallic collinear antiferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose and theoretically study minimal models of all N\'{e}el ordered collinear antiferromagnets which show the anomalous Hall effect. For simplicity we consider two-dimensional models of antiferromagnets with two magnetic sublattices on a square lattice. Examples of N\'{e}el ordered ferrimagnet and of Dzyaloshinskii's weak ferromagnet are given. Turov's invariants of existence of the magnetization in N\'{e}el ordered antiferromagnets for proposed systems are analyzed. As a result, we obtain that the anomalous Hall effect is allowed only for certain directions of the N\'{e}el order defined by the crystal lattice symmetries. We derive the mechanism of the anomalous Hall effect in antiferromagnets to be the interplay of momentum-dependent exchange interaction of conducting fermions with the N\'{e}el order, and the spin-orbit coupling consistent with the broken symmetries that allowed for the Turov's invariant in the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here it is shown that in the adiabatic limit of condensed-phase electron transfer, the onset of barrierless transition occurs at a lower driving force than predicted by the non-adiabatic Marcus formulation. Furthermore, in the adiabatic limit of the Marcus-inverted region, isoenergetic electron transfer is strictly forbidden in the absence of nuclear tunneling. This "forbidden" behavior arises from a topological change in the mapping between the adiabatic and diabatic electronic surfaces, emerging precisely at the onset of the Marcus-inverted region.</description>

      <title>Nuclear spin-free 70Ge/28Si70Ge quantum well heterostructures grown on industrial SiGe-buffered wafers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coherence of hole spin qubits in germanium planar heterostructures is limited by the hyperfine coupling to the nuclear spin bath due to 29Si and 73Ge isotopes. Thus, removing these nuclear spin-full isotopes is essential to extend the hyperfine-limited coherence times needed to implement robust quantum processors. This work demonstrates the epitaxial growth of device-grade nuclear spin-free 70Ge/28Si70Ge heterostructures on industrial SiGe buffers while minimizing the amounts of highly purified 70GeH4 and 28SiH4 used. The obtained 70Ge/28Si70Ge heterostructures exhibit a dislocation density of 5.3 x 10e6 cm-2 and an isotopic purity exceeding 99.99%, with carbon and oxygen impurities below the detection sensitivity, as revealed by atom probe tomography. Magnetotransport measurements on gated Hall bars demonstrate effective gate control of hole density in nuclear spin-free quantum wells. Negative threshold gate voltages confirm the absence of intentional doping in the wells, while Hall and Shubnikov-de Haas analyses yield consistent carrier densities (1.4 x 10e11 cm-2) and high mobilities (2.4 x 10e5 cm2/Vs). Mobility trends reveal interfacetrap- limited scattering and percolation concentration below 7 x 10e10 cm-2. These analyses, along with atomic-level studies, confirm the high quality of epitaxial 70Ge/28Si70Ge heterostructures and their relevance as a platform for long-coherence spin qubits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The graphene-insulator-semiconductor-structured electron source has garnered significant attention due to its high electron emission efficiency and highly monochromatic electron emission. Graphene, with its c-axis orientation and well-defined interlayer spacing, exhibits electron interference effects that can influence the properties of emitted electrons. In this work, motion of an electron wave packet is numerically calculated to discuss the energy spread of the zero-order and first-order diffracted electron waves by mono- and multilayer graphene. It is found that the effects of multiple reflections of electron between the layers broaden the energy spread especially for the incident energy of 13.4 eV, and that highly monochromatic electron emission can be achieved by using diffracted electron wave with a small aperture.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the decay of three-level artificial atom, a superconducting transmon qubit which interacts with a continuum of modes in an open one-dimensional waveguide. For strong interaction of transmon with a continuum we obtain analytical expressions for the frequency shifts and widths of the resonances the values of which are calculated numerically for the Gaussian density of states. We show that the coupling between the second level and ground state of a transmon significantly influences the decay of the third transmon level.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of on-chip all-optical switching of magnetization in integrated photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrafast all-optical magnetization switching (AOS) holds great promise for nextgeneration spintronic memory and hybrid spintronic-photonic systems. However, most implementations to date rely on bulky free-space optical setups, limiting scalability and practical integration. As a critical step toward integrated applications, we demonstrate single-pulse AOS within a silicon nitride (Si3N4) photonic integrated circuit. Using trains of femtosecond laser pulses guided through on-chip waveguides, we achieve deterministic toggle switching in a sub-micron out-of-plane Co/Gd Hall cross patterned directly atop the photonic waveguide. Electrical readout via the anomalous Hall effect reveals a switching contrast of up to 90% for 500 nm-wide devices. In larger Hall crosses, the contrast decreases and switching becomes stochastic, consistent with spatially non-uniform optical absorption as confirmed by finite-element simulations. This behavior is hypothetically attributed to domain wall relaxation and thermally assisted (de)pinning processes within partially switched regions. Our results highlight the critical role of device scaling in achieving robust on-chip AOS and establish a foundation for ultrafast, energy-efficient, and fully integrated spintronic-photonic platforms.</description>

      <title>Parity Anomalous Semimetal with Minimal Conductivity Induced by an In-Plane Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between topological materials and local symmetry breaking gives rise to diverse topological quantum phenomena. A notable example is the parity anomalous semimetal (PAS), which hosts a single unpaired gapless Dirac cone with a half-integer quantized Hall conductivity. Here, we realize this phase in a magnetic topological sandwich structure by applying an in-plane magnetic field. This configuration aligns the magnetization of one surface in-plane while preserving magnetization out-of-plane on the opposite surface, satisfying the condition for a gapless surface state near the Fermi level on only one surface. Our key evidence is a distinctive two-stage evolution of the conductivity tensor ($\sigma_{xy}$, $\sigma_{xx}$). The first stage culminates in the PAS at the fixed point ($\frac{e^2}{2h}$, $m \frac{e^2}{h}$), where $m \approx 0.6$ corresponds to the minimal longitudinal conductivity of a single gapless Dirac cone of fermions on a 2D lattice. This PAS state remains stabilized and is superposed with a gapped band flow in the second stage. This observation demonstrates that this state stabilized by the in-plane field resists localization--contrary to conventional expectations for 2D electron systems with broken time reversal symmetry. The dynamic transition from an integer quantized insulator to a half-integer quantized semimetal establishes this material system as a versatile platform for exploring parity anomaly physics.</description>

      <title>Unlocking n-alk-1-ynes Conformers: Quantum "Trigger Finger" versus "Stiff Joint" Conformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular conformation in n-alk-1-ynes (CnA) is conventionally simplified to an all-planar structure. We report a comprehensive quantum chemical analysis revealing two near-isoenergetic rotamers at the acetylenic terminus: planar (C$_s$) and skewed (C$_1$). The high, symmetric rotational energy barrier ($\approx 150$\,meV) arises from unique steric relief near the $\mathrm{sp}$ center coupled with electronic stabilization of C$_1$. This creates a unique kinetic profile: a Quantum ``Trigger Finger'' ($\alpha$ rotation) that enforces an $\approx 50\%:\,50\%$ $\mathrm{C}_s/\mathrm{C}_1$ ensemble, sharply contrasting with the thermodynamically biased ``Stiff Joint'' ($\delta$ rotation) of the alkyl chain. This structural degeneracy necessitates ensemble averaging for spectroscopic data interpretation, while the slow interconversion permits kinetic trapping and intentional conformer enrichment during synthesis and molecular junction fabrication. Our work redefines the alkyne anchor, providing a blueprint for accurate interpretation of spectroscopic data and achieving conformational control in molecular electronics.</description>

      <title>Emergent Bell Phase in an Electro-Nanomechanical Quantum Simulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suspended carbon nanotubes hosting electrostatically defined quantum dots allow for exceptionally strong and tunable electromechanical coupling as well as mechanical modes that can reach the quantum ground state of motion simply by cryogenic cooling. This makes them a unique platform for quantum simulation of electron-phonon coupling. Here, we propose an experimentally realisable setup with two such carbon nanotubes in parallel, each hosting four quantum dots. Our system not only exhibits phonon-mediated electron-electron attraction, but also supports a robust, maximally entangled Bell phase at mesoscopic scales shared across the subsystems. These features highlight its potential as a simulator of strongly correlated quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate a possibility of controlling second-order dispersion in a monolithic Fabry-Perot interferometer based on epitaxial heterostructure with quantum well (QW) serving as a bottom mirror. Careful choice of heterostructure parameters and experimental conditions makes it possible to introduce negative dispersion in a very narrow spectral region of QW excitonic resonance while maintaining a constant reflection coefficient across this region. The feasibility of the concept is demonstrated for heterostructures with InGaAs/GaAs QWs at cryogenic temperatures. We also propose an active device design that can switch the dispersion compensation on and off by controlling the exciton ensemble's environment.</description>

      <title>Tunable Josephson voltage source for quantum circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Noisy voltage sources can be a limiting factor for fundamental physics experiments as well as for device applications in quantum information, mesoscopic circuits, magnetometry, and other fields. The best commercial DC voltage sources can be programmed to approximately six digits and have intrinsic noise in the microvolt range. On the other hand the noise level in metrological Josephson-junction based voltage standards is sub-femtovolt. Although such voltage standards can be considered "noiseless," they are generally not designed for continuous tuning of the output voltage nor for supplying current to a load at cryogenic temperatures. We propose a Josephson effect based voltage source, as opposed to a voltage standard, operating in the 30-160 uV range which can supply over 100 nA of current to loads at milli-Kelvin temperatures. We describe the operating principle, the sample design, and the calibration procedure to obtain continuous tunability. We show current-voltage characteristics of the device, demonstrate how the voltage can be adjusted without DC control connections to room-temperature electronics, and showcase an experiment coupling the source to a mesoscopic load, a small Josephson junction. Finally we characterize the performance of our source by measuring the voltage noise at the load, 50 pV RMS, which is attributed to parasitic resistances in the cabling. This work establishes the use of the Josephson effect for voltage biasing extremely sensitive quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Transfer entropy and flow of information in two-skyrmion system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18777v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the flow of information in an interacting two-skyrmion system confined in a box at finite temperature. Using numerical simulations based on the Thiele-Langevin equation, we demonstrate that the skyrmion motion cannot be fully described by the master equation, highlighting the system's simplicity with its nontrivial dynamics. Particularly, due to the chiral motion of skyrmion, we find asymmetric flow of information even in equilibrium, which is demonstrated by the violation of the detailed balance condition. We analyze this novel system using information-theoretical quantities including Shannon entropy, mutual information, and transfer entropy. By the analyses, the physical significance of transfer entropy as a measure of flow of information, which has been overlooked in previous studies, is elucidated. Notably, the peak position of the transfer entropy, as a function of time delay, is found to be independent of the interaction range between the two skyrmions yet dependent on the box size. This peak corresponds to the characteristic time required for changing the skyrmion state: the box size divided by the average velocity of skyrmions. We can understand that the information transmission time consists of the time to obtain mutual information and the time to write the information. Since the unusual asymmetric circulation of information is revealed in this two-skyrmion system, it can be a unique platform for future applications to natural computing using flow of information, including more efficient machine learning algorithm.</description>

Abstract: The interplay between spin and charge degrees of freedom in low-dimensional systems is a cornerstone of modern spintronics, where achieving all-electrical control of spin currents is a major goal. Spin-orbit interactions provide a promising mechanism for such control, yet understanding how spin and charge transport emerge from microscopic principles remains a fundamental challenge. Here we develop a spin-dependent scattering matrix approach to describe spin and charge transport in a multiterminal system in the presence of Rashba spin-orbit interaction. Our framework generalizes the B\"uttiker formalism by offering explicit real-space expressions for spin and charge current densities, along with the corresponding linear response function. It simultaneously captures the effects of quantum confinement, the orbital response to external magnetic fields, and the intrinsic (geometric) properties of the electronic bands, offering a comprehensive description of the spin-charge interconversion mechanisms at play in a Hall bar, in agreement with experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we theoretically discuss thermal Hall effect of magnons in insulating N\'{e}el ordered antiferromagnets at zero external magnetic field. We show that for compensated N\'{e}el order the non-zero thermal Hall effect will occur inthe absence of any symmetry between the two magnetic sublattices, thus making the system ferrimagnetic. The thermal Hall effect of magnons will be non-zero by a virtue of the spin-momentum splitting of the magnon spectrum due to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction as well as anisotropic second-nearest exchange interaction different in the two magnetic sublattices, both corresponding to the broken symmetry. We construct a theoretical model in which an external electric field may change the symmetry of the antiferromagnetic system thus altering the thermal Hall effect of magnons.</description>

Abstract: Spin-momentum locking (SML) excitons in two-dimensional semiconductors are appealing to programmable optical control of spin-polarized carriers in ultrafast spintronics. To address the current thirsty for long-lived excitons with zero-external-field stability and room-temperature spin-polarization, we hereby predict the existence of intrinsically SML excitons in altermagnetic V$_2 X_2$O ($X=$ S, Se) driven by giant non-relativistic spin-splittings ($&gt;$ 1.2 eV). First-principles calculations reveal SML excitons with binding energies exceeding 1400 meV in monolayers and 430 meV in their van der Waals heterobilayers, along with stacking-dependent optical selection rules for tunable interlayer excitons. These remarkable physical properties, combined with their long radiative lifetimes, strongly suggest the feasibility of SML excitons with robust spin-polarization at room temperature. Our work provides a new paradigm for SML exciton physics via the novel altermagnetism, opening up new possibilities for all-optical manipulation in advanced opto-spintronics.</description>

Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC), a neural network designed for temporal data, enables efficient computation with low-cost training and direct physical implementation. Recently, quantum RC has opened new possibilities for conventional RC and introduced novel ideas to tackle open problems in quantum physics and advance quantum technologies. Despite its promise, it faces challenges, including physical realization, output readout, and measurement-induced back-action. Here, we propose to implement quantum RC through quantum transport in mesoscopic electronic systems. Our approach possesses several advantages: compatibility with existing device fabrication techniques, ease of output measurement, and robustness against measurement back-action. Leveraging universal conductance fluctuations, we numerically demonstrate two benchmark tasks, spoken-digit recognition and time-series forecasting, to validate our proposal. This work establishes a novel pathway for implementing on-chip quantum RC via quantum transport and expands the mesoscopic physics applications.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Mott transition and high-order van Hove singularity in twisted double bilayer WSe${}_2$: mean-field and functional renormalization group study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experiments on twisted double bilayer tungsten diselenide have demonstrated that moir'e semiconductors can realize a relativistic Mott transition, i.e., a quantum phase transition from a Dirac semimetal to a correlated insulating state, by twist-angle tuning. In addition, signatures of van Hove singularities were observed in the material's moir'e valence bands, suggesting further potential for the emergence of strongly-correlated states. Based on a continuum model, we provide a detailed analysis of the twist-angle dependence of the system's band structure, focusing on the evolution of the Dirac excitations and the Fermi-surface structure with its Lifshitz transitions across the van Hove fillings. We exhibit that the twist angle can be used to band engineer a high-order van Hove singularity, which can be accessed by gate tuning. We then study the magnetic phase diagram of an effective Hubbard model for twisted double bilayer tungsten diselenide on the effective honeycomb superlattice with tight-binding parameters fitted to the two topmost bands of the continuum model. To that end, we employ a self-consistent Hartree-Fock mean-field approach in real space. Fixing the angle-dependent Hubbard interaction based on the experimental findings, we explore a broad parameter range of twist angle, filling, and temperature. We find a rich variety of magnetic states that we expect to be accessible in future experiments, including, e.g., a non-coplanar spin-density wave with non-zero spin chirality and a half-metallic uniaxial spin-density wave. Finally, we employ a functional renormalization group approach to also study the competition between density-wave and superconducting instabilities. For twist angles of $\theta=2.0^\circ, 2.5^\circ$, as well as $\theta\approx 3.5^\circ$ -- where the high-order van Hove-singularity is found -- we find clear indications for unconventional superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Three-Dimensional Electrostatic and Quantum-Confinement Modeling of Silicon Nanowire Double Quantum Dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a three-dimensional simulation study of silicon nanowire double quantum dots (DQDs) with leads at T = 2 K, which extends beyond traditional effective mass or quasi-1D and quasi-2D approaches typically applied to bulk or planar geometries. A 3-D Poisson solver is self-consistently coupled to 2-D Schrodinger along slices normal to transport (width * thickness) to obtain spatially varying subbands and wavefunctions at T = 2 K. The slice approximation is justified by the large aspect ratio (Ltot/W &gt; 20) and by the small (&lt; 1.2 percent) wavefunction variation observed along the transport direction. The resulting effective conduction-band profile is imported into a full-wave, open-boundary Schrodinger solver to compute the transmission spectrum T(E), and the tunnel coupling (tc) is evaluated from the bonding and antibonding splitting of the first two resonances in T(E). The simulations show that narrow dots (W = 5 nm) provide strong confinement and robust single-electron localization but require higher plunger-gate voltage, whereas wider dots (W = 20 nm) load electrons at lower bias but form shallower, more delocalized states. The tunnel coupling decreases as the dot width and length are increased, due to the reduced wavefunction overlap between the dots, and saturates once W &gt; 2LPG, when longitudinal confinement is dominated by the plunger gate length. The simulated tunnel coupling trend agrees with experimental data reported for the Si DQD device.</description>

Abstract: Analog crossbar arrays consisting of emerging memory devices can greatly alleviate the computational strain required by vector matrix multiplications for neural network applications. The ability to produce spin orbit torque-magnetic random-access memory (SOT-MRAM) at wafer-scale positions SOT-MRAM as a strong memory candidate. In this work, we fabricate and measure 300 mm-compatible SOT-MRAM with 150% tunnel magnetoresistance ratio, fast (2 ns) and low voltage (&lt;1 V) operation, low energy dissipation (350 fJ), low write noise (0.1%), and low device-to-device variation of 10%. Through 2-bit quantization aware training and noisy training as mitigation techniques, the measured SOT-MRAM devices attain 95% on MNIST. The bi-stable anisotropy and stochastic switching of SOT-MRAM can additionally be leveraged for stochastic training of binary neural networks, able to reach ideal accuracy for a single device. Lastly, the devices were evaluated on implementation of probabilistic graph modeling and the interplay of tunnel magnetoresistance ratio, probability curve distribution, and conductance noise was shown to reduce potential errors in implementation. Through these results, SOT-MRAM is shown to be a uniquely effective candidate for implementation of crossbar accelerators in memory- and energy-limited applications, able to take advantage of stochastic operation and bi-stability to beneficial results in neural network applications.</description>

      <title>Tuning the Electronic Structure of Graphene by Controlling Spatial Confinement</title>

Abstract: The electronic properties of a material depend on the spatial freedom of the electron wavefunction. A well-known example is graphite, which is a conventional gapless semiconductor, while a single layer of it, graphene, exhibits extremely high electronic conductivity. Nevertheless, graphene ribbons can have different physical properties, such as a tunable band gap, from gapless to large band gap semiconductor. The purpose of this study is to investigate the electronic structure of graphene few-layers composed of a layer of graphene nanoribbons and graphene sheet(s), where quasi-one-dimensional nanoribbons can interact with two-dimensional sheet of graphite. Using the tight-binding model for graphite, we show how different configuration of such heterostructures can affect the electronic structure, in which is different from their components electronic structure. Namely, a gap of ~0.6 eV can be opened in a bilayer configuration composed of a layer of gapless armchair nanoribbon stacked on graphene.</description>

      <title>Interaction-induced reentrance of Bose glass and quench dynamics of Bose gases in twisted bilayer and quasicrystal optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03375v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the ground-state and dynamical properties of ultracold Bose gases in optical lattices with a quasicrystal structure, inspired by recent experiments on twisted bilayer and quasicrystalline optical lattices. The interplay between on-site repulsive interactions and the quasiperiodic potential leads to rich physics. At low filling factors, increasing the interaction strength induces a delocalization effect that transforms a Bose-glass (BG) phase-characterized by disconnected superfluid (SF) regions-into a robust SF phase with a percolated network of SF clusters. This transition is quantitatively identified via the percolation probability. At higher filling factors, we uncover a reentrant behavior: with increasing interaction, the system first changes from BG to SF, but further strengthening reverses the trend, restoring the BG phase. This reentrance originates from an interaction-driven rearrangement of particles, where a percolated SF network fragments into isolated SF islands as repulsion dominates. The quench dynamics show distinct transient features: intraphase quenches cause minor variations in the percolation probability and the inverse participation ratio (IPR), while interphase quenches produce strong responses. In particular, an SF-to-BG quench exhibits an abrupt loss of global SF connectivity, whereas a BG-to-SF quench shows oscillatory percolation and a gradual IPR decrease, stabilizing the SF phase. These results elucidate the competition between quasiperiodicity and interactions in ultracold Bose gases and offer insights relevant to current experiments with twisted bilayer and quasicrystal optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Skin Effect Induced Anomalous Dynamics from Charge-Fluctuating Initial States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium dynamics in non-Hermitian systems has attracted significant interest, particularly due to the skin effect and its associated anomalous phenomena. Previous studies have primarily focused on initial states with a definite particle number. Here, we present a systematic study of non-reciprocal quench dynamics in the pairing states with indefinite particle number. Our study uncovers a range of novel behaviors. Firstly, we demonstrate a universal tendency towards half-filling of particle density at late times. At early times for certain initial states, we observe a chiral wavefront in both particle number distribution and charge inflow, associated with a sharp decrease in particle number. Furthermore, we find that non-Hermiticity could enhance the growth of entanglement in the initial stages of evolution. In the intermediate time regime, the characteristic skin effect leads to particle accumulation on one side, leading to a pronounced reduction in entanglement entropy. Moreover, our results reveal the presence of the quantum Mpemba effect during the restoration of U(1) symmetry. Our findings open new avenues for exploring exotic dynamic phenomena in quantum many-body systems arising from the interplay of symmetry breaking and non-Hermiticity.</description>

      <title>Dual-Polarization SHG Interferometry for Imaging Antiparallel Domains and Stacking Angles of 2D Heterocrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical second-harmonic generation (SHG) enables orientational polarimetry for crystallographic analysis and domain imaging of various materials. However, conventional intensity polarimetry, which neglects phase information, fails to resolve antiparallel domains and to describe two-dimensional heterostructures, which represent a new class of van der Waals-bound composite crystals. In this work, we report dual-polarization spectral phase interferometry (DP-SPI) and establish a generalized SHG superposition model that incorporates the observables of DP-SPI. Antiparallel domains of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) were successfully imaged with distinction, validating the interferometric polarimetry. From DP interferograms of TMD heterobilayers, the orientation of each layer could be determined, enabling layer-resolved probing. By employing the superposition model, we also demonstrate the photonic design and fabrication of ternary TMD heterostructures for circularly polarized SHG. These methods, providing comprehensive SHG measurements and theoretical description, can be extended to heterostructures consisting of more than two constituent layers and are not limited to TMDs or 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Classical spin liquids from frustrated Ising models in hyperbolic space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic Ising models on frustrated lattices can realize classical spin liquids, with highly degenerate ground states and, possibly, fractionalized excitations and emergent gauge fields. Motivated by the recent interest in many-body system in negatively curved space, we study hyperbolic frustrated Ising models. Specifically, we consider nearest-neighbor Ising models on tesselations with odd-length loops in two-dimensional hyperbolic space. For finite systems with open boundaries we determine the ground-state degeneracy exactly, and we perform extensive finite-temperature Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain thermodynamic data as well as correlation functions. We show that the shape of the boundary, constituting an extensive part of the system, can be used to control low-energy states: Depending on the boundary, we find ordered or disordered ground states. Our results demonstrate how geometric frustration acts in curved space to produce classical spin liquids.</description>

      <title>Artificial discovery of lattice models for wave transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wave transport devices, such as amplifiers, frequency converters, and nonreciprocal devices, are essential for modern communication, signal processing, and sensing applications. Of particular interest are traveling wave setups, which offer excellent gain and bandwidth properties. So far, the conceptual design of those devices has relied on human ingenuity. This makes it difficult and time-consuming to explore the full design space under a variety of constraints and target functionalities. In our work, we present a method which automates this challenge. By optimizing the discrete and continuous parameters of periodic coupled-mode lattices, our approach identifies the simplest lattices that achieve the target transport functionality, and we apply it to discover new schemes for directional amplifiers, isolators, and frequency demultiplexers. Leveraging automated symbolic regression tools, we find closed analytical expressions that facilitate the discovery of generalizable construction rules. Moreover, we utilize important conceptual connections between the device transport properties and non-Hermitian topology. The resulting structures can be implemented on a variety of platforms, including microwave, optical, and optomechanical systems. Our approach opens the door to extensions like the artificial discovery of lattice models with desired properties in higher dimensions or with nonlinear interactions.</description>

      <title>Excitonic Coupling and Photon Antibunching in Venus Yellow Fluorescent Protein Dimers: A Lindblad Master Equation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14233v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong excitonic coupling and photon antibunching (AB) have been observed together in Venus yellow fluorescent protein dimers and currently lack a cohesive theoretical explanation. In 2019, Kim et al. demonstrated Davydov splitting in circular dichroism spectra, revealing strong J-like coupling, while antibunched fluorescence emission was confirmed by combined antibunching--fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (AB/FCS fingerprinting). To investigate the implications of this coexistence, Venus yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) dimer population dynamics are modeled within a Lindblad master equation framework, testing its ability to cope with typical, data-informed, Venus YFP dimer time and energy values. Simulations predict multiple-femtosecond (fs) decoherence, yielding bright/dark state mixtures consistent with antibunched fluorescence emission at room temperature. Thus, excitonic coupling and photon AB in Venus YFP dimers are reconciled without invoking long-lived quantum coherence. However, clear violations of several Lindblad approximation validity conditions appear imminent, calling for careful modifications to choices of standard system and bath definitions and parameter values.</description>

      <title>An introduction to Markovian open quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is a concise, pedagogical introduction to the dynamic field of open quantum systems governed by Markovian master equations. We focus on the mathematical and physical origins of the widely used Lindblad equation, its unraveling in terms of stochastic pure-state trajectories and the corresponding continuous measurement protocols, the structure of steady states with emphasis on the role of symmetry and conservation laws, and a sampling of the novel physical phenomena that arise from nonunitary dynamics (dissipation and measurements). This is far from a comprehensive summary of the field. Rather, the objective is to provide a conceptual foundation and physically illuminating examples that are useful to graduate students and researchers entering this subject. There are exercise problems and references for further reading throughout the notes.</description>
