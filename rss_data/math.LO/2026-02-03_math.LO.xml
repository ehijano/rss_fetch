      <title>Effective Dimension s and Gauge Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the gauge profile of $\mathcal{D}_s$, the set of reals with effective dimension $s$, and $\mathcal{D}_{\leq s}$, the set of reals with effective dimension $\leq s$. Let $W(s)$ be the set of reals that are $s$-well approximable. This gives us a separation between $\mathcal{D}_{\leq s}$ and $W(2/s)$ in terms of Hausdorff measure.</description>

      <title>A Baire Category Approach to Besicovitch's Theorem and Measure Regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By reformulating the classical proof as a Baire Category argument, we show that Besicovitch's Theorem in Cantor space is provable in $ACA_0$, and additionally that the witnessing subset is computable from one jump of the original set. We show that the necessary formulation of Baire Category, which we call Baire Category Theorem for Closed Sets (BCTC), is equivalent to $ACA_0$, contrasting with previous results on the reverse math strength of Baire Category variants. We also examine the implications of BCTC for more general monotone functions on closed sets, and explore how changing the representation of a closed set affects the reverse math strength of its measure regularity properties.</description>

      <title>A Class of Generalised Quantifiers for k-Variable Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce k-quantifier logics -- logics with access to k-tuples of elements and very general quantification patterns for transitions between k-tuples. The framework is very expressive and encompasses e.g. the k-variable fragments of first-order logic, modal logic, and monotone neighbourhood semantics. We introduce a corresponding notion of bisimulation and prove variants of the classical Ehrenfeucht-Fraisse and Hennessy-Milner theorem. Finally, we show a Lindstrom-style characterisation for k-quantifier logics that satisfy Los' theorem by proving that they are the unique maximally expressive logics that satisfy Los' theorem and are invariant under the associated bisimulation relations.</description>

      <title>Laver ultrafilters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce $\textit{Laver ultrafilters}$, namely ultrafilters $\mathcal{U}$ for which the associated Laver forcing $\mathbb{L}_{\mathcal{U}}$ has the Laver property. We give simple combinatorial characterisations of these ultrafilters, which allow us to analyse their position among several well-studied combinatorial classes, including $P$-points, rapid ultrafilters, and ultrafilters arising in Baumgartner's $\mathcal{I}$-ultrafilter framework. In particular, we show that the class of Laver ultrafilters properly contains the class of rapid $P$-points and that it is properly contained both in the class of hereditarily rapid- and in the class of measure zero ultrafilters. Finally, we investigate the (generic) existence of Laver ultrafilters and establish bounds on their generic existence number. In particular, we show that it is consistent that $P$-points do not exist while Laver ultrafilters exist generically.</description>

      <title>Convex sets and Axiom of Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under $\mathrm{ZF}$, we show that the statement that every subset of every $\mathbb{R}$-vector space has a maximal convex subset is equivalent to the Axiom of Choice. We also study the strength of the same statement restricted to some specific $\mathbb{R}$-vector spaces. In particular, we show that the statement for $\mathbb{R}^2$ is equivalent to the Axiom of Countable Choice for reals, whereas the statement for $\mathbb{R}^3$ is equivalent to the Axiom of Uniformization. We discuss the statement for some spaces of higher dimensions as well.</description>

      <title>Newelski's Conjecture for $o$-Minimal and $p$-Adic Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $ M_0 $ denote either the field structure $ \mathbb{Q}_p $ of $ p $-adic numbers, or an $o$-minimal expansion of the field structure $ \mathbb{R} $ of real numbers. We investigate the minimal flows and Ellis groups of definable groups over $ M_0 $ from the perspective of definable topological dynamics. This paper builds on the research initiated in \cite{BY-APAL} and generalizes the main results thereof in two key ways: First, we extend the scope of these results from reductive algebraic groups to arbitrary definable groups. Second, we generalize the approach from $ p $-adically closed fields to $o$-minimal expansions of real closed fields.
  Let $G$ be a definable group over $M_0$, and let $B$ be a definably amenable component (see Definition \ref{def-DAC}) of $G$. In a certain sense, $B$ can be regarded as a ``maximal definably amenable subgroup'' of $G$ (see Fact \ref{fact-max-DA-subgroup}). The main conclusion of this paper is as follows: For any $M \succ M_0$, the Ellis group of the universal definable flow of $G$ over $M$ is isomorphic to that of $B$ over $M$. In particular, the Ellis groups of the universal definable flow of $G$ are model-independent, as is the case for $B$ (see \cite{CS-Definably-Amenable-NIP-Groups}). As a consequence, we conclude that Newelski's Conjecture holds if and only if $G$ is definably amenable when $M_0 = \mathbb{Q}_p$.</description>

      <title>Model theory of term algebras revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on work of Maltsev on locally free algebras in finite purely functional languages, we revisit the model theory of (absolutely free) term algebras and their completions. Maltsev's analysis yields a natural axiomatization together with quantifier elimination to positive Boolean combinations of special formulas, and shows that the complete extensions are parametrized exactly by the number $k\in\{0,1,\dots,\omega\}$ of indecomposable elements; for $1\le k\le\omega$ the standard model is the free term algebra on $k$ generators.
  We give a new, quantifier-elimination--free proof of completeness using Ehrenfeucht--Fra\"iss\'e games, and we establish several further structural properties of the standard models and theories. In particular, for $1\le k\le\omega$ we prove first-order rigidity and atomicity of the standard model.
  For every $0\le k\le\omega$ we show that the corresponding theory does not have the finite cover property and weakly eliminates imaginaries. We also provide new proofs of stability-theoretic features previously obtained by Belegradek: the theories are stable but not superstable, normal (hence $1$-based), and have trivial forking; consequently, no infinite group is interpretable in any model.
  Finally, we analyze model completeness and show that $T_0$ is the model companion of the theory of locally free algebras, while the theories with $k\ge 1$ are not model complete.</description>

      <title>The Cofinality of Generating Familes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The topology of a separable metrizable space $M$ is \emph{generated} by a family $\mathcal{C}$ of its subsets provided that a set $A\subseteq M$ is closed in $M$ if and only if $A\cap C$ is closed in $C$ for each $C\in \mathcal{C}$. The \emph{sequentiality number}, $\mathop{seq}(M)$, and \emph{$k$-ness number}, $\mathop{k}(M)$, of $M$, are the minimum size of a generating family of convergent sequences, respectively compact subsets.
  Let $\mathfrak{b}$ be the minimum size of an unbounded set in $\omega^\omega$ with the mod finite order. For a cardinal $\kappa$, the \emph{sampling number}, $\mathop{sam}(\kappa)$, is the least number of countable subsets of $\kappa$ needed to have infinite intersection with every countably-infinite subset of $\kappa$. It is shown using the Tukey order on relations that (1) $\mathop{seq}(M)=\mathop{sam}(|M|)\cdot \mathfrak{b}$, unless $M$ is locally small (every point of $M$ has a neighborhood of size strictly less than $|M|$) in which case $\mathop{seq}(M)=\lim_{\mu &lt;|M|} \mathop{sam}(\mu)\cdot \mathfrak{b}$ and (2) $k(M)$ is in the interval $[kc(M)\cdot\mathfrak{b},\mathop{sam}(kc(M))\cdot \mathfrak{b}]$, where $kc(M)$ is the minimum number of compact sets that cover $M$. Shelah's \emph{PCF} theory is shown to provide tools to bound the sampling number, specifically, the covering number bounds from above, while mod finite scales give lower bounds.
  Solutions to problems of van Douwen's on the $k$-ness number of analytic and of co-analytic spaces are deduced.</description>

      <title>Decidability of Interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Bodirsky-Pinsker conjecture asserts a P vs. NP-complete dichotomy for the computational complexity of Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) of first-order reducts of finitely bounded homogeneous structures. Prominently, two structures in the scope of the conjecture have log-space equivalent CSPs if they are pp-bi-interpretable, or equivalently, if their polymorphism clones are topologically isomorphic. The latter gives rise to the algebraic approach which regards structures with topologically isomorphic polymorphism clones as equivalent and seeks to identify structural reasons for hardness or tractability in topological clones. We establish that the equivalence relation of pp-bi-interpretability underlying this approach is reasonable: On the one hand, we show that it is decidable under mild conditions on the templates; this improves a theorem of Bodirsky, Pinsker and Tsankov (LICS'11) on decidability of equality of polymorphism clones. On the other hand, we show that within the much larger class of transitive $\omega$-categorical structures without algebraicity, the equivalence relation is of lowest possible complexity in terms of descriptive set theory: namely, it is smooth, i.e., Borel-reduces to equality on the real numbers. On our way to showing the first result, we establish that the model-complete core of a structure that has a finitely bounded Ramsey expansion (which might include all structures of the Bodirsky-Pinsker conjecture) is computable, thereby providing a constructive alternative to previous non-constructive proofs of its existence.</description>

      <title>A formula for any real number, maybe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss how to write down three specific natural numbers $A$, $B$, $C$ such that for any real number $r$ you've probably ever thought of, it is consistent with $\mathsf{ZFC}$ set theory that $$\def\Rb{\mathbb{R}}\def\Nb{\mathbb{N}}r = \log\left(\sup_{x_0,x_1 \in \Rb} \inf_{x_2 \in \Rb} \sup_{x_3 \in \Rb}\inf_{x_4 \in \Rb}\sup_{m \in \Nb}\inf_{n_0,\dots,n_{A} \in \Nb} x^2_0
  \begin{bmatrix} \phantom{+}(n_0 - 2)^2 + (n_1-m)^2 \\ + n_2 + (n_B - n_C)^2 \\ + n_3 \sum_{k=0}^4 ( x_k - \frac{n_{k+5}}{1+n_4} +n_4)^2 \\ + \sum_{i,j = 0}^B (n_{9+2^i3^j} - n_i^{n_j})^2 \end{bmatrix}
  \right).$$ We also discuss why it's possible, assuming the existence of certain large cardinals, for there to be a real number $s$ which cannot be the value of this formula for our particular $A$, $B$, $C$. This involves set-theoretic mice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a combinatorial and order-theoretic framework for shuffles, understood as ordered concatenations of indexed families of sequences that induce total orders on the natural numbers. Motivated by the classical \v{S}arkovski\u{i} order, we introduce elementary building blocks that encode finite and infinite order patterns and focus on decomposable shuffles constructed from finite ordinals together with $\omega$ and its dual $\omega^*$. We define representations that allow individual elements to be located within a shuffle and show how suitable structural conditions yield total orders on $\mathbb{N}$</description>

      <title>Non-standard analysis for coherent risk estimation: hyperfinite representations, discrete Kusuoka formulae, and plug-in asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a non-standard analysis framework for coherent risk measures and their finite-sample analogues, coherent risk estimators, building on recent work of Aichele, Cialenco, Jelito, and Pitera. Coherent risk measures on $L^\infty$ are realised as standard parts of internal support functionals on Loeb probability spaces, and coherent risk estimators arise as finite-grid restrictions.
  Our main results are: (i) a hyperfinite robust representation theorem that yields, as finite shadows, the robust representation results for coherent risk estimators; (ii) a discrete Kusuoka representation for law-invariant coherent risk estimators as suprema of mixtures of discrete expected shortfalls on $\{k/n:k=1,\ldots,n\}$; (iii) uniform almost sure consistency (with an explicit rate) for canonical spectral plug-in estimators over Lipschitz spectral classes; (iv) a Kusuoka-type plug-in consistency theorem under tightness and uniform estimation assumptions; (v) bootstrap validity for spectral plug-in estimators via an NSA reformulation of the functional delta method (under standard smoothness assumptions on $F_X$); and (vi) asymptotic normality obtained through a hyperfinite central limit theorem.
  The hyperfinite viewpoint provides a transparent probability-to-statistics dictionary: applying a risk measure to a law corresponds to evaluating an internal functional on a hyperfinite empirical measure and taking the standard part. We include a standardd self-contained introduction to the required non-standard tools.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are able to explicitly compute the bimodule structure of von Neumann algebra inclusions in handle constructions, which arise as inductive limits of iterated amalgamated free products not elementarily equivalent to $L(\mathbb{F}_2)$. Our computation is achieved via identifying delicate normal form decompositions in amalgamated free products built in an iterated fashion. Using these techniques, we are able to show that the handles constructions are always full, without any need to appeal to Property (T) phenomena which was essential in all previous works. Furthermore our bimodule machinery works in the setting of arbitrary von Neumann algebras equipped with faithful normal states, yielding examples of full $\mathrm{III}_1$ factors via handle constructions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.07973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We continue the work from [8] and make a small -- but significant -- improvement to the definition of $j$-decomposable system. This provides us with a better lifting of elementary embeddings to symmetric extensions. In particular, this allows us to more easily lift weakly compact embeddings and thus preserve the notion of weakly critical cardinals. We use this improved lifting criterion to show that the first measurable cardinal can be the first weakly critical cardinal or the first Mahlo cardinal, both relative to the existence of a single measurable cardinal. However, if the first inaccessible cardinal is the first measurable cardinal, then in a suitable inner model it has Mitchell order of at least $2$.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Propositional Logic with Strict Implication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fundamental logic was introduced by Wesley Holliday (2023) to unify intuitionistic logic and quantum logic from a proof-theoretic perspective, capturing the logic determined solely by the introduction and elimination rules of connectives $\neg$, $\wedge$, $\vee$. This paper incorporates strict implication -- standard in intuitionistic logic and a significant candidate for quantum logic -- into the framework of fundamental propositional logic. We demonstrate that, unlike the original language, the presence of strict implication causes the semantic consequence relations over pseudo-reflexive pseudo-symmetric frames and reflexive pseudo-symmetric frames to diverge. Consequently, we provide separate axiomatizations for these two logics in the language $\{\perp, \wedge, \vee, \rightarrow\}$. Soundness and completeness theorems are established for both systems.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the notions of u-amenability and hyper-u-amenability for countable Borel equivalence relations, strong forms of amenability that are implied by hyperfiniteness. We show that treeable, hyper-u-amenable countable Borel equivalence relations are hyperfinite. One of the corollaries that we get is that if a countable Borel equivalence relation is measure-hyperfinite and equal to the orbit equivalence relation of a free continuous action of a virtually free group on a $\sigma$-compact Polish space, then it is hyperfinite. We also obtain that if a countable Borel equivalence relation is treeable and equal to the orbit equivalence relation of a Borel action of an amenable group on a standard Borel space, or if it is treeable, amenable and Borel bounded, then it is hyperfinite.</description>

      <title>On the cohomology of finite-dimensional nilpotent groups and Lie rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give some vanishing results for the first classical cohomology group in the case of finite-dimensional nilpotent groups and Lie rings. Based on the established cohomological results, we derive some structural consequences : we prove a form of Frattini's argument for definable connected Cartan subrings and we give a definable version of Maschke's theorem for the action of a definable connected p-divisible abelian group.</description>

      <title>Maximal Prikry Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the covering machinery of the Jensen-Steel core model $K$, under the hypothesis that there is no inner model with a Woodin cardinal. In an earlier work, Mitchell and the first author showed that if $\nu&gt;\omega_2$ is a regular cardinal in $K$ but a singular ordinal in $V$, then $\nu$ is a measurable cardinal in $K$. In this article, we further show that under certain circumstances, there exists a maximal Prikry sequence $C$ for a measure on $\nu$ in $K$. The first author shows that the anti-large cardinal hypothesis is necessary. In a more restrictive setting, we prove that every subset of $\nu$ with size $&lt;|\nu|$ can be covered by a set in $K[C]$ with size $&lt;|\nu|$. Benhamou and the first author show that the result is optimal.</description>
