      <title>An Interpretable Vision Transformer as a Fingerprint-Based Diagnostic Aid for Kabuki and Wiedemann-Steiner Syndromes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kabuki syndrome (KS) and Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome (WSS) are rare but distinct developmental disorders that share overlapping clinical features, including neurodevelopmental delay, growth restriction, and persistent fetal fingertip pads. While genetic testing remains the diagnostic gold standard, many individuals with KS or WSS remain undiagnosed due to barriers in access to both genetic testing and expertise. Dermatoglyphic anomalies, despite being established hallmarks of several genetic syndromes, remain an underutilized diagnostic signal in the era of molecular testing. This study presents a vision transformer-based deep learning model that leverages fingerprint images to distinguish individuals with KS and WSS from unaffected controls and from one another. We evaluate model performance across three binary classification tasks. Across the three classification tasks, the model achieved AUC scores of 0.80 (control vs. KS), 0.73 (control vs. WSS), and 0.85 (KS vs. WSS), with corresponding F1 scores of 0.71, 0.72, and 0.83, respectively. Beyond classification, we apply attention-based visualizations to identify fingerprint regions most salient to model predictions, enhancing interpretability. Together, these findings suggest the presence of syndrome-specific fingerprint features, demonstrating the feasibility of a fingerprint-based artificial intelligence (AI) tool as a noninvasive, interpretable, and accessible future diagnostic aid for the early diagnosis of underdiagnosed genetic syndromes.</description>

      <title>Internalized Morphogenesis: A Self-Organizing Model for Growth, Replication, and Regeneration via Local Token Exchange in Modular Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents an internalized morphogenesis model for autonomous systems, such as swarm robotics and micro-nanomachines, that eliminates the need for external spatial computation. Traditional self-organizing models often require calculations across the entire coordinate space, including empty areas, which is impractical for resource-constrained physical modules. Our proposed model achieves complex morphogenesis through strictly local interactions between adjacent modules within the "body." By extending the "Ishida token model," modules exchange integer values using an RD-inspired discrete analogue without solving differential equations. The internal potential, derived from token accumulation and aging, guides autonomous growth, shrinkage, and replication. Simulations on a hexagonal grid demonstrated the emergence of limb-like extensions, self-division, and robust regeneration capabilities following structural amputation. A key feature is the use of the body boundary as a natural sink for information entropy (tokens) to maintain a dynamic equilibrium. These results indicate that sophisticated morphological behaviors can emerge from minimal, internal-only rules. This framework offers a computationally efficient and biologically plausible approach to developing self-repairing, adaptive, and autonomous hardware.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Mirror-Image Peptide Sequence Design for Data Storage via Peptide Bond Cleavage Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional non-biological storage media, such as hard drives, face limitations in both storage density and lifespan due to the rapid growth of data in the big data era. Mirror-image peptides composed of D-amino acids have emerged as a promising biological storage medium due to their high storage density, structural stability, and long lifespan. The sequencing of mirror-image peptides relies on \textit{de-novo} technology. However, its accuracy is limited by the scarcity of tandem mass spectrometry datasets and the challenges that current algorithms encounter when processing these peptides directly. This study is the first to propose improving sequencing accuracy indirectly by optimizing the design of mirror-image peptide sequences. In this work, we introduce DBond, a deep neural network based model that integrates sequence features, precursor ion properties, and mass spectrometry environmental factors for the prediction of mirror-image peptide bond cleavage. In this process, sequences with a high peptide bond cleavage ratio, which are easy to sequence, are selected. The main contributions of this study are as follows. First, we constructed MiPD513, a tandem mass spectrometry dataset containing 513 mirror-image peptides. Second, we developed the peptide bond cleavage labeling algorithm (PBCLA), which generated approximately 12.5 million labeled data based on MiPD513. Third, we proposed a dual prediction strategy that combines multi-label and single-label classification. On an independent test set, the single-label classification strategy outperformed other methods in both single and multiple peptide bond cleavage prediction tasks, offering a strong foundation for sequence optimization.</description>

      <title>Prenatal Stress Detection from Electrocardiography Using Self-Supervised Deep Learning: Development and External Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prenatal psychological stress affects 15-25% of pregnancies and increases risks of preterm birth, low birth weight, and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. Current screening relies on subjective questionnaires (PSS-10), limiting continuous monitoring. We developed deep learning models for stress detection from electrocardiography (ECG) using the FELICITy 1 cohort (151 pregnant women, 32-38 weeks gestation). A ResNet-34 encoder was pretrained via SimCLR contrastive learning on 40,692 ECG segments per subject. Multi-layer feature extraction enabled binary classification and continuous PSS prediction across maternal (mECG), fetal (fECG), and abdominal ECG (aECG). External validation used the FELICITy 2 RCT (28 subjects, different ECG device, yoga intervention vs. control). On FELICITy 1 (5-fold CV): mECG 98.6% accuracy (R2=0.88, MAE=1.90), fECG 99.8% (R2=0.95, MAE=1.19), aECG 95.5% (R2=0.75, MAE=2.80). External validation on FELICITy 2: mECG 77.3% accuracy (R2=0.62, MAE=3.54, AUC=0.826), aECG 63.6% (R2=0.29, AUC=0.705). Signal quality-based channel selection outperformed all-channel averaging (+12% R2 improvement). Mixed-effects models detected a significant intervention response (p=0.041). Self-supervised deep learning on pregnancy ECG enables accurate, objective stress assessment, with multi-layer feature extraction substantially outperforming single embedding approaches.</description>

      <title>AFD-INSTRUCTION: A Comprehensive Antibody Instruction Dataset with Functional Annotations for LLM-Based Understanding and Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced protein representation learning. However, their capacity to interpret and design antibodies through natural language remains limited. To address this challenge, we present AFD-Instruction, the first large-scale instruction dataset with functional annotations tailored to antibodies. This dataset encompasses two key components: antibody understanding, which infers functional attributes directly from sequences, and antibody design, which enables de novo sequence generation under functional constraints. These components provide explicit sequence-function alignment and support antibody design guided by natural language instructions. Extensive instruction-tuning experiments on general-purpose LLMs demonstrate that AFD-Instruction consistently improves performance across diverse antibody-related tasks. By linking antibody sequences with textual descriptions of function, AFD-Instruction establishes a new foundation for advancing antibody modeling and accelerating therapeutic discovery.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Re-Analysis of the Phylogenetic Topology of Early SARS-CoV-2 Case Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01484v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A much-cited 2022 paper by Pekar et al. claimed that Bayesian analysis of the molecular phylogeny of early SARS-CoV-2 cases indicated that it was more likely that two successful introductions to humans had occurred than that just one had. Here I show that after correcting a fundamental error in Bayesian reasoning the results in that paper give larger likelihood for a single introduction than for two.</description>
