      <title>Practical realization of chiral nonlinearity for strong topological protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear topology has been much less inquired compared to its linear counterpart. Existing advances have focused on nonlinearities of limited magnitudes and fairly homogeneous types. As such, the realizations have rarely been concerned with the requirements for nonlinearity. Here we explore nonlinear topological protection through the determination of nonlinear rules and demonstrate their relevance in real-world experiments. We take advantage of chiral symmetry and identify the condition for its continuation in general nonlinear environments. Applying it to one-dimensional topological lattices, we can obtain definite evolution paths of zero-energy edge states that preserve topologically nontrivial phases regardless of the specifics of the chiral nonlinearities. Based on an acoustic prototype design, we theoretically, numerically, and experimentally showcase the nonlinear topological edge states that persist in all nonlinear degrees and directions without any frequency shift. Our findings unveil a broad family of nonlinearities that are compatible with topological non-triviality, establishing a solid ground for future drilling in the emergent field of nonlinear topology.</description>

      <title>Controller to eliminate the first harmonic in delayed periodic signal with application to rotational scanning atomic force microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The plant (system to be controlled) produces a periodic signal containing broad spectrum of the Fourier harmonics. The first Fourier harmonic (sine-type signal) assumed to be undesirable and should be removed by an external force, while other harmonics should be preserved. Because the measured plant data has an unknown amount of time delay and a sensitivity of the plant to external force is unknown, thus the amplitude and the phase of an anti-sine control force are unknown as well. We developed an adaptive controller described as a linear time-invariant system which is able to remove the first harmonic from the plant's output by constantly adjusting it's parameters of control force even if time delay of the plant output signal and plant sensitivity to the external force have slow variations over time. That type of controller was requested to further extend capabilities of newly developed high-speed large-area rotational scanning atomic force microscopy technique where the sample is rotated and a tilt angle between the normal of the sample surface and the axis of rotation produces the parasitic first Fourier harmonic which significantly limits the scanning area.</description>
