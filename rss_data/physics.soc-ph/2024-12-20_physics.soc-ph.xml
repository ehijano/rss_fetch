      <title>Characterising the dynamics of unlabelled temporal networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Networks model the architecture backbone of complex systems. The backbone itself can change over time leading to what is called `temporal networks'. Interpreting temporal networks as trajectories in graph space of a latent graph dynamics has recently enabled the extension of concepts and tools from dynamical systems and time series to networks. Here we address temporal networks with unlabelled nodes, a case that has received relatively little attention so far. Situations in which node labelling cannot be tracked over time often emerge in practice due to technical challenges, or privacy constraints. In unlabelled temporal networks there is no one-to-one matching between a network snapshot and its adjacency matrix. Characterizing the dynamical properties of such unlabelled network trajectories is nontrivial. We here exploit graph invariants to extend to the unlabelled setting network-dynamical quantifiers of linear correlations and dynamical instability. In particular, we focus on autocorrelation functions and the sensitive dependence on initial conditions. We show with synthetic graph dynamics that the measures are capable of recovering and estimating these dynamical fingerprints even when node labels are unavailable. We also validate the methods for some empirical temporal networks with removed node labels.</description>

      <title>Vulnerable Connectivity Caused by Local Communities in Spatial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been shown that randomly formed communities in topological networks reduce the robustness of connectivity. However, in spatial networks, where community structures are not random but constrained by physical and geographical factors, the effect of these structures on the robustness is unclear. This paper investigates the emergence of local communities in road and communication networks, whose nodes are located by population data of major urban areas in Japan, and connected shortly with low cost. We show that, as the strength of community increases, the spatial networks become more vulnerable to both intentional attacks and random failures. As an application point of view, this result suggests that the densely setting nodes of equipments should be avoided under short links in constructing a spatial network. These findings contribute to understanding the important relation between local communities and the robustness of connectivity against attacks and disasters especially in spatial networks.</description>

      <title>Phase transition in evolving networks that combine preferential attachment and random node deletion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analytical results are presented for the structure of networks that evolve via a preferential-attachment-random-deletion (PARD) model in the regime of overall network growth and in the regime of overall contraction. The phase transition between the two regimes is studied. At each time step a node addition and preferential attachment step takes place with probability $P_{\rm add}$, and a random node deletion step takes place with probability $P_{\rm del} = 1 - P_{\rm add}$. The balance between growth and contraction is captured by the parameter $\eta = P_{\rm add} - P_{\rm del}$, which in the regime of overall network growth satisfies $0 &lt; \eta \le 1$ and in the regime of overall network contraction $-1 \le \eta &lt; 0$. Using the master equation and computer simulations we show that for $-1 &lt; \eta &lt; 0$ the time-dependent degree distribution $P_t(k)$ converges towards a stationary form $P_{\rm st}(k)$ which exhibits an exponential tail. This is in contrast with the power-law tail of the stationary degree distribution obtained for $0 &lt; \eta \le 1$. Thus, the PARD model has a phase transition at $\eta=0$, which separates between two structurally distinct phases. At the transition, for $\eta=0$, the degree distribution exhibits a stretched exponential tail. While the stationary degree distribution in the phase of overall growth represents an asymptotic state, in the phase of overall contraction $P_{\rm st}(k)$ represents an intermediate asymptotic state of a finite life span, which disappears when the network vanishes.</description>

      <title>Computational Sociology of Humans and Machines; Conflict and Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This Chapter examines the dynamics of conflict and collaboration in human-machine systems, with a particular focus on large-scale, internet-based collaborative platforms. While these platforms represent successful examples of collective knowledge production, they are also sites of significant conflict, as diverse participants with differing intentions and perspectives interact. The analysis identifies recurring patterns of interaction, including serial attacks, reciprocal revenge, and third-party interventions. These microstructures reveal the role of experience, cultural differences, and topic sensitivity in shaping human-human, human-machine, and machine-machine interactions. The chapter further investigates the role of algorithmic agents and bots, highlighting their dual nature: they enhance collaboration by automating tasks but can also contribute to persistent conflicts with both humans and other machines. We conclude with policy recommendations that emphasize transparency, balance, cultural sensitivity, and governance to maximize the benefits of human-machine synergy while minimizing potential detriments.</description>

      <title>The Diffusive Nature of Housing Prices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the French housing market prices in the period 1970-2022, with high-resolution data from 2018 to 2022. The spatial correlation of the observed price field exhibits logarithmic decay characteristic of the two-dimensional random diffusion equation -- local interactions may create long-range correlations. We introduce a stylized model, used in the past to model spatial regularities in voting patterns, that accounts for both spatial and temporal correlations with reasonable values of parameters. Our analysis reveals that price shocks are persistent in time and their amplitude is strongly heterogeneous in space. Our study confirms and quantifies the diffusive nature of housing prices that was anticipated long ago (Clapp et al. 1994, Pollakowski et al. 1997), albeit on much restricted, local data sets.</description>

      <title>From Nonequilibrium to Equilibrium: Insights from a Two-Population Occupation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In socioeconomic systems, nonequilibrium dynamics naturally stem from the generically non-reciprocal interactions between self-interested agents, whereas equilibrium descriptions often only apply to scenarios where individuals act with the common good in mind. We bridge these two contrasting paradigms by studying a Sakoda-Schelling occupation model with both individualistic and altruistic agents, who, in isolation, follow nonequilibrium and equilibrium dynamics respectively. We investigate how the relative fraction of these two populations impacts the behavior of the system. In particular, we find that when fluctuations in the agents' decision-making process are small (high rationality), a very moderate amount of altruistic agents mitigates the sub-optimal concentration of individualists in dense clusters. In the regime where fluctuations carry more weight (low rationality), on the other hand, altruism progressively allows the agents to coordinate in a way that is significantly more robust, which we understand by reducing the model to a single effective population studied through the lens of active matter physics. We highlight that localizing the altruistic intervention at the right point in space may be paramount for its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Multipartite Entanglement Routing as a Hypergraph Immersion Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multipartite entanglement, linking multiple nodes simultaneously, is a higher-order correlation that offers advantages over pairwise connections in quantum networks (QNs). Creating reliable, large-scale multipartite entanglement requires entanglement routing, a process that combines local, short-distance connections into a long-distance connection, which can be considered as a transformation of network topology. Here, we address the question of whether a QN can be topologically transformed into another via entanglement routing. Our key result is an exact mapping from multipartite entanglement routing to Nash-Williams's graph immersion problem, extended to hypergraphs. This generalized hypergraph immersion problem introduces a partial order between QN topologies, permitting certain topological transformations while precluding others, offering discerning insights into the design and manipulation of higher-order network topologies in QNs.</description>
