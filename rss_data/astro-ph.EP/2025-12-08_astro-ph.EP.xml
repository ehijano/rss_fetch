      <title>TESS phase curve of ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-189 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermal structures of highly irradiated ultra-hot Jupiters can deviate substantially from those of cooler hot Jupiters. For planets orbiting rapidly rotating, and consequently oblate, host stars, photometric light curves provide a unique opportunity to measure the spin-orbit angle. Moreover, in systems with significant spin-orbit misalignment, the stellar oblateness can induce observable orbital precession. We wish to study the atmosphere and orbital architecture of an ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-189 b, orbiting around a hot A-type star. We use the photometric phase curves and gravity-darkened transits of WASP-189 b observed with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), complemented with the archival observations from CHaracterising ExOPlanet Satellite (CHEOPS). We detected a phase curve signal with significant occultation depth of 203.4 (+16.2) (-16.3) ppm, while the nightside flux, -71.8 (+36.4) (-36.0) ppm, is consistent with zero at 2-sigma. We invert the phase curve signal to construct the temperature map of the planet. The map was subsequently used to estimate the Bond albedo and heat redistribution efficiency, the expected median ranges of which are found to be 0.19-0.35 and 0.09-0.41, respectively. Finally, we analysed gravity-darkened transits to find that the planet is in polar orbit with the spin-orbit angle of 89.46 (+1.08) (-1.08) deg. We found no hint of orbital precession while comparing our results with those from the literature. Our observations, together with atmospheric modelling, suggest that the dayside emission of WASP-189 b in TESS and CHEOPS bandpasses is dominated by thermal emission from an atmosphere with extremely inefficient heat transport and negligible contribution from reflected light.</description>

      <title>Predictions of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope Galactic Exoplanet Survey. V. Detection Rates of Multiplanetary Systems in High Magnification Microlensing Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will expand the reach of gravitational microlensing surveys by increasing the number of events monitored and the precision of their light curves. We investigate Roman's ability to detect triple-lens microlensing systems, cases where a foreground star with two bound exoplanets produces detectable anomalies in a microlensing event, using its planned high-cadence observations toward the Galactic bulge. We simulate a large set of high-magnification microlensing light curves based on Roman's expected survey characteristics. A detection criterion, based on a required $\chi^2$ improvement for a two-planet model, is applied to determine whether the second planet can be reliably distinguished from a single-planet (binary-lens) model. Our simulations show that the majority of two-planet microlensing events would be detectable with Roman. Events in which both planets are relatively massive (planet-star mass ratios of order $10^{-3}$), or in which the more massive planet occupies a favorable resonant configuration, produce strong central perturbations, resulting in detection efficiencies of roughly 90\%. By contrast, systems with only low-mass planets ($q \sim 10^{-4}$) or with less favorable alignments generate much weaker signals, which often fall below the detection threshold. In general, the planetary mass ratios and the resulting caustic geometry (e.g., central caustic size in resonant versus wide/close orbits) are the dominant factors governing detectability. Taking into account the expected frequency of planetary systems and the fraction of high-magnification events, we estimate that Roman will detect a high-magnification triple-lens event in approximately 4.5\% of multi-planet microlensing events, corresponding to about 64 events over the course of the full survey.</description>

      <title>Keck Observations in the INfrared of Taurus and $\rho$ Oph Exoplanets And Ultracool dwarfs (KOINTREAU) I: A Planetary-Mass Companion and a Disk-Obscured Stellar Companion Discovered in Taurus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first discoveries from Keck Observations in the INfrared of Taurus and $\rho$ Oph Exoplanets And Ultracool dwarfs (KOINTREAU), an adaptive optics imaging survey of young stars in the Taurus and $\rho$ Oph star-forming regions using the Keck infrared pyramid wavefront sensor (PyWFS). We have found two faint ($\Delta$K~7 mag), wide-separation companions to two ~3-Myr-old Taurus members. Relative astrometry for these systems show that both companions are bound to their host stars. We obtained near-infrared spectra of these companions using IRTF/SpeX (R~100) and Gemini/GNIRS (R~1000-2000), and combine these with photometry from our NIRC2 imaging, the Pan-STARRS survey, and Spitzer/IRAC archival imaging to constrain their properties. One companion, KOINTREAU-1b (at a projected separation of 690 au), has an average near-IR spectral type of M9$\pm$2, a gravity classification of VL-G, and a changing spectral type between the SpeX (M7) and GNIRS (L1) observations. We estimate this object's mass to be $10.6^{+2.5}_{-2.3}$ M$_{\rm Jup}$, making KOINTREAU-1b the fifth planetary-mass companion found in Taurus. The other companion, KOINTREAU-2b (projected separation 560 au), has a spectral type of M4.5$\pm$1 but is ~4 magnitudes underluminous relative to other Taurus stars of the same spectral type. We detect exceptionally strong He I 1.083 micron emission from this object, indicative of outflows driven by ongoing accretion, but with a conspicuous lack of accompanying H emission. We conclude that KOINTREAU-2b is a young star obscured by an edge-on disk and observed in scattered light. Finally, we derive a distortion solution for NIRC2 imaging which shows a 0.118{\deg} difference in position angle from the previous distortion solution.</description>

      <title>Multi-bandpass Photometry for Exoplanet Atmosphere Reconnaissance (MPEAR) with the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) -- I. Differentiating Earth from Neptunes During Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the architecture for the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) is being developed, it is crucial to optimize the observing strategies for a survey to detect and characterize Earth-like planets around Sun-like stars. Efficient target identification and characterization will help drive mission requirements that can be matched to the planned observations. Current HWO concepts allow simultaneous multi-bandpass observations with the coronagraph instrument, critical for performing a qualitative planetary reconnaissance to optimize observing time for deriving orbital constraints and prioritize characterization of promising targets.
  We describe a new algorithm designed to determine the best combination of broadband photometric observations for extracting maximum information from the first visit. It identifies degeneracies in the orbital configurations, fluxes, and noise, and determines optimal secondary photometry bands to reduce these. We demonstrate its application by comparing an Earth seen at quadrature with a cold and a warm Neptune at inclined orbits and varying phases, with comparable flux in the discovery bandpass centered at 500 nm (20\% bandwidth). Using the noise and exposure time calculator that we developed for the HWO coronagraph instrument, we find that the baseline $S/N=7$ (corresponding to 3.2 hours observing time for a planet at 10pc) is only sufficient to marginally differentiate the Earth from a cold Neptune-like planet assuming two parallel bandpasses (550 nm + 850 nm). However, increasing to $S/N=15$ (7 hours observing time) and using three parallel bandpasses (360 nm + 500 nm + 1.11 micron) would differentiate the Earth from either a warm or cold Neptune.</description>

      <title>On-Orbit Calibration of Danuri/PolCam. I. Geometric Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The wide-angle Polarimetric Camera (PolCam) onboard South Korea's first lunar orbiter, Danuri, is a pioneering instrument designed to conduct the first global polarimetric and high-phase-angle survey of the Moon. Precise geometric calibration is critical for this mission, particularly due to PolCam's highly oblique viewing geometry, which introduces significant topographic distortion. We present a comprehensive on-orbit geometric calibration that relies on 160,256 tie points derived from matching features between PolCam images and the well-orthorectified global map of the Kaguya Multiband Imager (MI). This dataset allows us to address two fundamental challenges: (1) the accurate reconstruction of the observation time for each line of an observation strip via a simple linear model, and (2) the refinement of the precise camera model, geometric model for PolCam optics. Our optimization method for these two challenges transforms the 2D image coordinates of identified features into 3D lunar coordinates and minimizes the reprojection error against the reference coordinates provided by the Kaguya MI map. From the refined observation time and camera model, we compute the precise longitude, latitude, and elevation of each pixel of an observed image. These estimated 3D coordinates are then used to generate orthorectified images, the final product of the geometric calibration. The resulting calibration achieves a geometric precision comparable to that of previous lunar orbiters and establishes the foundational framework necessary to produce geometrically-corrected data products of PolCam.</description>

      <title>Radial modes of pressure bumps and dips in astrophysical discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the signatures of pressure extrema on global oscillations in discs. To this end, we use the framework of wave topology to establish a generalised local dispersion relation that includes pressure gradients. We highlight the influence of a previously unrecognized epicyclic-acoustic frequency and derive an analytical criterion for the existence of a branch of modes transiting between the inertial and the pressure bands. We find that pressure extrema consist of wave guides in which such topological modes propagate. The fundamental mode trapped at a pressure bump can propagate at all frequencies, allowing it to resonate with any temporal forcing, while the mode associated with a pressure gap propagates at a fixed frequency, propagates with arbitrary vertical phase velocity. These specific features make them attractive candidates for future discoseismology.</description>

      <title>Exoplanet formation inference using conditional invertible neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interpretation of the origin of observed exoplanets is usually done only qualitatively due to uncertainties of key parameters in planet formation models. To allow a quantitative methodology which traces back in time to the planet birth locations, we train recently developed conditional invertible neural networks (cINN) on synthetic data from a global planet formation model which tracks growth from dust grains to evolved final giant planets. In addition to deterministic single planet formation runs, we also include gravitationally interacting planets in multiplanetary systems, which include some measure of chaos. For the latter case, we treat them as individual planets or choose the two or three planets most likely to be discovered by telescopes. We find that training on multiplanetary data, each planet treated as individual point, is promising. The single-planet data only covers a small range of planets and does not extrapolate well to planet properties not included in the training data. Extension to planetary systems will require more training data due to the higher dimensionality of the problem.</description>

      <title>Most Rocky Sub-Neptunes are Molten: Mapping the Solidification Shoreline for Gas Dwarf Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sub-Neptunes are the most common type of detected exoplanet, yet their observed masses and radii are degenerate with several interior structures. One possibility is that sub-Neptunes have silicate/iron interiors and H$_2$-dominated atmospheres, i.e., they are `gas dwarfs'. If gas dwarfs have molten interiors, interactions between their magma oceans and atmospheres will produce distinct observational signatures. These signatures may break the degeneracy in interior structure, while providing insight into their interior processes, history, and population trends. We expect all such planets are born molten, but under what conditions do they remain molten today? We use the coupled interior-climate evolution model, PROTEUS, to estimate the `solidification shoreline': the instellation flux boundary (as a function of stellar $T_{\rm eff}$) that separates molten gas dwarfs from solidified ones. Our results show that 98\% of detected sub-Neptunes occupy a region of parameter space consistent with their having permanent magma oceans, if they are gas dwarfs. While mantle $f{\rm O}_2$ and bulk volatile C/H ratio both influence magma ocean lifetimes, planets with oxidising mantles and carbon-rich atmospheres are unlikely to have radii consistent with the sub-Neptune classification. Therefore, most detected sub-Neptunes (if they are gas dwarfs) have permanent magma oceans. This result motivates further research into the interactions between molten interiors and overlying atmospheres, and campaigns to identify unambiguous signatures of these interactions.</description>

      <title>Transformation of orientation and rotation angles of synchronous satellites: Application to the Galilean moons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The orientation and rotation of a synchronous satellite can be referred to both its Laplace plane and the ICRF equatorial plane, in terms of Euler angles or spin axis Cartesian coordinates and Earth equatorial coordinates, respectively. We computed second-order analytical expressions to make the transformation between the two systems and applied them to the Galilean satellites (Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto). If one term of the spin axis Cartesian coordinates series is dominant, trigonometric series can be generated for the inertial and orbital obliquities, node longitude and offset with respect to the Cassini plane. Since the transformation does not require any fit of amplitudes and frequencies on numerical series, the physical meaning of the frequencies is preserved from the input series and the amplitudes can be directly related to the geophysical parameters of interest. We provide tables for the coordinates and angles' series assuming that the satellites are entirely solid, and considering two different orbital theories. The possible amplitude ranges for the main terms are also examined in the case where a liquid layer is assumed in the interior model. We use our transformation method to propose an updated IAU WG solution which would result in an improvement with respect to zero obliquity models used so far. This method will also be useful for the interpretation of future Earth-based radar observations or JUICE data.</description>

      <title>Polarimetric and spectropolarimetric observations with FoReRo2: Instrument overview and standard stars monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a description and characterisation of the 2-Channel Focal Reducer Rozhen (FoReRo2), with an emphasis on its polarimetric and spectropolarimetric observation modes. FoReRo2 is a multimode instrument mounted at the Ritchey-Chretien(RC) focus of the 2-meter Ritchey-Chretien-Coude (RCC) telescope at the Bulgarian National Astronomical Observatory (BNAO) - Rozhen. The primary targets of this instrument include novae, Be/X-ray binaries, symbiotic stars, asteroids, and comets.
  Standard stars with a high degree of polarisation are an essential part of the polarimetric observations. In our sample, HD 204827 shows short-term variability in position angle, making it unsuitable for calibration. HD 183143 displays intrinsic polarisation variability but remains stable in position angle. For the first time, we present a statistical study of K and {\lambda}_max of the Serkowski law, including their mean value, standard deviation, and distribution.
  In order to show the FoReRo2 polarimetric capabilities, we also present several examples. The recurrent nova RS Oph shows variability of Serkowski's K parameter due to dust formation within the first few days after the 2021 outburst. The examples also include imaging polarimetry of comet C/2019 Y4 (ATLAS) and spectropolarimetric observations of the symbiotic star Z And.</description>

      <title>Multi-band ALMA Polarization Observations of BHB07-11 Reveal Aligned Dust Grains in Complex Spiral Arm Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polarization-mode observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) are powerful tools for studying the dust grain populations in circumstellar disks. Many sources exhibit polarization signatures consistent with aligned dust grains, yet the physical origin of this alignment remains uncertain. One such source is BHB07-11, a Class I protobinary object in the Pipe Nebula with complex spiral arm structures in its circumbinary disk. While magnetic fields are often invoked to explain grain alignment in the interstellar medium, the contrasting conditions in circumstellar disk environments demand further investigation into grain alignment mechanisms. To determine BHB07-11's dominant polarization mechanism, we leverage ALMA polarization-mode dust continuum observations in Bands 3 ($\lambda$=3.1 mm), 6 ($\lambda$=1.3 mm), and 7 ($\lambda$=0.87 mm), in combination with high-resolution dust continuum and spectral line observations in Band 6. Observed polarization vectors in each band are consistent with emission from aligned grains and follow the structure of the spiral arms as shown in the high-resolution observations. Given the relationship between the observed polarization vector orientation and the spiral arms, we find that the polarization morphology is most consistent with grains aligned through a relative velocity flow between gas and dust in the spiral arms, as envisioned in the recently developed badminton birdie-like alignment mechanism, rather than alignment with a magnetic field or other known alignment mechanisms.</description>

Abstract: We present LBTI/ALES 3.07-4.08 micron spectroscopic observations of HD~33632~Ab, a ~53 M_Jup directly imaged companion to an F8 star. Spectroscopic measurements of HD 33632 Ab now span 1-4 micron, and we perform the first spectroscopic analysis covering this full range. The data are compared to isolated brown dwarf template spectra, indicating that HD 33632 Ab is similar to L8/9 field brown dwarfs. Synthetic atmosphere model spectra from multiple model families are fit, with cloudy models providing the best fits, consistent with expectations for an L-dwarf. Evolutionary model predictions for the bulk properties of HD 33632 Ab are highly constrained by the precise dynamical mass found for the object. In particular, predictions for surface gravity are narrowly peaked, log(g)=5.21+/-0.05, and not dependent on the effects of clouds or cloud dispersion. We find significant tension between the surface gravities and object radii inferred from atmosphere model fits and those predicted by evolutionary models. We conclude with a comparison to the spectra of the HR 8799 c, d, and e, and emphasize the case that HD 33632 Ab, and other L/T transition directly imaged companions with constrained masses, will serve an essential role in understanding the complex physical processes governing the appearance of clouds in planetary atmospheres.</description>

Abstract: We present new analysis of the CWW 89 system as part of the Orbital Architectures of Transiting Massive Exoplanets And Low-mass stars (OATMEAL) survey. The CWW 89 system is a member of the 2.8 Gyr old Ruprecht 147 (NGC 6774) cluster and features two stars, CWW 89A (EPIC 219388192) and CWW 89B, with the primary hosting a transiting brown dwarf. We use in-transit, highly precise radial velocity measurements with the Keck Planet Finder (KPF) to characterize the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect and measure the projected spin-orbit obliquity $|\lambda|=1.4\pm2.5^\circ$ and the full 3D spin-orbit obliquity of the brown dwarf to be $\psi=15.1^{+15.0^\circ}_{-10.9}$. This value of $\lambda$ implies that the brown dwarf's orbit is prograde and well-aligned with the equator of the host star, continuing the trend of transiting brown dwarfs showing a preference for alignment ($\lambda \approx 0^\circ$) regardless of the stellar effective temperature. We find that this contrast with the transiting giant planet population, whose spin-orbit alignments depend on host $T_{\rm eff}$, shows an increasingly clear distinction in the formation and orbital migration mechanisms between transiting giant planets and transiting brown dwarfs like CWW 89Ab. For this system in particular, we find it plausible that the brown dwarf may have undergone coplanar high-eccentricity migration influence by CWW 89B.</description>

      <title>A Catalogue of Interstellar Material Delivery From Nearby Debris Disks</title>

Abstract: We modeled the trajectories of material ejected from 20 nearby debris disk stars, including Epsilon Eridani (Ran), Vega, Fomalhaut, and Beta Pictoris, within a simulated Milky Way potential in order to quantify their contribution to the population of interstellar material entering the solar system. Our simulations show that material from each of these 20 systems is currently to be expected within our planetary system. We calculate expected fluxes of both macroscopic interstellar objects (ISOs, $\geq100~$m), which could be detected by telescopic surveys, and smaller meteoroids ($\geq200~$microns), which could manifest as meteors in Earth's atmosphere. We estimate that the ISO population originating from these debris disks and currently within the inner solar system is on the order of ~2, only a fraction of the expected total ISO population but nonetheless likely to be discovered by Rubin. Meteors in Earth's atmosphere from these systems are expected as well, but current methods, both radar and video, might require decades to collect even a single event. Our sample is found to be rich in relatively low excess velocity particles compared to the broader expected ISO population, which might make them harder to distinguish observationally from bound objects in some cases. These results provide a framework for linking detections of interstellar material to their astrophysical origins, offering new opportunities to probe the composition and dynamical history of nearby planetary systems.</description>

      <title>The lower mass limit for circumbinary disc fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20125</link>

Abstract: In recent years, many wide orbit circumbinary giant planets have been discovered; some of these may have formed by gravitational fragmentation of circumbinary discs. The aim of this work is to investigate the lower mass limit for circumbinary disc fragmentation. We use the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics code SEREN, which employs an approximate method for the radiative transfer, to perform 3 sets of simulations of gravitationally unstable discs. The first set of simulations covers circumstellar discs heated by a single 0.7M$_{\odot}$ star (circumstellar model), the second set covers binaries with the same total stellar mass as the circumstellar model, attended by circumbinary discs with the same temperature profile (circumbinary fiducial model), and the third set covers circumbinary discs heated by each individual star (circumbinary realistic model). We vary the binary separation, mass ratio and eccentricity to see their effect on disc fragmentation. For the circumstellar disc model, we find a lower disc-to-star mass ratio for fragmentation of $\sim\,$0.31. For the circumbinary fiducial disc model we find the same disc-to-star mass ratio for fragmentation (but slightly lower for more eccentric, equal-mass binaries; 0.26). On the other hand, realistic circumbinary discs fragment at a lower mass limit (disc-to-star mass ratio of 0.17-0.26), depending on the binary properties. We conclude that circumbinary discs fragment at a lower disc mass (by $\sim 45\%$) than circumstellar discs. Therefore, gas giant planet around binaries may be able to form by gravitational instability easier than around single stars.</description>
