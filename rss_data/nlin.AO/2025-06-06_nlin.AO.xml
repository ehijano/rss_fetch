      <title>Self-organization to multicriticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-organized criticality is a well-established phenomenon, where a system dynamically tunes its structure to operate on the verge of a phase transition. Here, we show that the dynamics inside the self-organized critical state are fundamentally far more versatile than previously recognized, to the extent that a system can self-organize to a new type of phase transition while staying on the verge of another. In this first demonstration of self-organization to multicriticality, we investigate a model of coupled oscillators on a random network, where the network topology evolves in response to the oscillator dynamics. We show that the system first self-organizes to the onset of oscillations, after which it drifts to the onset of pattern formation while still remaining at the onset of oscillations, thus becoming critical in two different ways at once. The observed evolution to multicriticality is robust generic behavior that we expect to be widespread in self-organizing systems. Overall, these results offer a unifying framework for studying systems, such as the brain, where multiple phase transitions may be relevant for proper functioning.</description>

      <title>Memory-Driven Bounded Confidence Opinion Dynamics: A Hegselmann-Krause Model Based on Fractional-Order Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Memory effects play a crucial role in social interactions and decision-making processes. This paper proposes a novel fractional-order bounded confidence opinion dynamics model to characterize the memory effects in system states. Building upon the Hegselmann-Krause framework and fractional-order difference, a comprehensive model is established that captures the persistent influence of historical information. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, the fundamental properties including convergence and consensus is investigated. The results demonstrate that the proposed model not only maintains favorable convergence and consensus characteristics compared to classical opinion dynamics, but also addresses limitations such as the monotonicity of bounded opinions. This enables a more realistic representation of opinion evolution in real-world scenarios. The findings of this study provide new insights and methodological approaches for understanding opinion formation and evolution, offering both theoretical significance and practical applications.</description>

      <title>Associative Memory and Generative Diffusion in the Zero-noise Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Connections between generative diffusion and continuous-state associative memory models are studied. Morse-Smale dynamical systems are emphasized as universal approximators of gradient-based associative memory models and diffusion models as white-noise perturbed systems thereof. Universal properties of associative memory that follow from this description are described and used to characterize a generic transition from generation to memory as noise levels diminish. Structural stability inherited by Morse-Smale flows is shown to imply a notion of stability for diffusions at vanishing noise levels. Applied to one- and two-parameter families of gradients, this indicates stability at all but isolated points of associative memory learning landscapes and the learning and generation landscapes of diffusion models with gradient drift in the zero-noise limit, at which small sets of generic bifurcations characterize qualitative transitions between stable systems. Examples illustrating the characterization of these landscapes by sequences of these bifurcations are given, along with structural stability criterion for classic and modern Hopfield networks (equivalently, the attention mechanism).</description>

      <title>Collision Induced Binding and Transport of Shape Changing Robot Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report in experiment and simulation the spontaneous formation of dynamically bound pairs of shape changing robots undergoing locally repulsive collisions. These physical `gliders' robustly emerge from an ensemble of individually undulating three-link two-motor robots and can remain bound for hundreds of undulations and travel for multiple robot dimensions. Gliders occur in two distinct binding symmetries and form over a wide range of angular oscillation extent. This parameter sets the maximal concavity which influences formation probability and translation characteristics. Analysis of dynamics in simulation reveals the mechanism of effective dynamical attraction -- a result of the emergent interplay of appropriately oriented and timed repulsive interactions. Tactile sensing stabilizes the short-lived conformation via concavity modulation.</description>
