      <title>Accelerating Discovery of Solid-State Thin-Film Metal Dealloying for 3D Nanoarchitecture Materials Design through Laser Thermal Gradient Treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin-film solid-state metal dealloying (thin-film SSMD) is a promising method for fabricating nanostructures with controlled morphology and efficiency, offering advantages over conventional bulk materials processing methods for integration into practical applications. Although machine learning (ML) has facilitated the design of dealloying systems, the selection of key thermal treatment parameters for nanostructure formation remains largely unknown and dependent on experimental trial and error. To overcome this challenge, a workflow enabling high-throughput characterization of thermal treatment parameters while probing local nanostructures of thin-film samples is needed. In this work, a laser-based thermal treatment is demonstrated to create temperature gradients on single thin-film samples of Nb-Al/Sc and Nb-Al/Cu. This continuous thermal space enables observation of dealloying transitions and the resulting nanostructures of interest. Through synchrotron X-ray multimodal and high-throughput characterization, critical transitions and nanostructures can be rapidly captured and subsequently verified using electron microscopy. The key temperatures driving chemical reactions and morphological evolutions are clearly identified within this framework. While the oxidation process may contribute to nanostructure formation during thin-film treatment, the dealloying process at the dealloying front involves interactions solely between the dealloying elements, highlighting the availability and viability of the selected systems. This approach enables efficient exploration of the dealloying process and validation of ML predictions, thereby accelerating the discovery of thin-film SSMD systems with targeted nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnetic Semiconductor Nanotubes with Room Curie Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realizing ferromagnetic semiconductors with room Curie temperature $T\rm_C$ remains a challenge in spintronics. Inspired by the recent experimental progress on the nanotubes based on 2D van der Waals non-magnetic transition-metal dichalcogenides, magnetic nanotubes based on monolayer ferromagnetic materials are highly possible. Here, we proposed a way how to obtain high $T\rm_C$ ferromagnetic semiconductor nanotubes. Some high $T\rm_C$ ferromagnetic semiconductors are predicted in the MX$_2$ nanotubes (M = V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni; X = S, Se, Te), including CrS$_2$ and CrTe$_2$ zigzag nanotubes with the diameter of 18 unit cells showing $T\rm_C$ above 300 K. In addition, due to the strain gradient in walls of nanotubes, an electrical polarization at level of $0.1$ eV/\AA~inward of the radial direction is obtained. Our results not only present novel ferromagnetic semiconductor nanotubes with room Curie temperature but also be indicative of how to obtain such nanotubes based on experimentally obtained 2D high $T\rm_C$ ferromagnetic metals.</description>

      <title>Stability of the long-range corrected exchange-correlation functional in time-dependent density-functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excitonic effects in the optical absorption spectra of solids can be described with time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) in the linear-response regime, using a simple class of approximate, long-range corrected (LRC) exchange-correlation functionals. It was recently demonstrated that the LRC approximation can also be employed in real-time TDDFT to describe exciton dynamics. Here, we investigate the numerical stability of the time-dependent LRC approach using a two-dimensional model solid. It is found that the time-dependent Kohn-Sham equation with an LRC vector potential becomes more and more prone to instabilities for increasing exciton binding energies. The origin of these instabilities is traced back to time-averaged violations of the zero-force theorem, which leads to a simple and robust numerical stabilization scheme. This explains and justifies a recently proposed method by Dewhurst et al., arXiv:2401.16140.</description>

      <title>Observation of molecular and polymeric nitrogen stuffed NaCl ionic layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sodium chloride (NaCl), a ubiquitous and chemically stable compound, has been considered inert under ambient conditions. Its typical B1 structure is highly isotropic without preferential direction, favoring the growth of a three-dimensional network of strong Na-Cl ionic bonds. Here, we employ first-principles structural searching and synchrotron X-ray diffraction to unravel an unexpected chemical reaction between NaCl and N2 to produce a hybrid salt-NaCl(N2)2, where N2 molecules break the isotropic NaCl structure into two-dimensional layers upon synthesis at 50 GPa. In contrast to the insulating properties of pristine NaCl, the electronic bandgap of the N2-stuffed NaCl narrowed to 1.8 eV, becoming an indirect bandgap semiconductor. Further compression to 130 GPa induced the polymerization of N atoms into zigzag N-chains. Our findings not only demonstrate the possibility of unusual N-chemistry under extreme conditions, but also suggest a feasible approach for the design of layered NaCl frameworks to modulate the polymerization of nitrogen.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Donor Defects and Voltage-Assisted Hole Doping in Beta-Gallium Oxides under Multiple Epitaxy Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beta-phase gallium oxide (beta-Ga2O3) is prone to the spontaneous formation of donor defects but poses a formidable challenge in achieving high-quality p-type doping, mainly due to its exceptionally low valence band maximum (VBM). In this study, we utilize first-principles computations to investigate the origin of spontaneous donor defects in beta-Ga2O3 grown by three typical techniques: molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), and halide vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE). Our findings elucidate that the primary donor defects vary with the growth techniques, specifically Gai3+ for MBE, Hi+ and CGa+ for MOCVD, and (2VGa+Gai+2VO)+ and ClO+ for HVPE under unintentionally doped conditions. Employing a theoretically proposed voltage-assisted doping method, we computationally demonstrate that the dominant spontaneous donors can be significantly reduced accompanied by a noticeable increase in acceptors, leading to a stepwise reduction of Fermi level to 0.52, 0.88, and 2.10 eV above VBM for the MOCVD, HVPE, and MBE methods, and a hole concentration of 8.5*10^17, 8.7*10^11, and 2.7*10^-9 cm-3, respectively, at room temperature without the use of external dopants. By introducing Mg doping, we further reduce the Fermi level for both the MBE and HVPE experiments.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing Single-Atom Catalysts on Metastable Phases of Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-atom catalysts have attracted significant attention due to their exceptional atomic utilization and high efficiency in a range of catalytic reactions. However, these systems often face thermodynamic instability, leading to agglomeration under operational conditions. In this study, we investigate the interactions of twelve types of catalytic atoms (Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Ir, Pt, Au, and Bi) on three crystalline phases (1T, 1T', and 2H) of six transition metal dichalcogenide layers (MoS2, MoSe2, MoTe2, WS2, WSe2, and WTe2) based on first-principles calculations. We ultimately identify 82 stable single-atom systems that thermodynamically prevent the formation of metal clusters on these substrates. Notably, our findings reveal that the metastable 1T and 1T' phases significantly enhance the binding strength with single atoms and promote their thermodynamic stability. This research offers valuable insights into the design of stable single-atom systems and paves the way for discovering innovative catalysts in the future.</description>

      <title>Single crystal growth of 1T-VSe$_2$ by molten salt flux method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: VSe$_2$ is a highly promising van der Waals (vdW) material for applications in electronics, spintronics, and optoelectronics. Here, we report single crystal growth of 1T-VSe$_2$ by flux method using eutectic of NaCl/KCl molten salt. The typical size of as-grown VSe$_2$ single crystals is 5 $\times$ 4 $\times$ 0.1~mm$^3$. The elemental composition and homogeneity of the crystals were examined by energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, which is consistent with the stoichiometric ratio of VSe$_2$. The crystallographic [001] direction has been determined by x-ray diffraction. Raman measurement confirms that the 1T phase of VSe$_2$ has been formed. Temperature-dependent resistivity measurement exhibits a transition around 104 K due to the formation of the charge density wave phase.</description>

      <title>Liquid Metal-Exfoliated SnO$_2$-Based Mixed-dimensional Heterostructures for Visible-to-Near-Infrared Photodetection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-thin two-dimensional (2D) materials have gained significant attention for making next-generation optoelectronic devices. Here, we report a large-area heterojunction photodetector fabricated using a liquid metal-printed 2D $\text{SnO}_2$ layer transferred onto CdTe thin films. The resulting device demonstrates efficient broadband light sensing from visible to near-infrared wavelengths, with enhanced detectivity and faster photo response than bare CdTe photodetectors. Significantly, the device shows a nearly $10^5$-fold increase in current than the dark current level when illuminated with a 780 nm laser and achieves a specific detectivity of around $10^{12} \, \text{Jones}$, nearly two orders of magnitude higher than a device with pure CdTe thin film. Additionally, temperature-dependent optoelectronic testing shows that the device maintains a stable response up to $140^\circ \text{C}$ and generates distinctive photocurrent at temperatures up to $80^\circ \text{C}$, demonstrating its thermal stability. Using band structure analysis, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and photocurrent mapping, the formation of a $p$-$n$ junction is indicated, contributing to the enhanced photo response attributed to the efficient carrier separation by the built-in potential in the hetero-junction and the superior electron mobility of 2D $\text{SnO}_2$. Our results highlight the effectiveness of integrating liquid metal-exfoliated 2D materials for enhanced photodetector performance.</description>

      <title>Structural and optical changes induced by incorporation of antimony into InAs/GaAs(001) quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present experimental evidence of Sb incorporation inside InAs/GaA(001) quantum dots exposed to an antimony flux immediately before capping with GaAs. The Sb composition profile inside the nanostructures as measured by cross-sectional scanning tunneling and electron transmission microscopies show two differentiated regions within the quantum dots, with an Sb rich alloy at the tip of the quantum dots. Atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy micrographs show increased quantum-dot height with Sb flux exposure. The evolution of the reflection high-energy electron-diffraction pattern suggests that the increased height is due to changes in the quantum-dot capping process related to the presence of segregated Sb atoms. These structural and compositional changes result in a shift of the room-temperature photoluminescence emission from 1.26 to 1.36 microns accompanied by an order of magnitude increase in the room-temperature quantum-dot luminescence intensity.</description>

Abstract: This work presents a selective ultraviolet (UV)-ozone oxidation-chemical etching process that has been used, in combination with laser interference lithography (LIL), for the preparation of GaAs patterned substrates. Further molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth of InAs results in ordered InAs/GaAs quantum dot (QD) arrays with high optical quality from the first layer of QDs formed on the patterned substrate. The main result is the development of a patterning technology that allows the engineering of customized geometrical displays of QDs with the same optical quality as those formed spontaneously on flat non-patterned substrates.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore a method for obtaining site-controlled InAs quantum dots (QDs) on large areas of GaAs (0 0 1) pre-patterned surface. The patterning of the substrate is obtained by using a monolithically integrated nano-channel alumina (NCA) mask and transferring its self-ordering to the underlying GaAs substrate by continuing the anodization process once the GaAs surface is reached. After patterning, the GaAs substrate follows a low temperature process for surface preparation before epitaxial growth for QD formation. As a final result, we observe that the nanoholes act as preferential nucleation sites for InAs QD formation, with a filling factor close to unity, while the QD formation on the surface region between the pattern holes is completely suppressed.</description>

      <title>Suppression of ferromagnetism in van der Waals insulator due to pressure-induced layer stacking variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: External pressure suppresses the ferromagnetism of localized Cr 3d electron moments in the van der Waals insulator CrBr3, which cannot be explained without considering a dramatic pressure-induced crystal or electronic structure change. We addressed this issue by conducting a parallel experimental investigation of single crystals magnetic and structural properties using magnetization, X-ray diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy measurements. Ab initio DFT calculations of electronic structure and atomistic simulations of finite-temperature magnetism supported the analysis and interpretation of experimental results. The magnetization measurements at high pressures provided the first direct experimental evidence of the pressure-induced suppression of ferromagnetism. We observed a gradual decrease of the bulk magnetic moment and Curie temperature with increasing pressure, which accelerates at pressures above 3 GPa, leading to loss of ferromagnetism at 6.5 GPa. By increasing pressure, the ambient pressure phase gradually breaks down and is accompanied by the generation of layer stacking that favor the antiferromagnetic coupling of Cr moments. As a result, the appearing antiparallel pairs of moments disturb the ferromagnetic structure and reduce the bulk magnetic moment and Curie temperature. This scenario, which is well corroborated by the results of our theoretical calculations, suggests an antiferromagnetic phase emerging with increasing pressure beyond the critical value when the new single trigonal P-3m1 phase becomes stable, characterized by the "antiferromagnetic" A-A layer stacking, becomes stable. The weak coupling between adjacent magnetic layers in van der Waals materials allows variations in layering due to sufficient external forces. We hope our comprehensive study's results can help other researchers resolve frequently appearing issues of similar origin in this class of materials.</description>

Abstract: The realization of two-dimensional multiferroics offers significant potential for nanoscale device functionality. However, type-I two-dimensional multiferroics with strong magnetoelectric coupling, enabling electric field control of spin, remain scarce. In this study, using density functional theory and Monte Carlo simulations, we predict that the niobium phthalocyanine covalent organic framework (NbPc COF) monolayer exhibits type-I multiferroic behavior, with a ferroelectric transition occurring above room temperature. Remarkably, the strong magnetoelectric coupling in NbPc COF monolayer arises from the same origin of magnetism and ferroelectricity. Our findings offer flexible pathways for the design and development of organic nanoscale multiferroic devices with broad applications.</description>

      <title>Medium Temperature Phase Change Materials Thermal Characterization by the T-History Method and Differential Scanning Calorimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a thermal characterization of salt mixtures applying the T-History Method and the Differential Scanning Calorimetry DSC techniques. By using water as a standard substance, the original T-History method was developed to analyze materials with melting points under 100 Celsius. This is the first research that proposes to replace water by glycerin to characterize medium melting temperature PCMs from 140 to 220 Celsius. Moreover, the DSC technique was used to validate and compare the results obtained with the T-history method for each mixture. For instance, the system compound of 40 KNO$_3$ to 60 NaNO$_3$ was studied, and the enthalpy of fusion determined by THM and DSC differs by 2.1% between each method. The results given by the two methods for all mixtures showed that both techniques are complementary and present satisfactory agreement with the specialized literature.</description>

      <title>Emergent spin Hall conductivity in Tantalum-Rhenium alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the spin Hall conductivity (SHC) of a composition series of a Ta-Re bcc solid solution. At approximately 60 at.% Ta the Ta-Re alloy features an SHC similar to bcc-W, while both endpoints of the compositional series have rather moderate SHC. The intermediate stoichiometries exhibit a substantial enhancement due to Fermi level tuning through the same band structure feature which gives bcc-W and $\beta$-W its large SHC. We provide experimental evidence for the enhancement of the SHC in the alloy via THz emission upon ultrafast laser excitation of Ta-Re/CoFeB bilayers. We demonstrate that a rigid band model derived from bcc-W and Fermi level tuning describes the experimental data with a similar accuracy as coherent potential approximation alloy calculations of the SHC.</description>

      <title>Fragile Unconventional Magnetism in RuO$_2$ by Proximity to Landau-Pomeranchuk Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism has attracted considerable attention for its remarkable combination of spin-polarized band structures and zero net magnetization, making it a promising candidate for spintronics applications. We demonstrate that this magnetic phase represents a case of ``unconventional magnetism," first proposed nearly two decades ago by one of the present authors as part of a broader framework for understanding Landau-Pomeranchuk instabilities in the spin channel, driven by many-body interactions. By systematically analyzing the altermagnetism in RuO$_2$ with first-principles calculations, we reconcile conflicting experimental and theoretical reports by attributing it to RuO$_2$'s proximity to a quantum phase transition. We emphasize the critical role of tuning parameters, such as the Hubbard $U$, hole doping, and epitaxial strain, in modulating quasiparticle interactions near the Fermi surface. This work provides fresh insights into the origin and tunability of altermagnetism in RuO$_2$, highlighting its potential as a platform for investigating quantum phase transitions and the broader realm of unconventional magnetism.</description>

      <title>Computational Studies of NaVTe Half Heusler Alloy for Green Energy Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To lessen the quick depletion of fossil fuels and the resulting environmental harm, it is necessary to investigate effective and eco-friendly materials that can convert lost energy into electricity. The structural, optical, electronic, thermo-electric, and thermodynamic properties of the novel half-Heusler (HH) material NaVTe were examined in the current work using density functional theory (DFT). The Birch-Murnaghan equations of states were used to confirm the structural stability of the NaVTe HH alloy under investigation. These equations show that the compound in question has structural stability because its ground-state energy levels are negative. For spin-down configurations, NaVTe possesses an energy band gap of 3.2 eV, according to band structure and total density of state analysis. NaVTe is a material that is desirable for optoelectronic applications due to its optical features, which include maximum conductivity and absorption of electromagnetic radiation. The figure of merit and other thermodynamic and thermoelectric parameters are calculated. According to these predicted outcomes, the NaVTe HH alloy would be the ideal option for thermo-electric and renewable energy applications.</description>

      <title>Three-Dimensional to Layered Halide Perovskites: A Parameter-Free Hybrid Functional Method for Predicting Electronic Band Gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately predicting electronic band gaps in halide perovskites using ab initio density functional theory (DFT) is essential for their application in optoelectronic devices. Standard hybrid functionals such as HSE and PBE0 can overcome the limitations of DFT with reasonable computational cost but are known to underestimate the measured band gaps for layered halide perovskites. In this study, we assess the performance of the doubly screened dielectric-dependent hybrid (DSH) functional for predicting band gaps in three-dimensional (3D) and layered hybrid perovskites. We show that the DSH functional, which employs material-dependent mixing parameters derived from macroscopic dielectric constants, provides accurate band gap predictions for 3D halide perovskites when structural local disorder is considered. For layered hybrid perovskites, DSH functional based on average dielectric constants overestimates the band gaps. To improve the predictions and stay in a parameter-free ab initio workflow, we propose to use the calculated dielectric constant of the respective 3D perovskites. We find that the DSH functionals using the dielectric constants of the 3D perovskite accurately predict experimental gaps, with the lowest mean absolute errors compared to HSE and PBE0 for layered perovskites with various organic spacers, as well as for multilayered $BA_2MA_{n-1}Pb_{n}I_{3n-1}$ with n = 2, 3. Notably, the HSE functional systematically underestimates the band gaps in layered perovskites. We attribute the root of this failure to the absence of non-local long-range dielectric screening, a critical factor for halide perovskites. The computational framework introduced here provides an efficient parameter-free ab initio methodology for predicting the electronic properties of 3D and layered halide perovskites and their heterostructures, aiding in developing advanced optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Grain-size dependence of plastic-brittle transgranular fracture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The role of grain size in determining fracture toughness in metals is incompletely understood with apparently contradictory experimental observations. We study this grain-size dependence computationally by building a model that combines the phase-field formulation of fracture mechanics with dislocation density-based crystal plasticity. We apply the model to cleavage fracture of body-centered cubic materials in plane strain conditions, and find non-monotonic grain-size dependence of plastic-brittle transgranular fracture. We find two mechanisms at play. The first is the nucleation of failure due to cross-slip in critically located grains within transgranular band of localized deformation, and this follows the classical Hall-Petch law that predicts a higher failure stress for smaller grains. The second is the resistance to the propagation of a mode I crack, where grain boundaries can potentially pin a crack, and this follows an inverse Hall-Petch law with higher toughness for larger grains. The result of the competition between the two mechanisms gives rise to non-monotonic behavior and reconciles the apparently contradictory experimental observations.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic vector tomography allows for visualizing the 3D magnetization vector of magnetic nanostructures and multilayers with nanometric resolution. In this work, we present MARTApp (Magnetic Analysis and Reconstruction of Tomographies Application), a software designed to analyze the images obtained from a full-field or scanning transmission X-ray microscope and reconstruct the 3D magnetization of the sample. Here, its workflow and main features are described. Moreover, a synthetic test sample consisting of a hopfion is used to exemplify the workflow from raw images to the final 3D magnetization reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Imaging Topological Defect Dynamics Mediating 2D Skyrmion Lattice Melting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological defects are the key feature mediating 2D phase transitions. However, both resolution and tunability have been lacking to access the dynamics of the transitions. With dynamic Kerr microscopy, we directly capture the melting of a confined 2D magnetic skyrmion lattice with high resolution in real-time and -space. Skyrmions in magnetic thin films are two-dimensional, topologically non-trivial quasi-particles that provide rich dynamics as well as unique tunability as an essential ingredient for controlling phase behavior: We tune the skyrmion size and effective temperature on the fly to drive the two-step melting through an intermediate hexatic regime between the solid lattice and the isotropic liquid. We quantify the characteristic occurrence of topological defects mediating the transitions and reveal the so-far inaccessible dynamics of the lattice dislocations. The full real-time and -space imaging reveals the diffusion coefficient of the dislocations, which we find to be orders of magnitudes higher than that of the skyrmions.</description>

      <title>Field induced density wave in a kagome superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On the kagome lattice, electrons benefit from the simultaneous presence of band topology, flat electronic bands, and van Hove singularities, forming competing or cooperating orders. Understanding the interrelation between these distinct order parameters remains a significant challenge, leaving much of the associated physics unexplored. In the kagome superconductor KV3Sb5, which exhibits a charge density wave (CDW) state below T = 78 K, we uncover an unpredicted field-induced phase transition below 6 K. The observed transition is marked by a hysteretic anomaly in the resistivity, nonlinear electrical transport, and a change in the symmetry of the electronic response as probed via the angular dependence of the magnetoresistivity. These observations surprisingly suggest the emergence of an unanticipated broken symmetry state coexisting with the original CDW. To understand this experimental observation, we developed a theoretical minimal model for the normal state inside the high-temperature parent CDW phase where an incommensurate CDW order emerges as an instability sub-leading to superconductivity. The incommensurate CDW emerges when superconducting fluctuations become fully suppressed by large magnetic fields. Our results suggest that, in kagome superconductors, quantum states can either coexist or are nearly degenerate in energy, indicating that these are rich platforms to expose new correlated phenomena.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Driven Mechanical Memory in a Random Fibrous Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disordered fibrous matrices, formed by the random assembly of fibers, provide the structural framework for many biological systems and biomaterials. Applied deformation modifies the alignment and stress states of constituent fibers, tuning the nonlinear elastic response of these materials. While it is generally presumed that fibers return to their original configurations after deformation is released, except when neighboring fibers coalesce or individual fibers yield, this reversal process remains largely unexplored. The intricate geometry of these matrices leaves an incomplete understanding of whether releasing deformation fully restores the matrix or introduces new microstructural deformation mechanisms. To address this gap, we investigated the evolution of matrix microstructures during the release of an applied deformation. Numerical simulations were performed on quasi-two-dimensional matrices of random fibers under localized tension, with fibers modeled as beams in finite element analysis. After tension release, the matrix exhibited permanent mechanical remodeling, with greater remodeling occurring at higher magnitudes of applied tension, indicative of the matrix preserving its loading history as mechanical memory. This response was surprising; it occurred despite the absence of explicit plasticity mechanisms, such as activation of inter-fiber cohesion or fiber yielding. We attributed the observed remodeling to the gradient in fiber alignment that developed within the matrix microstructure under applied tension, driving the subsequent changes in matrix properties during the release of applied tension. Therefore, random fibrous matrices tend to retain mechanical memory due to their intricate geometry.</description>

      <title>Enhanced and Efficient Extraction of Uranyl Ions from Aqueous Waste through Graphene/CNT-PAMAM Nanocomposites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing threat of uranium contamination to environmental and human health due to its radiotoxicity demands the development of novel and efficient adsorbents for remediation. In this study, we investigated the potential of poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers of generations 1 to 4 (G1 - G4) functionalized with graphene and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as adsorbents for uranyl ion removal from aqueous solutions. By combining atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with experimental validation, we examined the influence of pH, uranyl ion concentration, and dendrimer generation on adsorption behavior. Our study revealed that uranyl ion adsorption is greater when PAMAM is grafted onto graphene/CNT than pristine PAMAM. However, PAMAM-grafted CNTs exhibit superior adsorption capacity at specific uranyl concentrations due to their curvature and abundant accessible binding sites. Higher-generation PAMAM dendrimers grafted onto graphene/CNTs exhibit greater adsorption capacity due to the increased availability of binding sites, which is consistent with experimental observations. The adsorption capability of uranyl ions in all four generations of the PAMAM dendrimer increased as the concentration of uranyl ions increased. Adsorption capacity increases with increasing uranyl ion concentration, and adsorption occurs on both PAMAM and graphene/CNT surfaces, with saturation observed at higher concentrations. This study provides insights into the adsorption mechanisms and highlights the potential of PAMAM-based nanocomposites for efficient uranyl ion extraction and environmental remediation.</description>

      <title>Signature of superconductivity in pressurized La4Ni3O10-x single crystals grown at ambient pressure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nickelates have attracted enormous attention since the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in La3Ni2O7 under high pressure. However, whether superconducting nickelate single crystals can be prepared at ambient pressure remains elusive. Here we report signature of superconductivity in pressurized La4Ni3O10-x single crystals grown from potassium carbonate flux at ambient pressure. Single crystal X-ray diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscopy investigations re-vealed high-quality single crystals with perfect stacking of trilayers. Resistivity measurements indicate that the metal-to-metal transition observed at ambient pressure was suppressed under high pressure, and a sharp drop occurred at ~30 K at 77.9 GPa, consistent with superconductivity in pressurized La4Ni3O10 single crystals grown by the floating zone method at an oxygen pressure of &gt;18 bar. Our results not only provide an important path to prepare high-quality nickelate single crystals but also support superconductivity in nickelates under high pressure, promoting more systematic and in-depth research in this compelling field.</description>

Abstract: We report the results of $^{139}$La NMR measurements in the non-centrosymmetric superconductor LaRhGe$_3$. This material crystallizes in a tetragonal structure without inversion symmetry and exhibits type-I superconductivity below 385 mK. We observed remarkably sharp NMR signals, indicating that the magnetic and electronic properties of the sample are extremely uniform in LaRhGe$_3$ despite the complex crystal structure. Our NMR results indicate that LaRhGe$_3$ is a weakly correlated semimetal in the normal state.</description>

Abstract: Topologically nontrivial electronic states can give rise to novel anomalous Hall effects. The potential appearance of these effects at room temperature holds promise for their application in magnetic sensing, spintronics, and energy harvesting technology. The anomalous in-plane Hall effect (IPHE) is predicted to arise in topological magnetic materials when an external magnetic field is applied within the sample plane. Because of stringent symmetry requirements, the conclusive detection of the anomalous IPHE induced by topological electronic states remains challenging, and the study of anomalous Hall effects is often confined to cryogenic conditions. Combining molecular beam epitaxy of the kagome metal Fe$_3$Sn with measurements of the electric Hall effect and theoretical calculations, we propose and experimentally demonstrate that the interplay of the kagome lattice motif with spin-orbit coupling and canted ferromagnetism with large exchange interactions gives rise to the anomalous IPHE at room temperature that is induced by topological Weyl points in the electronic band structure. Synthesizing a topological heterostructure including layers of Fe$_3$Sn and ferromagnetic CoFeB, we further show the enhancement of the anomalous IPHE through the magnetic stray field of the CoFeB layer. Our work establishes a design paradigm for topological magnets and heterostructures to discover and control novel anomalous Hall effects toward their use in technological applications.</description>

      <title>Structural and Transport Properties of Thin InAs Layers Grown on InxAl1-xAs Metamorphic Buffers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indium Arsenide is a III-V semiconductor with low electron effective mass, a small band gap, strong spin-orbit coupling, and a large g-factor. These properties and its surface Fermi level pinned in the conduction band make InAs a good candidate for developing superconducting solid-state quantum devices. Here, we report the epitaxial growth of very thin InAs layers with thicknesses ranging from 12.5 nm to 500 nm grown by Molecular Beam Epitaxy on InxAl1-xAs metamorphic buffers. Differently than InAs substrates, these buffers have the advantage of being insulating at cryogenic temperatures, which allows for multiple device operations on the same wafer and thus making the approach scalable. The structural properties of the InAs layers were investigated by high-resolution X-ray diffraction, demonstrating the high crystal quality of the InAs layers. Furthermore, their transport properties, such as total and sheet carrier concentration, sheet resistance, and carrier mobility, were measured in the van der Pauw configuration at room temperature. A simple conduction model was employed to quantify the surface, bulk, and interface contributions to the overall carrier concentration and mobility.</description>

      <title>Magnetic measurements under high pressure with a quantum sensor in Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic measurements under high-pressure conditions are pivotal for the study of superconductivity and magnetic materials but remain challenging due to the micrometer-sized sample in diamond anvil cells (DAC). In this study, we propose a quantum sensing approach utilizing negatively charged boron-vacancy (V$_B^-$) spin defects in two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride for high resolution magnetic measurements under pressure. The optical and spin properties of VB$^-$ defects were systematically studied under high-pressure conditions, revealing a significant pressure-induced shift in zero-field splitting (ZFS), approximately three times larger than that of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center. Furthermore, we demonstrate the pressure-dependent magnetic transition and variations in the Curie temperature of van der Waals ferromagnet Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ flake using V$_B^-$ defects under pressures. Notably, the maximum operational pressure for V$_B^-$ defects was determined to be approximately 11 GPa, attributed to a structural phase transition in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). This work establishes the way for two-dimensional quantum sensing technologies under high-pressure environments.</description>

      <title>Stress Predictions in Polycrystal Plasticity using Graph Neural Networks with Subgraph Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05169v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical modeling of polycrystal plasticity is computationally intensive. We employ Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to predict stresses on complex geometries for polycrystal plasticity from Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations. We present a novel message-passing GNN that encodes nodal strain and edge distances between FEM mesh cells, and aggregates to obtain embeddings and combines the decoded embeddings with the nodal strains to predict stress tensors on graph nodes. The GNN is trained on subgraphs generated from FEM mesh graphs, in which the mesh cells are converted to nodes and edges are created between adjacent cells. We apply the trained GNN to periodic polycrystals with complex geometries and learn the strain-stress maps based on crystal plasticity theory. The GNN is accurately trained on FEM graphs, in which the $R^2$ for both training and testing sets are larger than 0.99. The proposed GNN approach speeds up more than 150 times compared with FEM on stress predictions. We also apply the trained GNN to unseen simulations for validations and the GNN generalizes well with an overall $R^2$ of 0.992. The GNN accurately predicts the von Mises stress on polycrystals. The proposed model does not overfit and generalizes well beyond the training data, as the error distributions demonstrate. This work outlooks surrogating crystal plasticity simulations using graph data.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional ferroelectric crystal with temperature-invariant ultralow thermal conductivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of temperature-invariant ultralow thermal conductivity ($\kappa$) in monolayer $\beta'$-In$_2$Se$_3$, a two-dimensional ferroelectric crystal with in-plane polarization. Using a combination of generalized Wigner transport equation theory and machine-learning-assisted molecular dynamics simulations, we reveal that the balance between particle-like phonon propagating and wave-like tunneling transport mechanisms results in a propagating-tunneling-invariant (PTI) ultralow thermal conductivity of approximately 0.6 W/mK (comparable to that of glass) over a broad temperature range ($150&lt;T&lt;800$~K). This behavior stems from intrinsic strong lattice anharmonicity driven by ferroelectric dipolar fluctuations, eliminating the need for extrinsic structural modifications. In contrast, the $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$~monolayer, which shares the same stoichiometry, exhibits a conventional temperature-dependent thermal conductivity, $\kappa (T) \propto T^{-1}$, typical of simple crystals. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the anharmonicity in $\beta'$-In$_2$Se$_3$~can be precisely modulated by an external electric field, enabling on-demand control of thermal transport properties, including modifying the temperature scaling behavior of heat conductivity and achieving a large thermal switching ratio of $\approx$2.5. These findings provide fundamental insights into the interplay between field-tunable lattice anharmonicity, phonon dynamics, and thermal transport mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Small polarons mediated near-room-temperature metal-insulator transition in vanadium dioxide and their hopping dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Researchers pursuing advanced photoelectric devices have discovered near room-temperature metal-insulator transitions (MIT) in non-volatile VO2. Despite theoretical investigations suggesting that polaron dynamics mediate the MIT, direct experimental evidence remains scarce. In this study, we present direct evidence of the polaron state in insulating VO2 through high-resolution spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements and first-principles calculations. We illustrate the complementary role of polaron dynamics in facilitating Peierls and Mott transitions, thereby contributing to the MIT processes. Furthermore, our observations and characterizations of conventional metallic and correlated plasmons in the respective phases of the VO2 film offer valuable insights into their electron structures. This investigation enhances comprehension of the MIT mechanism in correlated systems and underscores the roles of polarons, lattice distortions, and electron correlations in facilitating phase transition processes in strongly-correlated systems. Additionally, the detailed detection of small polarons and plasmons serves as inspiration for the development of new device functionalities.</description>

      <title>Pressure-dependent magnetism of the Kitaev candidate Li$_2$RhO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use magnetization measurements under pressure along with \textit{ab initio} and cluster many-body calculations to investigate magnetism of the Kitaev candidate Li$_2$RhO$_3$. Hydrostatic compression leads to a decrease in the magnitude of the nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic Kitaev coupling $K_1$ and the corresponding increase in the off-diagonal anisotropy $\Gamma_1$, whereas the experimental Curie-Weiss temperature changes from negative to positive with the slope of +40~K/GPa. On the other hand, spin freezing persists up to at least 3.46~GPa with the almost constant freezing temperature of 5~K that does not follow the large changes in the exchange couplings and indicates the likely extrinsic origin of spin freezing. Magnetic frustration in Li$_2$RhO$_3$ is mainly related to the interplay between ferromagnetic $K_1$ and antiferromagnetic $\Gamma_1$, along with the weakness of the third-neighbor coupling $J_3$ that would otherwise stabilize zigzag order. The small $J_3$ distinguishes Li$_2$RhO$_3$ from other Kitaev candidates.</description>

      <title>Exploring Intrinsic Bond Orbitals in Solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a study of the construction and spatial properties of localized Wannier orbitals in large supercells of insulating solids using plane waves as the underlying basis. The Pipek-Mezey (PM) functional in combination with intrinsic atomic orbitals (IAOs) as projectors is employed, resulting in so-called intrinsic bond orbitals (IBOs). Independent of the bonding type and band gap, a correlation between orbital spreads and geometric properties is observed. As a result, comparable sparsity patterns of the Hartree-Fock exchange matrix are found across all considered bulk 3D materials, exhibiting covalent bonds, ionc bonds, and a mixture of both bonding types. Recognizing the considerable computational effort required to construct localized Wannier orbitals for large periodic simulation cells, we address the performance and scaling of different solvers for the localization problem. This includes the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS), Conjugate-Gradient (CG), Steepest Ascent (SA) as well as the Direct Inversion in the Iterative Subspace (DIIS) method. Each algorithm performs a Riemannian optimization under unitary matrix constraint, efficiently reaching the optimum in the "curved parameter space" on geodesics. We hereby complement the literature with an introduction to this topic along with key references. Furthermore, we observe that the construction of Wannier orbitals for supercells of metal oxides presents a significant challenge, requiring approximately one order of magnitude more iteration steps than other systems studied.</description>

      <title>Electronic anisotropy and rotational symmetry breaking at a Weyl semimetal/spin ice interface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In magnetic pyrochlore materials, the interplay of spin-orbit coupling, electronic correlations, and geometrical frustration gives rise to exotic quantum phases, including topological semimetals and spin ice. While these phases have been observed in isolation, the interface-driven phenomena emerging from their interaction have never been realized previously. Here, we report on the discovery of interfacial electronic anisotropy and rotational symmetry breaking at a heterostructure consisting of the Weyl semimetal Eu2Ir2O7 and spin ice Dy2Ti2O7. Subjected to magnetic fields, we unveil a six-fold anisotropic transport response that is theoretically accounted by a Kondo-coupled heterointerface, where the spin ice's field-tuned magnetism induces electron scattering in the Weyl semimetal's topological Fermi-arc states. Furthermore, at elevated magnetic fields, we reveal a two-fold anisotropic response indicative of a new symmetry-broken many-body state. This discovery showcases the nascent potential of complex quantum architectures in search of emergent phenomena unreachable in bulk crystals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13954v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider disordered finite systems of subwavelength resonators where the disorder is in the spatial arrangement of the resonators and their material parameters are perturbed randomly. We elucidate the mechanism of wave localisation in such systems. To do so, we employ the capacitance matrix formalism, make precise the notions of bandgap and localised eigenmodes, study their stabilities with respect to fluctuations in the system, and highlight the importance of defect hybridisation and level repulsion in creating localised eigenmodes for a given arrangement of the resonators by randomly changing their material parameters. We also introduce a method of localised eigenmode prediction based on the discrete Green function of the disordered system of resonators and show the existence of hybridised bound eigenmodes in disordered systems where local translation invariance is broken.</description>
