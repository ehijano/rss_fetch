      <title>Towards Flow-Matching-based TTS without Classifier-Free Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow matching has demonstrated strong generative capabilities and has become a core component in modern Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems. To ensure high-quality speech synthesis, Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is widely used during the inference of flow-matching-based TTS models. However, CFG incurs substantial computational cost as it requires two forward passes, which hinders its applicability in real-time scenarios. In this paper, we explore removing CFG from flow-matching-based TTS models to improve inference efficiency, while maintaining performance. Specifically, we reformulated the flow matching training target to directly approximate the CFG optimization trajectory. This training method eliminates the need for unconditional model evaluation and guided tuning during inference, effectively cutting the computational overhead in half. Furthermore, It can be seamlessly integrated with existing optimized sampling strategies. We validate our approach using the F5-TTS model on the LibriTTS dataset. Experimental results show that our method achieves a 9$\times$ inference speed-up compared to the baseline F5-TTS, while preserving comparable speech quality. We will release the code and models to support reproducibility and foster further research in this area.</description>

      <title>ISDrama: Immersive Spatial Drama Generation through Multimodal Prompting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal immersive spatial drama generation focuses on creating continuous multi-speaker binaural speech with dramatic prosody based on multimodal prompts, with potential applications in AR, VR, and others. This task requires simultaneous modeling of spatial information and dramatic prosody based on multimodal inputs, with high data collection costs. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to address these challenges. We construct MRSDrama, the first multimodal recorded spatial drama dataset, containing binaural drama audios, scripts, videos, geometric poses, and textual prompts. Then, we propose ISDrama, the first immersive spatial drama generation model through multimodal prompting. ISDrama comprises these primary components: 1) Multimodal Pose Encoder, based on contrastive learning, considering the Doppler effect caused by moving speakers to extract unified pose information from multimodal prompts. 2) Immersive Drama Transformer, a flow-based mamba-transformer model that generates high-quality drama, incorporating Drama-MOE to select proper experts for enhanced prosody and pose control. We also design a context-consistent classifier-free guidance strategy to coherently generate complete drama. Experimental results show that ISDrama outperforms baseline models on objective and subjective metrics. The demos and dataset are available at https://aaronz345.github.io/ISDramaDemo.</description>

      <title>APG-MOS: Auditory Perception Guided-MOS Predictor for Synthetic Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic speech quality assessment aims to quantify subjective human perception of speech through computational models to reduce the need for labor-consuming manual evaluations. While models based on deep learning have achieved progress in predicting mean opinion scores (MOS) to assess synthetic speech, the neglect of fundamental auditory perception mechanisms limits consistency with human judgments. To address this issue, we propose an auditory perception guided-MOS prediction model (APG-MOS) that synergistically integrates auditory modeling with semantic analysis to enhance consistency with human judgments. Specifically, we first design a perceptual module, grounded in biological auditory mechanisms, to simulate cochlear functions, which encodes acoustic signals into biologically aligned electrochemical representations. Secondly, we propose a residual vector quantization (RVQ)-based semantic distortion modeling method to quantify the degradation of speech quality at the semantic level. Finally, we design a residual cross-attention architecture, coupled with a progressive learning strategy, to enable multimodal fusion of encoded electrochemical signals and semantic representations. Experiments demonstrate that APG-MOS achieves superior performance on two primary benchmarks. Our code and checkpoint will be available on a public repository upon publication.</description>

      <title>TriniMark: A Robust Generative Speech Watermarking Method for Trinity-Level Attribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of diffusion models has facilitated the generation of speech with reinforced fidelity and naturalness. While deepfake detection technologies have manifested the ability to identify AI-generated content, their efficacy decreases as generative models become increasingly sophisticated. Furthermore, current research in the field has not adequately addressed the necessity for robust watermarking to safeguard the intellectual property rights associated with synthetic speech and generative models. To remedy this deficiency, we propose a \textbf{ro}bust generative \textbf{s}peech wat\textbf{e}rmarking method (TriniMark) for authenticating the generated content and safeguarding the copyrights by enabling the traceability of the diffusion model. We first design a structure-lightweight watermark encoder that embeds watermarks into the time-domain features of speech and reconstructs the waveform directly. A temporal-aware gated convolutional network is meticulously designed in the watermark decoder for bit-wise watermark recovery. Subsequently, the waveform-guided fine-tuning strategy is proposed for fine-tuning the diffusion model, which leverages the transferability of watermarks and enables the diffusion model to incorporate watermark knowledge effectively. When an attacker trains a surrogate model using the outputs of the target model, the embedded watermark can still be learned by the surrogate model and correctly extracted. Comparative experiments with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the superior robustness of our method, particularly in countering compound attacks.</description>

      <title>DiffusionRIR: Room Impulse Response Interpolation using Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Room Impulse Responses (RIRs) characterize acoustic environments and are crucial in multiple audio signal processing tasks. High-quality RIR estimates drive applications such as virtual microphones, sound source localization, augmented reality, and data augmentation. However, obtaining RIR measurements with high spatial resolution is resource-intensive, making it impractical for large spaces or when dense sampling is required. This research addresses the challenge of estimating RIRs at unmeasured locations within a room using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM). Our method leverages the analogy between RIR matrices and image inpainting, transforming RIR data into a format suitable for diffusion-based reconstruction.
  Using simulated RIR data based on the image method, we demonstrate our approach's effectiveness on microphone arrays of different curvatures, from linear to semi-circular. Our method successfully reconstructs missing RIRs, even in large gaps between microphones. Under these conditions, it achieves accurate reconstruction, significantly outperforming baseline Spline Cubic Interpolation in terms of Normalized Mean Square Error and Cosine Distance between actual and interpolated RIRs.
  This research highlights the potential of using generative models for effective RIR interpolation, paving the way for generating additional data from limited real-world measurements.</description>

      <title>Non-native Children's Automatic Speech Assessment Challenge (NOCASA)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the "Non-native Children's Automatic Speech Assessment" (NOCASA) - a data competition part of the IEEE MLSP 2025 conference. NOCASA challenges participants to develop new systems that can assess single-word pronunciations of young second language (L2) learners as part of a gamified pronunciation training app. To achieve this, several issues must be addressed, most notably the limited nature of available training data and the highly unbalanced distribution among the pronunciation level categories. To expedite the development, we provide a pseudo-anonymized training data (TeflonNorL2), containing 10,334 recordings from 44 speakers attempting to pronounce 205 distinct Norwegian words, human-rated on a 1 to 5 scale (number of stars that should be given in the game). In addition to the data, two already trained systems are released as official baselines: an SVM classifier trained on the ComParE_16 acoustic feature set and a multi-task wav2vec 2.0 model. The latter achieves the best performance on the challenge test set, with an unweighted average recall (UAR) of 36.37%.</description>

      <title>ECOSoundSet: a finely annotated dataset for the automated acoustic identification of Orthoptera and Cicadidae in North, Central and temperate Western Europe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Currently available tools for the automated acoustic recognition of European insects in natural soundscapes are limited in scope. Large and ecologically heterogeneous acoustic datasets are currently needed for these algorithms to cross-contextually recognize the subtle and complex acoustic signatures produced by each species, thus making the availability of such datasets a key requisite for their development. Here we present ECOSoundSet (European Cicadidae and Orthoptera Sound dataSet), a dataset containing 10,653 recordings of 200 orthopteran and 24 cicada species (217 and 26 respective taxa when including subspecies) present in North, Central, and temperate Western Europe (Andorra, Belgium, Denmark, mainland France and Corsica, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, Monaco, Netherlands, United Kingdom, Switzerland), collected partly through targeted fieldwork in South France and Catalonia and partly through contributions from various European entomologists. The dataset is composed of a combination of coarsely labeled recordings, for which we can only infer the presence, at some point, of their target species (weak labeling), and finely annotated recordings, for which we know the specific time and frequency range of each insect sound present in the recording (strong labeling). We also provide a train/validation/test split of the strongly labeled recordings, with respective approximate proportions of 0.8, 0.1 and 0.1, in order to facilitate their incorporation in the training and evaluation of deep learning algorithms. This dataset could serve as a meaningful complement to recordings already available online for the training of deep learning algorithms for the acoustic classification of orthopterans and cicadas in North, Central, and temperate Western Europe.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Non-Core Language Instruction-Following in Speech LLMs via Semi-Implicit Cross-Lingual CoT Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models have been extended to the speech domain, leading to the development of speech large language models (SLLMs). While existing SLLMs demonstrate strong performance in speech instruction-following for core languages (e.g., English), they often struggle with non-core languages due to the scarcity of paired speech-text data and limited multilingual semantic reasoning capabilities. To address this, we propose the semi-implicit Cross-lingual Speech Chain-of-Thought (XS-CoT) framework, which integrates speech-to-text translation into the reasoning process of SLLMs. The XS-CoT generates four types of tokens: instruction and response tokens in both core and non-core languages, enabling cross-lingual transfer of reasoning capabilities. To mitigate inference latency in generating target non-core response tokens, we incorporate a semi-implicit CoT scheme into XS-CoT, which progressively compresses the first three types of intermediate reasoning tokens while retaining global reasoning logic during training. By leveraging the robust reasoning capabilities of the core language, XS-CoT improves responses for non-core languages by up to 45\% in GPT-4 score when compared to direct supervised fine-tuning on two representative SLLMs, Qwen2-Audio and SALMONN. Moreover, the semi-implicit XS-CoT reduces token delay by more than 50\% with a slight drop in GPT-4 scores. Importantly, XS-CoT requires only a small amount of high-quality training data for non-core languages by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of core languages. To support training, we also develop a data pipeline and open-source speech instruction-following datasets in Japanese, German, and French.</description>

      <title>End-to-end Audio Deepfake Detection from RAW Waveforms: a RawNet-Based Approach with Cross-Dataset Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio deepfakes represent a growing threat to digital security and trust, leveraging advanced generative models to produce synthetic speech that closely mimics real human voices. Detecting such manipulations is especially challenging under open-world conditions, where spoofing methods encountered during testing may differ from those seen during training. In this work, we propose an end-to-end deep learning framework for audio deepfake detection that operates directly on raw waveforms. Our model, RawNetLite, is a lightweight convolutional-recurrent architecture designed to capture both spectral and temporal features without handcrafted preprocessing. To enhance robustness, we introduce a training strategy that combines data from multiple domains and adopts Focal Loss to emphasize difficult or ambiguous samples. We further demonstrate that incorporating codec-based manipulations and applying waveform-level audio augmentations (e.g., pitch shifting, noise, and time stretching) leads to significant generalization improvements under realistic acoustic conditions. The proposed model achieves over 99.7% F1 and 0.25% EER on in-domain data (FakeOrReal), and up to 83.4% F1 with 16.4% EER on a challenging out-of-distribution test set (AVSpoof2021 + CodecFake). These findings highlight the importance of diverse training data, tailored objective functions and audio augmentations in building resilient and generalizable audio forgery detectors. Code and pretrained models are available at https://iplab.dmi.unict.it/mfs/Deepfakes/PaperRawNet2025/.</description>

      <title>Design and Analysis of Binaural Signal Matching with Arbitrary Microphone Arrays and Listener Head Rotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03581v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Binaural reproduction is rapidly becoming a topic of great interest in the research community, especially with the surge of new and popular devices, such as virtual reality headsets, smart glasses, and head-tracked headphones. In order to immerse the listener in a virtual or remote environment with such devices, it is essential to generate realistic and accurate binaural signals. This is challenging, especially since the microphone arrays mounted on these devices are typically composed of an arbitrarily-arranged small number of microphones, which impedes the use of standard audio formats like Ambisonics, and provides limited spatial resolution. The binaural signal matching (BSM) method was developed recently to overcome these challenges. While it produced binaural signals with low error using relatively simple arrays, its performance degraded significantly when head rotation was introduced. This paper aims to develop the BSM method further and overcome its limitations. For this purpose, the method is first analyzed in detail, and a design framework that guarantees accurate binaural reproduction for relatively complex acoustic environments is presented. Next, it is shown that the BSM accuracy may significantly degrade at high frequencies, and thus, a perceptually motivated extension to the method is proposed, based on a magnitude least-squares (MagLS) formulation. These insights and developments are then analyzed with the help of an extensive simulation study of a simple six-microphone semi-circular array. It is further shown that the BSM-MagLS method can be very useful in compensating for head rotations with this array. Finally, a listening experiment is conducted with a four-microphone array on a pair of glasses in a reverberant speech environment and including head rotations, where it is shown that BSM-MagLS can indeed produce binaural signals with a high perceived quality.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Timbre Leakage with Universal Semantic Mapping Residual Block for Voice Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Voice conversion (VC) transforms source speech into a target voice by preserving the content. However, timbre information from the source speaker is inherently embedded in the content representations, causing significant timbre leakage and reducing similarity to the target speaker. To address this, we introduce a residual block to a content extractor. The residual block consists of two weighted branches: 1) universal semantic dictionary based Content Feature Re-expression (CFR) module, supplying timbre-free content representation. 2) skip connection to the original content layer, providing complementary fine-grained information. In the CFR module, each dictionary entry in the universal semantic dictionary represents a phoneme class, computed statistically using speech from multiple speakers, creating a stable, speaker-independent semantic set. We introduce a CFR method to obtain timbre-free content representations by expressing each content frame as a weighted linear combination of dictionary entries using corresponding phoneme posteriors as weights. Extensive experiments across various VC frameworks demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates timbre leakage and significantly improves similarity to the target speaker.</description>

      <title>Versatile Framework for Song Generation with Prompt-based Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Song generation focuses on producing controllable high-quality songs based on various prompts. However, existing methods struggle to generate vocals and accompaniments with prompt-based control and proper alignment. Additionally, they fall short in supporting various tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce VersBand, a multi-task song generation framework for synthesizing high-quality, aligned songs with prompt-based control. VersBand comprises these primary models: 1) VocalBand, a decoupled model, leverages the flow-matching method for generating singing styles, pitches, and mel-spectrograms, allowing fast, high-quality vocal generation with style control. 2) AccompBand, a flow-based transformer model, incorporates the Band-MOE, selecting suitable experts for enhanced quality, alignment, and control. This model allows for generating controllable, high-quality accompaniments aligned with vocals. 3) Two generation models, LyricBand for lyrics and MelodyBand for melodies, contribute to the comprehensive multi-task song generation system, allowing for extensive control based on multiple prompts. Experimental results demonstrate that VersBand performs better over baseline models across multiple song generation tasks using objective and subjective metrics. Audio samples are available at https://aaronz345.github.io/VersBandDemo.</description>

Abstract: Text-to-music (TTM) generation, which converts textual descriptions into audio, opens up innovative avenues for multimedia creation. Achieving high quality and diversity in this process demands extensive, high-quality data, which are often scarce in available datasets. Most open-source datasets frequently suffer from issues like low-quality waveforms and low text-audio consistency, hindering the advancement of music generation models. To address these challenges, we propose a novel quality-aware training paradigm for generating high-quality, high-musicality music from large-scale, quality-imbalanced datasets. Additionally, by leveraging unique properties in the latent space of musical signals, we adapt and implement a masked diffusion transformer (MDT) model for the TTM task, showcasing its capacity for quality control and enhanced musicality. Furthermore, we introduce a three-stage caption refinement approach to address low-quality captions' issue. Experiments show state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on benchmark datasets including MusicCaps and the Song-Describer Dataset with both objective and subjective metrics. Demo audio samples are available at https://qa-mdt.github.io/, code and pretrained checkpoints are open-sourced at https://github.com/ivcylc/OpenMusic.</description>

Abstract: There is a growing abundance of publicly available or company-owned audio/video archives, highlighting the increasing importance of efficient access to desired content and information retrieval from these archives. This paper investigates the challenges, solutions, effectiveness, and robustness of speaker retrieval systems developed "in the wild" which involves addressing two primary challenges: extraction of task-relevant labels from limited metadata for system development and evaluation, as well as the unconstrained acoustic conditions encountered in the archive, ranging from quiet studios to adverse noisy environments. While we focus on the publicly-available BBC Rewind archive (spanning 1948 to 1979), our framework addresses the broader issue of speaker retrieval on extensive and possibly aged archives with no control over the content and acoustic conditions. Typically, these archives offer a brief and general file description, mostly inadequate for specific applications like speaker retrieval, and manual annotation of such large-scale archives is unfeasible. We explore various aspects of system development (e.g., speaker diarisation, embedding extraction, query selection) and analyse the challenges, possible solutions, and their functionality. To evaluate the performance, we conduct systematic experiments in both clean setup and against various distortions simulating real-world applications. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the developed speaker retrieval systems, establishing the versatility and scalability of the proposed framework for a wide range of applications beyond the BBC Rewind corpus.</description>
