      <title>Achievable Rate and Coding Principle for MIMO Multicarrier Systems With Cross-Domain MAMP Receiver Over Doubly Selective Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of multicarrier modulation and multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) is critical for reliable transmission of wireless signals in complex environments, which significantly improve spectrum efficiency. Existing studies have shown that popular orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) and affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) offer significant advantages over orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) in uncoded doubly selective channels. However, it remains uncertain whether these benefits extend to coded systems. Meanwhile, the information-theoretic limit analysis of coded MIMO multicarrier systems and the corresponding low-complexity receiver design remain unclear. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-slot cross-domain memory approximate message passing (MS-CD-MAMP) receiver as well as develops its information-theoretic (i.e., achievable rate) limit and optimal coding principle for MIMO-multicarrier modulation (e.g., OFDM, OTFS, and AFDM) systems. The proposed MS-CD-MAMP receiver can exploit not only the time domain channel sparsity for low complexity but also the corresponding symbol domain constellation constraints for performance enhancement. Meanwhile, limited by the high-dimensional complex state evolution (SE), a simplified single-input single-output variational SE is proposed to derive the achievable rate of MS-CD-MAMP and the optimal coding principle with the goal of maximizing the achievable rate. Numerical results show that coded MIMO-OFDM/OTFS/AFDM with MS-CD-MAMP achieve the same maximum achievable rate in doubly selective channels, whose finite-length performance with practical optimized low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes is only 0.5 $\sim$ 1.8 dB away from the associated theoretical limit, and has 0.8 $\sim$ 4.4 dB gain over the well-designed point-to-point LDPC codes.</description>

      <title>Bridging Distance and Spectral Positional Encodings via Anchor-Based Diffusion Geometry Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular graph learning benefits from positional signals that capture both local neighborhoods and global topology. Two widely used families are spectral encodings derived from Laplacian or diffusion operators and anchor-based distance encodings built from shortest-path information, yet their precise relationship is poorly understood. We interpret distance encodings as a low-rank surrogate of diffusion geometry and derive an explicit trilateration map that reconstructs truncated diffusion coordinates from transformed anchor distances and anchor spectral positions, with pointwise and Frobenius-gap guarantees on random regular graphs. On DrugBank molecular graphs using a shared GNP-based DDI prediction backbone, a distance-driven Nystr\"om scheme closely recovers diffusion geometry, and both Laplacian and distance encodings substantially outperform a no-encoding baseline.</description>

      <title>Air-to-Ground Communications for Internet of Things: UAV-based Coverage Hole Detection and Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) play a pivotal role in ensuring seamless connectivity for Internet of Things (IoT) devices, particularly in scenarios where conventional terrestrial networks are constrained or temporarily unavailable. However, traditional coverage-hole detection approaches, such as minimizing drive tests, are costly, time-consuming, and reliant on outdated radio-environment data, making them unsuitable for real-time applications. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a UAV-assisted framework for real-time detection and recovery of coverage holes in IoT networks. In the proposed scheme, a patrol UAV is first dispatched to identify coverage holes in regions where the operational status of terrestrial base stations (BSs) is uncertain. Once a coverage hole is detected, one or more UAVs acting as aerial BSs are deployed by a satellite or nearby operational BSs to restore connectivity. The UAV swarm is organized based on Delaunay triangulation, enabling scalable deployment and tractable analytical characterization using stochastic geometry. Moreover, a collision-avoidance mechanism grounded in multi-agent system theory ensures safe and coordinated motion among multiple UAVs. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves high efficiency in both coverage-hole detection and on-demand connectivity restoration while significantly reducing operational cost and time.</description>

      <title>Feasibility Study Regarding Self-sustainable Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Without requiring operational costs such as cabling and powering while maintaining reconfigurable phase-shift capability, self-sustainable reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (ssRISs) can be deployed in locations inaccessible to conventional relays or base stations, offering a novel approach to enhance wireless coverage. This study assesses the feasibility of ssRIS deployment by analyzing two harvest-and-reflect (HaR) schemes: element-splitting (ES) and time-splitting (TS). We examine how element requirements scale with key system parameters, transmit power, data rate demands, and outage constraints under both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) ssRIS-to-user equipment (UE) channels. Analytical and numerical results reveal distinct feasibility characteristics. The TS scheme demonstrates better channel hardening gain, maintaining stable element requirements across varying outage margins, making it advantageous for indoor deployments with favorable harvesting conditions and moderate data rates. However, TS exhibits an element requirement that exponentially scales to harvesting difficulty and data rate. Conversely, the ES scheme shows only linear growth with harvesting difficulty, providing better feasibility under challenging outdoor scenarios. These findings establish that TS excels in benign environments, prioritizing reliability, while ES is preferable for demanding conditions requiring operational robustness.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Utility Trade-offs Under Multi-Level Point-Wise Leakage Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An information-theoretic privacy mechanism design is studied, where an agent observes useful data $Y$ which is correlated with the private data $X$. The agent wants to reveal the information to a user, hence, the agent utilizes a privacy mechanism to produce disclosed data $U$ that can be revealed. We assume that the agent has no direct access to $X$, i.e., the private data is hidden. We study privacy mechanism design that maximizes the disclosed information about $Y$, measured by the mutual information between $Y$ and $U$, while satisfying a point-wise constraint with different privacy leakage budgets. We introduce a new measure, called the \emph{multi-level point-wise leakage}, which allows us to impose different leakage levels for different realizations of $U$. In contrast to previous studies on point-wise measures, which use the same leakage level for each realization, we consider a more general scenario in which each data point can leak information up to a different threshold. As a result, this concept also covers cases in which some data points should not leak any information about the private data, i.e., they must satisfy perfect privacy. In other words, a combination of perfect privacy and non-zero leakage can be considered. When the leakage is sufficiently small, concepts from information geometry allow us to locally approximate the mutual information. We show that when the leakage matrix $P_{X|Y}$ is invertible, utilizing this approximation leads to a quadratic optimization problem that has closed-form solution under some constraints. In particular, we show that it is sufficient to consider only binary $U$ to attain the optimal utility. This leads to simple privacy designs with low complexity which are based on finding the maximum singular value and singular vector of a matrix.</description>

      <title>Stability of Constrained Optimization Models for Structured Signal Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recovering an unknown but structured signal from its measurements is a challenging problem with significant applications in fields such as imaging restoration, wireless communications, and signal processing. In this paper, we consider the inherent problem stems from the prior knowledge about the signal's structure, such as sparsity which is critical for signal recovery models. We investigate three constrained optimization models that effectively address this challenge, each leveraging distinct forms of structural priors to regularize the solution space. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that these models exhibit robustness to noise while maintaining stability with respect to tuning parameters that is a crucial property for practical applications, when the parameter selection is often nontrivial. By providing theoretical foundations, our work supports their practical use in scenarios where measurement imperfections and model uncertainties are unavoidable. Furthermore, under mild conditions, we establish tradeoff between the sample complexity and the mismatch error.</description>

      <title>Wireless Communication with Cross-Linked Rotatable Antenna Array: Architecture Design and Rotation Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotatable antenna (RA) technology can harness additional spatial degrees of freedom by enabling the dynamic three-dimensional orientation control of each antenna. Unfortunately, the hardware cost and control complexity of traditional RA systems is proportional to the number of RAs. To address the issue, we consider a cross-linked (CL) RA structure, which enables the coordinated rotation of multiple antennas, thereby offering a cost-effective solution. To evaluate the performance of the CL-RA array, we investigate a CL-RA-aided uplink system. Specifically, we first establish system models for both antenna element-level and antenna panel-level rotation. Then, we formulate a sum rate maximization problem by jointly optimizing the receive beamforming at the base station and the rotation angles. For the antenna element-level rotation, we derive the optimal solution of the CL-RA array under the single-user case. Subsequently, for two rotation schemes, we propose an alternating optimization algorithm to solve the formulated problem in the multi-user case, where the receive beamforming and the antenna rotation angles are obtained by applying the minimum mean square error method and feasible direction method, respectively. In addition, considering the hardware limitations, we apply the genetic algorithm to address the discrete rotation angles selection problem. Simulation results show that by carefully designing the row-column partition scheme, the performance of the CL-RA architecture is quite close to that of the flexible antenna orientation scheme. Moreover, the CL antenna element-level scheme surpasses the CL antenna panel-level scheme by 25% and delivers a 128% performance improvement over conventional fixed-direction antennas.</description>

      <title>Learning Sparsifying Transforms for mmWave Communication via $\ell^4$-Norm Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high directionality of wave propagation at millimeter-wave (mmWave) carrier frequencies results in only a small number of significant transmission paths between user equipments and the basestation (BS). This sparse nature of wave propagation is revealed in the beamspace domain, which is traditionally obtained by taking the spatial discrete Fourier transform (DFT) across a uniform linear antenna array at the BS, where each DFT output is associated with a distinct beam. In recent years, beamspace processing has emerged as a promising technique to reduce baseband complexity and power consumption in all-digital massive multiuser (MU) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems operating at mmWave frequencies. However, it remains unclear whether the DFT is the optimal sparsifying transform for finite-dimensional antenna arrays. In this paper, we extend the framework of Zhai et al. for complete dictionary learning via $\ell^4$-norm maximization to the complex case in order to learn new sparsifying transforms. We provide a theoretical foundation for $\ell^4$-norm maximization and propose two suitable learning algorithms. We then utilize these algorithms (i) to assess the optimality of the DFT for sparsifying channel vectors theoretically and via simulations and (ii) to learn improved sparsifying transforms for real-world and synthetically generated channel vectors.</description>

      <title>Refinements of Jensen's Inequality for Twice-Differentiable Convex Functions with Bounded Hessian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jensen's inequality, attributed to Johan Jensen -- a Danish mathematician and engineer noted for his contributions to the theory of functions -- is a ubiquitous result in convex analysis, providing a fundamental lower bound for the expectation of a convex function. In this paper, we establish rigorous refinements of this inequality specifically for twice-differentiable functions with bounded Hessians. By utilizing Taylor expansions with integral remainders, we tried to bridge the gap between classical variance-based bounds and higher-precision estimates. We also discover explicit error terms governed by Gruss-type inequalities, allowing for the incorporation of skewness and kurtosis into the bound. Using these new theoretical tools, we improve upon existing estimates for the Shannon entropy of continuous distributions and the ergodic capacity of Rayleigh fading channels, demonstrating the practical efficacy of our refinements.</description>

      <title>Precoding Matrix Indicator in the 5G NR Protocol: A Tutorial on 3GPP Beamforming Codebooks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper bridges this critical gap by providing a systematic examination of the beamforming codebook technology, i.e., precoding matrix indicator (PMI), in the 5G NR from theoretical, standardization, and implementation perspectives. We begin by introducing the background of beamforming in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems and the signaling procedures for codebook-based beamforming in practical 5G systems. Then, we establish the fundamentals of regular codebooks and port-selection codebooks in 3GPP standards. Next, we provide rigorous technical analysis of 3GPP codebook evolution spanning Releases 15-18, with particular focus on: 1) We elucidate the core principles underlying codebook design, 2) provide clear physical interpretations for each symbolic variable in the codebook formulas, summarized in tabular form, and 3) offer intuitive visual illustrations to explain how codebook parameters convey information. These essential pedagogical elements are almost entirely absent in the often-obscure standardization documents. Through mathematical modeling, performance benchmarking, feedback comparisons, and scenario-dependent applicability analysis, we provide researchers and engineers with a unified understanding of beamforming codebooks in real-world systems. Furthermore, we identify future directions and other beamforming scenarios for ongoing research and development efforts. This work serves as both an informative tutorial and a guidance for future research, facilitating more effective collaboration between academia and industry in advancing wireless communication technologies.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Tradeoffs for ISAC Multiple Access in Finite-Blocklength Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the fundamental communication--sensing tradeoffs of uplink dual-functional integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) multiple access under finite blocklength (FBL) constraints. Unlike conventional asymptotic analyses, we explicitly account for the limitations under FBL constraints imposed by short packets and low-latency transmission. By examining the unbiased channel state sensing estimator, we establish a geometric decomposition of the sensing error, indicating that it is jointly determined by the signal-to-noise ratio and the correlation structure of the information codebook. This insight reveals how cross-correlation among active users in the codebook geometry fundamentally constrains dual-functional ISAC performance. Consequently, we derive achievability and converse bounds that characterize the tradeoff between communication code rate and sensing accuracy in the FBL regime, with the converse further bounded by Shannon capacity. Moreover, by treating channel state sensing as a high-level sensing objective, a universal Cram\'er--Rao bound is derived to link channel estimation accuracy to practical sensing parameters. Examples of parameter sensing are also provided based on 3GPP standard. Numerical results validate the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the impact of blocklength, antenna dimensions, and sensing requirements.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Limits on Exact Subgraph Alignment Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The graph alignment problem aims to identify the vertex correspondence between two correlated graphs. Most existing studies focus on the scenario in which the two graphs share the same vertex set. However, in many real-world applications, such as computer vision, social network analysis, and bioinformatics, the task often involves locating a small graph pattern within a larger graph. Existing graph alignment algorithms and analysis cannot directly address these scenarios because they are not designed to identify the specific subset of vertices where the small graph pattern resides within the larger graph. Motivated by this limitation, we introduce the subgraph alignment problem, which seeks to recover both the vertex set and/or the vertex correspondence of a small graph pattern embedded in a larger graph. In the special case where the small graph pattern is an induced subgraph of the larger graph and both the vertex set and correspondence are to be recovered, the problem reduces to the subgraph isomorphism problem, which is NP-complete in the worst case. In this paper, we formally formulate the subgraph alignment problem by proposing the Erdos-Renyi subgraph pair model together with some appropriate recovery criterion. We then establish almost-tight information-theoretic results for the subgraph alignment problem and present some novel approaches for the analysis.</description>

      <title>Complexity Agnostic Recursive Decomposition of Thoughts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models often fail on multi-step reasoning due to fixed reasoning strategies that ignore problem specific difficulty. We introduce CARD (Complexity Agnostic Recursive Decomposition), a framework that predicts problem complexity before generation and adapts decomposition accordingly. Our system comprises MRCE (Multi-dimensional Reasoning Complexity Estimator), a 0.6B Qwen model predicting 30 fine-grained features from question text and a two-stage recursive solver: (1) hierarchical decomposition into K steps based on task profile and (2) per-step thought budget allocation (1, 5-9, or 10 thoughts) via recursive MRCE profiling. Evaluated on three reasoning models (Qwen3-0.6B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, Qwen3-1.7B), CARD achieves 81.4% to 89.2% accuracy on GSM8K while reducing token cost by 1.88x to 2.40x compared to fixed decomposition baselines. On MATH-500, CARD reaches 75.1 to 86.8% accuracy using 1.71x to 5.74x fewer tokens. Our results demonstrate that preemptive complexity estimation enables both higher accuracy and significant efficiency gains.</description>

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) and federated distillation (FD) are distributed learning paradigms that train UE models with enhanced privacy, each offering different trade-offs between noise robustness and learning speed. To mitigate their respective weaknesses, we propose a hybrid federated learning (HFL) framework in which each user equipment (UE) transmits either gradients or logits, and the base station (BS) selects the per-round weights of FL and FD updates. We derive convergence of HFL framework and introduce two methods to exploit degrees of freedom (DoF) in HFL, which are (i) adaptive UE clustering via Jenks optimization and (ii) adaptive weight selection via a damped Newton method. Numerical results show that HFL achieves superior test accuracy at low SNR when both DoF are exploited.</description>

      <title>Publishing FAIR and Machine-actionable Reviews in Materials Science: The Case for Symbolic Knowledge in Neuro-symbolic Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05051</link>

Abstract: Scientific reviews are central to knowledge integration in materials science, yet their key insights remain locked in narrative text and static PDF tables, limiting reuse by humans and machines alike. This article presents a case study in atomic layer deposition and etching (ALD/E) where we publish review tables as FAIR, machine-actionable comparisons in the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG), turning them into structured, queryable knowledge. Building on this, we contrast symbolic querying over ORKG with large language model-based querying, and argue that a curated symbolic layer should remain the backbone of reliable neurosymbolic AI in materials science, with LLMs serving as complementary, symbolically grounded interfaces rather than standalone sources of truth.</description>

      <title>A complete characterization of testable hypotheses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit a fundamental question in hypothesis testing: given two sets of probability measures $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$, when does a nontrivial (i.e.\ strictly unbiased) test for $\mathcal{P}$ against $\mathcal{Q}$ exist? Le~Cam showed that, when $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$ have a common dominating measure, a test that has power exceeding its level by more than $\varepsilon$ exists if and only if the convex hulls of $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$ are separated in total variation distance by more than $\varepsilon$. The requirement of a dominating measure is frequently violated in nonparametric statistics. In a passing remark, Le~Cam described an approach to address more general scenarios, but he stopped short of stating a formal theorem. This work completes Le~Cam's program, by presenting a matching necessary and sufficient condition for testability: for the aforementioned theorem to hold without assumptions, one must take the closures of the convex hulls of $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$ in the space of bounded finitely additive measures. We provide simple elucidating examples, and elaborate on various subtle measure theoretic and topological points regarding compactness and achievability.</description>

      <title>Binary Iterative Hard Thresholding Converges with Optimal Number of Measurements for 1-Bit Compressed Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.03427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compressed sensing has been a very successful high-dimensional signal acquisition and recovery technique that relies on linear operations. However, the actual measurements of signals have to be quantized before storing or processing. 1(One)-bit compressed sensing is a heavily quantized version of compressed sensing, where each linear measurement of a signal is reduced to just one bit: the sign of the measurement. Once enough of such measurements are collected, the recovery problem in 1-bit compressed sensing aims to find the original signal with as much accuracy as possible. The recovery problem is related to the traditional "halfspace-learning" problem in learning theory.
  For recovery of sparse vectors, a popular reconstruction method from 1-bit measurements is the binary iterative hard thresholding (BIHT) algorithm. The algorithm is a simple projected sub-gradient descent method, and is known to converge well empirically, despite the nonconvexity of the problem. The convergence property of BIHT was not theoretically justified, except with an exorbitantly large number of measurements (i.e., a number of measurement greater than $\max\{k^{10}, 24^{48}, k^{3.5}/\epsilon\}$, where $k$ is the sparsity, $\epsilon$ denotes the approximation error, and even this expression hides other factors). In this paper we show that the BIHT algorithm converges with only $\tilde{O}(\frac{k}{\epsilon})$ measurements. Note that, this dependence on $k$ and $\epsilon$ is optimal for any recovery method in 1-bit compressed sensing. With this result, to the best of our knowledge, BIHT is the only practical and efficient (polynomial time) algorithm that requires the optimal number of measurements in all parameters (both $k$ and $\epsilon$). This is also an example of a gradient descent algorithm converging to the correct solution for a nonconvex problem, under suitable structural conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04201v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A code is locally recoverable when each symbol in one of its code words can be reconstructed as a function of $r$ other symbols. We use bundles of projective spaces over a line to construct locally recoverable codes with availability; that is, evaluation codes where each code word symbol can be reconstructed from several disjoint sets of other symbols. The simplest case, where the code's underlying variety is a plane, exhibits noteworthy properties: When $r = 1$, $2$, $3$, they are optimal; when $r \geq 4$, they are optimal with probability approaching $1$ as the alphabet size grows. Additionally, their information rate is close to the theoretical limit. In higher dimensions, our codes form a family of asymptotically good codes.</description>

      <title>Exponentially Consistent Low Complexity Tests for Outlier Hypothesis Testing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit outlier hypothesis testing, propose exponentially consistent low complexity fixed-length and sequential tests and show that our tests achieve better tradeoff between detection performance and computational complexity than existing tests that use exhaustive search. Specifically, in outlier hypothesis testing, one is given a list of observed sequences, most of which are generated i.i.d. from a nominal distribution while the rest sequences named outliers are generated i.i.d. from another anomalous distribution. The task is to identify all outliers when both the nominal and anomalous distributions are unknown. There are two basic settings: fixed-length and sequential. In the fixed-length setting, the sample size of each observed sequence is fixed a priori while in the sequential setting, the sample size is a random number that can be determined by the test designer to ensure reliable decisions. For the fixed-length setting, we strengthen the results of Bu \emph{et. al} (TSP 2019) by i) allowing for scoring functions beyond KL divergence and further simplifying the test design when the number of outliers is known and ii) proposing a new test, explicitly bounding the detection performance of the test and characterizing the tradeoff among exponential decay rates of three error probabilities when the number of outliers is unknown. For the sequential setting, our tests for both cases are novel and enable us to reveal the benefit of sequentiality. Finally, for both fixed-length and sequential settings, we demonstrate the penalty of not knowing the number of outliers on the detection performance.</description>

      <title>Repeater Swarm-Assisted Cellular Systems: Interaction Stability and Performance Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a cellular massive MIMO system where swarms of wireless repeaters are deployed to improve coverage. These repeaters are full-duplex relays with small form factors that receive and instantaneously retransmit signals. They can be deployed in a plug-and-play manner at low cost, while being transparent to the network--conceptually they are active channel scatterers with amplification capabilities. Two fundamental questions need to be addressed in repeater deployments: (I) How can we prevent destructive effects of positive feedback caused by inter-repeater interaction (i.e., each repeater receives and amplifies signals from others)? (ii) How much performance improvement can be achieved given that repeaters also inject noise and may introduce more interference? To answer these questions, we first derive a generalized Nyquist stability criterion for the repeater swarm system, and provide an easy-to-check stability condition. Then, we study the uplink performance and develop an efficient iterative algorithm that jointly optimizes the repeater gains, user transmit powers, and receive combining weights to maximize the weighted sum rate while ensuring system stability. Numerical results corroborate our theoretical findings and show that the repeaters can significantly improve the system performance, both in sub-6 GHz and millimeter-wave bands. The results also warrant careful deployment to fully realize the benefits of repeaters, for example, by ensuring a high probability of line-of-sight links between repeaters and the base station.</description>

      <title>Unique Decoding of Extended Subcodes of GRS Codes Using Error-Correcting Pairs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extended Han-Zhang codes are a class of linear codes where each code is either a non-generalized Reed-Solomon (non-GRS) maximum distance separable (MDS) code or a near MDS (NMDS) code. They have important applications in communication, cryptography, and storage systems. While many algebraic properties and explicit constructions of extended Han-Zhang codes have been well studied in the literature, their decoding has been unexplored. In this paper, we focus on their decoding problems in terms of $\ell$-error-correcting pairs ($\ell$-ECPs) and deep holes. On the one hand, we determine the existence and specific forms of their $\ell$-ECPs, and further present an explicit decoding algorithm for extended Han-Zhang codes based on these $\ell$-ECPs, which can correct up to $\ell$ errors in polynomial time, with $\ell$ about half of the minimum distance. On the other hand, we determine the covering radius of extended Han-Zhang codes and characterize two classes of their deep holes, which are closely related to the maximum-likelihood decoding method. By employing these deep holes, we also construct more non-GRS MDS codes with larger lengths and dimensions, and discuss the monomial equivalence between them and the well-known Roth-Lempel codes. Some concrete examples are also given to support these results.</description>

      <title>Multi-Twisted Generalized Reed-Solomon Codes: Structure, Properties, and Constructions</title>

Abstract: Maximum distance separable (in short, MDS), near MDS (in short, NMDS), and self-orthogonal codes play a pivotal role in algebraic coding theory, particularly in applications such as quantum communications and secret sharing scheme. Recently, the construction of non-generalized Reed-Solomon (in short, non-GRS) codes has emerged as a significant research frontier. This paper presents a systematic investigation into a generalized class of $(\mathcal{L}, \mathcal{P})$-twisted generalized Reed-Solomon (TGRS) codes characterized by $\ell$ twists, extending the structures previously introduced by Beelen et al. and Hu et al.. We first derive the explicit parity-check matrices for these codes by analyzing the properties of symmetric polynomials. Based on this algebraic framework, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the self-orthogonality of the proposed codes, generalizing several recent results. Leveraging these self-orthogonal structures, we construct new families of LCD MDS codes that offer greater flexibility in code length compared to existing literature. Furthermore, we provide a characterization of the NMDS property for these codes, offering a partial solution to the open problem concerning general $(\mathcal{L}, \mathcal{P})$-TGRS codes posed by Hu et al. (2025). Finally, we rigorously prove that these codes are of non-GRS type when $2k &gt; n$, providing an improvement over previous bounds. Theoretical constructions are validated through numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Breaking AR's Sampling Bottleneck: Provable Acceleration via Diffusion Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for modern generative modeling, demonstrating strong potential for large language models (LLMs). Unlike conventional autoregressive (AR) models that generate tokens sequentially, diffusion models allow for parallel sampling, offering a promising path to accelerate generation and eliminate the left-to-right generation constraints. Despite their empirical success, theoretical understandings of diffusion language models remain underdeveloped. In this work, we develop convergence guarantees for diffusion language models from an information-theoretic perspective. Our analysis demonstrates that the sampling error, measured by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, decays inversely with the number of iterations $T$ and scales linearly with the mutual information between tokens in the target text sequence. Crucially, our theory covers the regime $T&lt;L$, where $L$ is the text sequence length. This justifies that high-quality samples can be generated with fewer iterations than $L$, thereby breaking the fundamental sampling bottleneck of $L$ steps required by AR models. We further establish matching upper and lower bounds, up to some constant factor, that shows the tightness of our convergence analysis. These results offer novel theoretical insights into the practical effectiveness of diffusion language models.</description>

      <title>From Timestamps to Versions: Version AoI in Single- and Multi-Hop Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Timely and informative data dissemination in communication networks is essential for enhancing system performance and energy efficiency, as it reduces the transmission of outdated or redundant data. Timeliness metrics, such as Age of Information (AoI), effectively quantify data freshness; however, these metrics fail to account for the intrinsic informativeness of the content itself. To address this limitation, content-based metrics have been proposed that combine both timeliness and informativeness. Nevertheless, existing studies have predominantly focused on evaluating average metric values, leaving the complete distribution-particularly in multi-hop network scenarios-largely unexplored. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the stationary distribution of the Version Age of Information (VAoI), a content-based metric, under various scheduling policies, including randomized stationary, uniform, and threshold-based policies, with transmission constraints in single-hop and multi-hop networks. We derive closed-form expressions for the stationary distribution and average VAoI under these scheduling approaches. Furthermore, for threshold-based scheduling, we analytically determine the optimal threshold value that minimizes VAoI and derive the corresponding optimal VAoI in closed form. Numerical evaluations verify our analytical findings, providing valuable insights into leveraging VAoI in the design of efficient communication networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06489v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parallel Proof-of-Work (PoW) protocols have been suggested in the literature to improve the safety guarantees, transaction throughput and confirmation latencies of Nakamoto consensus. In this work, we first consider the existing parallel PoW protocols and develop hard-coded incentive attack structures. Our theoretical results and simulations show that the existing parallel PoW protocols are more vulnerable to incentive attacks than the Nakamoto consensus, e.g., attacks have smaller profitability threshold and they result in higher relative rewards. Next, we introduce a voting-based semi-parallel PoW protocol that outperforms both Nakamoto consensus and the existing parallel PoW protocols from most practical perspectives such as communication overheads, throughput, transaction conflicts, incentive compatibility of the protocol as well as a fair distribution of transaction fees among the voters and the leaders. We use state-of-the-art analysis to evaluate the consistency of the protocol and consider Markov decision process (MDP) models to substantiate our claims about the resilience of our protocol against incentive attacks.</description>

      <title>Why Does Stochastic Gradient Descent Slow Down in Low-Precision Training?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07142v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-precision training has become crucial for reducing the computational and memory costs of large-scale deep learning. However, quantizing gradients introduces magnitude shrinkage, which can change how stochastic gradient descent (SGD) converges. In this study, we explore SGD convergence under a gradient shrinkage model, where each stochastic gradient is scaled by a factor \( q_k \in (0,1] \). We show that this shrinkage affect the usual stepsize \( \mu_k \) with an effective stepsize \( \mu_k q_k \), slowing convergence when \( q_{\min} &lt; 1 \). With typical smoothness and bounded-variance assumptions, we prove that low-precision SGD still converges, but at a slower pace set by \( q_{\min} \), and with a higher steady error level due to quantization effects. We analyze theoretically how lower numerical precision slows training by treating it as gradient shrinkage within the standard SGD convergence setup.</description>

      <title>Filter-and-Attend: Wireless Channel Foundation Model with Noise-Plus-Interference Suppression Structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wireless channel foundation model (WCFM) is a task-agnostic AI model that is pre-trained to learn a universal channel representation for a wide range of communications and sensing tasks. While existing works on WCFM have demonstrated its great potentials in various downstream tasks, the models are all trained using perfect (i.e., error-free and complete) channel information state (CSI) data. In practical systems, however, only degraded CSI obtained from pilot-based channel estimation is accessible, leading to distorted channel representations and performance degradation in downstream tasks for some real-world environments with severe noise and interference. To address this issue, this paper proposes a new paradigm for WCFM, termed as Filter-and-Attend. In this paradigm, Filter refers to explicitly suppressing noise-plus-interference (NPI) in the received signals, while Attend means performing correlation-aware CSI completion and feature extraction using attention mechanism. Specifically, an enhanced WCFM architecture is developed. In this architecture, coarse estimates of the CSIs are first obtained and exploited to construct two projection matrices that extract NPI components in the received signals, which are further processed and removed by a subtraction module. The filtered signal is subsequently passed through a CSI completion network to get a clean CSI for feature extraction. Simulation results demonstrated that compared to the state-of-the-art solutions, WCFM with NPI suppression structure achieves improved performance on various downstream tasks including time-domain channel prediction, frequency-domain channel prediction, and localization.</description>

      <title>Taming Barren Plateaus in Arbitrary Parameterized Quantum Circuits without Sacrificing Expressibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13408v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms based on parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) have enabled a wide range of applications on near-term quantum devices. However, existing PQC architectures face several challenges, among which the ``barren plateaus" phenomenon is particularly prominent. In such cases, the loss function concentrates exponentially with increasing system size, thereby hindering effective parameter optimization. To address this challenge, we propose a general and hardware-efficient method for eliminating barren plateaus in an arbitrary PQC. Specifically, our approach achieves this by inserting a layer of easily implementable quantum channels into the original PQC, each channel requiring only one ancilla qubit and four additional gates, yielding a modified PQC (MPQC) that is provably at least as expressive as the original PQC and, under mild assumptions, is guaranteed to be free from barren plateaus. Furthermore, by appropriately adjusting the structure of MPQCs, we rigorously prove that any parameter in the original PQC can be made trainable. Importantly, the absence of barren plateaus in MPQCs is robust against realistic noise, making our approach directly applicable to near-term quantum hardware. Numerical simulations demonstrate that MPQC effectively eliminates barren plateaus in PQCs for preparing thermal states of systems with up to 100 qubits and 2400 layers. Furthermore, in end-to-end simulations, MPQC significantly outperforms PQC in finding the ground-state energy of a complex Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Timely Information Updating for Mobile Devices Without and With ML Advice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates an information update system in which a mobile device monitors a physical process and sends status updates to an access point (AP). A fundamental trade-off arises between the timeliness of the information maintained at the AP and the update cost incurred at the device. To address this trade-off, we propose an online algorithm that determines when to transmit updates using only available observations. The proposed algorithm asymptotically achieves the optimal competitive ratio against an adversary that can simultaneously manipulate multiple sources of uncertainty, including the operation duration, information staleness, update cost, and update opportunities. Furthermore, by incorporating machine learning (ML) advice of unknown reliability into the design, we develop an ML-augmented algorithm that asymptotically attains the optimal consistency-robustness trade-off, even when the adversary can additionally corrupt the ML advice. The optimal competitive ratio scales linearly with the range of update costs, but is unaffected by other sources of uncertainty. Moreover, an optimal competitive online algorithm exhibits a threshold-like response to the ML advice: it either fully trusts or completely ignores the ML advice, as partially trusting the advice cannot improve the consistency without severely degrading the robustness. Extensive simulations in stochastic settings further validate the theoretical findings in the adversarial environment.</description>

      <title>Avoiding the Price of Adaptivity: Inference in Linear Contextual Bandits via Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Statistical inference in contextual bandits is challenging due to the adaptive, non-i.i.d. nature of the data. A growing body of work shows that classical least-squares inference can fail under adaptive sampling, and that valid confidence intervals for linear functionals typically require an inflation of order $\sqrt{d \log T}$. This phenomenon -- often termed the price of adaptivity -- reflects the intrinsic difficulty of reliable inference under general contextual bandit policies. A key structural condition that overcomes this limitation is the stability condition of Lai and Wei, which requires the empirical feature covariance to converge to a deterministic limit. When stability holds, the ordinary least-squares estimator satisfies a central limit theorem, and classical Wald-type confidence intervals remain asymptotically valid under adaptation, without incurring the $\sqrt{d \log T}$ price of adaptivity.
  In this paper, we propose and analyze a regularized EXP4 algorithm for linear contextual bandits. Our first main result shows that this procedure satisfies the Lai--Wei stability condition and therefore admits valid Wald-type confidence intervals for linear functionals. We additionally provide quantitative rates of convergence in the associated central limit theorem. Our second result establishes that the same algorithm achieves regret guarantees that are minimax optimal up to logarithmic factors, demonstrating that stability and statistical efficiency can coexist within a single contextual bandit method. As an application of our theory, we show how it can be used to construct confidence intervals for the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) under adaptively collected data. Finally, we complement our theory with simulations illustrating the empirical normality of the resulting estimators and the sharpness of the corresponding confidence intervals.</description>

      <title>Modern Neuromorphic AI: From Intra-Token to Inter-Token Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) has brought novel data processing and generative capabilities but also escalating energy requirements. This challenge motivates renewed interest in neuromorphic computing principles, which promise brain-like efficiency through discrete and sparse activations, recurrent dynamics, and non-linear feedback. In fact, modern AI architectures increasingly embody neuromorphic principles through heavily quantized activations, state-space dynamics, and sparse attention mechanisms. This paper elaborates on the connections between neuromorphic models, state-space models, and transformer architectures through the lens of the distinction between intra-token processing and inter-token processing. Most early work on neuromorphic AI was based on spiking neural networks (SNNs) for intra-token processing, i.e., for transformations involving multiple channels, or features, of the same vector input, such as the pixels of an image. In contrast, more recent research has explored how neuromorphic principles can be leveraged to design efficient inter-token processing methods, which selectively combine different information elements depending on their contextual relevance. Implementing associative memorization mechanisms, these approaches leverage state-space dynamics or sparse self-attention. Along with a systematic presentation of modern neuromorphic AI models through the lens of intra-token and inter-token processing, training methodologies for neuromorphic AI models are also reviewed. These range from surrogate gradients leveraging parallel convolutional processing to local learning rules based on reinforcement learning mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Surprisal and Metaphor Novelty: Moderate Correlations and Divergent Scaling Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Novel metaphor comprehension involves complex semantic processes and linguistic creativity, making it an interesting task for studying language models (LMs). This study investigates whether surprisal, a probabilistic measure of predictability in LMs, correlates with different metaphor novelty datasets. We analyse surprisal from 16 LM variants on corpus-based and synthetic metaphor novelty datasets. We explore a cloze-style surprisal method that conditions on full-sentence context. Results show that LMs yield significant moderate correlations with scores/labels of metaphor novelty. We further identify divergent scaling patterns: on corpus-based data, correlation strength decreases with model size (inverse scaling effect), whereas on synthetic data it increases (Quality-Power Hypothesis). We conclude that while surprisal can partially account for annotations of metaphor novelty, it remains a limited metric of linguistic creativity.</description>
