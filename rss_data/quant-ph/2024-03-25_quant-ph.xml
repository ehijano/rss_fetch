      <title>Depth scaling of unstructured search via quantum approximate optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms have become the de facto model for current quantum computations. A prominent example of such algorithms -- the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) -- was originally designed for combinatorial optimization tasks, but has been shown to be successful for a variety of other problems. However, for most of these problems the optimal circuit depth remains unknown. One such problem is unstructured search which consists on finding a particular bit string, or equivalently, preparing a state of high overlap with a target state. To bound the optimal QAOA depth for such problem we build on its known solution in a continuous time quantum walk (CTQW). We trotterize a CTQW to recover a QAOA sequence, and employ recent advances on the theory of Trotter formulas to bound the query complexity (circuit depth) needed to prepare a state of almost perfect overlap with the target state. The obtained complexity exceeds the Grover's algorithm complexity $O\left(N^\frac{1}{2}\right)$, but remains smaller than $O \left(N^{\frac{1}{2}+c}\right)$ for any $c&gt;0$, which shows quantum advantage of QAOA over classical solutions. We verify our analytical predictions by numerical simulations of up to 68 qubits, which demonstrate that our result overestimates the number of QAOA layers resulting from a trotterized CTQW by at most a polynomial factor.</description>

      <title>Galilean relativity and wave-particle duality imply the Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the Schr\"odinger equation can be derived assuming the Galilean covariance of a generic wave equation and the validity of the de Broglie's wave-particle duality hypothesis. We also obtain from this set of assumptions the transformation law for the wave function under a Galilean boost and prove that complex wave functions are unavoidable for a consistent description of a physical system. The extension to the relativistic domain of the above analysis is also provided. We show that Lorentz covariance and wave-particle duality are consistent with two different transformation laws for the wave function under a Lorentz boost. This leads to two different wave equations, namely, the Klein-Gordon equation and the Lorentz covariant Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

      <title>Secure communication based on sensing of undetected photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a secure optical communication protocol that harnesses quantum correlation within entangled photon pairs. A message written by acting on one of the photons can be read by exclusive measurements of the other photon of the pair. In this scheme a bright, meaningless optical beam hides the message rendering it inaccessible to potential eavesdroppers. Unlike traditional methods our approach only affects unauthorized users, fundamentally limiting their access to the communication channel. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our protocol by achieving secure communication through both amplitude and phase modulation. We successfully employ this technique for the secure transfer of an image. We demonstrate data exchange speed of up to 8 bits per second, along with the corresponding eye diagrams.</description>

      <title>Multipartite entanglement distribution in a topological photonic network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the ongoing effort towards a scalable quantum computer, multiple technologies have been proposed. Some of them exploit topological materials to process quantum information. In this work, we propose a lattice of photonic cavities with alternating hoppings to create a modified multidomain SSH chain, that is, a sequence of topological insulators made from chains of dimers. A qubit is then coupled to each boundary. We show this system is well suited for quantum information processing because topological transfer of photons through this one-dimensional lattice can entangle any set of qubits on demand, providing a scalable quantum platform. We verify this claim evaluating entanglement measures and witnesses proving that bipartite and multipartite entanglement is produced, even in the presence of some disorder.</description>

      <title>Phase estimation via coherent and photon-catalyzed squeezed vacuum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The research focused on enhancing the measurement accuracy through the use of non-Gaussian states has garnered increasing attention. In this study, we propose a scheme to input the coherent state mixed with photon-catalyzed squeezed vacuum state into the Mach-Zender interferometer to enhance phase measurement accuracy. The findings demonstrate that photon catalysis, particularly multi-photon catalysis, can effectively improve the phase sensitivity of parity detection and the quantum Fisher information. Moreover, the situation of photon losses in practical measurement was studied. The results indicate that external dissipation has a greater influence on phase sensitivity than the internal dissipation. Compared to input coherent state mixed with squeezed vacuum state, the utilization of coherent state mixed photon-catalyzed squeezed vacuum state, particularly the mixed multi-photon catalyzed squeezed vacuum state as input, can enhance the phase sensitivity and quantum Fisher information. Furthermore, the phase measurement accuracy can exceed the standard quantum limit, and even surpass the Heisenberg limit. This research is expected to significantly contribute to quantum precision measurement.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control of Spin Qudits Subject to Decoherence Using Amplitude-and-Frequency-Constrained Pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum optimal control theory (QOCT) can be used to design the shape of electromagnetic pulses that implement operations on quantum devices. By using non-trivially shaped waveforms, gates can be made significantly faster than those built by concatenating monochromatic pulses. Recently, we applied this technique to the control of molecular spin qudits modelled with Schr\"odinger's equation and showed it can speed up operations, helping mitigate the effects of decoherence [Phys. Rev. Appl. {\bf 17}, 064028 (2022)]. However, short gate times result in large optimal pulse amplitudes, which may not be experimentally accessible. Introducing bounds to the amplitudes then unavoidably leads to longer operation times, for which decoherence can no longer be neglected. Here, we study how to improve this procedure by applying QOCT on top of Lindblad's equation, to design control pulses accounting for decoherence already in the optimization process. In addition, we introduce a formulation that allows us to bound the maximum amplitude and frequency of the signals, which are the typical limitations of waveform generators. The pulses we obtain consistently enhance operation fidelities compared to those achieved with Schr\"odinger's equation across various target gates and durations, demonstrating the flexibility and robustness of our method. The improvement is larger the shorter the spin coherence time $T_{2}$.</description>

      <title>Quantum state transfer performance of Heisenberg spin chains with site-dependent interactions designed using a generic genetic algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing a good transfer channel for arbitrary quantum states in spin chains implies optimizing a cost function, usually the averaged fidelity of transmission. The fidelity of transmission measures how much the transferred state resembles the state prepared at the beginning of the transfer protocol. When averaged over all the possible initial states, the figure of merit quantifies the quality of the protocol. There are proposals for optimizing a given Hamiltonian to accomplish a particular task. The transfer of quantum states is one of them. In particular, we consider the design of Heisenberg spin chains using a genetic algorithm. This very efficient algorithm allows us to study different properties of Hamiltonians with good to excellent transfer ability. One apparent drawback of using a random search method is that it results in exchange coefficient strengths that change abruptly from site to site. Modifying the cost function, we obtain Hamiltonians with exchange coefficients varying smoothly along the chain length. Our results show that the smoothed Hamiltonians have the same, or less, transfer ability than the rough ones, and both kinds show similar robustness against static disorder. By studying the statistical properties of the eigenvalues of Hamiltonians with varying transfer abilities, we determine the ensemble of random matrices to which the spectra belong.</description>

      <title>Generally covariant geometric momentum and geometric potential for a Dirac fermion on a two-dimensional hypersurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometric momentum is the proper momentum for a moving particle constrained on a curved surface, which depends on the outer curvature and has observable effects. In the context of multi-component quantum states, geometric momentum should be rewritten as generally covariant geometric momentum. For a Dirac fermion constrained on a two-dimensional hypersurface, we give the generally covariant geometric momentum, and show that on the pseudosphere and the helical surface there exist no curvature-induced geometric potentials. These results verify that the dynamical quantization conditions are effective in dealing with constrained systems on hypersurfaces, and one could obtain the generally convariant geometric momentum and the geometric potential of a spin particle constrained on surfaces with definite parametric equations.</description>

      <title>Hybrid classical-quantum image processing via polar Walsh basis functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel hybrid classical-quantum approach for image processing based on polar Walsh basis functions. Using this approach, we present an algorithm for the removal of the circular banding noise (including Airy pattern noise) and the azimuthal banding noise. This approach is based on a formulation of Walsh basis functions in polar coordinates for image representations. This approach also builds upon an earlier work on a hybrid classical-quantum algorithm for Walsh-Hadamard transforms. We provide two kinds of polar representations using uniform area measure and uniform radial measure. Effective smoothening and interpolating techniques are devised relevant to the transformations between Cartesian and polar coordinates, mitigating the challenges posed by the non-injectivity of the transformation in the context of digital images. The hybrid classical-quantum approach presented here involves an algorithm for Walsh-Hadamard transforms, which has a lower computational complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N)$ compared to the well-known classical Fast Walsh-Hadamard Transform, which has a computational complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N \log_2 N)$. We demonstrated the applicability of our approach through computational examples involving the removal of the circular banding noise (including Airy pattern noise) and the azimuthal banding noise.</description>

      <title>Many-hypercube codes: High-rate quantum error-correcting codes for high-performance fault-tolerant quantum computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional approaches to quantum error correction for fault-tolerant quantum computation are based on encoding a single logical qubit into many physical qubits, resulting in asymptotically zero encoding rates and therefore huge resource overheads. To overcome this issue, high-rate quantum codes, such as quantum low-density parity-check codes, have been studied over the past decade. However, such codes have complex structure, making it difficult to perform logical gate operations in parallel without sacrificing their advantage. Observing the simple structure and high rates of quantum error-detecting codes, here we propose concatenated high-rate quantum error-detecting codes as a new family of high-rate quantum codes. Their simple structure allows for a geometrical interpretation using hypercubes, each of which corresponds to a logical qubit. We thus call them many-hypercube codes. The encoding rate is remarkably high, e.g., 30% (64 logical qubits are encoded into 216 physical qubits). Developing a dedicated high-performance decoder, we achieve high error thresholds even in a circuit-level noise model. Logical gate operations are also parallelizable. Thus, the many-hypercube codes will pave the way to high-performance fault-tolerant quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Markovian dynamics for a quantum/classical system and quantum trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum trajectory techniques have been used in the theory of open systems as a starting point for numerical computations and to describe the monitoring of a quantum system in continuous time. Here we extend this technique and use it to develop a general approach to the dynamics of quantum/classical hybrid systems. By using two coupled stochastic differential equations, we can describe a classical component and a quantum one which have their own intrinsic dynamics and which interact with each other. A mathematically rigorous construction is given, under the restriction of having a Markovian joint dynamics and of involving only bounded operators on the Hilbert space of the quantum component. An important feature is that, if the interaction allows for a flow of information from the quantum component to the classical one, necessarily the dynamics is dissipative. We show also how this theory is connected to a suitable hybrid dynamical semigroup, which reduces to a quantum dynamical semigroup in the purely quantum case and includes Liouville and Kolmogorov-Fokker-Plank equations in the purely classical case. Moreover, this semigroup allows to compare the proposed stochastic dynamics with various other proposals based on hybrid master equations. Some simple example are constructed in order to show the variety of physical behaviours which can be described; in particular, a model presenting hidden entanglement is introduced.</description>

      <title>beSnake: A routing algorithm for scalable spin-qubit architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum computing devices become larger with respect to the number of qubits, the realization of two-qubit interactions becomes more challenging, necessitating innovative and scalable qubit routing solutions. In this work, we introduce beSnake, a novel algorithm specifically designed to address the intricate qubit routing challenges in scalable spin-qubit architectures. The algorithm utilizes shuttle operations that physically move a qubit to an adjacent, unoccupied quantum dot. Unlike traditional methods in superconducting architectures that solely rely on SWAP operations, beSnake incorporates those shuttle operations to optimize the execution time of the circuits and achieve higher operational fidelity and quicker computation times of the routing task itself. By employing a breadth-first search approach, beSnake effectively manages the restrictions created by diverse topologies and positions of qubits. It also dynamically tackles parallelized routing tasks with multiple qubits that act as obstacles with the option to adjust the level of optimization. Our simulations demonstrate beSnake's advantage over an existing routing solution for random circuits and real quantum algorithms with up to $1,000$ qubits. It shows on average an up to $80\%$ and $54\%$ improvement in gate overhead and depth overhead, respectively, and up to $8.33$ times faster routing time.</description>

      <title>Coupler-Assisted Leakage Reduction for Scalable Quantum Error Correction with Superconducting Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting qubits are a promising platform for building fault-tolerant quantum computers, with recent achievement showing the suppression of logical error with increasing code size. However, leakage into non-computational states, a common issue in practical quantum systems including superconducting circuits, introduces correlated errors that undermine QEC scalability. Here, we propose and demonstrate a leakage reduction scheme utilizing tunable couplers, a widely adopted ingredient in large-scale superconducting quantum processors. Leveraging the strong frequency tunability of the couplers and stray interaction between the couplers and readout resonators, we eliminate state leakage on the couplers, thus suppressing space-correlated errors caused by population propagation among the couplers. Assisted by the couplers, we further reduce leakage to higher qubit levels with high efficiency (98.1%) and low error rate on the computational subspace (0.58%), suppressing time-correlated errors during QEC cycles. The performance of our scheme demonstrates its potential as an indispensable building block for scalable QEC with superconducting qubits.</description>

      <title>The Road to Near-Capacity CV-QKD Reconciliation: An FEC-Agnostic Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New near-capacity continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) reconciliation schemes are proposed, where both the authenticated classical channel (ClC) and the quantum channel (QuC) for QKD are protected by separate forward error correction (FEC) coding schemes. More explicitly, a new codeword-based - rather than syndrome-based - QKD reconciliation scheme is proposed, where Alice sends an FEC-protected codeword to Bob through a ClC, while Bob sends a separate FEC protected codeword to Alice through a QuC. Upon decoding the codeword received from the other side, the final key is obtained by applying a simple modulo-2 operation to the local codeword and the decoded remote codeword. As a result, first of all, the proposed codeword-based QKD reconciliation system ensures protection of both the QuC and of the ClC. Secondly, the proposed system has a similar complexity at both sides, where both Alice and Bob have an FEC encoder and an FEC decoder. Thirdly, the proposed system makes QKD reconciliation compatible with a wide range of FEC schemes, including polar codes, CCs and irregular convolutional codes (IRCCs), where a near-capacity performance can be achieved for both the QuC and for the ClC.Our simulation results demonstrate that thanks to the proposed regime, the performance improvements of the QuC and of the ClC benefit each other, hence leading to an improved secret key rate (SKR) that inches closer to both the Pirandola-Laurenza-Ottaviani-Banchi (PLOB) bound and to the maximum achieveable rate bound.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A study about the reflection and transmission of an electromagnetic pulse through a slab doped with four-level atomic system has been presented. The doped atoms are considered to be in N-configuration with a pump field and a weak probe field. An additional control field is also applied to manipulate the Raman gain of the atomic medium. The propagation of transmitted and reflected pulses at different control field strengths and different slab thickness has been studied. It is found that the transmitted and reflected pulses can be simultaneously subluminal or superluminal. These pulses can be controlled from subluminal to superluminal by adjusting the strength of the control field</description>

Abstract: Impurity $Fe^{3+}$ ion electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy using multiple dielectric modes in a $SrTiO_3$ dielectric resonator has been performed with a tuneable DC magnetic field of up to $1.6~T$. The $Ti^{4+}(d^0)$ ion is substituted by $Fe^{3+}$ ion forming $FeO_6$ octahedral complex with an iron-oxygen-vacancy $(Fe^{3+}-V_O)$. In such a metal-ligand complex, a giant g-factor of $g_{\scriptscriptstyle\parallel F} = 5.51$ was observed in the ferroelectric phase at $20~mK$. The the change of $Fe^{3+}$ ion center-symmetry in the $FeO_6$ complex as a soft-mode characteristics of ferroelectric phase transition and the influences of iron-oxygen-vacancy $(Fe^{3+}-V_O)$, interactively sensitive to asymmetry in the octahedral rotational parameter $\Phi$ in $SrTi0_3$.</description>

      <title>Aggregate Frequency Width, Nuclear Hyperfine Coupling and Jahn-Teller Effect of $Cu^{2+}$ Impurity Ion ESR in $SrLaAlO_4$ Dielectric Resonator at $20$ Millikelvin</title>

Abstract: The impurity paramagnetic ion, $Cu^{2+}$ substitutes $Al$ in the $SrLaAlO_4$ single crystal lattice, this results in a $CuO_6$ elongated octahedron, the resulting measured g-factors shows four-fold axes variation condition. The aggregate frequency width of the electron spin resonance with the required minimum level of impurity concentration has been evaluated in single crystal $SrLaAlO_4$ at $20$ millikelvin. Measured parallel hyperfine constants, $A_{\scriptscriptstyle\parallel Cu}$, were determined to be $-155.7\times10^{-4}~cm^{-1},~ -163.0\times10^{-4}~cm^{-1},~ -178.3\times10^{-4}~cm^{-1} $ and$~-211.1\times10^{-4}~cm^{-1}$ at $9.072~GHz~(WGH_{4,1,1})$ for the nuclear magnetic quantum number $M_I=+\frac{3}{2},+\frac{1}{2},-\frac{1}{2}$,~and$-\frac{3}{2}$ respectively. The anisotropy of the hyperfine structure reveals a characteristics of static Jahn-Teller effect. The second-order-anisotropy-term, $\sim (\frac{spin-orbit~coupling}{10D_q})^2$, is significant and can not be disregarded, with the local strain dominating over the observed Zeeman-anisotropy-energy difference. The Bohr electron magneton, $\beta=9.23\times 10^{-24} JT^{-1}$, (within $-0.43\%$ so-called experimental error) has been found using the measured spin-Hamiltonian parameters. Measured nuclear dipolar hyperfine structure parameter $P_{\scriptscriptstyle\parallel}=12.3\times10^{-4}~cm^{-1}$ shows that the mean inverse third power of the electron distance from the nucleus is $\langle r^{-3}_q\rangle\simeq 5.23$ a.u. for $Cu^{2+}$ ion in the substituted $Al^{3+}$ ion site assuming nuclear electric quadruple moment $Q=-0.211$ barn.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Quantum Entanglement in Bipartite Systems: Leveraging Optimal Control and Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement stands at the forefront of quantum information science, heralding new paradigms in quantum communication, computation, and cryptography. This paper introduces a quantum optimal control approach by focusing on entanglement measures rather than targeting predefined maximally entangled states. Leveraging the indirect Pontryagin Minimum Principle, we formulate an optimal control problem centered on maximizing an enhanced lower bound of the entanglement measure within a shortest timeframe in the presence of input constraints. We derive optimality conditions based on Pontryagin's Minimum Principle tailored for a matrix-valued dynamic control system and tackle the resulting boundary value problem through a Physics-Informed Neural Network, which is adept at handling differential matrix equations. The proposed strategy not only refines the process of generating entangled states but also introduces a method with increased sensitivity in detecting entangled states, thereby overcoming the limitations of conventional concurrence estimation.</description>

      <title>Manipulating the direction of one-way steering in an optomechanical ring cavity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum steering refers to the apparent possibility of exploiting nonseparable quantum correlations to remotely influence the quantum state of an observer via local measurements. Different from entanglement and Bell nonlocality, quantum steering exhibits an inherent asymmetric property, which makes it relevant for many asymmetric quantum information processing tasks. Here, we study Gaussian quantum steering between two mechanical modes in an optomechanical ring cavity. Using experimentally feasible parameters, we show that the state of the two considered modes can exhibit two-way steering and even one-way steering. Instead of using unbalanced losses or noises, we propose a simple practical way to control the direction of one-way steering. A comparative study between the steering and entanglement of the studied modes shows that both steering and entanglement undergo a sudden death-like behavior. In particular, steering is found more fragile against thermal noise remaining constantly upper bounded by entanglement. The proposed scheme may be meaningful for one-sided device-independent quantum key distribution, where the security of such protocol depends fundamentally on the direction of steering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building large-scale quantum communication networks has its unique challenges. Here, we demonstrate that a network-wide synergistic usage of quantum memories distributed in a quantum communication network offers a fundamental advantage. We first map the problem of quantum communication with local usage of memories into a classical continuum percolation model. Then, we show that this mapping can be improved through a cooperation of entanglement distillation and relay protocols via remote access to distributed memories. This improved mapping, which we term $\alpha$-percolation, can be formulated in terms of graph-merging rules, analogous to the decimation rules of the renormalization group treatment of disordered quantum magnets. These rules can be performed in any order, yielding the same optimal result, which is characterized by the emergence of a ``positive feedback'' mechanism and the formation of spatially disconnected ``hopping'' communication components -- both marking significant improvements in quantum network connectivity.</description>

Abstract: A recently proposed variational quantum algorithm has expanded the horizon of variational quantum computing to nonlinear physics and fluid dynamics. In this work, we employ this algorithm to find the ground state of the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation with a quadratic potential and implement it on the cloud superconducting quantum processors. We analyze the expressivity of real-amplitude ansatz to capture the ground state of the nonlinear system across various interaction regimes characterized by varying strengths of nonlinearity. Our investigation reveals that although quantum hardware noise impairs the evaluation of the energy cost function, small instances of the problem consistently converge to the ground state. We implement a variety of problem instances on IBM Q devices and report analogous discrepancies in the energy cost function evaluation attributable to quantum hardware noise. The latter are absent in the state fidelity estimation. Our comprehensive analysis offers valuable insights into the practical implementation and advancement of the variational algorithms for nonlinear quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Certifiable lower bounds of Wigner negativity volume and non-Gaussian entanglement with conditional displacement gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In circuit and cavity quantum electrodynamics devices where control qubits are dispersively coupled to high quality-factor cavities, characteristic functions of cavity states can be directly probed with echoed conditional displacement (ECD) gates. In this work, I propose a method to certify non-Gaussian entanglement between cavities using only ECD gates and qubit readouts. The ECD witness arises from an application of Bochner's theorem to a surprising connection between two negativities: that of the reduced Wigner function, and that of the partial transpose. Non-Gaussian entanglement of some common states, like photon-subtracted two-mode squeezed vacua and entangled cats, can be detected by measuring as few as four points of the characteristic function. Furthermore, the expectation value of the witness is a simultaneous lower bound to the Wigner negativity volume and a geometric measure of entanglement conjectured to be the partial transpose negativity. Both negativities are strong monotones of non-Gaussianity and entanglement respectively, so the ECD witness provides experimentally-accessible lower bounds to quantities related to these monotones without the need for tomography on the cavity states.</description>

      <title>One-Shot Non-Catalytic Distributed Purity Distillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pure states are an important resource in many quantum information processing protocols. However, even making a fixed pure state, say $|0\rangle$, in the laboratory requires a considerable amount of effort. Often one ends up with a mixed state $\rho$ whose classical description is nevertheless known. Hence it is important to develop protocols that extract a fixed pure state from a known mixed state. In this work, we study the problem of extracting a fixed pure state $|0\rangle^{A'} |0\rangle^{B'}$ from a known pure state $\rho^{AB}$ distributed between two parties $A$ and $B$. Here, $A'$, $B'$ are subspaces of $A$, $B$ and the total amount of purity extracted is $\log |A'| + \log |B'|$. The parties can borrow local pure ancilla, apply local unitary operations and send a message from $A$ to $B$ through a dephasing channel. If local pure ancilla is borrowed, it must be subtracted in order to properly account for the purity extracted. We obtain the most efficient achievable bounds on one shot distributed purity extraction, in terms of the rate of local ancilla borrowed by the protocol, while distilling pure qubits at the best known rate. Our protocols borrow little to no local pure ancilla. Our bounds improve upon the existing bounds for this problem in both one shot as well as asymptotic iid settings. In particular they subsume all the asymptotic iid results of Devetak and Krovi-Devetak. In addition, we derive upper bounds for the rate of distillation in the one shot setting, which nearly match our achievable bounds.</description>

Abstract: Spin ensembles play a pivotal role in various quantum applications such as metrology and simulating many-body physics. Recent research has proposed utilizing spin cat states to encode logical quantum information, with potentially logical lifetimes on the order of seconds via enhanced collective interactions that scale with system size. We investigate the dynamics of spin cat states under inhomogeneous broadening, revealing a phenomenon termed `parity-sensitive inhomogeneous dephasing': odd cat states are significantly more susceptible to inhomogeneous dephasing compared to even cat states due to parity symmetry. Additionally, from a mean-field analysis of the driven-dissipative dynamics, we identify a synchronization phase transition wherein the ensemble becomes completely dephased beyond a critical inhomogeneous linewidth. Our findings shed light on the stability of collective spin states, important for advancing quantum technologies.</description>

Abstract: A recent study shows that an emergent evolution dimension, in addition to time, can be induced if the quantum system depends on a continuous parameter. The evolution in the emergent evolution dimension is described by a parallel transport, the closest fiber bundle analog to a geodesic in (pseudo-)Riemannian geometry. Nevertheless, the evolution in the emergent dimension often exhibits some singular behaviors at critical points. In this work, we demonstrate that these singularities can be indications of quantum phase transitions. We then show that these singularities, like those at the black hole event horizon, can be removed locally.</description>

      <title>Vector Ising Spin Annealer for Minimizing Ising Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Vector Ising Spin Annealer (VISA), a framework in gain-based computing that harnesses light-matter interactions to solve complex optimization problems encoded in spin Hamiltonians. Traditional driven-dissipative systems often select excited states due to limitations in spin movement. VISA transcends these constraints by enabling spins to operate in a three-dimensional space, offering a robust solution to minimize Ising Hamiltonians effectively. Our comparative analysis reveals VISA's superior performance over conventional single-dimension spin optimizers, demonstrating its ability to bridge substantial energy barriers in complex landscapes. Through detailed studies on cyclic and random graphs, we show VISA's proficiency in dynamically evolving the energy landscape with time-dependent gain and penalty annealing, illustrating its potential to redefine optimization in physical systems.</description>

      <title>Boson sampling enhanced quantum chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we give a new variational quantum algorithm for solving electronic structure problems of molecules using only linear quantum optical systems. The variational ansatz we proposed is a hybrid of non-interacting Boson dynamics and classical computational chemistry methods, specifically, the Hartree-Fock method and the Configuration Interaction method. The Boson part is built by a linear optical interferometer which is easier to realize compared with the well-known Unitary Coupled Cluster (UCC) ansatz composed of quantum gates in conventional VQE and the classical part is merely classical processing acting on the Hamiltonian. We called such ansatzes Boson Sampling-Classic (BS-C). The appearance of permanents in the Boson part has its physical intuition to provide different kinds of resources from commonly used single-, double-, and higher-excitations in classical methods and the UCC ansatz to exploring chemical quantum states. Such resources can help enhance the accuracy of methods used in the classical parts. We give a scalable hybrid homodyne and photon number measurement procedure for evaluating the energy value which has intrinsic abilities to mitigate photon loss errors and discuss the extra measurement cost induced by the no Pauli exclusion principle for Bosons with its solutions. To demonstrate our proposal, we run numerical experiments on several molecules and obtain their potential energy curves reaching chemical accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a very simple distribution of unitaries: random (binary) phase -- Hadamard -- random (binary) phase -- random computational-basis permutation. We show that this distribution is statistically indistinguishable from random Haar unitaries for any polynomial set of orthogonal input states (in any basis) with polynomial multiplicity. This shows that even though real-valued unitaries cannot be completely pseudorandom (Haug, Bharti, Koh, arXiv:2306.11677), we can still obtain some pseudorandom properties without giving up on the simplicity of a real-valued unitary.
  Our analysis shows that an even simpler construction: applying a random (binary) phase followed by a random computational-basis permutation, would suffice, assuming that the input is orthogonal and \emph{flat} (that is, has high min-entropy when measured in the computational basis).
  Using quantum-secure one-way functions (which imply quantum-secure pseudorandom functions and permutations), we obtain an efficient cryptographic instantiation of the above.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In periodically driven (Floquet) systems, evolution typically results in an infinite-temperature thermal state due to continuous energy absorption over time. However, before reaching thermal equilibrium, such systems may transiently pass through a meta-stable state known as a prethermal state. This prethermal state can exhibit phenomena not commonly observed in equilibrium, such as discrete time crystals (DTCs), making it an intriguing platform for exploring out-of-equilibrium dynamics. Here, we investigate the relaxation dynamics of initially prepared product states under periodic driving in a kicked Ising model using the IBM Quantum Heron processor, comprising 133 superconducting qubits arranged on a heavy-hexagonal lattice, over up to $100$ time steps. We identify the presence of a prethermal regime characterised by magnetisation measurements oscillating at twice the period of the Floquet cycle and demonstrate its robustness against perturbations to the transverse field. Our results provide evidence supporting the realisation of a period-doubling DTC in a two-dimensional system. Moreover, we discover that the longitudinal field induces additional amplitude modulations in the magnetisation with a period incommensurate with the driving period, leading to the emergence of discrete time quasicrystals (DTQCs). These observations are further validated through comparison with tensor-network and state-vector simulations. Our findings not only enhance our understanding of clean DTCs in two dimensions but also highlight the utility of digital quantum computers for simulating the dynamics of quantum many-body systems, addressing challenges faced by state-of-the-art classical simulations.</description>

      <title>Quantum State Preparation for Probability Distributions with Mirror Symmetry Using Matrix Product States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum circuits for loading probability distributions into quantum states are essential subroutines in quantum algorithms used in physics, finance engineering, and machine learning. The ability to implement these with high accuracy in shallow quantum circuits is a critical issue. We propose a novel quantum state preparation method for probability distribution with mirror symmetry using matrix product states. By considering mirror symmetry, our method reduces the entanglement of probability distributions and improves the accuracy of approximations by matrix product states. As a result, we improved the accuracy by two orders of magnitude over existing methods using matrix product states. Our approach, characterized by a shallow quantum circuit primarily comprising nearest-neighbor qubit gates and linear scalability with qubit count, is highly advantageous for noisy quantum devices. Also, our experimental findings reveal that the approximation accuracy in tensor networks depends heavily on the bond dimension, with minimal reliance on the number of qubits. Our method is experimentally demonstrated for a normal distribution encoded into 10 and 20 qubits on a real quantum processor.</description>

Abstract: The Rabi-Stark model is a non-linear generalization of the quantum Rabi model including the dynamical Stark shift as a tunable term, which can be realized via quantum simulation on a cavity QED platform. When the Stark coupling becomes equal to the mode frequency, the spectrum changes drastically, a transition usually termed "spectral collapse" because numerical studies indicate an infinitely degenerate ground state. We show that the spectrum extends continuously from a threshold value up to infinity. A set of normalizable states are embedded in the continuum which furnishes an unexpected analogy to the atomic Stark effect. Bound states and continuum can be obtained analytically through two equally justified, but different confluence processes of the associated differential equation in Bargmann space. Moreover, these results are obtained independently using a method based on adiabatic elimination of the spin degree of freedom and corroborated through large-scale numerical checks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a superconducting qubit derived from operating a properly designed fluxonium circuit in a zero magnetic field. The qubit has a frequency of about 4 GHz and the energy relaxation quality factor $Q \approx 0.7\times 10^7$, even though the dielectric loss quality factor of the circuit components is in the low $10^5$ range. The Ramsey coherence time exceeds 100 us, and the average fidelity of Clifford gates is benchmarked to $\mathcal{F} &gt; 0.999$. These figures are likely to improve by an order of magnitude with optimized fabrication and measurement procedures. Our work establishes a ready-to-use ``partially protected" superconducting qubit with an error rate comparable to the best transmons.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear dynamics as a ground-state solution on quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the solution of time-dependent nonlinear differential equations, we present variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) that encode both space and time in qubit registers. The spacetime encoding enables us to obtain the entire time evolution from a single ground-state computation. We describe a general procedure to construct efficient quantum circuits for the cost function evaluation required by VQAs. To mitigate the barren plateau problem during the optimization, we propose an adaptive multigrid strategy. The approach is illustrated for the nonlinear Burgers equation. We classically optimize quantum circuits to represent the desired ground-state solutions, run them on IBM Q System One and Quantinuum System Model H1, and demonstrate that current quantum computers are capable of accurately reproducing the exact results.</description>

      <title>Fidelity of Wormhole Teleportation in Finite-qubit Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of quantum science and technology is leading us into an era where quantum many-body systems can be comprehended through quantum simulations. Holographic duality, which states gravity and spacetime can emerge from strongly interacting systems, then offers a natural avenue for the experimental study of gravity physics without delving into experimentally infeasible high energies. A prominent example is the simulation of traversable wormholes through the wormhole teleportation protocol, attracting both theoretical and experimental attention. In this work, we develop the theoretical framework for computing the fidelity of wormhole teleportation in $N$-qubit systems with all-to-all interactions, quantified by mutual information and entanglement negativity. The main technique is the scramblon effective theory, which captures universal out-of-time-order correlations in generic chaotic systems. We clarify that strong couplings between the two systems are essential for simulating the probe limit of semi-classical traversable wormholes using strongly interacting systems with near-maximal chaos. However, the teleportation signal diminishes rapidly when reducing the system size $N$, requiring a large number of qubits to observe a sharp signature of emergent geometry by simulating the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. This includes both the causal time-order of signals and the asymmetry of the teleportation signal for coupling with different signs. As a comparison, the teleportation signal increases when reducing $N$ in weakly interacting systems. We also analyze the fidelity of the generalized encoding scheme in fermionic string operators.</description>

      <title>Holographic Gaussian Boson Sampling with Matrix Product States on 3D cQED Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce quantum circuits for simulations of multi-mode state-vectors on 3D cQED processors, using matrix product state representations. The circuits are demonstrated as applied to simulations of molecular docking based on holographic Gaussian boson sampling, as illustrated for binding of a thiol-containing aryl sulfonamide ligand to the tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$ converting enzyme receptor. We show that cQED devices with a modest number of modes could be employed to simulate multimode systems by re-purposing working modes through measurement and re-initialization. We anticipate a wide range of GBS applications could be implemented on compact 3D cQED processors analogously, using the holographic approach. Simulations on qubit-based quantum computers could be implemented analogously, using circuits that represent continuous variables in terms of truncated expansions of Fock states.</description>

      <title>Remote Cooling of Spin-ensembles Coupled to a Spin-mechanical Hybrid Interface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present here a protocol for the ground-state cooling of a hybrid quantum system consisting of a spin ensemble, an oscillator, and a single probe spin. In the weak dispersive coupling limit between the spins and the oscillator, a back-action effect from frequent measurements of the probe spin allows exponential cooling of the hybrid system. We identify the parameter regimes necessary to cool the ensemble, the oscillator, or both to their thermal ground states. Our results contribute to the development of a practical solution for cooling/polarizing large spin ensembles. More importantly, we show that even with weak coupling, significant changes in the dynamics of such ensemble-oscillator hybrid systems can be achieved by manipulating a single spin. This result provides a relatively simple means of tuning the dynamics of a hybrid system, which might facilitate advances in many quantum technology applications such as preparing entangled states in macroscopic objects.</description>

      <title>High-Temperature Gibbs States are Unentangled and Efficiently Preparable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that thermal states of local Hamiltonians are separable above a constant temperature. Specifically, for a local Hamiltonian $H$ on a graph with degree $\mathfrak{d}$, its Gibbs state at inverse temperature $\beta$, denoted by $\rho =e^{-\beta H}/ \textrm{tr}(e^{-\beta H})$, is a classical distribution over product states for all $\beta &lt; 1/(c\mathfrak{d})$, where $c$ is a constant. This sudden death of thermal entanglement upends conventional wisdom about the presence of short-range quantum correlations in Gibbs states.
  Moreover, we show that we can efficiently sample from the distribution over product states. In particular, for any $\beta &lt; 1/( c \mathfrak{d}^3)$, we can prepare a state $\epsilon$-close to $\rho$ in trace distance with a depth-one quantum circuit and $\textrm{poly}(n) \log(1/\epsilon)$ classical overhead. A priori the task of preparing a Gibbs state is a natural candidate for achieving super-polynomial quantum speedups, but our results rule out this possibility above a fixed constant temperature.</description>

      <title>What is computable and non-computable in the quantum domain: 7 statements and 3 conjectures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in developing computational devices based on quantum effects and demonstrations of solving various tasks using them has actualized the question of the origin of the quantum advantage. Although various attempts to quantify and characterize the nature of quantum computational advantage have been made, this question in the general context remains open: There is no universal approach that helps to define a scope of problems that quantum computers are able to speed up, theoretically and in practice. Here we review an approach to this question based on the concept of complexity and reachability of quantum states. On the one hand, the class of quantum states that is of interest for quantum computing should be complex, i.e. non-simulatable with classical computers with less than exponential resources. On the other hand, such quantum states should be reachable on a practical quantum computer. This means that a unitary corresponding to the transformation of quantum states from initial to desired can be decomposed in a sequence of single- and two-qubit gates with of no more than polynomial in the number of qubits. Our consideration paves the way towards understanding the scope of problems that can be solved by a quantum computer by formulating a sequence of statements and conjectures on various sets of quantum states.</description>

      <title>Explanation of the Generalizations of Uncertainty Principle from Coordinate and Momentum Space Periodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalizations of coordinate $x$-momentum $p_x$ Uncertainty Principle, with $\Delta x$ and $\Delta p_x$ dependent terms ($\Delta$ denoting standard deviation), $$\Delta x \Delta p_x\geq i\hbar (1+\alpha\Delta p_x^2 +\beta \Delta x^2)$$ have provided rich dividends as a poor person's approach towards Quantum Gravity, because these can introduce coordinate and momentum scales ($\alpha,\beta$ ) that are appealing conceptually. However, these extensions of Uncertainty Principle are purely phenomenological in nature. Apart from the inherent ambiguity in their explicit structures, the introduction of generalized commutations relations compatible with the Uncertainty Principle has serious drawbacks.
  In the present paper we reveal that these generalized Uncertainty Principles can appear in a perfectly natural way, in canonical quantum mechanics, if one assumes a periodic nature in coordinate or momentum space, as the case may be. We bring in to light quite old, (but no so well known), works by Judge and by Judge and Lewis, that explains in detail how the popularly known structure of Extended Uncertainty Principle is generated in the case of angle $\phi$ angular momentum $L_z$, $$\Delta \phi \Delta L_z \geq i\hbar (1 +\nu \Delta \phi^2)$$ purely from a consistent implementation of periodic nature of the angle variable $\phi $, without changing the $\phi, L_z$ canonical commutation relation. We directly apply this formalism to construction to formulate generalizations in $\Delta x \Delta p_x $ Uncertainty Principle. We identify $\beta$ with an observed length scale relevant in astrophysics context. We speculate about the $\alpha$ extension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel, to the best of our knowledge, approach to superresolution optical imaging by combining quantum optics and near-field optics. Our concept involves the utilization of single-photon quantum emitters to generate a stand-alone evanescent wave. We demonstrate that the quantum interference effects of single-photon emitters, in conjunction with their near-field, result in a higher resolution of subwavelength structures than systems that are only quantum enhanced or only near-field enhanced. We believe that nano-sized emitters could be employed to accomplish the goals of this research, taking into account the current progress in nanophotonics and quantum optics technology.</description>

Abstract: A conserved photon current is derived from the commutation relations satisfied by the electromagnetic four-potential and field tensor operators. The density is found to be a sum over positive and negative frequency terms, both of which contribute a positive number density and propagate in a common direction. Discrete positive and negative frequency excitations are both identified as photons. Photon number, equal to the spatial integral of photon density, is conserved in the absence of sources and sinks.</description>

      <title>Measuring Spectral Form Factor in Many-Body Chaotic and Localized Phases of Quantum Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectral form factor (SFF) captures universal spectral fluctuations as signatures of quantum chaos, and has been instrumental in advancing multiple frontiers of physics including the studies of black holes and quantum many-body systems. However, the measurement of SFF in many-body systems is challenging due to the difficulty in resolving level spacings that become exponentially small with increasing system size. Here we experimentally measure the SFF to probe the presence or absence of chaos in quantum many-body systems using a superconducting quantum processor with a randomized measurement protocol. For a Floquet chaotic system, we observe signatures of spectral rigidity of random matrix theory in SFF given by the ramp-plateau behavior. For a Hamiltonian system, we utilize SFF to distinguish the quantum many-body chaotic phase and the prethermal many-body localization. We observe the dip-ramp-plateau behavior of random matrix theory in the chaotic phase, and contrast the scaling of the plateau time in system size between the many-body chaotic and localized phases. Furthermore, we probe the eigenstate statistics by measuring a generalization of the SFF, known as the partial SFF, and observe distinct behaviors in the purities of the reduced density matrix in the two phases. This work unveils a new way of extracting the universal signatures of many-body quantum chaos in quantum devices by probing the correlations in eigenenergies and eigenstates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum Mpemba effect from the perspective of non-equilibrium quantum thermodynamics by studying relaxation dynamics described by Davies maps. Starting from a state with coherences in the energy eigenbasis, we demonstrate that an exponential speedup to equilibrium will always occur if the state is transformed to a diagonal state in the energy eigenbasis, provided that the spectral gap of the generator is defined by a complex eigenvalue. When the transformed state has a higher non-equilibrium free energy, we argue using thermodynamic reasoning that this is a \textit{genuine} quantum Mpemba effect. Furthermore, we show how a unitary transformation on an initial state can always be constructed to yield the effect and demonstrate our findings by studying the dynamics of both the non-equilibrium free energy and the irreversible entropy production in single and multi-qubit examples.</description>

      <title>Scalar field with a time-independent classical source, not trivial after all: from vacuum decay to scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Historically it has been believed that a time-independent classical source has no effect on the scattering of relativistic uncharged field, in contrast with single particle quantum mechanics. In this work we show that the dynamics is not trivial. We solve exactly for the scattering amplitudes and find that a key ingredient is the production of particles from the unstable vacuum, conceptually similar to the Schwinger mechanism. We compute exactly the probabilities for the vacuum to decay in $n$ particles. The time dependence of such probabilities displays interesting properties such as the quantum Zeno effect and in particular has no regime where the exponential decay law is a good approximation. We show that the trivial scattering found in the past is the byproduct of the adiabatic switching of the interaction. In fact, it is not possible to switch off the interaction (adiabatically or otherwise) at distant times and recover the exact results. Finally, this non trivial vacuum behavior is a source of particle production. We argue that such non-perturbative calculations can be phenomenologically relevant for the production processes that are suppressed at the lower orders in perturbation theory, for instance dilaton production in a medium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement measures have emerged as one of the versatile probes to diagnose quantum phases and their transitions. Universal features in them expand their applicability to a range of systems, including those with quenched disorder. In this work, we show that when the underlying lattice has percolation disorder, free fermions at a finite density show interesting entanglement properties. These emerge from massively degenerate eigenspaces where the notion of standard bipartite entanglement entropy needs to be revisited. We show that appropriately defined entanglement measures can capture both geometrical aspects and electronic correlations of the percolated quantum system. Using a variety of toy models, we uncover the rich phenomenology of this physics. We further show that there are decipherable signatures of the classical percolation transition in these entanglement properties. Our work presents an interesting interplay between the geometrical properties of a lattice and quantum entanglement in a many-body quantum system.</description>

      <title>Directional superradiance in a driven ultracold atomic gas in free-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-cold atomic systems are among the most promising platforms that have the potential to shed light on the complex behavior of many-body quantum systems. One prominent example is the case of a dense ensemble illuminated by a strong coherent drive while interacting via dipole-dipole interactions. Despite being subjected to intense investigations, this system retains many open questions. A recent experiment carried out in a pencil-shaped geometry reported measurements that seemed consistent with the emergence of strong collective effects in the form of a ``superradiant'' phase transition in free space, when looking at the light emission properties in the forward direction. Motivated by the experimental observations, we carry out a systematic theoretical analysis of the system's steady-state properties as a function of the driving strength and atom number, $N$. We observe signatures of collective effects in the weak drive regime, which disappear with increasing drive strength as the system evolves into a single-particle-like mixed state comprised of randomly aligned dipoles. Although the steady-state features some similarities to the reported superradiant to normal non-equilibrium transition, also known as cooperative resonance fluorescence, we observe significant qualitative and quantitative differences, including a different scaling of the critical drive parameter (from $N$ to $\sqrt{N}$). We validate the applicability of a mean-field treatment to capture the steady-state dynamics under currently accessible conditions. Furthermore, we develop a simple theoretical model that explains the scaling properties by accounting for interaction-induced inhomogeneous effects and spontaneous emission, which are intrinsic features of interacting disordered arrays in free space.</description>

      <title>A Linear Time-Delay Scheme to Propagate Reduced Electron Density Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For any linear system where the unreduced dynamics are governed by unitary propagators, we derive a closed, time-delayed, linear system for a reduced-dimensional quantity of interest. We apply this method to understand the memory-dependence of reduced $1$-electron density matrices in time-dependent configuration interaction (TDCI), a scheme to solve for the correlated dynamics of electrons in molecules. Though time-dependent density functional theory has established that the reduced $1$-electron density possesses memory-dependence, the precise nature of this memory-dependence has not been understood. We derive a self-contained, symmetry/constraint-preserving method to propagate reduced TDCI electron density matrices. In numerical tests on two model systems (H$_2$ and HeH$^+$), we show that with sufficiently large time-delay (or memory-dependence), our method propagates reduced TDCI density matrices with high quantitative accuracy. We study the dependence of our results on time step and basis set. To derive our method, we calculate the $4$-index tensor that relates reduced and full TDCI density matrices. Our calculation applies to any TDCI system, regardless of basis set, number of electrons, or choice of Slater determinants in the wave function. This calculation enables a proof that the trace of the reduced TDCI density matrix is constant and equals the number of electrons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a possible quantum signature of the early Universe that could lead to observational imprints of the quantum nature of the inflationary period. Graviton production in the presence of an inflaton scalar field results in entangled states in polarization. This is because of a non-trivial effect due to the derivatives on two scalar fluctuations and it provides a fingerprint that depends on the polarization of the graviton that Alice and/or Bob measured in their patch. At horizon crossing, interactions between the gravitons and inflatons perform the required Bell experiments leading to a definitive measure. We hint how this signature could be measure in the high-order correlation function of galaxies, in particular on the halo bias and the intrinsic alignment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We systematically derive relativistic stochastic hydrodynamics based on the method of quantum nonlinear projection operator. Morozov's nonlinear projection operator is a generalization of the well-known linear Mori-Zwanzig projection operator method, from which one can account for the nonlinear interaction between macroscopic modes. The quantum generalized Fokker-Planck and Langevin equations are also obtained using this formalism, which are fundamentally important in non-equilibrium statistical physics. As an application, the relativistic stochastic hydrodynamic equations with Gaussian noises are derived, which are applicable in studying anomalous transport phenomena near critical points. The possible extension to include multiplicative noises is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Fractal ground state of ion chains in periodic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trapped ions in a periodic potential are a paradigm of a frustrated Wigner crystal. The dynamics is captured by a long-range Frenkel-Kontorova model. The classical ground state can be mapped to the one of an antiferromagnetic spin chain with long-range interactions in a magnetic field, whose strength is determined by the mismatch between chain's and substrate lattice's periodicity. The mapping is exact when the substrate potential is a piecewise harmonic potential and holds for any two-body interaction decaying as $1/r^\alpha$ with the distance $r$. The ground state is a devil's staircase of regular, periodic structures as a function of the mismatch, whose range of stability depends also on the coefficient $\alpha$. While the staircase is well defined in the thermodynamic limit for $\alpha&gt;1$, for Coulomb interactions, $\alpha=1$, it disappears and the sliding-to-pinned transitions becomes crossovers. However, due to the logarithmic convergence to the thermodynamic limit characteristic of the Coulomb potential, the staircase is found for any finite number of ions. We discuss the experimental parameters as well as the features that allow one to observe and reveal our predictions in experimental platforms. These dynamics are a showcase of the versatility of trapped ion platforms for exploring the interplay between frustration and interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore non-equilibrium processes in two-dimensional conformal field theories (2d CFTs) due to the growth of operators induced by inhomogeneous and homogeneous Hamiltonians by investigating the time dependence of the partition function, energy density, and entanglement entropy. The non-equilibrium processes considered in this paper are constructed out of the Lorentzian and Euclidean time evolution governed by different Hamiltonians. We explore the effect of the time ordering on entanglement dynamics so that we find that in a free boson CFT and RCFTs, this time ordering does not affect the entanglement entropy, while in the holographic CFTs, it does. Our main finding is that in the holographic CFTs, the non-unitary time evolution induced by the inhomogeneous Hamiltonian can retain the initial state information longer than in the unitary time evolution.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical Limit of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we rewrite the time-dependent Bogoliubov$\unicode{x2013}$de Gennes equation in an appropriate semiclassical form and establish its semiclassical limit to a two-particle kinetic transport equation with an effective mean-field background potential satisfying the one-particle Vlasov equation. Moreover, for some semiclassical regimes, we obtain a higher-order correction to the two-particle kinetic transport equation, capturing a nontrivial two-body interaction effect. The convergence is proven for $C^2$ interaction potentials in terms of a semiclassical optimal transport pseudo-metric. Furthermore, combining our current results with the results of Marcantoni et al. [arXiv:2310.15280], we establish a joint semiclassical and mean-field approximation of the dynamics of a system of spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Fermions by the Vlasov equation in some negative order Sobolev topology.</description>

      <title>Intersubband polaritonic metasurfaces for high-contrast ultra-fast power limiting and optical switching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear intersubband polaritonic metasurfaces support one of the strongest known ultrafast nonlinear responses in the mid-infrared frequency range across all condensed matter systems. Beyond harmonic generation and frequency mixing, these nonlinearities can be leveraged for ultrafast optical switching and power limiting, based on tailored transitions from strong to weak polaritonic coupling. Here, we demonstrate synergistic optimization of materials and photonic nanostructures to achieve large reflection contrast in ultrafast polaritonic metasurface limiters. The devices are based on optimized semiconductor heterostructure materials that minimize the intersubband transition linewidth and reduce absorption in optically saturated nanoresonators, achieving a record-high reflection contrast of 54% experimentally. We also discuss opportunities to further boost the metrics of performance of this class of ultrafast limiters, showing that reflection contrast as high as 94% may be realistically achieved using all-dielectric intersubband polaritonic metasurfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The total angular momentum of light has received attention for its application in a variety of phenomena such as optical communication, optical forces and sensing. However, the quantum behavior including the commutation relations have been relatively less explored. Here, we derive the correct commutation relation for the total angular momentum of light using both relativistic and non-relativistic approaches. An important outcome of our work is the proof that the widely-assumed quantum commutation relation for the total observable angular momentum of light is fundamentally incorrect. Our work will motivate experiments and leads to new insight on the quantum behavior of the angular momentum of light.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance and accuracy of quantum electronics is substantially degraded when the temperature of the electrons in the devices is too high. The electron temperature can be reduced with appropriate thermal anchoring and by filtering both the low frequency and radio frequency noise. Ultimately, for high performance filters the electron temperature can approach the phonon temperature (as measured by resistive thermometers) in a dilution refrigerator. In this application note, the method for measuring the electron temperature in a typical quantum electronics device using Coulomb blockade thermometry is described. This technique is applied to find the readily achievable electron temperature in the device when using the QFilter provided by QDevil. With our thermometry measurements, using a single GaAs/AlGaAs quantum dot in an optimized experimental setup, we determined an electron temperature of 28 $\pm$ 2 mK for a dilution refrigerator base temperature of 18 mK.</description>

      <title>Generation of $\gamma$-photons and pairs with transverse orbital angular momentum via spatiotemporal optical vortex pulse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the generation of well-collimated $\gamma$-photons and pairs with extrinsic transverse orbital angular momentum (TOAM) through the head-on collision of an intense spatiotemporal optical vortex (STOV) pulse carrying intrinsic TOAM with a high-energy electron beam. It is found that the TOAM of STOV pulse remains almost unchanged, and the TOAM is conserved in the center-of-mass frame (CMF). Moreover, there exhibits duality for particles TOAM in the CMF and laboratory frame (LF) when the initial location of high-energy electron beam is different. Furthermore, the TOAM of $\gamma$-photons in the CMF increases while that of positrons decreases as the topological charge of STOV pulse increases, whereas in the LF, the TOAM of both $\gamma$-photons and positrons decreases. And the result under the same pulse intensity is better than that under the same pulse energy. The increase in the initial energy of high-energy electrons leads to an enhancement of the TOAM for both $\gamma$-photons and positrons in both frames. $\gamma$-photons and electrons/positrons with TOAM as a new degree of freedom maybe have an extensive applications in optical communication, astrophysics and nanomaterials and so on.</description>

      <title>Infinite Grassmann Time-Evolving Matrix Product Operator Method in the Steady State</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an infinite Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operator method for quantum impurity problems, which directly works in the steady state. The method embraces the well-established infinite matrix product state algorithms with the recently developed GTEMPO method, and benefits from both sides: it obtains numerically exact real-time Green's functions without sampling noises, it is applicable for any temperature without the sign problem, its computational cost is independent of the transient dynamics and does not scale with the number of baths. We benchmark the method on the finite-temperature equilibrium Green's function in the noninteracting limit against exact solutions and in the single-orbital Anderson impurity model against GTEMPO calculations. We also study the zero-temperature non-equilibrium steady state of an impurity coupled to two baths with a voltage bias, obtaining consistent particle currents with existing calculations. The method is ideal for studying steady-state quantum transport, and can be readily used as an efficient real-time impurity solver in quantum embedding methods such as the dynamical mean field theory and its non-equilibrium extension.</description>

Abstract: Gate-tunable transmons (gatemons) employing semiconductor Josephson junctions have recently emerged as building blocks for hybrid quantum circuits. In this study, we present a gatemon fabricated in planar Germanium. We induce superconductivity in a two-dimensional hole gas by evaporating aluminum atop a thin spacer, which separates the superconductor from the Ge quantum well. The Josephson junction is then integrated into an Xmon circuit and capacitively coupled to a transmission line resonator. We showcase the qubit tunability in a broad frequency range with resonator and two-tone spectroscopy. Time-domain characterizations reveal energy relaxation and coherence times up to 75 ns. Our results, combined with the recent advances in the spin qubit field, pave the way towards novel hybrid and protected qubits in a group IV, CMOS-compatible material.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2102.01766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the first non-trivial one-shot inner bounds for sending quantum information over an entanglement unassisted two-sender quantum multiple access channel (QMAC) and an unassisted two-sender two-receiver quantum interference channel (QIC). Previous works only studied the unassisted QMAC in the limit of many independent and identical uses of the channel also known as the asymptotic iid limit, and did not study the unassisted QIC at all. We employ two techniques, rate splitting and successive cancellation}, in order to obtain our inner bound. Rate splitting was earlier used to obtain inner bounds, avoiding time sharing, for classical channels in the asymptotic iid setting. Our main technical contribution is to extend rate splitting from the classical asymptotic iid setting to the quantum one-shot setting. In the asymptotic iid limit our one-shot inner bound for QMAC approaches the rate region of Yard, Devetak and Hayden. For the QIC we get novel non-trivial rate regions in the asymptotic iid setting. All our results also extend to the case where limited entanglement assistance is provided, in both one-shot and asymptotic iid settings. The limited entanglement results for one-setting for both QMAC and QIC are new. For the QIC the limited entanglement results are new even in the asymptotic iid setting.</description>

The stated aim of their argument is to falsify the claim made by Feynman (in his third book of Lectures on Physics) that quantum interference is ``impossible, absolutely impossible, to explain in any classical way'' and that it ``contains the only mystery'' of quantum mechanics. We here want to point out some problems with their argument.</description>

Abstract: Quantum networks lead to novel notions of locality and correlations and an important problem concerns the question of which quantum states can be experimentally prepared with a given network structure and devices and which not. We prove that all multi-qubit graph states arising from a connected graph cannot originate from any quantum network with bipartite sources, as long as feed-forward and quantum memories are not available. Moreover, the fidelity of a multi-qubit graph state and any network state cannot exceed $9/10$. Similar results can also be established for a large class of multi-qudit graph states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.13057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the distributed dense coding (DC) protocol, involving multiple senders and a single or two receivers under the influence of non-Markovian noise, acting on the encoded qubits transmitted from senders to the receiver(s). We compare the effects of non-Markovianity on DC both for the dephasing and depolarising channels. In the case of dephasing channels, we illustrate that for some classes of states, high non-Markovian strength can eradicate the negative influence of noisy channels which is not observed for depolarizing noise. Furthermore, we incorporate randomness into the noise models by replacing the Pauli matrices with random unitaries and demonstrate the constructive impact of stochastic noise models on the quenched averaged dense coding capacity. Interestingly, we report that the detrimental effect of non-Markovian depolarising channels in the DC protocol can be eliminated when randomness is added to the channel.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.03668v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several classes of quantum circuits have been shown to provide a quantum computational advantage under certain assumptions. The study of ever more restricted classes of quantum circuits capable of quantum advantage is motivated by possible simplifications in experimental demonstrations. In this paper we study the efficiency of measurement-based quantum computation with a completely flat temporal ordering of measurements. We propose new constructions for the deterministic computation of arbitrary Boolean functions, drawing on correlations present in multi-qubit Greenberger, Horne, and Zeilinger (GHZ) states. We characterize the necessary measurement complexity using the Clifford hierarchy, and also generally decrease the number of qubits needed with respect to previous constructions. In particular, we identify a family of Boolean functions for which deterministic evaluation using non-adaptive MBQC is possible, featuring quantum advantage in width and number of gates with respect to classical circuits.</description>

      <title>Generation of genuine all-way entanglement in defect-nuclear spin systems through dynamical decoupling sequences</title>

Abstract: Multipartite entangled states are an essential resource for sensing, quantum error correction, and cryptography. Color centers in solids are one of the leading platforms for quantum networking due to the availability of a nuclear spin memory that can be entangled with the optically active electronic spin through dynamical decoupling sequences. Creating electron-nuclear entangled states in these systems is a difficult task as the always-on hyperfine interactions prohibit complete isolation of the target dynamics from the unwanted spin bath. While this emergent cross-talk can be alleviated by prolonging the entanglement generation, the gate durations quickly exceed coherence times. Here we show how to prepare high-quality GHZ$_M$-like states with minimal cross-talk. We introduce the $M$-tangling power of an evolution operator, which allows us to verify genuine all-way correlations. Using experimentally measured hyperfine parameters of an NV center spin in diamond coupled to carbon-13 lattice spins, we show how to use sequential or single-shot entangling operations to prepare GHZ$_M$-like states of up to $M=10$ qubits within time constraints that saturate bounds on $M$-way correlations. We study the entanglement of mixed electron-nuclear states and develop a non-unitary $M$-tangling power which additionally captures correlations arising from all unwanted nuclear spins. We further derive a non-unitary $M$-tangling power which incorporates the impact of electronic dephasing errors on the $M$-way correlations. Finally, we inspect the performance of our protocols in the presence of experimentally reported pulse errors, finding that XY decoupling sequences can lead to high-fidelity GHZ state preparation.</description>

      <title>Implementing any Linear Combination of Unitaries on Intermediate-term Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.13555v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop three new methods to implement any Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU), a powerful quantum algorithmic tool with diverse applications. While the standard LCU procedure requires several ancilla qubits and sophisticated multi-qubit controlled operations, our methods consume significantly fewer quantum resources. The first method (Single-Ancilla LCU) estimates expectation values of observables with respect to any quantum state prepared by an LCU procedure while requiring only a single ancilla qubit, and no multi-qubit controlled operations. The second approach (Analog LCU) is a simple, physically motivated, continuous-time analogue of LCU, tailored to hybrid qubit-qumode systems. The third method (Ancilla-free LCU) requires no ancilla qubit at all and is useful when we are interested in the projection of a quantum state (prepared by the LCU procedure) in some subspace of interest. We apply the first two techniques to develop new quantum algorithms for a wide range of practical problems, ranging from Hamiltonian simulation, ground state preparation and property estimation, and quantum linear systems. Remarkably, despite consuming fewer quantum resources they retain a provable quantum advantage. The third technique allows us to connect discrete and continuous-time quantum walks with their classical counterparts. It also unifies the recently developed optimal quantum spatial search algorithms in both these frameworks, and leads to the development of new ones that require fewer ancilla qubits. Overall, our results are quite generic and can be readily applied to other problems, even beyond those considered here.</description>

      <title>Quantum Monte Carlo simulations for financial risk analytics: scenario generation for equity, rate, and credit risk factors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.09682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monte Carlo (MC) simulations are widely used in financial risk management, from estimating value-at-risk (VaR) to pricing over-the-counter derivatives. However, they come at a significant computational cost due to the number of scenarios required for convergence. If a probability distribution is available, Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE) algorithms can provide a quadratic speed-up in measuring its properties as compared to their classical counterparts. Recent studies have explored the calculation of common risk measures and the optimisation of QAE algorithms by initialising the input quantum states with pre-computed probability distributions. If such distributions are not available in closed form, however, they need to be generated numerically, and the associated computational cost may limit the quantum advantage. In this paper, we bypass this challenge by incorporating scenario generation -- i.e. simulation of the risk factor evolution over time to generate probability distributions -- into the quantum computation; we refer to this process as Quantum MC (QMC) simulations. Specifically, we assemble quantum circuits that implement stochastic models for equity (geometric Brownian motion), interest rate (mean-reversion models), and credit (structural, reduced-form, and rating migration credit models) risk factors. We then integrate these models with QAE to provide end-to-end examples for both market and credit risk use cases.</description>

      <title>Production of genuine multimode entanglement in circular waveguides with long-range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.15137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starting with a product initial state, squeezed (squeezed coherent) state in one of the modes, and vacuum in the rest, we report that a circular waveguide comprising modes coupled with varying coupling strength is capable of producing genuine multimode entanglement (GME), quantified via the generalized geometric measure (GGM). We demonstrate that for a fixed coupling and squeezing strength, the GME content of the resulting state increases as the range of couplings between the waveguides increases, although the GGM collapses and revives with the variation of coupling strength and time. The advantage of long-range coupling can be emphasized by measuring the area under the GGM curve, which clearly illustrates the growing trends of GME with the increasing range of couplings. Moreover, long-range couplings help in generating a higher GGM for a fixed coupling strength. We analytically determine the exact expression of GGM for systems involving an arbitrary number of modes, when all the modes interact with each other equally. The entire analysis is performed in the phase-space formalism. We manifest the constructive effect of disorder in the coupling parameter, which promises a steady production of GME, independent of the coupling strength.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.03796v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an architecture for measurement-based quantum computing using photonic quantum emitters. The architecture exploits spin-photon entanglement as resource states and standard Bell measurements of photons for fusing them into a large spin-qubit cluster state. The scheme is tailored to emitters with limited memory capabilities since it only uses an initial non-adaptive (ballistic) fusion process to construct a fully percolated graph state of multiple emitters. By exploring various geometrical constructions for fusing entangled photons from deterministic emitters, we improve the photon loss tolerance significantly compared to similar all-photonic schemes.</description>

      <title>Complementarity between decoherence and information retrieval from the environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.12222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the problem of fundamental limitations of information extraction from the environment in open quantum systems. We derive a model-independent, hybrid quantum-classical solution of open dynamics in the recoil-less limit, which includes environmental degrees of freedom. Specifying to the celebrated Caldeira-Leggett model of hot thermal environments, ubiquitous in everyday situations, we reveal the existence of a new lengthscale, called distinguishability length, different from the well-known thermal de Broglie wavelength that governs the decoherence. Interestingly, a new integral kernel, called Quantum Fisher Information kernel, appears in the analysis. It complements the well-known dissipation and noise kernels and satisfies disturbance-information gain type of relations, similar to the famous fluctuation-dissipation relation. Our results complement the existing treatments of the Caldeira-Legget model from a non-standard and highly non-trivial perspective of information dynamics in the environment. This leads to a full picture of how the open evolution looks like from both the system and the environment points of view, as well as sets limits on the precision of indirect observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.00138v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fabrication errors pose a significant challenge in scaling up solid-state quantum devices to the sizes required for fault-tolerant (FT) quantum applications. To mitigate the resource overhead caused by fabrication errors, we combine two approaches: (1) leveraging the flexibility of a modular architecture, (2) adapting the procedure of quantum error correction (QEC) to account for fabrication defects. We simulate the surface code adapted to qubit arrays with arbitrarily distributed defects to find metrics that characterize how defects affect fidelity. We then determine the impact of defects on the resource overhead of realizing a fault-tolerant quantum computer, on a chiplet-based modular architecture. Our strategy for dealing with fabrication defects demonstrates an exponential suppression of logical failure where error rates of non-faulty physical qubits are ~0.1% in a circuit-based noise model. This is a typical regime where we imagine running the defect-free surface code. We use our numerical results to establish post-selection criteria for building a device from defective chiplets. Using our criteria, we then evaluate the resource overhead in terms of the average number of fabricated physical qubits per logical qubit. We find that an optimal choice of chiplet size, based on the defect rate and target fidelity, is essential to limiting any additional error correction overhead due to defects. When the optimal chiplet size is chosen, at a defect rate of 1% the resource overhead can be reduced to below 3X and 6X respectively for the two defect models we use, for a wide range of target performance. We also determine cutoff fidelity values that help identify whether a qubit should be disabled or kept as part of the error correction code.</description>

Abstract: We show that it is possible to perform Heisenberg-limited metrology on GHZ-like states, in the presence of generic spatially local, possibly strong interactions during the measurement process. An explicit protocol, which relies on single-qubit measurements and feedback based on polynomial-time classical computation, achieves the Heisenberg limit. In one dimension, matrix product state methods can be used to perform this classical calculation, while in higher dimensions the cluster expansion underlies the efficient calculations. The latter approach is based on an efficient classical sampling algorithm for short-time quantum dynamics, which may be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: By the Majorana representation, for any $d &gt; 1$ there is a one-one correspondence between a quantum state of dimension $d$ and $d-1$ qubits represented as $d-1$ points in the Bloch sphere. Using the theory of symmetry class of tensors, we present a simple scheme for constructing $d-1$ points on the Bloch sphere and the corresponding $d-1$ qubits representing a $d$-dimensional quantum state. Additionally, we demonstrate how the inner product of two $d$-dimensional quantum states can be expressed as a permanent of a matrix related to their $(d-1)$-qubit state representations. Extension of the result to mixed states is also considered.</description>

Abstract: Non-equilibrium effects may have a profound impact on the performance of thermal devices performing thermodynamic tasks such as refrigeration or heat pumping. The possibility of enhancing the performance of thermodynamic operations by means of quantum coherence is of particular interest but requires an adequate characterization of heat and work at the quantum level. In this work, we demonstrate that the presence of even small amounts of coherence in the thermal reservoirs powering a three-terminal machine, enables the appearance of combined and hybrid modes of operation, where either different resources are combined to perform a single thermodynamic task, or more than one task is performed at the same time. We determine the performance of such coherence-enabled modes of operation obtaining their power and efficiency. In the case of hybrid regimes, the presence of coherence in the hot bath allows for an increase in power while maintaining high efficiencies. On the other hand, in combined regimes, a contrasting behavior emerges whereby coherence has a detrimental impact on power output and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Effective Field Theories and Finite-temperature Properties of Zero-dimensional Superradiant Quantum Phase Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The existence of zero-dimensional superradiant quantum phase transitions seems inconsistent with conventional statistical physics. This work clarifies this apparent inconsistency. We demonstrate the corresponding effective field theories and finite-temperature properties of light-matter interacting systems, and show how this zero-dimensional quantum phase transition occurs. We first focus on the Rabi model, which is a minimum model that hosts a superradiant quantum phase transition. With the path integral method, we derive the imaginary-time action of the photon degrees of freedom. We also define a dynamical critical exponent as the rescaling between the temperature and the photon frequency, and perform dimensional analysis to the effective action. The dynamical critical exponent shows that the effective theory of the Rabi model is a free scalar field, where a true second-order quantum phase transition emerges. These results are also verified by numerical simulations of imaginary-time correlation functions of the order parameter. Furthermore, we also generalize this method to the Dicke model. Our results make the zero-dimensional superradiant quantum phase transition compatible with conventional statistical physics, and pave the way to understand it in the perspective of effective field theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Certain non-Hermitian systems exhibit the skin effect, whereby the wavefunctions become exponentially localized at one edge of the system. Such exponential amplification of wavefunction has received significant attention due to its potential applications in e.g., classical and quantum sensing. However, the opposite edge of the system, featured by the exponentially suppressed wavefunctions, remains largely unexplored. Leveraging this phenomenon, we introduce a non-Hermitian cooling mechanism, which is fundamentally distinct from traditional refrigeration or laser cooling techniques. Notably, non-Hermiticity will not amplify thermal excitations, but rather redistribute them. Hence, thermal excitations can be cooled down at one edge of the system, and the cooling effect can be exponentially enhanced by the number of auxiliary modes, albeit with a lower bound that depends on the dissipative interaction with the environment. Non-Hermitian cooling does not rely on intricate properties such as exceptional points or non-trivial topology, and it can apply to a wide range of Bosonic modes such as photons, phonons, magnons, etc.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD) allows two users to set up shared cryptographic key without the need to trust the quantum devices used. Doing so requires nonlocal correlations between the users. However, in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 050503 (2021)] it was shown that for known protocols nonlocality is not always sufficient, leading to the question of whether there is a fundamental lower bound on the minimum amount of nonlocality needed for any DIQKD implementation. Here we show that no such bound exists, giving schemes that achieve key with correlations arbitrarily close to the local set. Furthermore, some of our constructions achieve the maximum of 1 bit of key per pair of entangled qubits. We achieve this by studying a family of Bell-inequalities that constitute all self-tests of the maximally entangled state with a single linear Bell expression. Within this family there exist non-local correlations with the property that one pair of inputs yield outputs arbitrarily close to perfect key. Such correlations exist for a range of Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) values, including those arbitrarily close to the classical bound. Finally, we show the existence of quantum correlations that can generate both perfect key and perfect randomness simultaneously, whilst also displaying arbitrarily small CHSH violation; this opens up the possibility of a new class of cryptographic protocol.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01997v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the statistical properties of a single two-level system (qubit) subject to repetitive ancilla-based measurements. This setup is a fundamental minimal model for exploring the intricate interplay between the unitary dynamics of the system and the nonunitary stochasticity introduced by quantum measurements, which is central to the phenomenon of measurement-induced phase transitions. We demonstrate that this "toy model" harbors remarkably rich dynamics, manifesting in the distribution function of the qubit's quantum states in the long-time limit. We uncover a compelling analogy with the phenomenon of Anderson localization, albeit governed by distinct underlying mechanisms. Specifically, the state distribution function of the monitored qubit, parameterized by a single angle on the Bloch sphere, exhibits diverse types of behavior familiar from the theory of Anderson transitions, spanning from complete localization to almost uniform delocalization, with fractality occurring between the two limits. By combining analytical solutions for various special cases with two complementary numerical approaches, we achieve a comprehensive understanding of the structure delineating the "phase diagram" of the model. We categorize and quantify the emergent regimes and identify two distinct phases of the monitored qubit: ergodic and nonergodic. Furthermore, we identify a genuinely localized phase within the nonergodic phase, where the state distribution functions consist of delta peaks, as opposed to the delocalized phase characterized by extended distributions. Identification of these phases and demonstration of transitions between them in a monitored qubit are our main findings.</description>

Abstract: The fields of precision timekeeping and spectroscopy increasingly rely on optical frequency comb interferometry. However, comb-based measurements are not described by existing quantum theory because they exhibit both large mode mismatch and finite strength local oscillators. To establish this quantum theory, we derive measurement operators for homodyne detection with arbitrary mode overlap. These operators are a combination of quadrature and intensity-like measurements, which inform a filter that maximizes the quadrature measurement signal-to-noise ratio. Furthermore, these operators establish a foundation to extend frequency-comb interferometry to a wide range of scenarios, including metrology with nonclassical states of light.</description>

Abstract: Entanglement is a key property of quantum computing that separates it from its classical counterpart, however, its exact role in the performance of quantum algorithms, especially variational quantum algorithms, is not well understood. In this work, we utilise tensor network methods to systematically probe the role of entanglement in the working of two variational quantum algorithms, the Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm (QAOA) and Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs), on prototypical problems under controlled entanglement environments. We find that for the MAX-CUT problem solved using QAOA, the fidelity as a function of entanglement is highly dependent on the number of layers, layout of edges in the graph, and edge density, generally exhibiting that a high number of layers indicates a higher resilience to truncation of entanglement. This is in contrast to previous studies based on no more than four QAOA layers which show that the fidelity of QAOA follows a scaling law with respect to the entanglement per qubit of the system. Contrarily, in the case of QNNs, trained circuits with high test accuracies are underpinned by higher entanglement, with any enforced limitation in entanglement resulting in a sharp decline in test accuracy. This is corroborated by the entanglement entropy of these circuits which is consistently high suggesting that, unlike QAOA, QNNs may require quantum devices capable of generating highly entangled states. Overall our work provides a deeper understanding of the role of entanglement in the working of variational quantum algorithms which may help to implement these algorithms on NISQ-era quantum hardware in a way that maximises their accuracies.</description>

Abstract: With quantum devices rapidly approaching qualities and scales needed for fault tolerance, the validity of simplified error models underpinning the study of quantum error correction needs to be experimentally evaluated. In this work, we have assessed the performance of IBM superconducting quantum computer devices implementing heavy-hexagon code syndrome measurements with increasing circuit sizes up to 23 qubits, against the error assumptions underpinning code threshold calculations. Circuit operator change rate statistics in the presence of depolarizing and biased noise were modelled using analytic functions of error model parameters. Data from 16 repeated syndrome measurement cycles was found to be inconsistent with a uniform depolarizing noise model, favouring instead biased and inhomogeneous noise models. Spatial-temporal correlations investigated via $Z$ stabilizer measurements revealed significant temporal correlation in detection events. These results highlight the non-trivial structure which may be present in the noise of quantum error correction circuits, revealed by operator measurement statistics, and support the development of noise-tailored codes and decoders to adapt.</description>

      <title>Practical trainable temporal post-processor for multi-state quantum measurement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop and demonstrate a trainable temporal post-processor (TPP) harnessing a simple but versatile machine learning algorithm to provide optimal processing of quantum measurement data subject to arbitrary noise processes, for the readout of an arbitrary number of quantum states. We demonstrate the TPP on the essential task of qubit state readout, which has historically relied on temporal processing via matched filters in spite of their applicability only for specific noise conditions. Our results show that the TPP can reliably outperform standard filtering approaches under complex readout conditions, such as high power readout. Using simulations of quantum measurement noise sources, we show that this advantage relies on the TPP's ability to learn optimal linear filters that account for general quantum noise correlations in data, such as those due to quantum jumps, or correlated noise added by a phase-preserving quantum amplifier. We show that the transformation described by the TPP can be expressed via an efficient semi-analytic form, providing a linearly-scaling generalization of matched filtering to an arbitrary number of states under the most general noise conditions of the readout signal emanating from the measurement chain. The TPP can be efficiently, autonomously, and reliably trained on measurement data, and requires only linear operations, making it ideal for FPGA implementations in cQED for real-time processing of measurement data from general quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of a quantum system interacting with white non-Gaussian baths: Poisson noise master equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00376v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum systems are unavoidably open to their surrounding degrees of freedom. The theory of open quantum systems is thus crucial to understanding the fluctuations, dissipation, and decoherence of a quantum system of interest. Typically, the bath is modeled as an ensemble of harmonic oscillators, which yields Gaussian statistics of the bath influence on the quantum systems. However, there are also phenomena in which the bath consists of two-state systems, spins, or anharmonic oscillators; therefore, the non-Gaussian properties of the bath become important. Nevertheless, a theoretical framework to describe quantum systems under the influence of such non-Gaussian baths is not well established. Here, we develop a theory to describe quantum dissipative systems affected by Poisson noise properties of the bath, because the L\'evi-It\^o decomposition theorem asserts that Poisson noise is fundamental in describing arbitrary white noise beyond Gaussian properties. We introduce a quantum bath model that allows for the consistent description of dissipative quantum systems. The obtained master equation reveals non-Gaussian bath effects in the white noise regime, and provides an essential step toward describing open quantum dynamics under the influence of generic baths.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the mathematics of exactly solvable Unruh-DeWitt detector models, interacting with massless scalar fields under instantaneous interactions, to construct a relativistic quantum Otto heat engine. By deriving the conditions under which the thermodynamic cycle is closed we study the effects of motion on the amount of work that can be extracted from the machine when the working medium is moving at a constant relativistic velocity through the heat baths. While there is a degrading effect with respect to speed in the hot bath, we demonstrate that in the case of the cold bath, genuine enhancing effects are sometimes present. For couplings the same order as the inverse frequency of the detector and a specific value for the temporal separation between the two instantaneous interactions--needed in order to be possible to cool the detector--a non-monotonic dependence between speed and extracted work exists raising the intriguing possibility of exploiting relativistic effects for the enhancement of thermodynamic processes in tabletop experiments.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic formalism and anomalous transport in 1D semiclassical Bose-Hubbard chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the time-dependent free energy functionals of the semiclassical one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard chain. We first review the weakly chaotic dynamics and the consequent early-time anomalous diffusion in the system. The anomalous diffusion is robust, appears with strictly quantized coefficients, and persists even for very long chains (more than hundred sites), crossing over to normal diffusion at late times. We identify fast (angle) and slow (action) variables and thus consider annealed and quenched partition functions, corresponding to fixing the actions and integrating over the actions, respectively. We observe the leading quantum effects in the annealed free energy, whereas the quenched energy is undefined in the thermodynamic limit, signaling the absence of thermodynamic equilibrium in the quenched regime. But already the leading correction away from the quenched regime reproduces the annealed partition function exactly. This encapsulates the fact that in both slow- and fast-chaos regime both the anomalous and the normal diffusion can be seen (though at different times).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ground-based interferometric gravitational wave detectors are highly precise sensors for weak forces, limited in sensitivity across their detection band by quantum fluctuations of light. Current and future instruments address this limitation by injecting frequency-dependent squeezed vacuum into the detection port, utilizing narrow-band, low-loss optical cavities for optimal rotation of the squeezing ellipse at each signal frequency. This study introduces a novel scheme employing the principles of quantum teleportation and entangled states of light. It allows achieving broadband suppression of quantum noise in detuned signal recycled-Fabry-Perot--Michelson interferometers, which is the baseline design of the low-frequency detector within the Einstein Telescope xylophone detector, without requiring additional filter cavities or modifications to the core optics of the main interferometer.</description>

      <title>Quantum entanglement transfer assisted via Duffing nonlinearity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a scheme to enhance quantum entanglement in an optomechanical system by exploiting the so-called Duffing nonlinearity. Our model system consists of two mechanically coupled mechanical resonators, both driven by an optical field. One resonator supports Duffing nonlinearity, while the other does not. The resonators are coupled to each other via the so-called phonon hopping mechanism. The hopping rate is $\theta$-phase-dependent that induces Exceptional Points (EPs) singularities in the system. Interestingly, while the resonator with Duffing nonlinearity exhibits vanishing bipartite entanglement, we observe an entanglement transfer phenomenon into the other mechanical resonator. This nonlinearly induced entanglement demonstrates superior robustness against thermal fluctuations compared to entanglement generated without the nonlinearity. Additionally, this entanglement features the sudden death and revival phenomenon, where the peaks happen at the multiple of $\theta=\frac{\pi}{2}$. This work opens a new avenue for exploiting nonlinear resources to generate robust quantum entanglement, paving the way for advancements in quantum information processing, quantum sensing, and quantum computing within complex systems.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Grover's Search Algorithm: A Modified Approach to Increase the Probability of Good States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00082v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article introduces an enhancement to the Grover search algorithm to speed up computing the probability of finding good states. It suggests incorporating a rotation phase angle determined mathematically from the derivative of the model during the initial iteration. At each iteration, a new phase angle is computed and used in a rotation gate around y+z axis in the diffusion operator. The computed phase angles are optimized through an adaptive adjustment based on the estimated increasing ratio of the consecutive amplitudes. The findings indicate an average decrease of 28% in the required number of iterations resulting in a faster overall process and fewer number of quantum gates. For large search space, this improvement rises to 29.58%. Given the computational capabilities of the computer utilized for the simulation, the approach is applied to instances with up to 12 qubits or 4096 possible combination of search entries.</description>

Abstract: Interacting particle systems studied in this paper are probabilistic cellular automata with nearest-neighbor interaction including the Domany-Kinzel model. A special case of the Domany-Kinzel model is directed percolation. We regard the interacting particle system as a Markov chain on a graph. Then we present a new quantization of the interacting particle system. After that, we introduce a zeta function of the quantized model and give its determinant expression. Moreover, we calculate the absolute zeta function of the quantized model for the Domany-Kinzel model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian one-photon and two-photon quantum Rabi models (QRMs) with imaginary couplings are respectively solved through the Bogoliubov operators approach. Transcendental functions responsible for exact solutions are derived, whose zeros produce the complete spectra. Exceptional points (EPs) can be identified in terms of the transcendental function. The EP is formed in the two nearest-neighboring excited energy levels, and shifts towards lower coupling strength at higher energy levels. Interestingly, under the resonant condition in the non-Hermitian two-photon QRM, the lowest two excited states within the same parity in the even photonic number subspace coalesce at an EP, but take always the purely real energy, in sharp contrast to the conventional EP in the non-Hermitian systems. For both non-Hermitian QRMs, the fidelity susceptibility goes to negative infinity at the EPs, consistent with the recent observations in non-Hermitian systems. All eigenstates can be labeled by the conserved energy and the QRM parity, we argue that the non-Hermitian QRMs are also integrable, similar to their Hermitian counterparts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recurring challenge in quantum science and technology is the precise control of their underlying dynamics that lead to the desired quantum operations, often described by a set of quantum gates. These gates can be subject to application-specific errors, leading to a dependence of their controls on the chosen circuit, the quality measure and the gate-set itself. A natural solution would be to apply quantum optimal control in an application-oriented fashion. In turn, this requires the definition of a meaningful measure of the contextual gate-set performance. Therefore, we explore and compare the applicability of quantum process tomography, linear inversion gate-set tomography, randomized linear gate-set tomography, and randomized benchmarking as measures for closed-loop quantum optimal control experiments, using a macroscopic ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond as a test-bed. Our work demonstrates the relative trade-offs between those measures and how to significantly enhance the gate-set performance, leading to an improvement across all investigated methods.</description>

Abstract: Three-dimensional microwave cavity resonators have been shown to reach lifetimes of the order of a second by maximizing the cavity volume relative to its surface, using better materials, and improving surface treatments. Such cavities represent an ideal platform for quantum computing with bosonic qubits, but their efficient control remains an outstanding problem since the large mode volume results in inefficient coupling to nonlinear elements used for their control. Moreover, this coupling induces additional cavity decay via the inverse Purcell effect which can easily destroy the advantage of a long intrinsic lifetime. Here, we discuss conditions on, and protocols for, efficient utilization of these ultra-high-quality microwave cavities as memories for conventional superconducting qubits. We show that, surprisingly, efficient write and read operations with ultra-high-quality cavities does not require similar quality factors for the qubits and other nonlinear elements used to control them. Through a combination of analytical and numerical calculations, we demonstrate that efficient coupling to cavities with second-scale lifetime is possible with state-of-the-art transmon and SNAIL devices and outline a route towards controlling cavities with even higher quality factors. Our work explores a potentially viable roadmap towards using ultra-high-quality microwave cavity resonators for storing and processing information encoded in bosonic qubits.</description>

Abstract: Quantum state reconstruction is an essential element in quantum information processing. However, efficient and reliable reconstruction of non-trivial quantum states in the presence of hardware imperfections can be challenging. This task is particularly demanding for high-dimensional states encoded in continuous-variable (CV) systems, as many error-prone measurements are needed to cover the relevant degrees of freedom of the system in phase space. In this work, we introduce an efficient and robust technique for optimized reconstruction based on excitation number sampling (ORENS). We use a standard bosonic circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) setup to experimentally demonstrate the robustness of ORENS and show that it outperforms the existing cQED reconstruction techniques such as Wigner and Husimi Q tomography. Our investigation highlights that ORENS is naturally free of parasitic system dynamics and resilient to decoherence effects in the hardware. Finally, ORENS relies only on the ability to accurately measure the excitation number of the state, making it a versatile and accessible tool for a wide range of CV platforms and readily scalable to multimode systems. Thus, our work provides a crucial and valuable primitive for practical quantum information processing using bosonic modes.</description>

Abstract: We formulate a quantum phase space for molecular rotational and nuclear-spin states. Taking in molecular geometry and nuclear-spin data, our framework yields admissible position and momentum states, inter-convertible via a generalized Fourier transform. We classify molecules into three types -- asymmetric, rotationally symmetric, and perrotationally symmetric -- with the last type having no macroscopic analogue due to nuclear-spin statistics constraints. We identify two features in perrotationally symmetric state spaces that are Hamiltonian-independent and induced solely by symmetry and spin statistics. First, many molecular species are intrinsically rotation-spin entangled in a way that cannot be broken without transitioning to another species or breaking symmetry. Second, each molecular position state houses an internal pseudo-spin or "fiber" degree of freedom, and the fiber's Berry phase or matrix after adiabatic changes in position yields naturally robust operations, akin to braiding anyonic quasiparticles or realizing fault-tolerant quantum gates. We outline scenarios where these features can be experimentally probed.</description>

Abstract: Computing vacuum states of lattice gauge theories (LGTs) containing fermionic degrees of freedom can present significant challenges for classical computation using Monte-Carlo methods. Quantum algorithms may offer a pathway towards more scalable computation of groundstate properties of LGTs. However, a comprehensive understanding of the quantum computational resources required for such a problem is thus far lacking. In this work, we investigate using the quantum subspace expansion (QSE) algorithm to compute the groundstate of the Schwinger model, an archetypal LGT describing quantum electrodynamics in one spatial dimension. We perform numerical simulations, including the effect of measurement noise, to extrapolate the resources required for the QSE algorithm to achieve a desired accuracy for a range of system sizes. Using this, we present a full analysis of the resources required to compute LGT vacuum states using a quantum algorithm using qubitization within a fault tolerant framework. We develop of a novel method for performing qubitization of a LGT Hamiltonian based on a 'linear combination of unitaries' (LCU) approach. The cost of the corresponding block encoding operation scales as $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(N)$ with system size $N$. Including the corresponding prefactors, our method reduces the gate cost by multiple orders of magnitude when compared to previous LCU methods for the QSE algorithm, which scales as $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(N^2)$ when applied to the Schwinger model. While the qubit and single circuit T-gate cost resulting from our resource analysis is appealing to early fault-tolerant implementation, we find that the number of shots required to avoid numerical instability within the QSE procedure must be significantly reduced in order to improve the feasibility of the methodology we consider and discuss how this might be achieved.</description>

Abstract: Using quantum information geometry, I derive quantum generalizations of the Onsager rate equations, which model the irreversible dynamics of a system near a steady state. By redefining the currents, I propose a version of the equations with a symmetric transport tensor without assuming any detailed balance. With a more conventional definition of the currents, I propose another version where the transport tensor may not be symmetric, and I give the precise condition for its symmetry. A reasonable definition of quantum detailed balance is shown to be a sufficient, though not necessary, condition. The relations and relative merits of the two versions, as well as their connection to physical systems, are discussed.</description>

Abstract: Information-theoretic insights have proven fruitful in many areas of quantum physics. But can the fundamental dynamics of quantum systems be derived from purely information-theoretic principles, without resorting to Hilbert space structures such as unitary evolution and self-adjoint observables? Here we provide a model where the dynamics originates from a condition of informational non-equilibrium, the deviation of the system's state from a reference state associated to a field of identically prepared systems. Combining this idea with three basic information-theoretic principles, we derive a notion of energy that captures the main features of energy in quantum theory: it is observable, bounded from below, invariant under time-evolution, in one-to-one correspondence with the generator of the dynamics, and quantitatively related to the speed of state changes. Our results provide an information-theoretic reconstruction of the Mandelstam-Tamm bound on the speed of quantum evolutions, establishing a bridge between dynamical and information-theoretic notions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nuclear hyperpolarization is a known method to enhance the signal in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) by orders of magnitude. The present work addresses the $^{13}$C hyperpolarization in diamond micro- and nanoparticles, using the optically-pumped nitrogen-vacancy center (NV) to polarize $^{13}$C spins at room temperature. Consequences of the small particle size are mitigated by using a combination of surface treatment improving the $^{13}$C relaxation ($T_1$) time, as well as that of NV, and applying a technique for NV illumination based on a microphotonic structure. Monitoring the light-induced redistribution of the NV spin state populations with electron paramagnetic resonance, a strong polarization enhancement for the NV spin state is observed in a narrow spectral region corresponding to about 4\% of these defect centers. By combining adjustments to the `PulsePol' sequence and slow sample rotation, the NV-$^{13}$C polarization transfer rate is improved further. The hyperpolarized $^{13}$C NMR signal is observed in particles of 2 $\mu$m and 100 nm median sizes, with enhancements over the thermal signal (at 0.29 T magnetic field), of 1500 and 940, respectively. The present demonstration of room-temperature hyperpolarization anticipates the development of agents based on nanoparticles for sensitive magnetic resonance applications.</description>

Abstract: The qubit scalability imposes a paramount challenge in the field of quantum computing. Photonic interconnects between distinct quantum computing modules provide a solution to deal with this issue. The fundamental part of this approach is entanglement distribution via travelling photons emitted by matter qubits. However, randomness of the spontaneous emission in the matter qubits limits both the entanglement fidelity and the generation rate. In this paper, by numerical and analytical methods, we investigate the relationship between the entanglement affected by the spontaneous emission and the waveform of the pump pulse used in the photon generation. We confirm and analyze a rate-fidelity trade-off in the entanglement swapping with Gaussian pump pulses and show that a simple extension to non-Gaussian pump pulses improves the trade-off in a certain parameter region. Furthermore we extend our analysis to entanglement distribution in the general multipartite setting and show that the analysis of the bipartite entanglement can be straightforwardly applied in this case as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.08828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A spontaneous symmetry-breaking order is conventionally described by a tensor-product wave-function of some few-body clusters. We discuss a type of symmetry-breaking orders, dubbed entanglement-enabled symmetry-breaking orders, which cannot be realized by any tensor-product state. Given a symmetry breaking pattern, we propose a criterion to diagnose if the symmetry-breaking order is entanglement-enabled, by examining the compatibility between the symmetries and the tensor-product description. For concreteness, we present an infinite family of exactly solvable gapped models on one-dimensional lattices with nearest-neighbor interactions, whose ground states exhibit entanglement-enabled symmetry-breaking orders from a discrete symmetry breaking. In addition, these ground states have gapless edge modes protected by the unbroken symmetries. We also propose a construction to realize entanglement-enabled symmetry-breaking orders with spontaneously broken continuous symmetries. Under the unbroken symmetries, some of our examples can be viewed as symmetry-protected topological states that are beyond the conventional classifications.</description>

Abstract: We generalize isometric tensor network states to fermionic systems, paving the way for efficient adaptations of 1D tensor network algorithms to 2D fermionic systems. As the first application of this formalism, we developed and benchmarked a time-evolution block-decimation (TEBD) algorithm for real-time and imaginary-time evolution. The imaginary-time evolution produces ground-state energies for gapped systems, systems with a Dirac point, and systems with gapless edge modes to good accuracy. The real-time TEBD captures the scattering of two fermions and the chiral edge dynamics on the boundary of a Chern insulator.</description>

Abstract: Multivariate functions of continuous variables arise in countless branches of science. Numerical computations with such functions typically involve a compromise between two contrary desiderata: accurate resolution of the functional dependence, versus parsimonious memory usage. Recently, two promising strategies have emerged for satisfying both requirements: (i) The quantics representation, which expresses functions as multi-index tensors, with each index representing one bit of a binary encoding of one of the variables; and (ii) tensor cross interpolation (TCI), which, if applicable, yields parsimonious interpolations for multi-index tensors. Here, we present a strategy, quantics TCI (QTCI), which combines the advantages of both schemes. We illustrate its potential with an application from condensed matter physics: the computation of Brillouin zone integrals.</description>

      <title>Pairing dome from an emergent Feshbach resonance in a strongly repulsive bilayer model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13040v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A key to understanding unconventional superconductivity lies in unraveling the pairing mechanism of mobile charge carriers in doped antiferromagnets, yielding an effective attraction between charges even in the presence of strong repulsive Coulomb interactions. Here, we study pairing in a mixed-dimensional (mixD) $t-J$ model, featuring robust binding energies -- despite dominant repulsive interactions -- that are strongly enhanced in the finite doping regime. The single and coupled mixD ladders we study, corresponding to bilayers of width $w\leq 2$, feature a crossover from tightly bound pairs of holes (closed channel) at small repulsion, to more spatially extended, correlated pairs of individual holes (open channel) at large repulsion. We derive an effective model for the latter, in which the attraction is mediated by the closed channel, in analogy to atomic Feshbach resonances. Using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations we reveal a dome of large binding energies at around $30\%$ doping, accompanied by a change of the Fermi surface volume and a crossover from extended to tightly bound hole pairs. Our work provides a microscopic theory of pairing in the doped mixD system with dominant repulsion, closely related to bilayer, Ni-based superconductors, and our predictions can be tested in state-of-the-art quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Pairing from repulsion in a two-dimensional Fermi gas with soft-core interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.17362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a model many-body system of spinless Fermi gas in two dimensions, where the bare two-body interaction is repulsive and takes the form of a soft-core disk potential. We obtain the zero temperature phase diagram of this model by numerical functional renormalization group (FRG), which retains the effective interaction vertices in all channels to provide a detailed picture of how Cooper pairing emerges under the renormalization flow. The repulsion drives the system to a series of superfluid states with higher angular momentum paring, for example in the $f$- and $h$-wave channels instead of the $p$-wave channel. This is in sharp contrast to the original Kohn-Luttinger mechanism where pairing of very large angular momenta and exponentially small transition temperature was predicted. We trace the stabilization and enhancement of $f$- and $h$-wave pairing back to the momentum dependence of the bare interaction. A perturbative calculation is carried out to show that while the second order Kohn-Luttinger diagrams provide a qualitative understanding of the onsets of the various superfluid phases, they are unable to accurately capture the phase boundaries predicted by FRG. Our findings suggest that tuning the shape of the interaction potential offers a promising route to achieve stronger ``pairing glue" and to realize nontrivial superfluid phases in repulsive Fermi gases beyond the scope of the original Kohn-Luttinger analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17208v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the evolution of the entanglement entropy for a massless field within a spherical region throughout the inflationary period and the subsequent era of radiation domination, starting from the Bunch-Davies vacuum. In order to focus on the entanglement of modes that are directly accessible to observations, we impose an ultraviolet cutoff set by the wavelength of the last mode that exited the horizon at the end of inflation. The transition of each mode towards a squeezed state upon horizon exit during inflation and the additional squeezing when radiation domination sets in enhance the entanglement entropy. Shortly after the transition to the radiation-dominated era, a volume term develops and becomes the leading contribution to the entropy at late times, as is common for systems lying in squeezed states. We estimate the magnitude of the entropy and discuss its interpretation in the light of the quantum to classical transition for modes exiting the horizon during inflation. Our results raise the possibility that the quantum nature of weakly interacting fields, such as gravitational waves resulting from tensor modes during inflation, may be detectable in today's universe. On the other hand, an observer with no knowledge of the degrees of freedom beyond the horizon would interpret the entropy as thermal. From this point of view, the reheating after inflation would be a result of quantum entanglement.</description>

Abstract: An Ising machine is any hardware specifically designed for finding the ground state of the Ising model. Relevant examples are coherent Ising machines and quantum annealers. In this paper, we propose a new machine learning model that is based on the Ising structure and can be efficiently trained using gradient descent. We provide a mathematical characterization of the training process, which is based upon optimizing a loss function whose partial derivatives are not explicitly calculated but estimated by the Ising machine itself. Moreover, we present some experimental results on the training and execution of the proposed learning model. These results point out new possibilities offered by Ising machines for different learning tasks. In particular, in the quantum realm, the quantum resources are used for both the execution and the training of the model, providing a promising perspective in quantum machine learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reducing control complexity is essential for achieving large-scale quantum computing. However, reducing control knobs may compromise the ability to independently address each qubit. Recent progress in neutral atom-based platforms suggests that rectangular (row-column) addressing may strike a balance between control granularity and flexibility for 2D qubit arrays. This scheme allows addressing qubits on the intersections of a set of rows and columns each time. While quadratically reducing controls, it may necessitate more depth. We formulate the depth-optimal rectangular addressing problem as exact binary matrix factorization, an NP-hard problem also appearing in communication complexity and combinatorial optimization. We introduce a satisfiability modulo theories-based solver for this problem, and a heuristic, row packing, performing close to the optimal solver on various benchmarks. Furthermore, we discuss rectangular addressing in the context of fault-tolerant quantum computing, leveraging a natural two-level structure.</description>

Abstract: Polaritons are promising for important applications including organic solar cells, optical logic gates, and qubits. In low-Q microcavities, polaritonic signatures of strongly hybridized photons and Frenkel excitons were previously found to decay together with dark excitons. There remain unresolved questions regarding whether dark excitons affect the strength of exciton-photon coupling. Additionally, the contributions of dark excitons in organic layers and hot electrons in metal films to the polaritonic response are not fully understood. Here, we identified that due to delocalization of polaritons over organic and metal layers, they are sensitive to both dark excitons and hot electrons. Dark excitons modulate exciton-photon coupling strength, whereas hot-electrons imprint two-temperature dynamics onto the polaritonic response. Both organic and metal films contribute to transient Fano-like gain-loss spectra of exciton-polaritons. These and other mechanistic insights into the strong-coupling dynamics were supported by the theory of non-Hermitian Hamiltonian mechanics, axially-resolved optical simulations, global analysis of pump-probe spectra, and statistical correlation analysis. The developed methodology can be applied to other microcavity structures. Our findings are important for disentangling pure polaritonic effects from other excitations in organic and metal layers, with the ultimate aim of achieving photonic control over photophysical and photochemical processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the structural and electronic origin of antiferromagnetic coupling in the Yttrium iron garnet (YIG) and permalloy (Py) bilayer system at the atomic level. Ferromagnetic Resonance (FMR) reveal unique hybrid modes in samples prepared with surface ion milling, indicative of antiferromagnetic exchange coupling at the YIG/Py interface. Using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), we highlight significant interfacial differences introduced by ion-milling. The observations suggests that the antiferromagnetic coupling in YIG/Py bilayers is predominantly driven by an oxygen-mediated super-exchange coupling mechanism on the tetrahedral Fe terminated YIG surface, which is supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This research provides critical insight into the fundamental mechanisms governing the efficiency of coupling in magnetic bilayers and underscores the pivotal role of oxide surface termination in modulating magnetic interfacial dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Spatiotemporal Optical Vortices (STOVs) are structured electromagnetic fields propagating in free space with phase singularities in the space-time domain. Depending on the tilt of the helical phase front, STOVs can carry both longitudinal and transverse orbital angular momentum (OAM). Although STOVs have gained significant interest in the recent years, the current understanding is limited to the semi-classical picture. Here, we develop a quantum theory for STOVs with an arbitrary tilt, extending beyond the paraxial limit. We demonstrate that quantum STOV states, such as Fock and coherent twisted photon pulses, display non-vanishing longitudinal OAM fluctuations that are absent in conventional monochromatic twisted pulses. We show that these quantum fluctuations exhibit a unique texture, i.e. a spatial distribution which can be used to experimentally isolate these quantum effects. Our findings represent a step towards the exploitation of quantum effects of structured light for various applications such as OAM-based encoding protocols and platforms to explore novel light-matter interaction in 2D material systems.</description>

      <title>Relational Quantum Mechanics, Quantum Relativism, and the Iteration of Relativity</title>

Abstract: The idea that the dynamical properties of quantum systems are invariably relative to other systems has recently regained currency. Using Relational Quantum Mechanics (RQM) for a case study, this paper calls attention to a question that has been underappreciated in the debate about quantum relativism: the question of whether relativity iterates. Are there absolute facts about the properties one system possesses relative to a specified reference, or is this again a relative matter, and so on? It is argued that RQM (in its best-known form) is committed to what I call the Unrestricted Iteration Principle (UIP), and thus to an infinite regress of relativisations. This principle plays a crucial role in ensuring the communicability and coherence of interaction outcomes across observers. It is, however, shown to be incompatible with the widespread, conservative reading of RQM in terms of relations, instead necessitating the adoption of the more unorthodox notion of perspectival facts. I conclude with some reflections on the current state of play in perspectivist versions of RQM and quantum relativism more generally, underscoring both the need for further conceptual development and the importance of the iteration principle for an accurate cost-benefit analysis of such interpretations.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast and highly collimated radially polarized photons from a colloidal quantum dot in a hybrid nanoantenna at room-temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06523</link>

Abstract: To harness the potential of radially polarized single photons in applications such as high-dimensional quantum key distribution (HD-QKD) and quantum communication, we demonstrate an on-chip, room-temperature device, which generates highly directional radially polarized photons at very high rates. The photons are emitted from a giant CdSe/CdS colloidal quantum dot (gQD) accurately positioned at the tip of a metal nanocone centered inside a hybrid metal-dielectric bullseye antenna. We show that due to the large and selective Purcell enhancement specifically for the out-of-plane optical dipole of the gQD, the emitted photons can have a very high degree of radial polarization (&gt;93%), based on a quantitative metric. Our study emphasizes the importance of accurate gQD positioning for optimal radial polarization purity through extensive experiments and simulations, which contribute to the fundamental understanding of radial polarization in nanostructured devices and pave the way for implementation of such systems in practical applications using structured quantum light.</description>
