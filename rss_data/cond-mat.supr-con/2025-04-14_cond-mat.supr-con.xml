      <title>Normal state and superconducting state properties of high entropy Ta0.2Nb0.2V0.2Ti0.2X0.2 (X = Zr and Hf )</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High entropy alloy superconductors represent a unique blend of advanced material systems and quantum physics, offering significant potential for advancing superconducting technologies. In this study, we report a detailed theoretical and experimental investigation of high entropy alloy superconductors Ta0.2Nb0.2V0.2Ti0.2X0.2 (X = Zr and Hf). Our study unveils that both the materials crystallize in a body-centered cubic structure (space group: I m -3 m) and exhibit bulk superconductivity with a superconducting onset temperature of (Tonset C ) of 5 K for X = Hf and 6.19 K for X = Zr sample. Our detailed analysis, including magnetization, resistivity, heat capacity measurements, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicates moderately coupled isotropic s-wave superconductivity in these materials. Our DFT results find significant spectral weight at the Fermi energy and phonon spectra is free of imaginary modes, confirming the dynamical stability and metallic nature of these alloys. Remarkably, we have observed a high upper critical field (HC2(0)) surpassing the Pauli paramagnetic limit for the X = Hf sample and explained it on the basis of the increased spin-orbit coupling in the structure. Ta0.2Nb0.2V0.2Ti0.2Zr0.2, on the other hand, shows a conventional HC2 behaviour. With the dynamical stability of these alloys, excellent normal state metallic nature, high micro-hardness, and high upper critical field, these samples emerge as potential candidates for future applications in superconducting devices.</description>

      <title>Oxygen-isotope effect on the density wave transitions in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ and La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The isotope effect in solid-state physics is fundamental to understanding how atomic mass influences the physical properties of materials and provides crucial insights into the role of electron-phonon coupling in the formation of various quantum states. In this study, we investigate the effect of oxygen isotope ($^{16}$O/$^{18}$O) substitution on density wave transitions in the double- and triple-layer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. The charge-density wave (CDW) transitions in both systems are influenced by isotope substitution, with the CDW transition temperature ($T_{\rm CDW}$) shifting to higher values in the $^{18}$O-substituted samples. In contrast, the isotope effect on the spin-density wave (SDW) transition temperature ($T_{\rm SDW}$) differs between the two systems. Specifically, a significant isotope effect on $T_{\rm SDW}$ is observed only in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, where the CDW and SDW orders are intertwined. This interplay results not only in equal values for $T_{\rm CDW}$ and $T_{\rm SDW}$ but also in an identical isotope effect on both transitions. In contrast, in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, where the SDW transition occurs at a temperature distinct from the CDW, no isotope effect is observed on $T_{\rm SDW}$.</description>

      <title>Time-reversal symmetric topological superconductivity in Machida-Shibata lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments engineered special spin-degenerate Andreev states in atomic cages of adatoms on superconductors, the Machida-Shibata states, revealing a promising building block for quantum matter. Here, we investigate the formation of time-reversal symmetric bands by hybridizing multiple such states and analyzing their electronic topological properties. The low-energy theory shows that competing emerging singlet and triplet superconducting pairings drive the formation of topologically non-trivial phases in symmetry class DIII. Therefore, Kramers pairs of Majorana zero modes appear at the ends of Machida-Shibata chains, while two-dimensional lattices host helical Majorana edge modes. Additionally, we discover extended regions in the Brillouin zone with vanishing superconducting pairings, which can be lifted by repulsive electron interactions. Our findings offer new perspectives for manipulating topological superconductivity and pairings in non-magnetic adatom systems.</description>

      <title>Biharmonic-drive tunable Josephson diode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect has garnered significant interest due to its prospective applications in cryogenic electronics and computing, characterized by zero resistance and no energy dissipation. This phenomenon has been demonstrated across various superconducting platforms, which typically necessitate unconventional materials with broken spatial symmetries or external magnetic fields, posing scalability and integration challenges. This work introduces an innovative method to realize the superconducting diode effect by disrupting spatio-temporal symmetries in a conventional Josephson junction utilizing a biharmonic AC drive signal. We achieve wireless modulation of the diode's polarity and efficiency with an antenna. Our findings indicate a diode efficiency reaching the ideal $100\%$ over a broad frequency range, with a temperature resilience up to 800 mK, and efficient AC signal rectification. This versatile and platform-independent superconducting diode signifies a promising component for advancing future superconducting digital electronics, including efficient logic gates, ultra-fast switches, and dynamic half-wave supercurrent rectifiers.</description>

      <title>Bloch transistor for cryogenic quantum electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the development of a Bloch transistor (BT) for the emerging platform of cryogenic quantum electronics. The BT is a fully quantum non-dissipative device facilitating precise delivery of the quantized current to the circuit, I=2efn (where n is an integer, e is the charge of an electron and f is the microwave frequency). It does not have an analogue in classical electronics, but it is required for quantum ones. The amplitude of the quantized current is adjustable through four controls: the gate or bias voltage and the frequency or amplitude of the microwave. The device features Josephson junctions operating in the regime of Bloch oscillations, an isolating electromagnetic circuit and microwave feeding leads. BT operates at a bias of 5 {\mu}V, and can deliver the quantized currents up to 10 nA.</description>

      <title>Designing Topological High-Order Van Hove Singularities: Twisted Bilayer Kagom\'e</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay of high-order Van Hove singularities and topology plays a central role in determining the nature of the electronic correlations governing the phase of a system with unique signatures characterising their presence. Layered van der Waals heterostuctures are ideal systems for band engineering through the use of twisting and proximity effects. Here, we use symmetry to demonstrate how twisted Kagom\'e bilayers can host topological high-order Van Hove singularities. We study a commensurate system with a large twist angle and demonstrate how the initial choice of high-symmetry stacking order can greatly influence the electronic structure and topology of the system. We, furthermore, study the sublattice interference in the system. Our results illustrate the rich energy landscape of twisted Kagom\'e bilayers and unveil large Chern numbers (of order 10), establishing twisted bilayer Kagom\'e as a natural playground for probing the mixing of strong correlations and topology.</description>

      <title>Effect of substrate spin-orbit coupling on the topological gap size of Shiba chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.10062v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Realizing Majorana bound states in chains of magnetic impurities on $s$-wave superconducting substrates relies on a fine tuning of the energy and hybridization of the single magnetic impurity bound states and of the spin-orbit coupling (SOC). While recent experiments investigate the influence of the former two parameters, the effect of SOC remained experimentally largely unexplored. Here, we present a scanning tunneling spectroscopy study of close-packed Mn chains along the [001]-direction on Ta(110) which has almost identical atomic and surface electronic structure compared to the previously studied Nb(110) system, but a three times larger SOC. The dominant Shiba band has a very similar dispersion, but its minigap, taken relative to $\varDelta$, is increased by a factor of 1.9 with respect to the Nb case, which can be ascribed to the stronger SOC.</description>

      <title>In-plane Ising superconductivity revealed by exchange interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19599v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional superconductors with spin-textured Fermi surfaces can be a platform for realizing unconventional pairing states and are of substantial interest in the context of quantum information science, and superconducting spintronics/orbitronics. We observed an unusual in-plane Ising like uniaxial anisotropy in the superconducting 2D electron gas (2DEG) formed at EuOx/KTaO3 (110) interfaces, where the EuOx is magnetic. This anisotropy is not evident in AlOx/KTaO3 (110) where the overlayer is non-magnetic. Our results are consistent with a highly anisotropic spin-textured Fermi surface in 2DEGs formed at the KTaO3 (110) interface that is hidden from external magnetic fields due to a near cancellation between orbital and spin moments but revealed by exchange interactions of the electrons in the 2DEG with Eu moments near the EuOx/KTaO3 (110) interface. The interactions between the uniaxial spin texture and the magnetic overlayer offer new ways to explore the interplay between magnetism and 2D superconductivity.</description>

      <title>A geometric one-fluid model of superfluid helium-4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A standard description of superfluid helim-4 is based on the concept of two components (superfluid and normal), which leads to the so called two-fluid models. However, as there are no two kinds of atoms in helium-4, the two components can not be separated. Superfluid helium-4 is not a mixture of two components, being rather a single fluid with two motions. Here, we present a geometric one-fluid model of superfluid helium-4, which is based on the Hamiltonian formulation of fluid mechanics. The model is derived from the kinetic theory of excitations and average particle motions. It can be simplified to the Hall-Vinen-Bekharevich-Khalatnikov (HVBK) two-fluid model, where it removes one fitting parameter from the HVBK model, but it also gives extra terms beyond HVBK. Actually, we show that the two-fluid models are problematic in case of higher normal velocities, where the splitting of total momentum to the superfluid and normal component becomes impossible. Finally, we show how vortex line density may be added to the state variables. The one-component model can be seen as a generalization of the two-fluid models that is geometrically consistent, fully compressible, with non-zero superfluid vorticity, and compatible with classical experiments.</description>

      <title>Realizing string-net condensation: Fibonacci anyon braiding for universal gates and sampling chromatic polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The remarkable complexity of the vacuum state of a topologically-ordered many-body quantum system encodes the character and intricate braiding interactions of its emergent particles, the anyons.} Quintessential predictions exploiting this complexity use the Fibonacci string-net condensate (Fib-SNC) and its Fibonacci anyons to go beyond classical computing. Sampling the Fib-SNC wavefunction is expected to yield estimates of the chromatic polynomial of graph objects, a classical task that is provably hard. At the same time, exchanging anyons of Fib-SNC is expected to allow fault-tolerant universal quantum computation. Nevertheless, the physical realization of Fib-SNC and its anyons remains elusive. Here, we introduce a scalable dynamical string-net preparation (DSNP) approach, suitable even for near-term quantum processors, which dynamically prepares Fib-SNC and its anyons through reconfigurable graphs. Using a superconducting quantum processor, we couple the DSNP approach with composite error-mitigation on deep circuits to successfully create, measure, and braid anyons of Fib-SNC in a scalable manner. We certify the creation of anyons by measuring their `anyon charge', finding an average experimental accuracy of $94\%$. Furthermore, we validate that exchanging these anyons yields the { expected} golden ratio~$\phi$ with~$98\%$ average accuracy and~$8\%$ measurement uncertainty. Finally, we sample the Fib-SNC to estimate the chromatic polynomial at~$\phi+2$ for {several} graphs. Our results establish the proof of principle for using Fib-SNC and its anyons for fault-tolerant universal quantum computation and {for aiming at} a classically-hard problem.</description>

      <title>Stripes, pair density wave, and holon Wigner crystal in single-band Hubbard model on diagonal square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18833v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the ground-state properties of the Hubbard model on wide diagonal square cylinders, rotated by $\pi/4$ relative to the regular lattice orientation. Using state-of-the-art density matrix renormalization group calculations with a large number of states, we convincingly demonstrate the development of a unidirectional charge density wave (CDW) characterized by infinite-length stripes along the primitive vector of square lattice in models with next-nearest-neighbor hopping $t'=-0.1\sim -0.3$ and doping $\delta \sim 14\%$. Intriguingly, analysis of pair-pair correlation functions along these stripes reveals incommensurate pair density wave (PDW) superconductivity with diverged susceptibility. To the best of our knowledge, this is probably the first controlled numerical evidence of dominant PDW in the single-band Hubbard model on square lattices. At lower doping $\delta \sim 10\%$, we observed the formation of an additional CDW order within each stripe, which aligns across different stripes, forming a holon Wigner crystal phase. The spin pattern retains antiferromagnetic stripes with anti-phase domain walls. The ordering momentum of this emerged CDW order is remarkably close to the center-of-mass momentum of Cooper pairs in the PDW phase, suggesting a multifaceted relationship between CDW and PDW ordering.</description>
