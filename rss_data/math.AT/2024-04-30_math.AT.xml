      <title>Strong minimal model theorem and Massey products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kadeishvili's minimal model theorem establishes the existence of an $A_\infty$-structure, unique up to isomorphism, on the cohomology of a dg associative algebra, which captures its homotopy type. In this note we prove the existence of minimal models that are unique up to isotopy, a stronger result obviously known to T. Kadeishvili and certainly to others, yet seemingly overlooked by mankind. We will explore how this stronger result can help in the study of Massey products. First, we show that the attempts to extract a local information from the ternary operation $\mu_3$ of our minimal model leads directly to the rediscovery of the triple Massey product. The motto is: "The triple Massey product is an invariant manifestation of $\mu_3$." We then prove that, under reasonable assumptions, the higher Massey product $\langle x_1,\ldots,x_n\rangle$ equals the set of all values $\mu_n(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$, where $\mu_n$ runs over the $n$-ary products of our minimal models. We believe that this note will help to elucidate the still somewhat enigmatic relationship between minimal models and Massey products.</description>

      <title>A rank decomposition for the topological classification of neural representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks can be thought of as applying a transformation to an input dataset. The way in which they change the topology of such a dataset often holds practical significance for many tasks, particularly those demanding non-homeomorphic mappings for optimal solutions, such as classification problems. In this work, we leverage the fact that neural networks are equivalent to continuous piecewise-affine maps, whose rank can be used to pinpoint regions in the input space that undergo non-homeomorphic transformations, leading to alterations in the topological structure of the input dataset. Our approach enables us to make use of the relative homology sequence, with which one can study the homology groups of the quotient of a manifold $\mathcal{M}$ and a subset $A$, assuming some minimal properties on these spaces.
  As a proof of principle, we empirically investigate the presence of low-rank (topology-changing) affine maps as a function of network width and mean weight. We show that in randomly initialized narrow networks, there will be regions in which the (co)homology groups of a data manifold can change. As the width increases, the homology groups of the input manifold become more likely to be preserved. We end this part of our work by constructing highly non-random wide networks that do not have this property and relating this non-random regime to Dale's principle, which is a defining characteristic of biological neural networks.
  Finally, we study simple feedforward networks trained on MNIST, as well as on toy classification and regression tasks, and show that networks manipulate the topology of data differently depending on the continuity of the task they are trained on.</description>

      <title>The integration theory of curved absolute L-infinity algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.10282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce the notion of a curved absolute $\mathcal{L}_\infty$-algebra, a structure that behaves like a curved $\mathcal{L}_\infty$-algebra where all infinite sums of operations are well-defined by definition. We develop their integration theory by introducing two new methods in integration theory: the complete Bar construction and intrinsic model category structures. They allow us to generalize all essential results of this theory quickly and from a conceptual point of view. We provide applications of our theory to rational homotopy theory, and show that curved absolute $\mathcal{L}_\infty$-algebras provide us with rational models for finite type nilpotent spaces without any pointed or connected assumptions. Furthermore, we show that the homology of rational spaces can be recovered as the homology of the complete Bar construction. We also construct new smaller models for rational mapping spaces without any hypothesis on the source simplicial set. Another source of applications is deformation theory: on the algebraic side, we show that curved absolute $\mathcal{L}_\infty$-algebras are mandatory in order to encode the deformation complexes of $\infty$-morphisms of (co)-algebras. On the geometrical side, we construct a curved absolute $\mathcal{L}_\infty$-algebra from a derived affine stack and show that it encodes the formal geometry of any finite collection of points living in any finite field extension of the base field.</description>

      <title>Formalising and Computing the Fourth Homotopy Group of the $3$-Sphere in Cubical Agda</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.00151v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Brunerie's 2016 PhD thesis contains the first synthetic proof in Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT) of the classical result that the fourth homotopy group of the 3-sphere is $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$. The proof is one of the most impressive pieces of synthetic homotopy theory to date and uses a lot of advanced classical algebraic topology rephrased synthetically. Furthermore, the proof is fully constructive and the main result can be reduced to the question of whether a particular "Brunerie number" $\beta$ can be normalised to $\pm 2$. The question of whether Brunerie's proof could be formalised in a proof assistant, either by computing this number or by formalising the pen-and-paper proof, has since remained open. In this paper, we present a complete formalisation in Cubical Agda. We do this by modifying Brunerie's proof so that a key technical result, whose proof Brunerie only sketched in his thesis, can be avoided. We also present a formalisation of a new and much simpler proof that $\beta$ is $\pm 2$. This formalisation provides us with a sequence of simpler Brunerie numbers, one of which normalises very quickly to $-2$ in Cubical Agda, resulting in a fully formalised computer-assisted proof that $\pi_4(\mathbb{S}^3) \cong \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$.</description>

      <title>Homology operations for gravity algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{M}_{0,n+1}$ be the moduli space of genus zero Riemann surfaces with $n+1$ marked points. In this paper we compute $H_*^{\Sigma_n}(\mathcal{M}_{0,n+1};\mathbb{F}_p)$ and $H_*^{\Sigma_n}(\mathcal{M}_{0,n+1};\mathbb{F}_p(\pm 1))$ for any $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and any prime $p$, where $\mathbb{F}_p(\pm 1)$ denotes the sign representation of the symmetric group $\Sigma_n$. The interest in these homology groups is twofold: on the one hand classes in these equivariant homology groups parametrize homology operations for gravity algebras. On the other hand the homotopy quotient $(\mathcal{M}_{0,n+1})_{\Sigma_n}$ is a model for the classifying space for $B_n/Z(B_n)$, the quotient of the braid group $B_n$ by its center.</description>

      <title>Coarse Alexander duality for pairs and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.00059v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a group $G$ (of type $F$) acting properly on a coarse Poincar\'{e} duality space $X$, Kapovich-Kleiner introduced a coarse version of Alexander duality between $G$ and its complement in $X$. More precisely, the cohomology of $G$ with group ring coefficients is dual to a certain \v{C}ech homology group of the family of increasing neighborhoods of a $G$-orbit in $X$. This duality applies more generally to coarse embeddings of certain contractible simplicial complexes into coarse $PD(n)$ spaces. In this paper we introduce a relative version of this \v{C}ech homology that satisfies the Eilenberg-Steenrod Exactness Axiom, and we prove a relative version of coarse Alexander duality.
  As an application we provide a detailed proof of the following result, first stated by Kapovich-Kleiner. Given a $2$-complex formed by gluing $k$ halfplanes along their boundary lines and a coarse embedding into a contractible $3$-manifold, the complement consists of $k$ deep components that are arranged cyclically in a pattern called a Jordan cycle. We use the Jordan cycle as an invariant in proving the existence of a $3$-manifold group that is virtually Kleinian but not itself Kleinian.</description>

      <title>Cohomology of configuration spaces on punctured varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2011.07153v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the theory of configuration spaces, "splitting" usually refers to the phenomenon that the configuration spaces on a manifold and those on its punctured version are closely related cohomologically. We prove a splitting theorem that is equivariant and mixed-Hodge-theoretic; both are new features in such results. As an application, we determine the generating function for the mixed Hodge numbers of the unordered configuration spaces of a multi-punctured elliptic curve.</description>

      <title>Homology and homotopy for arbitrary categories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03735v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the prime motivation for topology was Homotopy theory, which captures the general idea of a continuous transformation between two entities, which may be spaces or maps. In later decades, an algebraic formulation of topology was discovered with the development of Homology theory. Some of the deepest results in topology are about the connections between Homotopy and Homology. These results are proved using intricate constructions. This paper re-proves these connections via an axiomatic approach that provides a common ground for homotopy and homology in arbitrary categories. One of the main contributions is a re-interpretation of convexity as an extrinsic rather than intrinsic property. All the axioms and results are applicable for the familiar notions of homology and homotopy for topological spaces. We also provide a recipe for making the axioms come to fruition in arbitrary categories.</description>

      <title>Uniform approximation of Betti numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05104v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that Lefschetz's principle of approximating the cohomology of a possibly singular affine scheme of finite type over a field by the cohomology of a suitable (thickening of a) hyperplane section can be made uniform: in the affine case, we can choose the hyperplane section independently of the cohomology. Using Jouanolou's trick, this gives a new way to bound the Betti numbers of quasi-projective schemes over a field, independently of the cohomology. This is achieved through a motivic version of Deligne's generic base change formula and an axiomatic presentation of the theory of perverse sheaves. These methods produce generating families of Voevodsky motivic sheaves that are realized in perverse sheaves over any base of equal characteristic.</description>

Abstract: In this article we describe the $T_{comp}$-equivariant topological $K$-ring of a $T$-{\it cellular} simplicial toric variety. We further show that $K_{T_{comp}}^0(X)$ is isomorphic as an $R(T_{comp})$-algebra to the ring of piecewise Laurent polynomial functions on the associated fan denoted $PLP(\Delta)$. Furthermore, we compute a basis for $K_{T_{comp}}^0(X)$ as a $R(T_{comp})$-module and multiplicative structure constants with respect to this basis.</description>
