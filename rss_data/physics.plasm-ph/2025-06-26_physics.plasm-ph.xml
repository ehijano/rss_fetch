      <title>Control of pedestal-top electron density using RMP and gas puff at KSTAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the experimental results of controlling the pedestal-top electron density by applying resonant magnetic perturbation with the in-vessel control coils and the main gas puff in the 2024-2025 KSTAR experimental campaign. The density is reconstructed using a parametrized psi_N grid and the five channels of the line-averaged density measured by a two-colored interferometer. The reconstruction procedure is accelerated by deploying a multi-layer perceptron to run in about 120 microseconds and is fast enough for real-time control. A proportional-integration controller is adopted, with the controller gains being estimated from the system identification processes. The experimental results show that the developed controller can follow a dynamic target while exclusively using both actuators. The absolute percentage errors between the electron density at psi_N=0.89 and the target are approximately 1.5% median and a 2.5% average value. The developed controller can even lower the density by using the pump-out mechanism under RMP, and it can follow a more dynamic target than a single actuator controller. The developed controller will enable experimental scenario exploration within a shot by dynamically setting the density target or maintaining a constant electron density within a discharge.</description>

      <title>Global properties and stability of transonic plasma acceleration in the magnetic nozzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that transonic plasma acceleration in the converging-diverging magnetic field (magnetic nozzle) follows the unique global solution which is fully defined by the magnetic field. Such solution, which was analytically obtained earlier in the paraxial approximation, is compared here with results of the axisymmetric two-dimensional (rz) magnetohydrodynamics(MHD) simulations. It is shown that analytical solution describes well the region near the axis but also can be applied to arbitrary magnetic surfaces. The simulations with different length of the nozzle and different boundary values for plasma velocity show that the plasma flow switches to the unique transonic acceleration profile via the shock-like transition in the velocity and pressure profiles. The simulations with arbitrary (not vacuum) initial magnetic field demonstrate the global adjustment of the magnetic field such that the transonic acceleration velocity profile follows the analytic predictions with the modified magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear edge localized mode with impurity seeding in CFETR hybrid scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A critical challenge for operating fusion burning plasma in high confinement mode lies in mitigating damage caused by edge localized modes (ELMs). While impurity seeding has been experimentally validated as a reliable and effective ELM mitigation technique, its underlying physics remains insufficiently understood and requires further clarification. Through nonlinear magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, this work reproduces key features of natural ELM crash and reveals its trigger mechanism. Impurity seeding significantly affects nonlinear ELM dynamics by inducing local and global modifications to the pedestal pressure profile, driving high-n ballooning mode instabilities that govern ELM crash. Two critical control parameters -- impurity density level and poloidal seeding location -- are systematically investigated, which play key roles in the ELM crash onset timing and the resulting energy loss magnitude.</description>

      <title>Observation of Enhanced Core Impurity Transport in a Turbulence-Reduced Stellarator Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An enhancement of core impurity transport is observed for the first time in a high-density stellarator plasma with continuous lithium (Li) granule injection. When Li-granules are dropped continuously into the plasma, energy confinement is improved due to reduced turbulence. In parallel, the transport of mid- and high-Z impurities is increased. Simulations with the drift-kinetic transport code SFINCS for such plasmas show that the role of neoclassical transport prevails for the main plasma components (electrons, ions, and Zavg = 3.5). In contrast, the classical contribution is dominant in transporting high-Z impurities. This study demonstrates experimentally, for the first time also, that classical transport plays an essential role in enhancing the transport of such impurities in high-density stellarator plasmas, a situation that is achieved by continuous injection of Li-granules, which is effective for real-time wall conditioning and plasma performance improvement</description>

      <title>Relativistic Oscillating Window Driven by an Intense Laguerre Gaussian Laser Pulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-order harmonic generation by the diffraction of an intense Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) laser beam through a small aperture is studied. It is found that the 2D peripheral electron dynamics on the rim can facilitate complex interplay between the spin and orbital angular momentum interaction, which leads to distinct selection rules for LG pulses with different polarization states. In particular, when the driver is linearly polarized, the harmonic beams no longer follow a simple orbital angular momentum conservation rule. Instead, multiple LG modes with different topological charges are produced in each harmonic beam, and the number of modes equals to the harmonic order. A theory is derived and validated by simulations, which can predict the harmonic topological charges as well as their relative intensities for LG drivers with different polarization states. Our work provides fundamental insight into the behavior of light in nonlinear optics, and paves the way towards high-intensity UV or X-ray pulses carrying controllable OAM, that can serve as versatile tools at frontiers of various scientific fields.</description>

      <title>Excitation of Giant Surface Waves During Laser Wake Field Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have detected the presence of very high intensity surface waves that are excited during plasma waveguided laser wakefield acceleration. Wakefield acceleration can be enchanced by the introduction of an ``all optical" plasma waveguide that confines and guides a laser pulse at the optimal intensity over long distances, producing quasimonoenergetic multi-GeV electron bunches. However strong pulses of radio frequency radiation (RF) are also produced, and particle in cell simulations show why: a continuous stream of multi-MeV electrons are also ejected radially from the plasma due to nonlinear wave breaking, and these excite and copropagate coherently with a giant cylindrical Sommerfeld surface wave. Laboratory measurements, simulations, and analytic approximations all converge on a 20 J laser pulse exciting a 1 Joule, 400 GW broadband THz surface wave, with a peak electric field strength of 35 GV/m.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian formulation of the quasineutral Vlasov-Poisson system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Slow manifold reduction and the theory of Poisson-Dirac submanifolds are used to deduce a Hamiltonian formulation for a quasineutral limit of the planar, collisionless, magnetized Vlasov-Poisson system. Motion on the slow manifold models plasma dynamics free of fast Langmuir oscillations. Preservation of quasineutrality requires the bulk plasma flow is incompressible. The electric field is determined by counterbalancing plasma stresses that would otherwise produce compression. The Hamiltonian structure for the quasineutral model synthesizes well-known Poisson brackets for incompressible fluids and collisionless kinetic equations.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy-Induced Magnetic Field Generation in Bidimensional Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate an electromagnetic instability in two-dimensional materials arising from an anisotropy of the Fermi surface, utilizing a kinetic model accounting for the effects of the values of temperature, chemical potential and anisotropy ratio, as well as considering both linear and quadratic low-energy band structures. The wavenumber-dependent growth-rate of these modes is derived in the linear regime, and their confinement, contrasting with stable electromagnetic waves in these systems, is described. The generation of structured out-of-plane magnetic fields, as well as their behaviour in saturation, is shown using fully kinetic and non-linear simulations.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking and Parallelization of Electrostatic Particle-In-Cell for low-temperature Plasma Simulation by particle-thread Binding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Particle-In-Cell (PIC) method for plasma simulation tracks particle phase space information using particle and grid data structures. High computational costs in 2D and 3D device-scale PIC simulations necessitate parallelization, with the Charge Deposition (CD) subroutine often becoming a bottleneck due to frequent particle-grid interactions. Conventional methods mitigate dependencies by generating private grids for each core, but this approach faces scalability issues. We propose a novel approach based on a particle-thread binding strategy that requires only four private grids per node in distributed memory systems or four private grids in shared memory systems, enhancing CD scalability and performance while maintaining conventional data structures and requiring minimal changes to existing PIC codes. This method ensures complete accessibility of grid data structure for concurrent threads and avoids simultaneous access to particles within the same cell using additional functions and flags. Performance evaluations using a PIC benchmark for low-temperature partially magnetized E x B discharge simulation on a shared memory as well as a distributed memory system (1000 cores) demonstrate the method's scalability, and additionally, we show the method has little hardware dependency.</description>

      <title>$\alpha$ Effect and Magnetic Diffusivity $\beta$ in Helical Plasma under Turbulence Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the transport coefficients $\alpha$ and $\beta$ in plasma systems with varying Reynolds numbers while maintaining a unit magnetic Prandtl number. {The $\alpha$ and $\beta$ tensors parameterize the turbulent electromotive force (EMF) in terms of the large-scale magnetic field ${\bf \overline{B}}$ and current density ${\bf \overline{}}$ as follows : $\langle {\bf u}\times {\bf b} \rangle = \alpha {\bf \overline{B}}-\beta {\nabla\times \bf \overline{B}}$.} In astrophysical plasmas, high fluid Reynolds numbers ($Re$) and magnetic Reynolds numbers ($Re_\mathrm{M}$) drive turbulence, where $Re$ governs flow dynamics and $Re_\mathrm{M}$ controls magnetic field evolution. The coefficients $\alpha_{\text{semi}}$ and $\beta_{\text{semi}}$ are obtained from large-scale magnetic field data as estimates of the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ tensors, while $\beta_{\text{theo}}$ is derived from turbulent kinetic energy data. The reconstructed large-scale field $\overline{B}$ agrees with simulations, confirming consistency among $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\overline{B}$ in weakly nonlinear regimes. This highlights the need to incorporate magnetic effects under strong nonlinearity. To clarify $\alpha$ and $\beta$, we introduce a field structure model, identifying $\alpha$ as the electrodynamic induction effect and $\beta$ as the fluid-like diffusion effect. The agreement between our method and direct simulations suggests that plasma turbulence and magnetic interactions can be analyzed using fundamental physical quantities. Moreover, $\alpha_{\text{semi}}$ and $\beta_{\text{semi}}$, which successfully reproduce the numerically obtained magnetic field, provide a benchmark for future theoretical studies.</description>

      <title>Non-linear MHD modelling of shattered pellet injection in ASDEX Upgrade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shattered pellet injection (SPI) is selected for the disruption mitigation system in ITER, due to deeper penetration, expected assimilation efficiency and prompt material delivery. This article describes non-linear magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of SPI in the ASDEX Upgrade tokamak to test the mitigation efficiency of different injection parameters for neon-doped deuterium pellets using the JOREK code. The simulations are executed as fluid simulations, while additional marker particles are used to evolve the charge state distribution and radiation property of impurities based on OpenADAS atomic data, i.e., a collisional-radiative model is used. Neon fraction scans between 0 - 10% are performed. Numerical results show that the thermal quench (TQ) occurs in two stages. In the first stage, approximately half of the thermal energy is abruptly lost, primarily through convective and conductive transport in the stochastic fields. This stage is relatively independent of the neon fraction. In the second stage, where the majority of the remaining thermal energy is lost, radiation plays a dominant role. In case of pure deuterium injection, this second stage may not occur at all. A larger fraction ($\sim $20%) of the total material in the pellet is assimilated in the plasma for low neon fraction pellets ($\leq 0.12\%$) due to the full thermal collapse of the plasma occurring later than in high neon fraction scenarios. Nevertheless, the total number of assimilated neon atoms increases with increasing neon fraction. The effects of fragment size and penetration speed are then numerically studied, showing that slower and smaller fragments promote edge cooling and the formation of a cold front. Faster fragments result in shorter TQ duration and higher assimilation as they reach the hotter plasma regions quicker.</description>
