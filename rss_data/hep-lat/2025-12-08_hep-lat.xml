      <title>QCD phase structure at finite isospin chemical potential and smaller-than-physical quark mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introduction of a nonzero isospin chemical potential in QCD leads to the emergence of a pion condensed phase at sufficiently large $\mu_I$, bounded by a second order transition line. At zero temperature the pion condensate appears at $\mu_I = m_\pi / 2$. Recent numerical studies at physical quark masses show that the pion condensation boundary remains vertical up to the meeting point with the chiral crossover line. If this result remains valid when the light quark mass (and the pion mass) goes to zero, then in the chiral limit at temperatures below the chiral transition pion condensation happens at arbitrary nonzero $\mu_I$. We report on results of a lattice QCD simulation of a 2+1 flavour QCD at nonzero isospin chemical potential, at smaller-than-physical light quark mass, that support this scenario.</description>

      <title>Flux-tube structure in finite temperature QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of the structure of the chromoelectrical field created by a static quark-antiquark pair in lattice QCD with 2+1 flavours of dynamical quarks, where the quark masses are set to their physical values. The analysis covers a wide range of temperatures both above and below the chiral crossover, and explores varying quark-antiquark distances, with the aim of identifying signals of deconfinement and string breaking in the field structure. To this end we apply the zero-curl perturbative field subtraction method, developed in our earlier studies of pure gauge SU(3) theory and of full QCD at zero temperature.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Quantum Simulations of Energy-Loss and Hadronization in Non-Abelian Gauge Theories: SU(2) Lattice Gauge Theory in 1+1D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulations of energy loss and hadronization are essential for understanding a range of phenomena in non-equilibrium strongly-interacting matter. We establish a framework for performing such simulations on a quantum computer and apply it to a heavy quark moving across a modest-sized 1+1D SU(2) lattice of light quarks. Conceptual advances with regard to simulations of non-Abelian versus Abelian theories are developed, allowing for the evolution of the energy in light quarks, of their local non-Abelian charge densities, and of their multi-partite entanglement to be computed. The non-trivial action of non-Abelian charge operators on arbitrary states suggests mapping the heavy quarks to qubits alongside the light quarks, and limits the heavy-quark motion to discrete steps among spatial lattice sites. Further, the color entanglement among the heavy quarks and light quarks is implemented using hadronic operators, and Domain Decomposition is shown to be effective in quantum state preparation. Scalable quantum circuits that account for the heterogeneity of non-Abelian charge sectors across the lattice are used to prepare the interacting ground-state wavefunction in the presence of heavy quarks. The discrete motion of heavy quarks between adjacent spatial sites is implemented using fermionic SWAP operations. Quantum simulations of the dynamics of a system on $L=3$ spatial sites are performed using IBM's ${\tt ibm\_pittsburgh}$ quantum computer using 18 qubits, for which the circuits for state preparation, motion, and one second-order Trotter step of time evolution have a two-qubit depth of 398. A suite of error mitigation techniques are used to extract the observables from the simulations, providing results that are in good agreement with classical simulations. The framework presented here generalizes straightforwardly to other non-Abelian groups, including SU(3) for quantum chromodynamics.</description>

      <title>Lattice field theory for superconducting circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large superconducting quantum circuits have a number of important applications in quantum computing. Accurately predicting the performance of these devices from first principles is challenging, as it requires solving the many-body Schr\"odinger equation. This work introduces a new, general ab-initio method for analyzing large quantum circuits based on lattice field theory, a tool commonly applied in nuclear and particle physics. This method is competitive with state-of-the-art techniques such as tensor networks, but avoids introducing systematic errors due to truncation of the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space associated with superconducting phases. The approach is applied to fluxonium, a specific many-component superconducting qubit with favorable qualities for quantum computation. A systematic study of the influence of impedance on fluxonium is conducted that parallels previous experimental studies, and ground capacitance effects are explored. The qubit frequency and charge noise dephasing rate are extracted from statistical analyses of charge noise, where thousands of instantiations of charge disorder in the Josephson junction array of a fixed fluxonium qubit are explicitly averaged over at the microscopic level. This is difficult to achieve with any other existing method.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping SU(3) Lattice Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply the positivity bootstrap approach to SU(3) lattice Yang-Mills (YM) theory, extending previous studies of large N and SU(2) theories by incorporating multiple-trace Wilson loop operators. By utilizing Hermitian and reflection positivity conditions, alongside Schwinger-Dyson (SD) loop equations, we compute rigorous bounds for the expectation values of plaquette Wilson loops in 2D, 3D, and 4D YM theories. Our results exhibit clear convergence and are consistent with known analytic or numerical results. To enhance the approach, we introduce a novel twist-reflection positivity condition, which we prove to be exact in 2D YM theory. Additionally, we propose a dimensional-reduction truncation, where Wilson loop operators are effectively restricted to a lower-dimensional subplane, significantly simplifying computations. SD equations for double-trace Wilson loops are also derived in detail. Our findings suggest that the positivity bootstrap method is broadly applicable to higher-rank gauge theories beyond single-trace cases, providing a solid foundation for further non-perturbative investigations of gauge theories using positivity-based methods.</description>
