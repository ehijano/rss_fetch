      <title>Mechanism and Stability of Li-Dynamics in Amorphous Li-Ti-P-S Based Mixed Ionic-Electronic Conductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixed ionic-electronic conductor (MIEC) exhibit both high ionic and electronic conductivity to improve the battery performance. In this work, we investigate the mechanism and stability of transport channels in recently developed our MIEC material, amorphous Ti-doped lithium phosphorus sulfide (LPS), using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with a 99\% accurate machine-learning force field (MLFF) trained on \textit{ab-initio} MD data. The achieved MLFF helps efficient large-scale MD simulations on LPS with three Ti concentrations (10\%, 20\%, and 30\%) and six temperatures (25$^\mathrm{o}$C to 225$^\mathrm{o}$C) to calculate ionic conductivity, activation energy, Li-ion transport mechanism, and configurational entropy. Results show that ionic conductivities and activation energies are consistent with our recent experimental values. Moreover, Li-ion transport occurs via free-volume diffusion facilitated by the formation of disordered Li-S polyhedra. Enhanced stability of transport channels at 10\% and 20\% Ti doping, compared to 0\% and 30\%, is observed through the analysis of the vibrational and configurational entropy of these disordered Li-S polyhedra. Overall, this study highlights the utility of MLFF-based large-scale MD simulations in explaining the transport mechanism and its stability of Li-ion in Ti doped LPS electrolyte with significant computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Origins of chalcogenide perovskite instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chalcogenide perovskites, particularly II-IV ABS3 compounds, are a promising class of materials for optoelectronic applications. However, these materials frequently exhibit instability in two respects: 1) a preference for structures containing one-dimensional edge- or face-sharing octahedral networks instead of the three-dimensional corner-sharing perovskite framework (polymorphic instability), and (2) a tendency to decompose into competing compositions (hull instability). We evaluate the stability of 81 ABS3 compounds using Density Functional Theory, finding that only BaZrS3 and BaHfS3 are both polymorphically and hull stable, with the NH4CdCl3-type structure the preferred polymorph for 77% of these compounds. Comparison with existing tolerance factor models demonstrates that these approaches work well for known perovskites but overpredict stability for compositions without published experimental results. Polymorphic stability analysis reveals that perovskite structures are stabilized by strong B-S bonding interactions, while needle structures exhibit minimal B-S covalency, suggesting that electrostatic rather than covalent interactions drive the preference for edge-sharing motifs. Hull stability analysis comparing ABS3 to ABO3 analogues reveals a weaker inductive effect in sulfides as a possible explanation for the scarcity of sulfides compared with oxides. The relative instability of ABS3 compounds is further supported by experimental synthesis attempts. These findings provide fundamental insights into the origins of instability in chalcogenide perovskites and highlight the challenges in expanding this promising materials class beyond the few materials that have been reported to date.</description>

      <title>Theory of infrared magneto-optical effects from chiral phonons in solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In crystals with broken time-reversal symmetry, zone-center phonons can acquire a finite angular momentum via velocity-dependent forces on the nuclei. Despite having the same order of magnitude as the electron spin angular momentum, the phonon angular momentum can be hard to detect because the frequency splitting is small. Here, by developing a theory of lattice magneto-optical effects in reflection and transmission, we show that infrared magnetic circular dichroism is a sensitive probe of zone-center phonon chirality. We evaluate the infrared magneto-optical Faraday, Kerr, and circular-dichroism spectra of CrI$_3$ from time-dependent density-functional theory in the adiabatic local-density approximation. We find sizeable circular dichroism from the infrared-active E$_u$ mode at $\approx 214$ cm$^{-1}$, even though the calculated splitting is only 0.22 cm$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Polymorphism Crystal Structure Prediction with Adaptive Space Group Diversity Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystalline materials can form different structural arrangements (i.e. polymorphs) with the same chemical composition, exhibiting distinct physical properties depending on how they were synthesized or the conditions under which they operate. For example, carbon can exist as graphite (soft, conductive) or diamond (hard, insulating). Computational methods that can predict these polymorphs are vital in materials science, which help understand stability relationships, guide synthesis efforts, and discover new materials with desired properties without extensive trial-and-error experimentation. However, effective crystal structure prediction (CSP) algorithms for inorganic polymorph structures remain limited. We propose ParetoCSP2, a multi-objective genetic algorithm for polymorphism CSP that incorporates an adaptive space group diversity control technique, preventing over-representation of any single space group in the population guided by a neural network interatomic potential. Using an improved population initialization method and performing iterative structure relaxation, ParetoCSP2 not only alleviates premature convergence but also achieves improved convergence speed. Our results show that ParetoCSP2 achieves excellent performance in polymorphism prediction, including a nearly perfect space group and structural similarity accuracy for formulas with two polymorphs but with the same number of unit cell atoms. Evaluated on a benchmark dataset, it outperforms baseline algorithms by factors of 2.46-8.62 for these accuracies and improves by 44.8\%-87.04\% across key performance metrics for regular CSP.

      <title>Semi-empirical Pseudopotential Method for Monolayer Transitional-Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Semiempirical Pseudopotential Method for accurately computing the band structures and Bloch states of monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), including MoS2, MoSe2, WS2, and WSe2. Our approach combines local and non-local pseudopotentials, carefully fitted to replicate fully self-consistent density-functional theory results, while using only a minimal set of empirical parameters. By expressing the total potential as a sum of a few separable components, we achieve both accuracy and computational efficiency. The resulting pseudopotentials are transferable to more complex systems such as bilayer, trilayer, and moire superlattices, offering a reliable foundation for large-scale simulations. When integrated with artificial intelligence techniques, this method provides a powerful tool for the design and exploration of TMDC-based nanodevices for next-generation optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Uni-Traveling-Carrier Photodiode Based on MoS2/GaN van der Waals Heterojunction for High-Speed Visible-Light Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uni-traveling-carrier photodiodes (UTC-PDs), which utilize only electrons as the active carriers, have become indispensable in high-speed optoelectronics due to their unique capabilities, such as high saturation power and broad bandwidth. However, extending the operating wavelengths into the visible region for wider applications is challenging due to the lack of suitable wide-bandgap III-V semiconductor combinations with the necessary band alignment and lattice matching. Here, we show that a UTC-PD based on a van der Waals heterojunction composed of a 2D transition metal dichalcogenide, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), as a photoabsorption layer and a gallium nitride (GaN) film as a carrier transport layer, offers a solution to this challenge. The fast vertical carrier transport across the heterointerface is enabled by the direct epitaxial growth of a MoS2 layer on a GaN film. Our device demonstrates a frequency response in the several-GHz range with a quantum efficiency on the order of 1% throughout the entire visible spectrum, highlighting the promise for high-speed visible optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Can the Oxygen $2p$ Band Be Hole Doped?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of $p$-type oxide semiconductors remains impeded by the inherently low-lying valence-band maximum (VBM) dominated by O-2$p$ states. A prevailing approach to mitigate this limitation is to elevate the VBM by introducing cation states that hybridize with O-2$p$ orbitals or lie energetically above the O-2$p$ level. Nevertheless, the $p$-type oxides reported to date exhibit limited hole mobilities. To expand the search space, it is essential to accurately understand the intrinsic difficulty of introducing holes into O-2$p$ orbitals. Accordingly, we evaluated 845 oxides to identify those in which holes can be doped into O-2$p$ bands. Our high-throughput screening revealed CaCdO$_2$ as the only promising exemplar, in which the VBM is slightly hybridized with deep-lying Cd-3$d$ states. Our screening suggests that hole doping into O-2$p$ orbitals is extremely difficult and thus reinforces the effectiveness of the traditional ``VBM-raising strategy.''</description>

      <title>How oxygen influences the catalytic activity of iron during carbon nanotube nucleation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The catalytic activity of metal nanoparticles toward nucleation of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) is fundamental to achieving structure-controlled growth using catalytic chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Despite the success of oxidized catalysts in SWCNT growth, there is a lack of understanding regarding how oxygen influences the catalysts and the nucleation process. Quantum chemical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations employing density functional tight binding (DFTB) demonstrate that the kinetics of carbon nucleation on an iron nanoparticle catalyst can be tuned via oxygen loading. Increasing the oxygen content in the catalyst leads to activation of surface-bound carbon species and enhanced carbon chain growth due to respective weakening and strengthening of the C-C and Fe-C bonding. This is due to oxygen modulating the electronic structure of the iron catalyst, with the Fermi level of the catalyst increasing proportionally with oxygen content until the iron:oxygen stoichiometry reaches parity. The increase in Fe 3d states near the Fermi level also promotes the donation of electron density into unoccupied C 2p states, activating C-C bonds which in turn facilitates carbon chain growth and slows carbon ring condensation.</description>

      <title>PAMBE growth of GaN nanowires on metallic ZrN buffers -- a critical impact of ZrN layer thickness on the growth temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An impact of thin metallic ZrN layers on Si and sapphire wafers on substrate temperature during MBE growth of GaN nanowires is studied. Using nucleation kinetics of GaN as a sensitive probe we show that a thin ZrN layer strongly increases the substrate temperature, which significantly affects the dimensions and density of the nanowires. To quantify the effect we developed a technique of optical pyrometer calibration that allows reliable determination of emissivity, and thus precise measurement of temperature of substrates with unknown optical parameters, such as ZrN buffers of various thicknesses. Our results show that emissivity of ZrN-coated Si and sapphire wafers differs significantly from the bulk ZrN and increases drastically for films thinner than ~100 nm. Simple calculations indicate that ignoring the influence of the thin film may lead to huge errors in temperature readings and consequently to losing the growth control. Then, we show that we can compensate for the impact of ZrN buffer on substrate temperature and grow identical nanowire arrays on Si substrates with and without ZrN layers. Finally, having identical arrays of GaN nanowires we used X-ray diffraction to compare nanowire arrangements on Si and ZrN/Si substrates with a thin SiN nucleation layer.</description>

      <title>Towards 4D modelisation of thermal-field emission from semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theoretical picture of thermal field-emission (TFE) from semiconductors has been limited to 1D and 2D models. This can be attributed to the complex and interdependent phenomena that is involved in TFE from semiconductors which makes the calculations cumbersome. Such limitations result in a partial understanding of the underlying physics of semiconducting surfaces under high electrical fields, which requires the addition of the temporal dimension (4D) to yield a realistic model. Here we develop a 3D model of TFE from semiconductors that can take arbitrary geometries and doping levels. Our model successfully reproduces the characteristic saturation plateau of some semiconductors, as well as its dependence in temperature. The model is found to be in good agreement with experimental data from ntype Germanium at a qualitative level. We propose this model as a platform for future extensions into the full 4D framework, incorporating temporal dynamics for a more complete and predictive description of thermal-field emission from semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Robustness of Floquet topological phase at room temperature: a first-principles dynamics study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonadiabatic Thouless pumping of electrons is studied within the framework of topological Floquet engineering, particularly focused on how atomic lattice dynamics affect the emergent Floquet topological phase in trans-polyacetylene under the driving electric field. As similarly done in the earlier work [Zhou and Kanai, J. Phys. Chem. Lett., 12, 4496 (2021)], the real-time time-dependent density functional theory and Ehrenfest dynamics simulations were used to investigate the extent to which the number of pumped charges remains equal to the topological invariant, the winding number, when the temperature effect of ions and the dynamical coupling of electrons and ions are taken into account. Our theoretical work shows that the Floquet topological phase remains intact but the condition on the driving field necessary for observing the topological phase becomes more limiting.</description>

      <title>PolyMicros: Bootstrapping a Foundation Model for Polycrystalline Material Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Foundation Models for Materials Science are poised to revolutionize the discovery, manufacture, and design of novel materials with tailored properties and responses. Although great strides have been made, successes have been restricted to materials classes where multi-million sample data repositories can be readily curated (e.g., atomistic structures). Unfortunately, for many structural and functional materials (e.g., mesoscale structured metal alloys), such datasets are too costly or prohibitive to construct; instead, datasets are limited to very few examples. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel machine learning approach for learning from hyper-sparse, complex spatial data in scientific domains. Our core contribution is a physics-driven data augmentation scheme that leverages an ensemble of local generative models, trained on as few as five experimental observations, and coordinates them through a novel diversity curation strategy to generate a large-scale, physically diverse dataset. We utilize this framework to construct PolyMicros, the first Foundation Model for polycrystalline materials (a structural material class important across a broad range of industrial and scientific applications). We demonstrate the utility of PolyMicros by zero-shot solving several long standing challenges related to accelerating 3D experimental microscopy. Finally, we make both our models and datasets openly available to the community.</description>

      <title>Resolving Discrepancies in Wood Micromechanics: Strain-Mapped Compression of Tracheid Wall Micropillars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wood's increasing role as a structural resource in sustainable materials selection demands accurate characterization of its mechanical behavior. Its performance arises from a hierarchical structure, where the dominant load-bearing component is the S2 layer of tracheid cell walls-a thick, fiber-reinforced composite of cellulose microfibrils embedded in hemicelluloses and lignin. Due to the small dimensions and anisotropic nature of the S2 layer, mechanical testing presents significant challenges, particularly in producing homogeneous stress and strain fields. In this study, we apply micropillar compression (MPC) combined with digital image correlation (DIC) to Norway spruce tracheids, enabling direct and model-free strain measurements at the cell wall scale. Micropillars were oriented at different microfibril angles (MFAs), confirming the expected dependence of stiffness and yield stress on ultrastructural alignment, with higher stiffness and yield stress at low MFAs. For these under compression fibril-aligned kink bands occurred, while shear related failure was observed at higher angles. A parameter study on the acceleration voltage of the Scanning Electron Microscope revealed that electron beam exposure significantly degrades pillar integrity, which could explain data scatter and mechanical underestimation in earlier MPC studies. By controlling imaging protocols and using DIC-based strain measurements, we report the highest direct measurements of wood cell wall stiffness to date-up to 42 GPa for MFA=0{\deg}-closer matching micromechanical model predictions compared to previous results. Findings are compared with Finite Element Method-based displacement corrections to establish a robust protocol for probing soft, anisotropic biological composites' mechanical behavior while clarifying longstanding inconsistencies in reported results of wood MPC measurements.</description>

      <title>Passive radiative cooling using temperature-dependent emissivity can sometimes outperform static emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In passive sky-facing radiative cooling, wavelength-selective thermal emitters in the atmospheric transparency window of 8-13 $\mu$m can reach lower temperatures compared to broadband emitters, but broadband emitters always have higher cooling power when the emitter is warmer than the ambient. Here, we propose a temperature-tunable thermal emitter that switches between a wavelength-selective state -- with high emissivity only in the atmospheric transparency window of 8-13 $\mu$m -- and a broadband-emissive state with high emissivity in the 3-25 $\mu$m range, thus maintaining high cooling potential across all temperatures. We also propose a realization of such a temperature-tunable emitter using the phase transition of vanadium dioxide (VO$_2$), which can be tuned to the ambient temperature using a combination of doping and defect engineering.</description>

      <title>In situ studies of a molten metal anode ablation in a nearly atmospheric pressure DC arc</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A DC arc with a meltable metal anode in a near-atmospheric pressure hydrocarbon gas is an emerging method for producing single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). In these systems, evaporation of the molten metal anode determines the formation of catalyst seed particles needed for SWCNT growth, and therefore, should be monitored, controlled, and optimized. Evaluating the anode ablation rate by weighing the anode before and after a synthesis run is unfeasible due to anode carburization in the hydrocarbon atmosphere. To overcome this, we implemented a high-speed, 2D, 2-color pyrometry for reliable temperature measurements of the molten anode in a DC arc. The obtained temperature fields were used to calculate the anode ablation rates. Results showed the importance of resolving the arc and molten pool dynamics, as well as addressing the issue of reflections. Furthermore, significant changes in ablation rates were revealed upon addition of CH4, which must be considered when scaling up the production of SWCNTs.</description>

      <title>Multi-angle precession electron diffraction (MAPED): a versatile approach to 4D-STEM precession</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precession of a converged beam during acquisition of a 4D-STEM dataset improves strain, orientation, and phase mapping accuracy by averaging over continuous angles of illumination. Precession experiments usually rely on integrated systems, where automatic alignments lead to fast, high-quality results. The dependence of these experiments on specific hardware and software is evident even when switching to non-integrated detectors on a precession tool, as experimental set-up becomes challenging and time-consuming. Here, we introduce multi-angle precession electron diffraction (MAPED): a method to perform precession electron diffraction by collecting sequential 4D-STEM scans at different incident beam tilts. The multiple diffraction datasets are averaged together post-acquisition, resulting in a single dataset that minimizes the impact of the curvature and orientation of the Ewald sphere relative to the crystal under study. Our results demonstrate that even four additional tilts improved measurement of material properties, namely strain and orientation, as compared to single-tilt 4D-STEM experiments. We show the versatility and flexibility of our few-tilt precession approach with data collected on a number of microscopes with different hardware configurations and a variety of detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indium gallium nitride (InGaN) quantum well (QW) micro- and nano-scale light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are vital to the next-generation optoelectronic applications such as ultrahigh-speed optical interconnects and near-eye augmented/virtual reality displays. However, scaling to nanoscale dimensions introduces several challenges, including an increased nonradiative recombination from surface states and defect-related emission degradation. In this work, we present a high-performance, strain-relaxed nanoscale LED array, fabricated using a top-down nanostructuring approach applied to a high-quality, all-InGaN (quantum well/barrier) LED structure grown by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy (PAMBE) on bulk GaN substrates. Combining an ultra-low threading dislocation density bulk GaN substrate and effective sidewall passivation with atomic layer deposition (ALD) results in excellent diode rectification characteristics and extremely low leakage currents. Electroluminescence measurements reveal bright blue emission with a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 0.46% at an elevated injection current density of ~1.2 kA/cm2.</description>

      <title>In-Plane Ni-O-Ni Bond Angles as Structural Fingerprints of Superconductivity in Layered Nickelates: Effects of Pressure, Strain, Layering, and Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the structural and electronic conditions conducive to superconductivity in layered nickelates using density functional theory with Hubbard corrections (DFT+$U$). For both the bilayer and 1-3 polymorphs of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, we find that the in-plane Ni-O-Ni bond angles under pressure strongly correlate with the experimentally observed superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) dome, and may serve as a reasonable proxy. Under compressive strain, the bond angles straighten, peaking near 2\% strain-consistent with experimental reports of superconductivity in strained bilayer thin films. However, the bond angles at this strain are more bent than those achieved under hydrostatic pressure, correlating with a lower $T_c$. We show that increasing the number of NiO$_2$ layers, as in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, or substituting heavier rare-earth elements (e.g., Pr) raises the pressure required to reach the structural configuration associated with superconductivity. Our results indicate that these systems require higher external pressure to achieve in-plane bond straightening. Varying the on-site Coulomb interaction $U$ reveals that stronger electronic correlations delay the structural transition and favor high-spin states. This suggests that moderate correlation strength may be optimal for superconductivity, with stronger correlation preventing the formation of favorable bond geometries. Electronic structure analysis shows that the Ni $e_g$ orbitals dominate near the Fermi level and shift downward with pressure, enhancing Ni-O hybridization. These results highlight how pressure and strain tune structural features that may be essential for engineering high-$T_c$ phases in nickelate superconductors.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional topological orbital Hall effect caused by magnetic hopfions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic hopfions are non-collinear spin textures that are characterized by an integer topological invariant, called Hopf index. The three-dimensional magnetic solitons can be thought of as a tube with a twisted magnetization that has been closed at both ends to form a torus. The tube consists of a magnetic whirl called in-plane skyrmion or bimeron. Although hopfions have been observed by microscopy techniques, their detection remains challenging as they lack an electronic hallmark so far. Here we predict a three-dimensional orbital Hall effect caused by hopfion textures: When an electric field is applied, the hopfion generates a transverse current of orbital angular momentum. The effect arises due to the local emergent field that gives rise to in-plane and out-of-plane orbital Hall conductivities. This orbital Hall response can be seen as a hallmark of hopfions and allows us to distinguish them from other textures, like skyrmioniums, that look similar in real-space microscopy experiments. While the two-dimensional topological invariant of a skyrmion determines its topological Hall transport, the unique three-dimensional topological orbital Hall effect can be identified with the three-dimensional topological invariant that is the Hopf index. Our results make hopfions attractive for spin-orbitronic applications because their orbital signatures allow for their detection in devices and give rise to large orbital torques.</description>

      <title>The QUEST Database of Highly-Accurate Excitation Energies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report theoretical best estimates of vertical transition energies (VTEs) for a large number of excited states and molecules: the \textsc{quest} database. This database includes 1489 \emph{aug}-cc-pVTZ VTEs (731 singlets, 233 doublets, 461 triplets, and 64 quartets) for both valence and Rydberg transitions occurring in molecules containing from 1 to 16 non-hydrogen atoms. \textsc{Quest} also includes a significant list of VTEs for states characterized by a partial or genuine double-excitation character, known to be particularly challenging for many computational methods. The vast majority of the reported values are deemed chemically-accurate, that is, are within $\pm0.05$ eV of the FCI/\emph{aug}-cc-pVTZ estimate. This allows for a balanced assessment of the performance of popular excited-state methodologies. We report the results of such benchmarks for various single- and multi-reference wavefunction approaches, and provide extensive supporting information allowing testing of other models. All corresponding data associated with the \textsc{quest} database, along with analysis tools, can be found in the associated \textsc{GitHub} repository at the following URL: https://github.com/pfloos/QUESTDB.</description>

      <title>Current-Controlled Magnon-Magnon Coupling in an On-Chip Cavity Resonator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Harnessing spin currents to control magnon dynamics enables new functionalities in magnonic devices. Here, we demonstrate current-controlled magnon-magnon coupling between cavity and boundary modes in an ultrathin film of Bi-doped yttrium iron garnet (BiYIG). Cavity modes emerge in a BiYIG region between two Pt nanostripes, where interfacial anisotropy modifies the magnon dispersion. These modes hybridize with boundary magnons confined within the Pt-capped BiYIG, resulting in an anticrossing gap. Modeling based on dipole-exchange spin-wave dispersion accurately reproduces the observed modes and their hybridization. Spin current injection via the spin Hall effect in a Pt nanostripe disrupts the cavity boundary conditions and suppresses both cavity modes and hybridization upon driving the system beyond the damping compensation threshold. Furthermore, tuning the microwave power applied to a microstrip antenna enables controlled detuning of the anticrossing gap. Our findings provide a platform for exploring spin current-magnon interactions and designing on-chip reconfigurable magnonic devices.</description>

      <title>Orbital Pumping in Ferrimagnetic Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the detection of pure orbital currents generated by both coherent and thermal magnons in the magnetic insulator Bi-doped yttrium iron garnet (BiYIG). The pumping of orbital and spin currents is jointly investigated in nano-devices made of naturally oxidized Cu, pure Cu, Pt, and Cr. The absence of charge conduction in BiYIG and the negligible spin-to-charge conversion of oxidized Cu allows us to disambiguate the orbital current contribution. Comparative measurements on YIG and BiYIG show that the origin of the orbital pumping in BiYIG/oxidized Cu is the dynamics of the orbital magnetization in the magnetic insulator. In Cr, the pumping signal is dominated by the negative spin Hall effect rather than the positive orbital Hall effect, indicating that orbital currents represent a minority of the total angular momentum current pumped from the magnetic insulator. Our results also evidence that improving the interfacial transparency significantly enhances pumping efficiencies not only for spin, but also for orbital currents.</description>

      <title>Thermal conductivity minimum with thickness in ultrathin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermal properties of solids under nanoscale confinement are currently not understood at the atomic level. Recent numerical studies have highlighted the presence of a minimum in the thermal conductivity as a function of thickness for ultrathin films at a thickness about 1-2 nm, which cannot be described by existing theories. We develop a theoretical description of thin films which predicts a new physical law for heat transfer at the nanoscale. In particular, due to the strong redistribution of phonon momentum states in reciprocal space (with a transition from a spherical Debye surface to a different homotopy group $\mathbb{Z}$ at strong confinement), the low-energy phonon density of states no longer follows Debye's law but rather a cubic law with frequency, which then crosses over to Debye's law at a crossover frequency proportional to the average speed of sound of the material and inversely proportional to the film thickness. Concomitantly, this implies that the phonon population becomes dominated by low-energy phonons as confinement increases, which then leads to a higher thermal conductivity under extreme confinement. The theory is able to reproduce the thermal conductivity minimum in recent molecular simulations data for ultrathin silicon and provides useful guidelines as to tune the minimum position based on the mechanical properties of the material.</description>

      <title>Bubble Dynamics Transformer: Microrheology at Ultra-High Strain Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser-induced inertial cavitation (LIC)-where microscale vapor bubbles nucleate due to a focused high-energy pulsed laser and then violently collapse under surrounding high local pressures-offers a unique opportunity to investigate soft biological material mechanics at extremely high strain rates (&gt;1000 1/s). Traditional rheological tools are often limited in these regimes by loading speed, resolution, or invasiveness. Here we introduce novel machine learning (ML) based microrheological frameworks that leverage LIC to characterize the viscoelastic properties of biological materials at ultra-high strain rates. We utilize ultra-high-speed imaging to capture time-resolved bubble radius dynamics during LIC events in various soft viscoelastic materials. These bubble radius versus time measurements are then analyzed using a newly developed Bubble Dynamics Transformer (BDT), a neural network trained on physics-based simulation data. The BDT accurately infers material viscoelastic parameters, eliminating the need for iterative fitting or complex inversion processes. This enables fast, accurate, and non-contact characterization of soft materials under extreme loading conditions, with significant implications for biomedical applications and materials science.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we provide a brief perspective on recent developments in the study of shear thickening in dense suspensions. We give a rapid overview of the state of the art and discuss current models aiming to describe this particular rheology. Although most of the experiments and simulation studies are conducted in "ideal" flows, where the sample is confined without an open boundary condition, we have decided to highlight more realistic flow conditions. We further provide an overview on how to relate the recently proposed constitutive models to these more practical flow conditions like pipe flow or flow down an incline.</description>

      <title>DFT+U+J with linear response parameters predicts non-magnetic oxide band gaps with hybrid-functional accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.08487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.08487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: First-principles Hubbard-corrected approximate density-functional theory (DFT+U) is a low-cost, potentially high throughput method of simulating materials, but it has been hampered by empiricism and inconsistent band-gap correction in transition-metal oxides. DFT+U property prediction of non-magnetic systems such as d0 and d10 transition-metal oxides is typically faced with excessively large calculated Hubbard U values, and with difficulty in obtaining acceptable band-gaps and lattice volumes. Meanwhile, Hund's exchange coupling J is an important but often neglected component of DFT+U, and the J parameter has proven challenging to directly calculate by means of linear response. In this work, we provide a revised formula for computing Hund's J using established self-consistent field DFT+U codes. For non-magnetic systems, we introduce a non-approximate technique for calculating U and J simultaneously in such codes, at no additional cost. Using unmodified Quantum ESPRESSO, we assess the resulting values using two different DFT+U functionals incorporating J, namely the widely used DFT+(U-J) and the readily available DFT+U+J. We assess a test set comprising TiO2, ZrO2, HfO2, Cu2O and ZnO, and apply the corrections both to metal and oxygen centered pseudoatomic subspaces. Starting from the PBE functional, we find that DFT+(U-J) is significantly out-performed in band-gap accuracy by DFT+U+J, the mean absolute band-gap error of which matches that of the hybrid functional HSE06. ZnO, a long-standing challenge case for DFT+U, is addressed by means of Zn 4s instead of Zn 3d correction, whereupon the first-principles DFT+U+J band-gap error falls to half of that reported for HSE06, yet remains larger than for PBE0.</description>

      <title>Observation of dendrite formation at Li metal-electrolyte interface: A machine-learning enhanced constant potential framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14025v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uncontrollable dendrites growth during electrochemical cycles leads to low Coulombic efficiency and critical safety issues in Li metal batteries. Hence, a comprehensive understanding of the dendrite formation mechanism is essential for further enhancing the performance of Li metal batteries. Machine learning accelerated molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can provide atomic-scale resolution for various key processes at an ab-initio level accuracy. However, traditional MD simulation tools hardly capture Li electrochemical depositions, due to lack of an electrochemical constant potential (ConstP) condition. In this work, we propose a ConstP approach that combines a machine learning force field with the charge equilibration method to reveal the dynamic process of dendrites nucleation at Li metal anode surfaces. Our simulations show that inhomogeneous Li depositions, following Li aggregations in amorphous inorganic components of solid electrolyte interphases, can initiate dendrites nucleation. Our study provides microscopic insights for Li dendrites formations in Li metal anodes. More importantly, we present an efficient and accurate simulation method for modeling realistic ConstP conditions, which holds considerable potential for broader applications in modeling complex electrochemical interfaces.</description>

Abstract: Quantum geometry, including Berry curvature and the quantum metric, of the electronic Bloch bands has been studied via nonlinear responses in topological materials. Naturally, these material systems with intrinsic strong nonlinear responses also form the key component in nonlinear electronic devices. However, the previous reported quantum geometry effects are mainly observed at cryogenic temperatures, hindering their application in practical devices. Here we report the tuneable strong room-temperature second-harmonic transport response in a quantum magnet, TbMn6Sn6, which is governed by the quantum metric and can be tuned with applied magnetic fields. We show that around room temperature, which is close to the spontaneous spin-reorientation transition, the magnetic configurations, and therefore the related symmetry breaking phases, are easily controlled via magnetic fields. Our results also show that manipulation of the symmetries of the magnetic structure presents an effective route to tuneable quantum-geometry-based devices.</description>

      <title>Magnetic switching of phonon angular momentum in a ferrimagnetic insulator</title>

Abstract: Circularly polarized phonons offer a new route for mediating angular momentum in solids. However, controlling phonon angular momentum without altering the material's structure or composition remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate the non-volatile switching of angular momentum-carrying phonons by leveraging intrinsic ferrimagnetism in an insulator. We find a pair of chiral phonons with giant energy splitting reaching 20% of the phonon frequency, due to spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry. With a moderate magnetic field, the phonon angular momentum of the two chiral phonon branches can be switched along with the magnetization. Notably, near the critical temperature, the effective phonon magnetic moment is enhanced, reaching 2.62 Bohr magneton, exceeding the moment of a magnon. A microscopic model based on phonon-magnon coupling accounts for the observations. Furthermore, we identify two types of phononic domains with opposite phonon Zeeman splitting and propose the existence of topologically protected phononic edge modes at domain boundaries. These results demonstrate effective manipulation of chiral phonons with magnetism, and pave the way for engineering chiral phononic domains on the micrometer scale.</description>

      <title>High-Quality Ultra-Fast Total Scattering and Pair Distribution Function Data using an X-ray Free Electron Laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21462</link>

Abstract: High-quality total scattering data, a key tool for understanding atomic-scale structure in disordered materials, require stable instrumentation and access to high momentum transfers. This is now routine at dedicated synchrotron instrumentation using high-energy X-ray beams, but it is very challenging to measure a total scattering dataset in less than a few microseconds. This limits their effectiveness for capturing structural changes that occur at the much faster timescales of atomic motion. Current X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) provide femtosecond-pulsed X-ray beams with maximum energies of approximately 24 keV, giving the potential to measure total scattering and the attendant pair distribution functions (PDFs) on femtosecond timescales. Here, we show that this potential has been realised using the HED scientific instrument at the European XFEL and present normalised total scattering data for 0.35 \r{A}-1 &lt; Q &lt; 16.6 \r{A}-1 and their PDFs from a broad spectrum of materials, including crystalline, nanocrystalline and amorphous solids, liquids, and clusters in solution. We analyse the data using a variety of methods, including Rietveld refinement, small-box PDF refinement, joint reciprocal-real space refinement, cluster refinement, and Debye scattering analysis. The resolution function of the setup is also characterised. We conclusively show that high-quality data can be obtained from a single approximately 30 fs XFEL pulse. Our efforts not only significantly increase the existing maximum reported Q-range for an S(Q) measured at an XFEL but also mean that XFELs are now a viable X-ray source for the broad community of people using reciprocal space total scattering and PDF methods in their research.</description>

      <title>Modeling Athermal Phonons in Novel Materials using the G4CMP Simulation Toolkit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding phonon and charge propagation in superconducting devices plays an important role in both performing low-threshold dark matter searches and limiting correlated errors in superconducting qubits. The Geant4 Condensed Matter Physics (G4CMP) package, originally developed for the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) experiment, models charge and phonon transport within silicon and germanium detectors and has been validated by experimental measurements of phonon caustics, mean charge-carrier drift velocities, and heat pulse propagation times. In this work, we present a concise framework for expanding the capabilities for phonon transport to a number of other novel substrate materials of interest to the dark matter and quantum computing communities, including sapphire (Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$), gallium arsenide (GaAs), lithium fluoride (LiF), calcium tungstate (CaWO$_{4}$), and calcium fluoride (CaF$_{2}$). We demonstrate the use of this framework in generating phonon transport properties of these materials and compare these properties with experimentally-determined values where available.</description>

      <title>Brightening dark excitons and trions in systems with a Mexican-hat energy dispersion: example of InSe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06473v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of momentum-dark excitons and trions formed in two-dimensional (2D) materials that exhibit an inverted Mexican-hat-shaped dispersion relation, taking monolayer InSe as an example. We employ variational techniques to obtain the momentum-dark and bright ground-states (non-zero and zero quasiparticle momenta, respectively). These states are of particular interest due to their peaks in the quasiparticle density of states, the largest contribution comes from the momentum-dark ground state due to the presence of a van Hove singularity (VHS). These momentum-dark systems require a physical process to provide the necessary momentum to become bright. We study the brightening of this state due to coupling with phonons and compute the resulting photoluminescence spectrum. This work opens new avenues of research, such as exploiting dark excitons in solar cells and other semiconductor-based optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>FeTaX2: A ferrimagnetic quantum anomalous Hall insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically propose that the van der Waals layered ternary transition metal chalcogenide FeTaX$_2$ (X = S, Se, Te) is a new family of ferrimagnetic quantum anomalous Hall insulators with sizable bulk gap and Chern number C = -2. The magnetic ordering originates predominantly from the Fe atoms, where strong ferromagnetic exchange interactions between them induce magnetic moments on the Ta sites, yielding a collinear ferrimagnetic ground state. The large topological gap arises from the deep sd-type band inversion between spin-down Ta d$_{z^2}$ and d$_{xy}$ orbitals near the Fermi level-a mechanism unique to d-orbital systems. Remarkably, the Curie temperature of monolayer FeTaX$_2$ is predicted to significantly exceed that of monolayer MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. Furthermore, both the Curie temperature and topological gap scale positively with the spin orbit coupling strength of the $d$ electrons, suggesting a common physical origin. These findings, if realized experimentally, could open new avenues for the research and application of topological quantum physics.</description>

      <title>Electric field control of third-order nonlinear Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The third-order nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE) serves as a sensitive probe of energy band geometric property, providing a new paradigm for revealing the Berry curvature distribution and topological response of quantum materials. In the Weyl semimetal TaIrTe4, we report for the first time that the sign of the third-order NLHE reverses with decreasing temperature. Through scaling law analysis, we think that the third-order NLHE at high (T &gt; 23 K) and low (T &lt; 23 K) temperatures is dominated by Berry-connection polarizability (BCP) and impurity scattering, respectively. The third-order NLHE response strength can be effectively modulated by an additional applied in-plane constant electric field. At the high temperature region, the BCP reduction induced by the electric field leads to a decrease in the third-order NLHE response strength, while at the low temperature region, the electric field cause both BCP and impurity scattering effects to weaken, resulting in a more significant modulation of the third-order NLHE response strength. At 4 K and an electric field strength of 0.3 kV/cm, the modulated relative response strength could reach up to 65.3%. This work provides a new means to explore the third-order NLHE and a valuable reference for the development of novel electronic devices.</description>
