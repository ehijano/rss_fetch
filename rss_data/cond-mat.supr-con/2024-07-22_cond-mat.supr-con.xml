      <title>Disorder-dependent dominant superconducting pairing symmetry in doped graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disorder and doping have profound effects on the intrinsic physical mechanisms of superconductivity. In this paper, we employed the determinant quantum Monte Carlo method to investigate the symmetry-allowed superconducting orders on the two-dimensional honeycomb lattice within the Hubbard model, using doped graphene as the carrier, focusing their response to bond disorder. Specifically, we calculated the pairing susceptibility and effective pairing interactions for the $d+id$ wave and extended $s$-wave pairings for different electron densities and disorder strengths. Our calculations show that at high electron densities, increased disorder strength may lead to a transform from $d+id$ wave dominance to extended $s$ wave dominance. However, at lower electron densities, neither of the two superconducting pairings appears under larger disorder strength. Our calculations may contribute to a further understanding of the superconducting behavior in doped materials affected by disorder.</description>

      <title>Temporal Evolution of Defects and Related Electric Properties in He-Irradiated YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{7-\delta}$ Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin films of the superconductor YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ (YBCO) were modified by low-energy light-ion irradiation employing collimated or focused He$^+$ beams, and the long-term stability of irradiation-induced defects was investigated. For films irradiated with collimated beams, the resistance was measured in situ during and after irradiation and analyzed using a phenomenological model. The formation and stability of irradiation-induced defects are highly influenced by temperature. Thermal annealing experiments conducted in an Ar atmosphere at various temperatures demonstrated a decrease in resistivity and allowed us to determine diffusion coefficients and the activation energy $\Delta E = (0.31 \pm 0.03)$ eV for diffusive oxygen rearrangement within the YBCO unit cell basal plane. Additionally, thin YBCO films, nanostructured by focused He$^+$-beam irradiation into vortex pinning arrays, displayed significant commensurability effects in magnetic fields. Despite the strong modulation of defect densities in these pinning arrays, oxygen diffusion during room-temperature annealing over almost six years did not compromise the signatures of vortex matching, which remained precisely at their magnetic fields predicted by the pattern geometry. Moreover, the critical current increased substantially within the entire magnetic field range after long-term storage in dry air. These findings underscore the potential of ion irradiation in tailoring the superconducting properties of thin YBCO films.</description>

      <title>Temperature-Dependent Optical Constants of Nanometer-thin Flakes of Fe(Te,Se) Superconductor in the Visible and Near-Infrared Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Iron chalcogenides superconductors, such as Fe(Te,Se) have recently garnered significant attention due to their simple crystal structure with a relatively easy synthesis process, high-temperature superconductivity, intrinsic topological band structure, and an unconventional pairing of superconductivity with ferromagnetism. Here, we report the complex in-plane refractive index measurement of nanometer-thin Fe(Te,Se) flake exfoliated from a single crystal FeTe$_{\text{0.6}}$Se$_{\text{0.4}}$ for photon wavelengths from 450 to 1100 nm over a temperature range from 4 K to 295 K. The results were obtained by employing a two-Drude model for the dielectric function of Fe(Te,Se), a multiband superconductor, and fitting the absolute optical reflection spectra using the transfer matrix method. A high extinction coefficient in the visible to near-infrared range makes nanometer-thin Fe(Te,Se) flakes a promising material for photodetection applications.</description>

      <title>Unraveling nano-scale effects of topotactic reduction in LaNiO$_2$ crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infinite-layer nickelates stand as a promising frontier in the exploration of unconventional superconductivity. Their synthesis through topotactic oxygen reduction from the parent perovskite phase remains a complex and elusive process. This study delves into the nano-scale effects of the topotactic lattice transformation within LaNiO$_2$ crystals. Leveraging high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy and spectroscopy, our investigations uncover a panorama of structural alterations, including grain boundaries and coherent twin boundaries, triggered by reduction-induced transformations. In addition, our analyses unveil the formation of an oxygen-rich disordered transition phase encircling impurities and pervading crystalline domains, and the internal strain is accommodated by grain boundary formation. By unraveling these nano-scale effects, our findings provide insights into the microscopic intricacies of the topotactic reduction process elucidating the transition from the perovskite to the infinite-layer phase within nickelate bulk crystals.</description>

      <title>What is the dual Ginzburg-Landau theory for holographic superconductors?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Holographic superconductors are holographic duals of superconductors. Macroscopically, a superconductor should be described by the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory. There is ample evidence that the holographic superconductors are described by the standard GL theory, but the exact form of the dual GL theory is little known. We identify the dual GL theory for a class of bulk 5-dimensional holographic superconductors, where numerical coefficients are obtained analytically.</description>

      <title>Current-Crowding-Free Superconducting Nanowire Single-Photon Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting single photons is essential for applications such as dark matter detection, quantum science and technology, and biomedical imaging. Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) excel in this task due to their near-unity detection efficiency, sub-Hz dark count rates, and picosecond timing jitter. However, a local increase of current density (current crowding) in the bends of meander-shaped SNSPDs limits these performance metrics. By locally irradiating the straight segments of SNSPDs with helium ions while leaving the bends unirradiated, we realize current-crowding-free SNSPDs with simultaneously enhanced sensitivity: after irradiation with 800 ions/nm$\unicode{xB2}$, locally irradiated SNSPDs showed a relative saturation plateau width of 37% while fully irradiated SNSPDs reached only 10%. This larger relative plateau width allows operation at lower relative bias currents, thereby reducing the dark count rate while still detecting single photons efficiently. We achieve an internal detection efficiency of 94% for a wavelength of 780 nm with a dark count rate of 7 mHz near the onset of saturating detection efficiency.</description>

      <title>A quasiparticle-injection superconducting microwave relaxation oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a superconducting microwave relaxation oscillator based on a nanowire shunted by a resistor and an inductor controlled by quasiparticle injection from a tunnel junction positioned on it: the QUISTRON. This device exhibits relaxation oscillator behavior with DC voltage-controlled frequency tuning and DC current bias. The device frequency is modulated via the tunnel junction, which induces localized heating by injecting quasiparticles. This heating mechanism modulates the nanowire switching current, enabling relaxation oscillations when it falls below the bias current. We demonstrate the device operating principles and characterize its performance across various parameters, including different choices of shunt resistor, shunt inductance, and bath temperature ranging from 20 mK to 1 K. The device showed oscillation with a frequency range approximately between 1 GHz and 10 GHz and total energy dissipation per cycle of $\sim100$ zJ. Our results suggest that this design offers a promising platform for compact, tunable superconducting oscillators in the microwave spectrum with potential applications in quantum information processing, microwave technology, and ultra-low-power electronics. The straightforward frequency control mechanism and integration potential make this device an attractive candidate for superconducting microwave local oscillators.</description>

      <title>Search for orbital magnetism in the kagome superconductor ${\rm CsV_3Sb_5}$ using neutron diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As many Kagome metals, the topological superconductor AV$_3$Sb$_5$ with (A = K,Rb,Cs) hosts a charge density wave . A related chiral flux phase that breaks the time-reversal symmetry has been further theoretically predicted in these materials. The flux phase is associated with loop currents that produce ordered orbital magnetic moments, which would occur at the momentum points, $\bf M$, characterizing the charge-density wave state. Polarized neutron-diffraction experiments have been performed on an assembly of single crystals of ${\rm CsV_3Sb_5}$ to search for such orbital magnetic moments. No evidence for the existence of a three-dimensionally ordered moment is found at any temperature at the first ${\bf M_1}$=(1/2,0,0) point in the Brillouin zone within an excellent experimental uncertainty, ${\it i.e.}$ ${\bf m}=0 \pm 0.01\mu_B$ per vanadium atom. However, a hint to a magnetic orbital moment is found in the second Brillouin zone at {\bf M$_2$}=(1/2,1/2,0) at the detection limit of the experiment. Some loop currents patterns flowing ${\it only}$ on vanadium triangles are able to account for this finding suggesting an ordered orbital magnetic moment of, at most, $\sim 0.02 \pm 0.01\mu_B$ per vanadium triangle.</description>

      <title>Assessing the formation of spin and charge stripes in La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ from first-principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ correlated density-functional theory methods (DFT + Hubbard $U$) to investigate the spin-density wave state of the bilayer Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelate La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ which becomes superconducting under pressure. We predict that the ground state of this bilayer RP material is a single spin-charge stripe phase with in-plane up$^\prime$/up/down$^\prime$/down diagonal stripes with up$^\prime$/down$^\prime$ being low spin (formally Ni$^{3+}$: $d^7$) and up/down being high spin (formally Ni$^{2+}$: $d^8$). The main feature of this solution (that is insulating even at $U=0$) is the dominant role of $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ bands around the Fermi level, which would become doped with the introduction of electrons via oxygen vacancies. In spite of the similarity with cuprates in terms of the dominant role of $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ bands, some differences are apparent in the magnetic ground state of La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$: the antiferromagnetic out-of-plane coupling within the bilayer (linked to the $d_{z^2}$ orbitals forming a spin-singlet-like configuration) is found to be the dominant one while in-plane interactions are reduced due to the stripe order of the ground state. With pressure, this striped magnetic ground state remains similar in nature but the increase in bandwidth quickly transitions La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ into a metallic state with all the activity close to the Fermi level involving, to a large extent, $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals. This is reminiscent of the cuprates and may provide key insights into how superconductivity arises in this material under pressure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor materials are fueling research in mesoscopic physics and quantum technology. Recently demonstrated smooth $\beta$-Sn superconductor shells, due to the increased induced gap, are expanding the available parameter space to new regimes. Fabricated on quasiballistic InSb nanowires, with careful control over the hybrid interface, Sn shells yield measurable switching currents even when nanowire resistance is of order 10kohm. In this regime Cooper pairs travel through a purely 1D quantum wire for at least part of their trajectory. Here, we focus on the evolution of proximity-induced supercurrent in magnetic field parallel to the nanowire. Long decay up to fields of 1T is observed. At the same time, the decay for higher occupied subbands is notably faster in some devices but not in others. We analyze this using a tight-binding numerical model that includes the Zeeman, orbital and spin-orbit effects. When the first subband is spin polarized, we observe a dramatic suppression of supercurrent, which is also confirmed by the model and suggests an absence of significant triplet supercurrent generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nickel oxide superconductors offer an alternative playground for understanding the formation of Cooper pairs in correlated materials such as the famous cuprates. By studying the La$_{n+1}$Ni$_n$O$_{2n+2}$ phase diagram on the basis of hybrid and spin-polarized density functional theory simulations, we reveal the existence of charge and bond ordered (CBO) insulating phases that are quenched by doping effects, ultimately resulting in a metallic phase at the n=5 member. Nevertheless, the phonons associated with the CBO identified in the phase diagram remain sufficiently large to mediate Cooper pairs in La$_6$Ni$_5$O$_{12}$, yielding a computed critical temperature between T$_c$=11-19K consistent with the 13K observed experimentally in Nd$_6$Ni$_5$O$_{12}$. Thus, in order to identify the superconducting mechanism, extracting the relevant instabilities in the doping phase diagram of superconductors appears critical.</description>

Abstract: Feasibility of two-line design of Josephson traveling wave parametric amplifier aimed at increase of the allowed pump wave energy and hence the gain growth is analyzed and discussed. Serious restrictions follow from both the cyclic energy transfer of the pump, signal and idler waves in the coupled waveguide lines and the phase mismatch of the waves. Besides, impact of the artificial line discreteness on the phase mismatch is considered as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Controlled engineering of vortex pinning sites in copper-oxide superconductors is a critical issue in manufacturing devices based on magnetic flux quanta. To address this, we employed a focused He-ion beam (He-FIB) to irradiate thin YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ films and create ultradense hexagonal arrays of defects with lattice spacings as small as 20 nm. Critical current and magnetoresistance measurements demonstrate efficient pinning by an unprecedentedly high matching field of 6 T visible in a huge temperature range from the critical temperature $T_c$ down to 2 K. These results show that He-FIB irradiation provides excellent opportunities for the development and application of superconducting fluxonic devices based on Abrikosov vortices. In particular, our findings suggest that such devices can operate at temperatures far below $T_c$, where superconductivity is robust.</description>

      <title>Baryon number violation accompanied by CP-violation as a quantum tunneling effect induced by superfluid pairing interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore a new picture of baryon number ($\mathcal{B}$) violation inspired by the formal analogies between the Brout-Englert-Higgs model and the Ginzburg-Landau model. A possible manifestation of this new picture could be the transition between a pair of neutrons and a pair of antineutrons (i.e. $nn \rightarrow \bar{n}\bar{n}$), which violates $\mathcal{B}$ by 4 units. In the presence of the superfluid pairing interactions, two neutrons can form a Cooper pair and can be modeled by a semi-classical complex scalar field, which carries two units of $\mathcal{B}$. In the presence of the $\mathcal{B}$-violating terms, the system does not possess a continuous $U(1)$ symmetry but instead it respect a discrete $Z_2$ symmetry. Before the spontaneous breaking of the $Z_2$ symmetry, the ground state (vacuum) of the neutron Cooper field and that of the antineutron Cooper field should have degenerate energy levels. After the spontaneous breaking of the $Z_2$ symmetry, the degeneracy of the ground states would be removed and a domain wall that interpolates between the two inequavalent ground states can emerge. If the vacuum energy of the neutron Cooper field is higher than that of the antineutron Cooper field, the false vacuum ($nn$) would decay into the true vacuum ($\bar{n}\bar{n}$) through a quantum tunneling process across the domain wall. Therefore, The $nn \rightarrow \bar{n}\bar{n}$ transition process can be considered as a false vacuum decay through a quantum tunneling process induced by the superfluid pairing interactions. Both the $\mathcal{B}$-violating and CP-violating effects can be quite naturally accommodated in the $nn \rightarrow \bar{n}\bar{n}$ transition process. The $\mathcal{B}$-violating process accompanied by CP-violation would open a promising avenue for exploring new physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

Abstract: When time-reversal and inversion symmetry are broken, superconducting circuits may exhibit a so-called diode effect, where the critical currents for opposite directions of the current flow differ. In recent years, this effect has been observed in a multitude of systems and the different physical ingredients that may yield such an effect are well understood. On a microscopic level, the interplay between spin-orbit coupling and a Zeeman field may give rise to a diode effect in a single Josephson junction. However, so far there is no analytical description of the effect within a simple model. Here we study a single channel nanowire with Rashba spin-orbit coupling and in the presence of a Zeeman field. We show that the different Fermi velocities and spin projections of the two pseudo-spin bands lead to a diode effect. Simple analytical expressions for the diode efficiency can be obtained in limiting cases.</description>

Abstract: The perfect linear-in-$T$ dc resistivity in the strange metal phase of the high-$T_{c}$ cuprate superconductors is probably the most prominent manifestation of their non-Fermi liquid nature. A major puzzle about the strange metal behavior is that there is no discernible change in the trend of the dc resistivity at a temperature when we expect the electron-phonon coupling to play an essential role. The empirical Matthiessen's rule of summation of the resistivity from different scattering channels seems to be simply violated. On the other hand, the electron-phonon coupling has long been proposed to be responsible for the various spectral anomalies observed in the cuprate superconductors. In particular, the $B_{1g}$ buckling mode of the oxygen ion in the $CuO_{2}$ plane is proposed to be responsible for the peak-dip-hump spectral shape around the anti-nodal point. Here we show that the coupling to the $B_{1g}$ buckling mode is strongly suppressed by the vertex correction from the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation in the system as a result of the destructive interference between electron-phonon matrix element at momentum differ by the antiferromagnetic wave vector. In the real space scenario, such a destructive interference effect simply amounts to the fact that the electron hopping between nearest-neighboring sites is suppressed by the antiferromagnetic spin correlation between the electrons. More generally, we argue that the electron-phonon coupling strength in the cuprate superconductors should diminish with the proximity of the Mott insulating phase as a result of similar vertex correction from the electron correlation effect. We think that this offers an interpretation for the violation of the Matthiessen's rule in the dc resistivity of the strange metal phase of the cuprate superconductors.</description>
