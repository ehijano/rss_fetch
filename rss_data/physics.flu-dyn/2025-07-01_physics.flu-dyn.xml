      <title>Helical flows spontaneously generated by salt fingers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of salt fingers in the regime of slow salinity diffusion (small inverse Lewis number) and strong stratification (large density ratio), focusing on regimes relevant to Earth's oceans. Using three-dimensional direct numerical simulations in periodic domains, we show that salt fingers exhibit rich, multiscale dynamics in this regime, with vertically elongated fingers that are twisted into helical shapes at large scales by mean flows and disrupted at small scales by isotropic eddies. We use a multiscale asymptotic analysis to motivate a reduced set of partial differential equations that filters internal gravity waves and removes inertia from all parts of the momentum equation except for the Reynolds stress that drives the helical mean flow. When simulated numerically, the reduced equations capture the same dynamics and fluxes as the full equations in the appropriate regime. The reduced equations enforce zero helicity in all fluctuations about the mean flow, implying that the symmetry-breaking helical flow is spontaneously generated by strictly non-helical fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic interactions of low-aspect-ratio oscillating panels in a tip-to-tip formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vertical, tip-to-tip arrangement of neighboring caudal fins, common in densely packed fish schools, has received much less attention than staggered or side-by-side pairings. We explore this configuration using a canonical system of two trapezoidal plates (aspect ratio AR = 1.2) that pitch about their leading edges while heaving harmonically at a Strouhal number St = 0.45 and a reduced frequency k = 2.09. Direct numerical simulations based on an immersed-boundary method are conducted over a Reynolds number range of 600 &lt;= Re &lt;= 1e4, and complementary water-channel experiments extend this range to 1e4 &lt;= Re &lt;= 3e4, thereby validating the computations at higher flow speeds. Results indicate that when the plates oscillate in phase at a nondimensional vertical spacing H/c &lt;= 1.0, the cycle-averaged thrust coefficient of each plate rises by up to 14.5% relative to an isolated plate; the enhancement decreases monotonically as the spacing increases. Anti-phase motion instead lowers the time-average power coefficient by up to 6%, with only a modest thrust penalty, providing an alternative interaction regime. Flow visualization shows that in-phase kinematics accelerate the stream between the plates, intensifying the adjacent leading-edge vortices. Downstream, the initially separate vortex rings merge into a single, larger ring that is strongly compressed in the spanwise direction; this wake compression correlates with the measured thrust gain. The interaction mechanism and its quantitative benefits persist throughout the entire numerical and experimental Reynolds-number sweep, indicating weak Re-sensitivity within 600 &lt;= Re &lt;= 3e4. These results provide the first three-dimensional characterization of tip-to-tip flapping-plate interactions, establish scaling trends with spacing and phase, and offer a reference data set for reduced-order models of vertically stacked propulsors.</description>

      <title>Exact coherent structures with dilute particle suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physics of settling suspensions under shear are investigated by theoretical and numerical analyses of unstable equilibrium solutions to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, coupled with an advection-diffusion-settling equation for a dilute phase of particles. Two cases are considered: the 'passive scalar' regime, in which the sediment is advected by the fluid motion, but concentrations are too dilute to affect the flow; and the 'stratified' regime, where nonuniform vertical distribution of sediment due to particle settling leads to a bulk stratification that feeds back on the flow via buoyancy. In the passive regime, we characterise the structure of the resultant sediment concentration fields and derive formulae for transport fluxes of sediment with asymptotically low and high settling velocities. In the stratified regime, parametric continuation is employed to explore the dependence of states upon the bulk Richardson number $Ri_b$. Symmetry breaking in the governing equations leads to travelling wave solutions with a rich bifurcation structure. The maximum $Ri_b$ attained by these states depends non-monotonically on settling velocity and obeys asymptotic scalings that have also been observed to capture the dependence of the laminar-turbulent boundary in direct numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Surface curvature and secondary vortices in steady dense shallow granular flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense granular flows exhibit both surface deformation and secondary flows due to the presence of normal stress differences. Yet, a complete mathematical modelling of these two features is still lacking. This paper focuses on a steady shallow dense flow down an inclined channel of arbitrary cross-section, for which asymptotic solutions are derived by using an expansion based on the flow shallowness combined with a second-order granular rheology. The leading order flow is uniaxial, with a streamwise velocity corresponding to a lateral juxtaposition of Bagnold profiles scaled by the varying flow depth. The correction at first order introduces two counter-rotating vortices in the plane perpendicular to the main flow direction (with downwelling in the centre), and an upward curve of the free surface. These solutions are compared to DEM simulations, which they match quantitatively. This result is then used together with laboratory experiments to infer measurements of the second-normal stress difference in dense dry granular flow.</description>

      <title>Effective viscosity closures for dense suspensions in CSP systems via lubrication-enhanced DNS and numerical viscometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense particle suspensions are promising candidates for next-generation Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) receivers, enabling operating temperatures above 800 degrees C. However, accurate modeling of the rheological behavior of granular flows is essential for reliable computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. In this study, we develop and assess numerical methodologies for simulating dense suspensions pertinent to CSP applications. Our computational framework is based on Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS), augmented by lubrication force models to resolve detailed particle-particle and particle-wall interactions at volume fractions exceeding 50\%. We conducted a systematic series of simulations across a range of volume fractions to establish a robust reference dataset. Validation was performed via a numerical viscometer configuration, permitting direct comparison with theoretical predictions and established benchmark results. Subsequently, the viscometer arrangement was generalized to a periodic cubic domain, serving as a representative volume element for CSP systems. Within this framework, effective viscosities were quantified independently through wall force measurements and energy dissipation analysis. The close agreement between these two approaches substantiates the reliability of the results. Based on these findings, effective viscosity tables were constructed and fitted using polynomial and piecewise-smooth approximations. These high-accuracy closure relations are suitable for incorporation into large-scale, non-Newtonian CFD models for CSP plant design and analysis.</description>

      <title>On how walls shape dissipation intermittency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intermittency of energy dissipation has long been studied via high-order moments in homogeneous and isotropic turbulence, but not much where the boundary effects are explicitly included. Here, we derive two fundamental Reynolds number scaling expressions for dissipation moments in wall-bounded flows -- one in the outer region where the boundary effects are weak and the other close to the walls where those effects are strong -- and support these expressions by direct numerical simulations. Dissipation moments in the outer region follow universal power laws with exponents linked to anomalous scaling of velocity structure functions. In contrast, moments near the wall follow a bounded defect law, leading to a finite asymptotic limit without intermittency. For very large Reynolds numbers, the outer proposal predicts vanishing dissipation compared to that on the wall, highlighting the need for solid boundaries in generating Onsager-type singularities.</description>

      <title>Improving Spatio-Temporal Accuracy of the Stochastic Particle Fokker-Planck Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of rarefied gas flows is important for space vehicle design, particularly in rarefied regimes where the Navier-Stokes equations are no more valid. While the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method acts as a numerical solver for rarefied gas flows, it becomes inefficient when dealing with near-continuum regimes. The Fokker-Planck (FP) model improves computational efficiency by approximating particle collisions as a drift-diffusion process. The FP model has been extended to handle diatomic gases, such as the Fokker-Planck-Master (FPM) model. The FPM model's first-order accuracy in both time and space limits computational efficiency gains. This study proposes a unified stochastic particle FPM (USP-FPM) model that achieves second-order spatio-temporal accuracy for diatomic gases. Temporal accuracy is improved by introducing second-order energy relaxation into the USP-FP method. Spatial accuracy is improved by employing a polynomial reconstruction method for macroscopic properties. The USP-FPM model is validated through two numerical simulations: relaxation to thermal equilibrium in a homogeneous flow and hypersonic flow over a vertical plate. The results demonstrate that the USP-FPM model shows good agreement with DSMC results and significantly reduces computational cost by enabling larger cell sizes and time steps.</description>

      <title>Importance of the numerical schemes in the CFD of the human nose</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational fluid dynamics of the air flow in the human nasal cavities, starting from patient-specific Computer Tomography (CT) scans, is an important tool for diagnostics and surgery planning. However, a complete and systematic assessment of the influence of the main modeling assumptions is still lacking. In designing such simulations, choosing the discretization scheme, which is the main subject of the present work, is an often overlooked decision of primary importance. We use a comparison framework to quantify the effects of the major design choices on the results. The reconstructed airways of a healthy, representative adult patient are used to set up a computational study where such effects are systematically measured. It is found that the choice of the numerical scheme is the most important aspect, although all varied parameters impact the solution noticeably. For a physiologically meaningful flow rate, changes of the global pressure drop up to more than 50\% are observed; locally, velocity differences can become extremely significant. Our results call for an improved standard in the description of this type of numerical studies, where way too often the order of accuracy of the numerical scheme is not mentioned.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian Finite-Time Fluctuation Relation in isotropic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23336v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The entropy generation rate in turbulence can be defined using the energy cascade rate as described in the scale-integrated Kolmogorov-Hill equation at a specified length scale. The fluctuation relation (FR) from non-equilibrium thermodynamics, which predicts exponential behaviour of the ratio of probability densities for positive and negative entropy production rates, was confirmed in prior work \citep{yao2023entropy}, but under certain limiting assumptions. We here examine the applicability of FR to isotropic turbulence under less stringent assumptions by analyzing entropy generation rates averaged over intervals ranging from one to several eddy turnover times. Based on time-resolved data at a Taylor-scale based Reynolds number $Re_\lambda = 433$, we find that the FR is valid in the sense that very close to exponential behaviour of probability ratios of positive and negative entropy generation (forward and inverse cascade of energy) is observed. Interestingly, finite-time averaging yields FR-consistent results only within a Lagrangian framework, along fluid trajectories using filtered convective velocities. In contrast, the FR does not hold with time-averaging at fixed (Eulerian) positions. Results provide evidence that the definition of entropy generation based on the scale-integrated Kolmogorov-Hill equation describes turbulent cascade processes that exhibit properties predicted by non-equilibrium thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Unsteady solutions of the spray flamelet equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solutions of the spray flamelet equations reported in the literature during the last decade have been limited to very specific situations presenting steady evaporation profiles only. In contrast, intrinsically unsteady interactions between the liquid and gas phases have received little attention so far. In this work, the spray flamelet equations are closed by means of a Lagrangian description of the liquid phase in mixture fraction space, which allows solving them for unsteady situations. The resulting formulation is then employed to conduct parametric analyses of the effects of initial droplet radius and velocity variations on ethanol/air non-premixed gas flamelets perturbed by sprays generated with different droplet injection strategies. Special emphasis is given to the differences between continuous and discontinuous droplet injection. The results illustrate how the latter can considerably increase the temperature and stability of flamelet structures, provided the spray parameters are appropriately selected.</description>

      <title>Neural inference of fluid-structure interactions from sparse off-body measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a novel physics-informed neural framework for reconstructing unsteady fluid-structure interactions (FSI) from sparse, single-phase observations of the flow. Our approach combines modal surface models with coordinate neural representations of the fluid and solid dynamics, constrained by the fluid's governing equations and an interface condition. Using only off-body Lagrangian particle tracks and a moving-wall boundary condition, the method infers both flow fields and structural motion. It does not require a constitutive model for the solid nor measurements of the surface position, although including these can improve performance. Reconstructions are demonstrated using two canonical FSI benchmarks: vortex-induced oscillations of a 2D flapping plate and pulse-wave propagation in a 3D flexible pipe. In both cases, the framework achieves accurate reconstructions of flow states and structure deformations despite data sparsity near the moving interface. A key result is that the reconstructions remain robust even as additional deformation modes are included beyond those needed to resolve the structure, eliminating the need for truncation-based regularization. This represents a novel application of physics-informed neural networks for learning coupled multiphase dynamics from single-phase observations. The method enables quantitative FSI analysis in experiments where flow measurements are sparse and structure measurements are asynchronous or altogether unavailable.</description>

      <title>Predicting any small-scale statistics of high-Reynolds-number turbulence using ensemble simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complex small-scale statistics of turbulence are a result of the combined cascading dynamics through all scales of the flow. Predicting these statistics using fully resolved simulations at the high Reynolds numbers that typically occur in engineering, geophysical, and astrophysical flows will exceed the capabilities of even the largest supercomputers for the foreseeable future. A common observation is that high-Reynolds-number flows are organized in clusters of intense turbulent activity separated by large regions of quiescent flow. We here show that small-scale statistics in high-Reynolds-number turbulence can be predicted based on an ensemble hypothesis, stating that they can be emulated by the statistical mixture of a heterogeneous ensemble of lower-Reynolds-number simulations. These simulations are forced at smaller scales with energy injection rates varying across the ensemble. We show that our method predicts complex gradient statistics from the recent literature, including the joint QR-PDF and extreme dissipation and enstrophy statistics, to unprecedented accuracy. Remarkably, we find that the weight distribution needed for the ensemble method to make predictions can be inferred from the anomalous scaling exponents of turbulence. Thus combining theory with fully resolved simulations, our method can be readily applied to predict a wide range of statistics at high Reynolds number but low cost, while opening up various avenues for further theoretical and numerical exploration.</description>

      <title>Effect of freestream turbulence on the coherent dynamics of a wind turbine wake</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The wake of a model wind turbine exposed to freestream turbulence (FST) with a variety of turbulent characteristics is studied through Particle Image Velocimetry experiments. The FST cases spanned turbulent intensities (T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) in the range 1% &lt; T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 13.1 % and integral length scales (L&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;) in the range 0.01D &lt; L&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 0.11D (where D is the diameter of the turbine model)}. Increasing T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and L&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; in this range resulted in an earlier breakdown of the tip vortices which in turn resulted in an earlier onset of wake recovery. Typically, the amplitude of wake meandering increased in the presence of FST, but not monotonically with either T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; or L&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;. The nature of the low frequency region (typical of wake meandering frequencies) of the power spectra changed from a more discrete to a more broadband one as FST level was increased, highlighting a fundamental change in the nature of wake meandering with/without FST. Deeper insights into the origins, and subsequent evolution, of the various coherent motions (characterised by particular frequencies) in the presence of FST are obtained through analysis of the multi-scale triple-decomposed coherent kinetic energy budgets. The wake meandering modes in the presence of FST are shown to better utilize the mean velocity shear, extracting more energy from the mean flow while other sources such as non-linear triadic interactions and diffusion also gain in importance.</description>

      <title>Patterning surface textured plates with a viscoplastic fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deposition of a viscoplastic fluid onto a substrate can be achieved by simply moving apart two plates initially separated by a fluid filled gap, where the footprint shape depends on the initiation of a fingering instability. Here, we present another approach for the controlled deposition of a viscoplastic fluid by designing the macroscopic structures of the solid substrate. Through experiments in a lifted Hele-Shaw cell, we explore how slot, square, pyramid, and triangle-shaped patterns affect the dynamics of liquid deposition. These substrate structures directly control the final shape of the viscoplastic fluid footprint. It turns out that these substrate patterns have little influence on the normal adhesive force acting on the plates.</description>

Abstract: Wind tunnels and linearized turbulence and boundary-layer models have been so far necessary to simulate and approximate the stationery lift and drag forces on (base-mounted) airfoils by means of statistically determined or approximated values of the relevant situational coefficients as the drag and lift coefficients.To improve this process, we introduce transient and exact formulae to separate these forces in advance by means of the solutions found from the fluid dynamics model of the Navier Stokes differential equations.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Surrogate Modeling of DSMC Solutions Using Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a deep neural network (DNN) framework that accelerates Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) computations for rarefied-gas flows, while maintaining high physical fidelity. First, a fully connected deep neural network is trained on high-quality DSMC data for seven temperatures (200-650 K) to reproduce the Maxwell-Boltzmann speed distribution of argon. Injecting the physical boundary point into the training set enforces the correct low-speed limit. It reduces the mean-squared error to below 10^-5, thereby decreasing inference time from tens of minutes per DSMC run to milliseconds. For one-dimensional shock waves, a multi-output network equipped with learnable Fourier features learns the complete profiles of density, velocity, and temperature. Trained only on Mach numbers 1.4-1.9, it predicts a Mach 2 and 2.5 case with near-perfect agreement to DSMC, demonstrating robust out-of-training generalization. In a lid-driven cavity, the large parametric spread in Knudsen number is handled by a "family-of-experts" strategy: separate specialist models are trained at discrete Knudsen (Kn) values, and log-space interpolation fuses their outputs. This hybrid surrogate recovers the full 2-D velocity and temperature fields at unseen Kn with less than 2% spatial error. Key innovations include (i) explicit injection of physical constraints during data preprocessing, (ii) learnable Fourier feature mapping to capture steep shock gradients, and (iii) a modular expert-interpolation scheme to cover wide Knudsen ranges. Together, they establish a general recipe for trustworthy, rapid surrogate models that can be extended to non-equilibrium phenomena, gas mixtures, and design optimization workflows</description>

      <title>Hyperuniformity in ternary fluid mixtures: the role of wetting and hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase separation in multicomponent fluids is central to understanding the organization of complex materials and biological structures. The Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (CHNS) equations offer a robust framework for modeling such systems, capturing both diffusive dynamics and hydrodynamic interactions. In this work, we investigate hyperuniformity, characterized by suppressed large-scale density fluctuations, in ternary fluid mixtures governed by the ternary CHNS equations. Using large-scale direct numerical simulations, we systematically explore the influence of wetting conditions and hydrodynamic effects on emergent hyperuniformity. Similar to binary systems we observe that the presence of hydrodynamics weakens the hyperuniform characteristics. However, also the wetting properties have an effect. We find that in partial wetting regimes, all three components exhibit comparable degrees of hyperuniformity. In contrast, for complete wetting scenarios, where one component preferentially wets the other two, the wetting component displays a significant reduction in hyperuniformity relative to the others. These findings suggest that wetting asymmetry can act as a control parameter for spatial order in multicomponent fluids.</description>

      <title>Variational hydrodynamics of the classical Yukawa one-component plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a recently developed variational approach to the hydrodynamics of strongly coupled plasmas [D. Krimans and S. Putterman, Phys. Fluids 36, 037131 (2024)] and extend it to the Yukawa one-component plasma. This approach generalizes the ordinary hydrodynamic equations to finite length scales by explicitly including terms that depend on the pair distribution function. After discussing the form of the Lagrangian, we derive equations of motion and explicit formulas for the momentum and energy conservation laws. After demonstrating consistency with thermodynamics, we consider the simpler linear regime and the dispersion laws. By comparing the longitudinal speed of sound to existing numerical data, we find excellent agreement in the weak to moderate screening regimes, while discrepancies arise at strong screening. The finite-wavelength behavior of the longitudinal dispersion relation also shows excellent agreement with simulations across a wide range of coupling and screening parameters, even when the wavelength is comparable to the average interparticle spacing. In addition to the linear regime, our variational approach has potential for application to nonlinear problems and other physical systems.</description>

      <title>The hydrodynamic thermal continuum, with applications to stratified atmospheres and 1D coronal loop models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using both analytical and numerical means, we demonstrate that linear stability analysis of a hydrodynamic stratified atmosphere or a 1D coronal loop model in non-adiabatic settings features a thermal continuum corresponding to highly localized eigenfunctions. This thermal continuum can be precomputed, involving the net heat-loss function and its partial derivatives, and is the generalization of the thermal instability introduced by~\citet{Parker1953}. We account for a thermal imbalance, directly affecting thermal instability growthrates.
  We present completely general equations that govern all eigenmodes, including non-adiabatically affected p- and g-modes of the stratified settings. We intend to clarify how linear thermal instability is relevant for solar loops that show spontaneous in-situ condensations, and eliminate recent confusion on specific isochoric routes to linear instability alongside other thermal instability channels. The thermal continuum, previously identified as a crucial ingredient in magnetohydrodynamic eigenmode spectra for coronal loops and atmospheres, drives multithermal aspects across our universe, such as forming solar coronal rain and prominences, or cold cloud creation in intracluster to interstellar medium environments.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Turbulence Synthesis: Validation in 2D Hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical simulations can follow the evolution of fluid motions through the intricacies of developed turbulence. However, they are rather costly to run, especially in 3D. In the past two decades, generative models have emerged which produce synthetic random flows at a computational cost equivalent to no more than a few time-steps of a simulation. These simplified models qualitatively bear some characteristics of turbulent flows in specific contexts (incompressible 3D hydrodynamics or magnetohydrodynamics), but generally struggle with the synthesis of coherent structures. We aim at generating random fields (e.g. velocity, density, magnetic fields, etc.) with realistic physical properties for a large variety of governing partial differential equations and at a small cost relative to time-resolved simulations. We propose a set of approximations applied to given sets of partial differential equations, and test the validity of our method in the simplest framework: 2D decaying incompressible hydrodynamical turbulence. We compare results of 2D decaying simulations with snapshots of our synthetic turbulence. We assess quantitatively the difference first with standard statistical tools: power spectra, increments and structure functions. These indicators can be reproduced by our method during up to about a third of the turnover time scale. We also consider recently developed scattering transforms statistics, able to efficiently characterise non-Gaussian structures. This reveals more significant discrepancy, which can however be bridged by bootstrapping. Finally, the number of Fourier transforms necessary for one synthesis scales logarithmically in the resolution, compared to linearly for time-resolved simulations. We have designed a multiscale turbulence synthesis (MuScaTS) method to efficiently short-circuit costly numerical simulations to produce realistic instantaneous fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Repetitive curling of the incompressible viscid Navier-Stokes differential equation leads to a higher-order diffusion equation. Substituting this equation into the Navier-Stokes differential equation transposes the latter into the Korteweg-de Vries-Burgers equation with the Weierstrass p-function as the soliton solution. However, a higher-order derivative of the studied variable produces the so-called N-soliton solution, which is comparable to the N-soliton solution of the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation.</description>

      <title>Vortex Detection from Quantum Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum solutions to differential equations represent quantum data -- states that contain relevant information about the system's behavior, yet are difficult to analyze. We propose a toolbox for reading out information from such data, where customized quantum circuits enable efficient extraction of flow properties. We concentrate on the process referred to as quantum vortex detection (QVD), where specialized operators are developed for pooling relevant features related to vorticity. Specifically, we propose approaches based on sliding windows and quantum Fourier analysis that provide a separation between patches of the flow field with vortex-type profiles. First, we show how contour-shaped windows can be applied, trained, and analyzed sequentially, providing a clear signal to flag the location of vortices in the flow. Second, we develop a parallel window extraction technique, such that signals from different contour positions are coherently processed to avoid looping over the entire solution mesh. We show that Fourier features can be extracted from the flow field, leading to classification of datasets with vortex-free solutions against those exhibiting Lamb-Oseen vortices. Our work exemplifies a successful case of efficiently extracting value from quantum data and points to the need for developing appropriate quantum data analysis tools that can be trained on them.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the statistical recovery of missing physics and turbulent phenomena in fluid flows using generative machine learning. Here we develop a two-stage super-resolution method using spectral filtering to restore the high-wavenumber components of a Kolmogorov flow. We include a rigorous examination of generated samples through the lens of statistical turbulence. By extending the prior methods to a combined super-resolution and conditional high-wavenumber generation, we demonstrate turbulence recovery on a 8x upsampling task, effectively doubling the range of recovered wavenumbers.</description>

      <title>Neural optical flow for planar and stereo PIV</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural optical flow (NOF) offers improved accuracy and robustness over existing OF methods for particle image velocimetry (PIV). Unlike other OF techniques, which rely on discrete displacement fields, NOF parameterizes the physical velocity field using a continuous neural-implicit representation. This formulation enables efficient data assimilation and ensures consistent regularization across views for stereo PIV. The neural-implicit architecture provides significant data compression and supports a space-time formulation, facilitating the analysis of both steady and unsteady flows. NOF incorporates a differentiable, nonlinear image-warping operator that relates particle motion to intensity changes between frames. Discrepancies between the advected intensity field and observed images form the data loss, while soft constraints, such as Navier-Stokes residuals, enhance accuracy and enable direct pressure inference from PIV images. Additionally, mass continuity can be imposed as a hard constraint for both 2D and 3D flows. Implicit regularization is achieved by tailoring the network's expressivity to match a target flow's spectral characteristics. Results from synthetic planar and stereo PIV datasets, as well as experimental planar data, demonstrate NOF's effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art wavelet-based OF and CC methods. Additionally, we highlight its potential broader applicability to techniques like background-oriented schlieren, molecular tagging velocimetry, and other advanced measurement systems.</description>

      <title>To jump or not to jump: Adhesion and viscous dissipation dictate the detachment of coalescing wall-attached bubbles</title>

Abstract: Bubble coalescence can promote bubble departure at much smaller sizes compared to buoyancy. This can critically enhance the efficiency of gas-evolving electrochemical processes, such as water electrolysis. In this study, we integrate high-speed imaging experiments and direct numerical simulations to dissect how and under which conditions bubble coalescence on surfaces leads to detachment. Our transparent electrode experiments provide new insights into contact line dynamics, demonstrating that the bubble neck generally does not contact the surface during coalescence. We reveal that whether coalescence leads to bubble departure or not is determined by the balance between surface energy, adhesion forces, and viscous dissipation. For the previously unexplored regime at low effective Ohnesorge number, a measure of viscosity that incorporates the effect of asymmetry between the coalescing bubbles, we identify a critical dimensionless adhesion energy threshold of $\approx$15% of the released surface energy, below which bubbles typically detach. We develop a global energy balance model that successfully predicts coalescence outcomes across diverse experimental conditions.</description>

      <title>A universal hydrodynamic transition in confined marine invertebrate larvae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11744v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ocean is teeming with a myriad of mm-sized invertebrate planktonic larvae, which thrive in a viscous fluid environment. Many of them rely on ciliary beating to generate fluid flows for locomotion and feeding. Their larval forms, local morphologies, and ciliation patterns exhibit remarkable diversity, producing intricate and dynamic 3D flows that are notoriously difficult to characterize in laboratory settings. Traditional microscopic imaging techniques typically involve gently squeeze-confining the soft larvae between a glass slide and cover slip to study their flows in quasi-2D. However, a comprehensive hydrodynamic framework for the low-to-intermediate Reynolds number (&lt;1) flows in quasi-2D confinement, particularly in light of their complex forms, has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that vortices around larvae proliferate with increasing confinement and illuminate the underlying physical mechanism. We experimentally quantify confinement-induced flows in larvae of sea stars and sea urchins. The flows exhibited strikingly universal patterns: under weak confinement, all larvae generated two vortices, whereas under strong confinement, the number of generated vortices significantly increased. The experimental observations were well captured by a low Reynolds number theoretical model based on the superposition of confined Stokeslets. Building on experiments and theory, we developed a comprehensive framework for confinement-induced flows, which suggests that vorticity dynamics are primarily determined by local morphological features, rather than solely the body plan. Our work provides fundamental insights into form-functional relationships between larval morphology and flow generation. Our findings are broadly applicable to understanding flows generated by a wide range of ciliated organisms with complex forms and morphologies, from micro- to milli-length-scales.</description>

Abstract: Entangled vortex filaments are essential to turbulence, serving as coherent structures that govern nonlinear fluid dynamics and support the reconstruction of fluid fields to reveal statistical properties. This study introduces an quantum implicit representation of vortex filaments in turbulence, employing a level-set method that models the filaments as the intersection of the real and imaginary zero iso-surfaces of a complex scalar field. Describing the fluid field via the scalar field offers distinct advantages in capturing complex structures, topological properties, and fluid dynamics, while opening new avenues for innovative solutions through quantum computing platforms. The representation is reformulated into an eigenvalue problem for Hermitian matrices, enabling the conversion of velocity fields into complex scalar fields that embed the vortex filaments. The resulting optimization is addressed using a variational quantum eigensolver, with Pauli operator truncation and deep learning techniques applied to improve efficiency and reduce noise. The proposed quantum framework achieves a near-linear time complexity and a exponential storage reduction while maintaining a balance of accuracy, robustness, and versatility, presenting a promising tool for turbulence analysis, vortex dynamics research, and machine learning dataset generation.</description>

      <title>Scatterless interferences: Delay of laminar-to-turbulent flow transition by a lattice of subsurface phonons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18835v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wave interference has historically relied on scattering objects placed within the wave domain. Here, we introduce a fundamentally new mechanism: scatterless interference induced by a lattice of subsurface phonon motion beneath a smooth wall interfacing with a transitioning boundary-layer flow. The subsurface consists of a wall-parallel lattice of wall-normal frequency-dependent phononic structural units, each designed to respond to local flow perturbations in an out-of-phase manner, suppressing them at the point of interaction. Collectively, the lattice induces interference effects that cause the kinetic energy of flow instabilities to decay downstream, thereby delaying laminar-to-turbulent transition. To guide the design of the phononic subsurface lattice, a Bloch-wave unit-cell analysis is developed for the flow perturbations, and direct numerical simulations validate the concept. This work establishes scatterless interference as a distinct physical phenomenon and represents a paradigm shift in the design of aerodynamic and hydrodynamic surfaces--moving beyond streamlined shaping to leveraging subsurface phonon engineering for drag reduction and enhanced performance.</description>

Abstract: Suspensions of motile microorganisms can spontaneously form large-scale fluid motion, known as bioconvection, characterized by dense downwelling plumes separated by broad upwelling regions. In this study, we investigate bioconvection in shallow suspensions of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii confined within spiral-shaped boundaries, combining detailed experiments with three-dimensional simulations. Under open liquid-air interfaces, cells accumulate near the surface via negative gravitaxis, generating spiral-shaped density patterns that subsequently fragment into lattice-like clusters, leading to plume formation. Space-time analyses demonstrate coherent rotational dynamics, with predominantly inward-directed motion near the spiral core and bidirectional motion further out. Introducing confinement by sealing the upper boundary with an air-impermeable wall triggers dramatic pattern transitions due to oxygen depletion: initially stable arrangements reorganize into new structures with significantly reduced wavelengths. Complementary numerical simulations, based on incompressible Navier-Stokes equations incorporating negative buoyancy and active swimmer stress, successfully replicate initial pattern formation, subsequent instability, fragmentation into plumes, and emergence of strong vortical flows-nearly an order of magnitude faster than individual cell swimming. However, these models do not capture oxygen depletion-driven transitions observed experimentally. Our results highlight that geometric confinement, oxygen availability, and metabolic transitions critically regulate bioconvection dynamics, offering novel strategies for controlling microbial self-organization and fluid transport.</description>

      <title>Optimal body force for heat transfer in turbulent vertical heated pipe flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The vertical heated-pipe is widely used in thermal engineering applications, as buoyancy can help drive a flow, but several flow regimes are possible: shear-driven turbulence, laminarised flow, and convective turbulence. Steady velocity fields that maximise heat transfer have previously been calculated for heated pipe flow, but were calculated independently of buoyancy forces, and hence independently of the flow regime and time-dependent dynamics of the flow. In this work, a variational method is applied to find an optimal body force of limited magnitude that maximises heat transfer for the vertical arrangement, with the velocity field constrained by the full governing equations. In our calculations, mostly at Re=3000, it is found that streamwise-independent rolls remain optimal, as in previous steady optimisations, but that the optimal number of rolls and their radial position are dependent on the flow regime. Surprisingly, while it is generally assumed that turbulence enhances heat transfer, for the strongly forced case, time-dependence typically leads to a reduction. Beyond offering potential improvement through the targeting of the roll configuration for this application, wider implications are that optimisations under the steady flow assumption may overestimate improvements in heat transfer, and that strategies that simply aim to induce turbulence may not necessarily be efficient in enhancing heat transfer either. Including time-dependence and the full governing equations in the optimisation is challenging but offers further enhancement and improved reliability in prediction.</description>

      <title>Impact of Particle Injection Velocity on the Stability of the Particulate Rayleigh-B\'enard System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16300v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The linear stability of a thermally stratified fluid layer between horizontal walls, where thermal particles are continuously injected at one boundary and extracted at the other - a system known as particulate Rayleigh-B\'enard (pRB) - is studied. For a fixed volumetric particle flux, reducing the injection velocity stabilizes the system when heavy particles are introduced from above, but destabilizes it when light particles are injected from below. For very light particles (bubbles), low injection velocities can shift the onset of convection to negative Rayleigh numbers, i.e. heating from above. Particles accumulate non-uniformly near the extraction wall and in regions of strong vertical flow, aligning with either wall-impinging or wall-detaching zones depending on whether injection is at sub- or super-terminal velocity.</description>

      <title>Enhanced oil recovery in reservoirs via diffusion-driven $\text{CO}_{2}$ flooding: Experimental insights and material balance modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05905v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\text{CO}_{2}$ flooding is central to carbon utilization technologies, yet conventional waterflooding models fail to capture the complex interactions between CO$_2$ and formation fluids. In this study, one- and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance experiments reveal that $\text{CO}_{2}$ markedly enhances crude oil mobility during miscible displacement via multiple synergistic mechanisms, yielding a recovery factor of $60.97\%$, which surpasses that of immiscible displacement (maximum $57.53\%$). Guided by these findings, we propose a convection-diffusion model that incorporates the diffusion coefficient ($D$) and porosity ($\phi$) as key parameters. This model captures the spatiotemporal evolution of the $\text{CO}_{2}$ front and addresses a key limitation of conventional formulations-the omission of diffusion effects. It improves predictions of gas breakthrough time and enables optimized injection design for low-permeability reservoirs. Extending classical material balance theory, we develop an enhanced $\text{CO}_{2}$ flooding equation that integrates critical transport phenomena. This formulation incorporates $\text{CO}_{2}$ diffusion, oil phase expansion, reservoir adsorption, and gas compressibility to describe the dynamic transport and mass compensation of injected $\text{CO}_{2}$. Validation through experimental and numerical data confirms the model's robustness and applicability under low-permeability conditions. The proposed framework overcomes limitations of physical experiments under extreme environments and offers theoretical insight into oil recovery enhancement and $\text{CO}_{2}$ injection strategy optimization.</description>

      <title>Ill posedness in shallow multi-phase debris flow models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Depth-averaged systems of equations describing the motion of fluid-sediment mixtures have been widely adopted by scientists in pursuit of models that can predict the paths of dangerous overland flows of debris. As models have become increasingly sophisticated, many have been developed from a multi-phase perspective in which separate, but mutually coupled sets of equations govern the evolution of different components of the mixture. However, this creates the opportunity for the existence of pathological instabilities stemming from resonant interactions between the phases. With reference to the most popular approaches, analyses of two- and three-phase models are performed, which demonstrate that they are more often than not ill posed as initial value problems over physically relevant parameter regimes - an issue which renders them unsuitable for scientific applications. Additionally, a general framework for detecting ill posedness in models with any number of phases is developed. This is used to show that small diffusive terms in the equations for momentum transport, which are sometimes neglected, can reliably eliminate this issue. Conditions are derived for the regularisation of models in this way, but they are typically not met by multi-phase models that feature diffusive terms.</description>

      <title>Evaporation-induced freezing dynamics of droplets levitated in acoustic field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the evaporation-induced freezing dynamics of pure cyclohexane droplets levitated via acoustic levitation. Acoustic levitation has attracted considerable attention across various fields owing to its potential to create lab-in-a-drop systems. While droplet evaporation is a fundamental physicochemical process in such a platform, the freezing of droplets induced by evaporation has been sparsely explored experimentally. For pure cyclohexane, the rapid evaporation of levitated droplets initiated freezing at the droplet surface. To better understand this evaporation-induced freezing process, the evaporation behavior of the levitated cyclohexane droplets was visualized and quantified using a high-speed camera and an infrared camera. According to the obtained experimental data, the evaporative heat transfer characteristics of the droplets were identified with theoretical models. Using the derived heat transfer coefficient, a mathematical prediction method for the onset of freezing was proposed and validated with the experimental data. These experimental findings offer valuable insights into the phase transition process and its potential physicochemical applications in a containerless environment.</description>

      <title>Discrete vortex-based broadcast mode analysis for mitigation of dynamic stall</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01835v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We integrate a discrete vortex method with complex network analysis to strategize dynamic stall mitigation over a pitching airfoil with active flow control. The objective is to inform actuator placement and timing to introduce control inputs during the transient evolution of dynamic stall. To this end, we represent the massively separated flow as a network of discrete vortical elements and quantify the interactions among these vortical nodes by tracking the spread of displacement perturbations between each pair of elements using the discrete vortex method. This enables a network broadcast mode analysis to identify an optimal set of vortices, critical timing, and direction to seed perturbations as control inputs. Motivated by the goal of mitigating dynamic stall, the optimality is defined as minimizing the total circulation of free vortices generated from the leading edge over a prescribed time horizon. We demonstrate the framework on two cases: two-dimensional flow over a flat plate airfoil and three-dimensional turbulent flow over a SD7003 airfoil. The analysis reveals that optimal timing for introducing disturbances occurs just after separation onset, when the shear layer pinches up to form the core of the dynamic stall vortex. Broadcast modes indicate that vortical nodes along the shear layer are optimal for control, guiding actuator placement. Flow simulations validate these insights: placing actuators near the leading edge and triggering them shortly after separation yields a 12% and 30% reduction in peak lift for the flat plate and SD7003 cases, respectively. A corresponding decrease in vorticity injection under control confirms the analysis objective. This study highlights the potential of combining discrete vortex methods with network analysis to guide active flow control in unsteady aerodynamics.</description>

      <title>Moving contact lines of power-law fluids: How nonlinear fluid rheology drastically alters stress singularity and dynamic wetting behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Power-law fluids can strongly affect the degree of the contact line stress singularity and hence the nature of moving contact lines. We develop a framework beyond the classical paradigm for power-law fluids, providing a unified account for the distinct behaviors of the advancing contact lines. We show that the apparent dynamic contact angle $\theta_d$ can depend on the extent of the characteristic dissipation length $h^* \propto U_n/(n-1)$, altering its dependence on the contact line speed $U$. For shear-thinning fluids, we find $\theta_d \sim (h/h^*)^{(1-n)/3}$, with contact line motion being dissipated within $h^*$ extending beyond the local wedge height $h$ without requiring a cutoff. In drop spreading problems, $\theta_d$ varies with the spreading radius $R$, leading to $\theta_d \propto U^{3n/(2n+7)}$ consistent with the spreading law $R \propto t^{n/(3n+7)}$ derived from a self-similar solution, where $R$ is the spreading radius and $t$ is time. For shear-thickening fluids, the apparent contact line motion is characterized by $\theta_d \sim (h^*/h_m)^{(1-n)/3}$, where dissipation is concentrated within $h^*$ which is smaller than the microscopic liquid height $h_m$ near the contact line. In fact, the dynamic contact angle relationship in this case can be expressed as the Cox-Voinov law $\theta_d \sim Ca_{eff}^{1/3}$ in terms of a capillary number $Ca_{eff} =\eta_f U/\gamma$ where $\gamma$ is the surface tension and $\eta_f \propto (U/ h_m)^{n-1}$ is the viscosity based on the local shear rate $U/h_m$ across $h_m$. We also show that a precursor film induced by molecular forces ahead of the wedge leads to $h_m \propto U^{-n/(4-n)}$ and hence $\theta_d \propto U^{3n/(4-n)}$, making the spreading behavior highly sensitive to the contact line microstructure. Our predictions show good agreement with experimental results.</description>

      <title>On global existence and large-time behaviour of weak solutions to the compressible barotropic Navier--Stokes Equations on $\mathbb{T}^2$ with density-dependent bulk viscosity: beyond the Va\u{\i}gant--Kazhikhov regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We are concerned with the compressible barotropic Navier--Stokes equations for a $\gamma$-law gas with density-dependent bulk viscosity coefficient $\lambda=\lambda(\rho)=\rho^\beta$ on the two-dimensional periodic domain $\mathbb{T}^2$. The global existence of weak solutions with initial density bounded away from zero and infinity for $\beta&gt;3$, $\gamma&gt;1$ has been established by Va\u{\i}gant--Kazhikhov [\textit{Sib. Math. J.} 36 (1995), 1283--1316]. When $\gamma=\beta&gt;3$, the large-time behaviour of the weak solutions and, in particular, the absence of formation of vacuum and concentration of density as $t \to \infty$, has been proved by Perepelitsa [\textit{SIAM J. Math. Anal.} 39 (2007/08), 1344--1365]. Huang--Li [\textit{J. Math. Pures Appl.} 106 (2016), 123--154] extended these results by establishing the global existence of weak solutions and large-time behaviour under the assumptions $\beta &gt;3/2$, $1&lt; \gamma&lt;4\beta-3$, and that the initial density stays away from infinity (but may contain vacuum).
  Improving upon the works listed above, we prove that in the regime of parameters as in Huang--Li, namely that $\beta &gt;3/2$ and $1&lt; \gamma&lt;4\beta-3$, if the density has no vacuum or concentration at $t=0$, then it stays away from zero and infinity at all later time $t \in ]0,\infty[$. Moreover, under the mere assumption that $\beta&gt;1$ and $\gamma&gt;1$, we establish the global existence of weak solutions, thus pushing the global existence theory of the barotropic Navier--Stokes equations on $\mathbb{T}^2$ to the most general setting to date. One of the key ingredients of our proof is a novel application -- motivated by the recent work due to Danchin--Mucha [\textit{Comm. Pure Appl. Math.} 76 (2023), 3437--3492] -- of Desjardins' logarithmic interpolation inequality.</description>

      <title>Online model learning with data-assimilated reservoir computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an online learning framework for forecasting nonlinear spatio-temporal signals (fields). The method integrates (i) dimensionality reduction, here, a simple proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) projection; (ii) a generalized autoregressive model to forecast reduced dynamics, here, a reservoir computer; (iii) online adaptation to update the reservoir computer (the model), here, ensemble sequential data assimilation. We demonstrate the framework on a wake past a cylinder governed by the Navier-Stokes equations, exploring the assimilation of full flow fields (projected onto POD modes) and sparse sensors. Three scenarios are examined: a na\"ive physical state estimation; a two-fold estimation of physical and reservoir states; and a three-fold estimation that also adjusts the model parameters. The two-fold strategy significantly improves ensemble convergence and reduces reconstruction error compared to the na\"ive approach. The three-fold approach enables robust online training of partially-trained reservoir computers, overcoming limitations of a priori training. By unifying data-driven reduced order modelling with Bayesian data assimilation, this work opens new opportunities for scalable online model learning for nonlinear time series forecasting.</description>
