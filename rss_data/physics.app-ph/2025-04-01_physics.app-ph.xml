      <title>Scalable Superconducting Nanowire Memory Array with Row-Column Addressing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing ultra-low-energy superconducting computing and fault-tolerant quantum computing will require scalable superconducting memory. While conventional superconducting logic-based memory cells have facilitated early demonstrations, their large footprint poses a significant barrier to scaling. Nanowire-based superconducting memory cells offer a compact alternative, but high error rates have hindered their integration into large arrays. In this work, we present a superconducting nanowire memory array designed for scalable row-column operation, achieving a functional density of 2.6$\,$Mb/cm$^{2}$. The array operates at $1.3\,$K, where we implement and characterize multi-flux quanta state storage and destructive readout. By optimizing write and read pulse sequences, we minimize bit errors while maximizing operational margins in a $4\times 4$ array. Circuit-level simulations further elucidate the memory cell's dynamics, providing insight into performance limits and stability under varying pulse amplitudes. We experimentally demonstrate stable memory operation with a minimum bit error rate of $10^{-5}$. These results suggest a promising path for scaling superconducting nanowire memories to high-density architectures, offering a foundation for energy-efficient memory in superconducting electronics.</description>

      <title>Concept and Demonstration of a Low-cost Compact Electron Microscope Enabled by a Photothermionic Carbon Nanotube Cathode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scanning electron microscope (SEM) delivers high resolution, high depth of focus and an image quality as if microscopic objects are seen by the naked eye. This makes it not only a powerful scientific instrument, but a tool inherently applicable to nearly all fields of study and curiosity involving the small scale. However, SEMs have remained complex, expensive, and beyond the reach of many. To broaden access, we demonstrate an SEM using simple, low-cost, off-the-shelf components, and hobby-level electromechanics; this has been enabled by a unique thermionic electron source based on a carbon nanotube array excited by low optical power. The instrument offers sub-micrometer resolution, a depth of focus of several hundred micrometers, and an image quality comparable to commercial SEMs; it also tolerates poor vacuum and moist specimens, making it broadly applicable. It has a flexible design that lends itself to easy customization for different use scenarios. We provide the conceptual approach and high-level design in this paper; the detailed blueprints of our specific implementation will be provided separately online. We hope that specialists and non-specialists alike will build variations that fit their own needs and interests, helping electron microscopy expand into diverse new sectors of society and industry.</description>

      <title>Weak scattering formulation for flexural waves in thin elastic plates with point-like resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A theoretical study on the weak scattering formulation for flexural waves in thin elastic plates loaded by point-like resonators is reported. Our approach employs the Born approximation and far-field asymptotics of the Green function to characterize multiple scattering effects in this system. The response of the system to an incident wave can be expressed as a power series expansion, where each term introduces higher-order scattering components. The behavior of this series is governed by the spectral properties of a specific matrix, which dictates the convergence and accuracy of the weak scattering approximation. By decomposing the scattering response into geometric and physical contributions, we establish a condition for weak scattering in terms of these two factors. This formulation provides a systematic framework for assessing the validity of low-order approximations and understanding wave interactions in complex media. Numerical examples illustrate the accuracy of the weak scattering condition in periodic and random distributions of scatterers, highlighting its implications for wave control and metamaterial design.</description>

      <title>Mechanism on Failure of Cooled Infrared Detector Illuminated by CW laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooled infrared detectors with high sensitivity and high performance are widely applied in many fields. However, environmental disturbances such as intense light may cause a decline in their performance and even lead to permanent damage. In this study, the multi-physical behaviors and the performance degradation processes of typical cooled infrared detectors under the illumination of high-power density lasers are investigated to evaluate their survivability under extreme conditions. The experimental results reveal the electrical and thermomechanical responses of the detectors under the illumination of continuous-wave lasers, and the main thermomechanical failure modes that have not been revealed before are discovered. The theoretical results obtained through a newly established three-dimensional multi-physical numerical model of the detectors under laser illumination clarify the thermomechanical mechanism of the failure of the main components of the detectors. Moreover, the dependence of the thermomechanical results on relevant parameters is discussed, providing a scientific basis for the development and optimization of related systems.</description>

      <title>Acceleration Theorem for Low-Dimensional Electron Systems with Off-Diagonal Effective Mass Components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The motion of electrons under homogeneously applied electric fields in low-dimensional systems with non-zero off-diagonal effective mass (ODEM) is studied. The equation describing the time evolution of a probability coefficient of finding an electron in a subband is derived using the Krieger-Iafrate theory in the effective mass approximation. It is shown that an electron can change subbands during free flight due to the ODEM-induced inter-subband transitions. By introducing an effective dispersion defined as a weighted average of the subband dispersions, it is also shown that the initial acceleration of an electron effectively follows the bulk dispersion relation. The results obtained suggest that the transport properties of the quantized systems when many subbands are occupied in the weak confinement limit approach the values one would find without considering the quantization.</description>

      <title>Strain effects in a directly bonded diamond-on-insulator substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The direct bonding process of a diamond-on-insulator (DOI) substrate enables monolithic integration of diamond photonic structures for quantum computing by improving photon collection efficiency and entanglement generation rate between emitters. It also addresses key fabrication challenges, such as robustness, bonding strength, and scalability. In this study, we investigate strain effects in DOI substrates following direct bonding. Strain generation is expected near the diamond-SiO2/Si interface due to thermal expansion coefficient mismatch between the bonded materials. Strain-induced lattice distortions are characterized using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond via optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) and photoluminescence (PL) mapping. PL mapping reveals interference fringes in unbonded regions, indicating bonding irregularities. Depth-resolved ODMR measurements show a volumetric strain component increase of ~0.45 MHz and a shear component increase of ~0.71 MHz between the top surface and the DOI interface. However, ODMR signal contrast and peak linewidth remain largely unaffected, suggesting no visible deterioration in the optical properties of the emitters. By combining ODMR and PL mapping, this work establishes a robust methodology for assessing bonding quality and strain impact on NV centers, an essential step toward advancing scalable quantum technologies and integrated photonic circuits.</description>

      <title>First-principles design of stable spin qubits in monolayer MoS2 with elemental defect engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum information science (QIS), encompassing technologies such as quantum computing, sensing, and communication, relies on the development and manipulation of quantum bits (qubits). Recently, two-dimensional (2D) materials - characterized by their atomic thinness and external controllability - have emerged as promising candidates for qubit fabrication and manipulation at room temperature. In this study, we propose that antisite defects (MX) in 2D transition metal disulfides (TMDs) can serve as tunable quantum defects with controlled positioning. Using first-principles atomic structure simulations, we identify six thermodynamically stable neutral antisite defects (MX, where M = Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Zn, Cd; X = S) in monolayer 1H-MoS2. These defects exhibit potential as spin-defected qubits with stable triplet ground states. Additionally, we demonstrate that the reduction of the bandgap leads to significant fluctuations in the absorption coefficient within the low-energy range, resulting in the optical response within the desired telecommunication band, which is advantageous for quantum communication applications. The zero-phonon line (ZPL) associated with these qubits can serve as an effective identifier. This work presents the novel, tunable approach to exploiting defects in 2D materials, opening new possibilities for the development of qubit platforms in quantum information technology.</description>

      <title>Harnessing uncertainty when learning through Equilibrium Propagation in neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is a supervised learning algorithm that trains network parameters using local neuronal activity. This is in stark contrast to backpropagation, where updating the parameters of the network requires significant data shuffling. Avoiding data movement makes EP particularly compelling as a learning framework for energy-efficient training on neuromorphic systems. In this work, we assess the ability of EP to learn on hardware that contain physical uncertainties. This is particularly important for researchers concerned with hardware implementations of self-learning systems that utilize EP. Our results demonstrate that deep, multi-layer neural network architectures can be trained successfully using EP in the presence of finite uncertainties, up to a critical limit. This limit is independent of the training dataset, and can be scaled through sampling the network according to the central limit theorem. Additionally, we demonstrate improved model convergence and performance for finite levels of uncertainty on the MNIST, KMNIST and FashionMNIST datasets. Optimal performance is found for networks trained with uncertainties close to the critical limit. Our research supports future work to build self-learning hardware in situ with EP.</description>

      <title>Intermediate Excited State Relaxation Dynamics of Boron-Vacancy Spin Defects in Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The experimental identification of optically addressable spin defects in hexagonal boron nitride has opened new possibilities for quantum sensor technologies in two-dimensional materials and structures. Despite numerous fundamental and theoretical studies on the electronic structure of defects, the dynamics of the excited states are yet to be comprehensively investigated. The non-radiative relaxation pathways from the triplet excited states to the triplet ground states, particularly the one via a metastable intermediate state, remain largely presumed. A detailed identification, let alone a direct measurement of the rate constants, is still lacking. In this work, we investigate the relaxation dynamics of the excited and intermediate states in the optical cycle under pulsed laser excitation in a broad temperature range. The focus is on the shelving intermediate state and resulting ground state spin polarization of an ensemble of optically pumped negatively charged boron vacancies. Our experiments show a relaxation time of 24 ns from the metastable state back to the ground state at room temperature. For low temperatures we find this time to approximately double - in accordance with a doubling of photoluminescence lifetime and intensity. Simulations show the evolution of the spin-populations in the five-level system and the polarization of the ground state depending on excitation rates. We thus optimize pulsed optically detected magnetic resonance sequences to account for the relaxation of the intermediate state. This yields significantly increased efficiency of the spin manipulation and hence, the sensitivity of the quantum sensor based on boron vacancies can be optimized considerably.</description>

      <title>HTS Potential and Needs for Future Accelerator Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: HTS has the potential of a game changer for many applications of superconductivity, not last in the field of particle accelerators and detectors. This paper explores the potential of HTS, with a focus on REBCO-coated conductors, in relation to the evolving demands of superconducting magnets for accelerators. HTS already have a spectacular current carrying ability at high field, demonstrated and available on relevant lengths. Recent advances in non-conventional winding techniques for solenoids, in particular non-insulated windings, have shown that it is possible to reach engineering current densities in the coil exceeding by far those of LTS . This approach seems to offer an extended field reach, as well as solutions to the challenges associated with magnet mechanics, quench management and cost. Most important, beyond the ability to reach a field range higher than what is possible with LTS, HTS offers an extended range of operating temperature, with large margin. This can be exploited to obtain higher availability and better cryogenic efficiency, a must for the future of sustainable large scale research infrastructures such as particle accelerators.</description>

      <title>Compact orbital-angular-momentum multiplexing via laser-written glass chips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes have emerged as a promising solution for enhancing the capacity of optical multiplexing systems, leveraging their theoretically unbounded set of orthogonal spatial modes. However, the generation and detection of OAM multiplexing signals are predominantly reliant on bulky optical components within complex optical setups. We introduce a compact solution for OAM information processing using laser-written glass chips, facilitating efficient multiplexing and demultiplexing of multiple OAM information channels. During the multiplexing process, OAM channels are managed via laser-scribed single-mode waveguides within a glass chip, with their modes converted using laser-written holograms on the side wall of the glass chip. The reverse optical process is employed for OAM demultiplexing. Our chips seamlessly interface with commercial optical fibers, ensuring compatibility with existing fiber-optic communication infrastructure. This work not only establishes a novel approach for OAM optical multiplexing but also underscores the potential of laser-writing technology in advancing photonics and its practical applications in optical communications.</description>

      <title>Determining diffusivity and dissipation of diffuse body waves in concrete with multiple planar boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new method for determining the diffusive properties of diffuse body waves, specifically diffusivity and dissipation, in concrete with multiple planar boundaries. Instead of relying on the analytical solution to the diffusion equation, which accounts for all possible reflections and has a significantly complex form, we propose a simpler method that considers the reflected energy originating from a limited number of image sources, making it easier to perform curve fitting and obtain diffusive properties. Our experimental findings highlight that distant image sources have a negligible effect on the acquired diffusive properties, suggesting that the number of image sources considered should be determined based on their maximum contribution to the main energy. Additionally, failing to account for the reflected energy during the fitting process results in an underestimation of both the diffusivity and dissipation. The obtained diffusive properties can be used to evaluate damage in concrete.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Bottom-Up Fabrication of Plasmonic Nanostructures on Optical Nanofibers via Blurred Electron Beam Deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel method for the deterministic fabrication of metallic nanostructures with controlled geometry and composition on suspended, single mode tapered optical nanofibers (TNFs) using a tailored Blurred Electron Beam Induced Deposition (BEBID) technique. TNFs, owing to their subwavelength diameters and intense evanescent fields, offer a unique platform for enhanced light matter interactions at the nanoscale. However, their mechanical fragility has thus far hindered the integration of plasmonic structures using conventional high energy deposition methods. BEBID addresses this limitation by deliberately defocusing the electron beam to reduce local mechanical stress, minimize vibration, and prevent fiber damage during deposition, thereby enabling the one-step growth of platinum nanopillars with sub 20 nm spatial precision and high structural fidelity directly on suspended TNFs. The fabricated structures were characterized using SEM, EDX, and their optical properties were investigated through broadband scattering spectra and polarization resolved measurements, showing strong agreement with Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) simulations. Numerical modeling further reveals that ordered arrays of nanopillars can shape and direct the scattered field along the fiber axis, enabling directional emission. This work establishes BEBID as a versatile bottom up nanofabrication approach for functional photonic architectures on fragile substrates, with direct applications in quantum photonics, nano optics, and on fiber plasmonic sensing.</description>

      <title>Creation of a black hole bomb instability in an electromagnetic system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The amplification and generation of electromagnetic radiation by a rotating metallic or lossy cylinder, first theorized by Zeldovich in the 1970s, is tightly connected to the concepts of quantum friction, energy extraction from rotating black holes and runaway mechanisms such as black hole bombs. Despite recent advances including acoustic analogues of the Zeldovich effect and the observation of a negative resistance in a low-frequency electromagnetic model, actual positive signal amplitude gain, the spontaneous generation of electromagnetic waves and runaway amplifi- cation effects have never been experimentally verified. Here, we demonstrate experimentally that a mechanically rotating metallic cylinder not only definitively acts as an amplifier of a rotating elec- tromagnetic field mode but also, when paired with a low-loss resonator, becomes unstable and acts as a generator, seeded only by noise. The system exhibits an exponential runaway amplification of spontaneously generated electromagnetic modes thus demonstrating the electromagnetic analogue of Press and Teukolskys black hole bomb. The exponential amplification from noise supports theoretical investigations into black hole instabilities and is promising for the development of future experiments to observe quantum friction in the form of the Zeldovich effect seeded by the quantum vacuum.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, prediction of airfoil shape from targeted pressure distribution (suction and pressure sides) and vice versa is demonstrated using both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) techniques. The dataset is generated for 1600 airfoil shapes, with simulations carried out at Reynolds numbers (Re) ranging from 10,000 and 90,00,000 and angles of attack (AoA) ranging from 0 to 15 degrees, ensuring the dataset captured diverse aerodynamic conditions. Five different CNN and DNN models are developed depending on the input/output parameters. Results demonstrate that the refined models exhibit improved efficiency, with the DNN model achieving a multi-fold reduction in training time compared to the CNN model for complex datasets consisting of varying airfoil, Re, and AoA. The predicted airfoil shapes/pressure distribution closely match the targeted values, validating the effectiveness of deep learning frameworks. However, the performance of CNN models is found to be better compared to DNN models. Lastly, a flying wing aircraft model of wingspan &gt;10 m is considered for the prediction of pressure distribution along the chordwise. The proposed CNN and DNN models show promising results. This research underscores the potential of deep learning models accelerating aerodynamic optimization and advancing the design of high-performance airfoils.</description>

      <title>Measurement and Modeling on Terahertz Channel Propagation Through Vegetation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The terahertz band offers promising opportunities for high-capacity wireless communications but faces significant challenges from vegetation-induced channel impairments. This article presents a comprehensive investigation of THz channel propagation through vegetation, introducing a hybrid modeling approach that combines deterministic vegetation dependent exponential decay modeling with statistical characterization of temporal variations. Through extensive laboratory measurements using Epipremnum aureum, we find that vegetation introduces angular-dependent power losses, with channel statistics following heavy tailed Stable distributions rather than conventional Rician or Weibull models. Our outdoor measurements with dense and sparse lilac scenarios reveal pronounced seasonal variations in attenuation and height-dependent effects, while validating the VED model's ability to maintain excellent agreement with measured data and parameter stability across different heights. Critical bit error rate analysis uncovers distinct SNR thresholds beyond which performance exhibits oscillatory behavior due to heavy-tailed fading, with significant implications for modulation scheme selection and power control strategies in practical THz communication systems.</description>

      <title>Proper Characterization of Heat-to-Electric Conversion Efficiency of Liquid Thermogalvanic Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Liquid thermogalvanic cells (LTCs) have emerged as a promising technology for harvesting low-grade heat due to their low cost, compact design, and high thermopower. However, discrepancies exist in quantifying their output power and efficiency. The commonly used figure of merit, ZT = S^2\sigma T/k, is based on electrolyte properties but fails to account for electrochemical reaction kinetics at the electrode interface that significantly impact performance and losses. This work establishes an experimental protocol for accurately characterizing LTC efficiency. We propose a device-level figure of merit, ZT = S^2T/RK , where R and K represent total internal resistance and thermal conductance. This formulation, derived by linearizing the Butler-Volmer relation, incorporates irreversible losses such as mass transfer and activation overpotential. Different methods for assessing LTC output power are examined, including linear sweeping voltammetry (LSV), constant resistance discharging, and constant current step discharging. LSV tends to overestimate power due to transient effects, while the latter two methods provide more accurate steady-state measurements. Additionally, heat conduction across LTCs is carefully analyzed, highlighting the significant impact of natural convection within electrolytes. Through rigorous experimental characterization, we demonstrate that the modified figure of merit is a proper efficiency indicator at the steady-state.</description>

      <title>All-optical modulation with single-photons using electron avalanche</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The distinctive characteristics of light, such as high-speed and low-loss propagation, low cross-talk and low power consumption, along with photons unique quantum properties, make it most suitable for various applications in communication, high-resolution imaging, optical computing, and emerging quantum information technologies. One limiting factor, though, is the weak optical nonlinearity of conventional media that poses challenges for the control of light with ultra-low intensities. In this work, we demonstrate all-optical modulation enabled by electron avalanche process in silicon, using a control beam with single-photon light intensities. The observed process corresponds to a record-high nonlinear refractive index of $n_{2}$~$1.3*10^{-2} m^2/W$, which is several orders of magnitude higher than the best known nonlinear optical materials. Our approach opens the possibility of gigahertz-speed, and potentially even faster, optical switching at the single-photon level, which could enable a family of novel on-chip photonic and quantum devices operating at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Stability of Cantilever-like Structures with Applications to Soft Robot Arms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07601v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The application of variational principles for analyzing problems in the physical sciences is widespread. Cantilever-like problems, where one end is fixed and the other end is free, have received less attention in terms of their stability despite their prevalence. In this article, we establish stability conditions for these problems by examining the second variation of the energy functional through the generalized Jacobi condition. This requires computing conjugate points determined by solving a set of initial value problems from the linearized equilibrium equations. We apply these conditions to investigate the nonlinear stability of intrinsically curved elastic cantilevers subject to an end load. The rod deformations are modelled using Kirchhoff rod theory. The role of intrinsic curvature in inducing complex nonlinear phenomena, such as snap-back instability, is particularly emphasized. The numerical examples highlight its dependence on the system parameters. These examples illustrate potential applications in the design of flexible soft robot arms and innovative mechanisms.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Investigation of PbSe Thermoelectric Material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The thermoelectric characteristics of lead selenium (PbSe) doped with gallium (Ga) are investigated in this study. When the lead sulfide (PbSe) is tuned with appropriate dopants, it exhibits satisfactory ZT values, hence making it a promising thermoelectric material. This study examines the electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, thermal conductivity, and power factor of PbSe, with varying amounts of added Ga. Results indicate that incorporating Ga into PbSe improves its thermoelectric performance, with a maximum ZT value of approximately 1.2 at 873 K for the optimal doping concentration of 0.005 atomic percent. This improvement is attributed to the combined effects of increased electrical conductivity and reduced thermal conductivity. These findings suggest that Ga-doped PbSe is a promising candidate for mid-temperature thermoelectric applications.</description>

      <title>Dynamic switching of ferrocene and plasmonic interactions in Au/self-assembled monolayer/single Ag nanocube molecular junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the redox switching of ferrocene moieties embedded in a double tunnel barrier plasmonic cavity fabricated from a click-chemistry self-assembled monolayers of ferrocenyl-alkylthiol on ultra flat gold surfaces, connected to a single poly(vinylpyrrolidone) capped silver nanocube, AgNC, which is contacted by the tip of a conductive-AFM to study the electron transport properties in the dark and under light irradiation at the plasmonic resonance wavelengths. We observe a dual behavior in the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics in the dark: a large hysteresis loop at positive voltages and an hysteretic negative differential conductance (NDC) at negative voltages, due to the redox switching of ferrocene between its oxidized (Fc+) and neutral (Fc0) states. The I-V curves are analyzed by a generalized combined Marcus-Landauer model. We determine the highest occupied molecular orbital of the Fc+ and Fc0 states at 0.54 and 0.42 eV below the Fermi energy, respectively, with a weak reorganization energy &lt; 0.1 eV upon switching. Under plasmonic excitation, the hysteresis and NDC behaviors are no longer observed and the I-V characteristics of the Au-ferrocenyl-alkylthiol/AgNC junctions become similar to Au-ferrocenyl-alkylthiol SAMs. A virtual molecular orbital due to the plasmon-induced coupling (fast electron transfer) between the two redox states of the Fc is determined at 0.46 eV. This dynamic behavior opens perspectives in artificial synaptic devices for neuromorphic computing with the additional function to turn on/off this synaptic behavior on-demand by light.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric HfO$_2$-ZrO$_2$ multilayers with reduced wake-up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the discovery of ferroelectricity in HfO$_2$ thin films, significant research has focused on Zr-doped HfO$_2$ and solid solution (Hf,Zr)O$_2$ thin films. Functional properties can be further tuned via multilayering, however, this approach has not yet been fully explored in HfO$_2$-ZrO$_2$ films. This work demonstrates ferroelectricity in a 50 nm thick, solution-processed HfO$_2$-ZrO$_2$ multilayer film, marking it as the thickest multilayer film to date exhibiting ferroelectric properties. The multilayer structure was confirmed through transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, with high-resolution TEM revealing grain continuity across multiple layers. This finding indicates that a polar phase in the originally paraelectric ZrO$_2$ layer, can be stabilized by the HfO$_2$ layer. The film attains a remanent polarization of 9 uC/cm$^2$ and exhibits accelerated wake-up behavior, attributed to its higher breakdown strength resulting from the incorporation of multiple interfaces. These results offer a faster wake-up mechanism for thick ferroelectric hafnia films.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear particle motion and bursty periodic energy deposition in inductively coupled plasmas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03508v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional, electromagnetic particle-in-cell simulations are employed to study particle kinetics and power deposition in inductively coupled plasmas. We show that in the regime of low frequency ($\sim\mathrm{MHz}$) and low pressure, the motion of electrons can be highly nonlinear in the skin region near the antenna coil. Through most of the RF cycle, the electrons are strongly magnetized, with energy deposition being small. However, for a brief period around the null of the oscillating magnetic field, the electrons demagnetize, causing a jet-like current penetrating into the bulk plasma. During these brief periods, the power deposition becomes high, exhibiting a periodic burst nature. Based on kinetic theory, we provide new analytical expressions for the plasma current and energy deposition. A criterion for transition between the newly identified low-frequency, periodic-burst regime and the usual anomalous non-local skin effect regime is proposed and verified using a series of fully kinetic 2D particle-in-cell simulations.</description>

      <title>Influence of elastic deformations on body-wave velocity in solids: a case study considering shear deformations in concrete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the influence of elastic deformation on the velocity of body waves in compressible isotropic materials making use of the framework of acoustoelasticity. Specifically, it examines body waves propagating at an angle to the principal deformation axes, where both shear and normal deformations are present in the coordinate system defined by the wave propagation direction. While numerous efforts have addressed this topic, the theoretical derivations have not yet to provide definitive conclusions about the response of wave velocity to applied shear stresses and strains. To derive more specific conclusions for body waves in concrete, we analyzed three examples using concrete as the medium. The key findings are that, in case of concrete materials when body waves propagate on the shear deformation plane, variations in longitudinal wave velocity are predominantly attributed to changes in normal strains, whereas transverse wave velocity is significantly influenced by both normal and shear strains. This finding can enhance the use of acoustoelasticity for detecting the magnitudes and directions of principal stresses in plane stress state applications.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Enhanced Unconventional Spin Current Anisotropy in a Collinear Antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin-orbit torque (SOT) presents a promising avenue for energy-efficient spintronics devices, surpassing the limitations of spin transfer torque. While extensively studied in heavy metals, SOT in antiferromagnetic quantum materials remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate SOT in epitaxial FeSn, a collinear antiferromagnet with a kagome lattice. FeSn exhibits intriguing topological quantum features, including two-dimensional flat bands and Dirac-like surface states, making it an ideal platform for investigating emergent SOT properties. Using spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance, we uncover a six-fold symmetric damping-like SOT in epitaxial-FeSn/Py heterostructures, reflecting the six-fold symmetry of the epitaxial [0001]-oriented FeSn films. Additionally, we observe a substantial unconventional field-like torque, originating from spin currents with out-of-plane spin polarization. This torque exhibits a unique angular dependence-a superposition of six-fold crystalline symmetry and uniaxial symmetry associated with the antiferromagnetic spin Hall effect. Notably, the unconventional field-like torque is enhanced when the RF current flows along the Neel vector in FeSn. Our findings reveal an unconventional spin current anisotropy tunable by crystalline and magnetic symmetry, offering a novel approach for controlling SOT in antiferromagnetic spintronics.</description>
