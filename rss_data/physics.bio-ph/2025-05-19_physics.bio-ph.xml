      <title>Near-critical gene expression in embryonic boundary precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embryonic development relies on the formation of sharp, precise gene expression boundaries. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, boundary formation has been proposed to occur at a dynamical critical point. Yet, in the paradigmatic case of the hunchback (hb) gene, evidence suggests that boundary formation occurs in a bistable regime, not at the dynamical critical point. We develop a minimal model for hb expression and identify a single parameter that tunes the system from its monostable regime to its bistable regime, crossing the critical point in between. We find that boundary precision is maximized when the system is weakly bistable--near, but not at, the critical point--optimally negotiating the tradeoff between two key effects of bistability: sharpening the boundary and amplifying its noise. Incorporating the diffusion of Hb proteins into our model, we show that boundary precision is maximized simultaneously at an optimal degree of bistability and an optimal diffusion strength. Our work elucidates design principles of precise boundary formation and has general implications for pattern formation in multicellular systems.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Interplay Between Formation Mechanisms and Luminescence of Lignin Carbon Quantum Dots from Spruce Biomass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the intricate relationship between the formation mechanisms and luminescent properties of lignin-derived carbon quantum dots (LG-CQDs) synthesized from spruce biomass by hydrothermal treatment. A comprehensive understanding of LG-CQD structure and its photoluminescence requires insights into the native architecture of lignin and the distribution of its acidolysis-derived fragments. Research showed how these lignin-derived units interact with dopant molecules in three different approaches during synthesis, contributing to core and surface structures that govern the optical behavior. Our findings reveal a clear correlation between structural features and luminescent properties, emphasizing the role of surface chemistry in tuning emission characteristics. These insights provide a foundation for the rational design of LG-CQDs with tailored luminescent properties, advancing their potential applications in sustainable optoelectronics, sensing, and bioimaging.</description>

      <title>Spatial and Temporal Characterization of Living Mycelium through Dispersion Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective: This study explores the feasibility of using living mycelium as a sustainable biosensing material for structural health monitoring in buildings and infrastructure. Methods: An electrical impedance network model was developed to characterize the signal transmission properties of mycelium. The model was coupled with the inhomogeneous wave correlation (IWC) method, commonly used in elastic wave propagation, to assess the dispersion behavior of electrical signals through mycelial networks. Experimental validation was conducted using living, dehydrated, and rehydrated mycelium samples. Results: The results demonstrate clear frequency-dependent and spatial attenuation characteristics of electrical signals in mycelium. The analysis highlights the critical role of environmental humidity in enabling effective signal transmission. Furthermore, dispersion behavior was used to assess the homogeneity of the material, revealing differences in signal behavior across hydration states. Conclusion: The combination of impedance modeling and dispersion analysis confirms that living mycelium can serve as a viable medium for transmitting and sensing electrical signals in a structurally integrated form. Its performance is significantly influenced by hydration level, reinforcing the need to control or monitor environmental conditions in practical applications. Significance: This work introduces mycelium as a novel, biodegradable material for embedded biosensing, contributing to the advancement of sustainable technologies in biomedical and structural health monitoring.</description>

      <title>Universal scaling of segment fluctuations in polymer and chromatin dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate how center-of-mass (COM) motion influences polymer segment fluctuations. Cancellation of internal forces, together with spatially uncorrelated external noise, generally yields COM diffusivity scaling as $1/s$ with segment length $s$, regardless of fractal dimension, viscoelasticity, or activity. This introduces distinct dynamic scaling corrections to two-point fluctuations and quenched-induced tangential correlations, validated by theory, simulations, and chromatin imaging data. In the latter, the extracted dynamic exponent reveals topological constraints, thereby resolving the discrepancy between chromatin's crumpled structure and its Rouse-like dynamics.</description>

      <title>Chemically active droplets in crowded environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biomolecular condensates are essential for cellular organization and result from phase separation in systems far from thermodynamic equilibrium. Among various models, chemically active droplets play a significant role, consisting of proteins that switch between attractive and repulsive states via nonequilibrium chemical reactions. While field-based simulations have provided insights into their behavior, these coarse-grained approaches fail to capture molecular-scale effects, particularly in crowded cellular environments. Macromolecular crowding, a key feature of intracellular organization, strongly influences molecular transport within condensates, yet its quantitative impact remains underexplored. This study investigates the interplay between chemically active droplets and crowders by using particle-based models, that provide molecular insight, and a field-based model, that complements this picture. Surprisingly, crowding reduces droplet size while expanding the overall dense phase volume, challenging equilibrium-based expectations. This effect arises from the interplay between depletion interactions, diffusion hindrance, and nonequilibrium particle fluxes. Our findings provide a step towards a more comprehensive understanding of chemically active droplets in complex, realistic cellular environments.</description>
