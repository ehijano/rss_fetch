      <title>Demonstration of optical spring in an un-detuned cavity containing an optical parametric amplifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we demonstrate the capacity to manipulate the optical spring (OS) effect by employing an optical parametric amplifier (OPA) within an optical cavity. We observed more than a factor of 2 increase in the OS frequency shift with the OPA. We also showed for the first time that the OS can be tuned by solely adjusting the OPA phase and showing an un-detuned cavity exhibiting an optical spring. The method can be applied to gravitational wave detectors in the signal recycling configuration to realize narrow bandwidth high sensitivity. The OS can be tuned to align the detector peak sensitivity frequency to known frequency continuous gravitational wave signals, dynamically tuned to track the gravitational wave signal from merging compact binaries or tuned to search for the post-merger signal of known binary coalescence.</description>

      <title>Broadband Fourier-Transform Optical Photothermal Infrared Spectroscopy and Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical photothermal microscopy is a powerful, emerging method that overcomes the diffraction limit in infrared hyperspectral imaging by utilizing a visible probe laser beam to detect local temperature-induced modulation at the visible diffraction limit. However, the spectral range of this technique has been limited by the tuning range of infrared sources, which is generally restricted to the fingerprint window with commercially available quantum cascade lasers. In this work, ultra-broadband synchrotron infrared radiation was used for infrared photothermal imaging and spectroscopy, spanning the entire mid-infrared range. Both optical- and fluorescence-detected photothermal modalities were performed, demonstrating improved spectral range when compared to optical photothermal microscopy using commercial sources and improved spatial resolution when compared to synchrotron micro-spectroscopy measurements. Following these initial validation studies, synchrotron Fourier-transform optical photothermal infrared spectroscopy (FT-OPTIR) in combination with synchrotron micro-spectroscopy measurements were used to differentiate cells in mouse brain tissue sections.</description>

      <title>Wide Field of View Large Aperture Meta-Doublet Eyepiece</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wide field of view and light weight optics are critical for advanced eyewear, with applications in augmented/virtual reality and night vision. Conventional refractive lenses are often stacked to correct aberrations at wide field of view, leading to limited performance and increased size and weight. In particular, simultaneously achieving wide field of view and large aperture for light collection is desirable but challenging to realize in a compact form-factor. Here, we demonstrate a wide field of view (greater than 60$^\circ$) meta-optic doublet eyepiece with an entrance aperture of 2.1 cm. At the design wavelength of 633 nm, the meta-optic doublet achieves comparable performance to a refractive lens-based eyepiece system. This meta-doublet eyepiece illustrates the potential for meta-optics to play an important role in the development of high-quality monochrome near-eye display and night vision systems.</description>

      <title>Electro-Optic Cavities for In-Situ Measurement of Cavity Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cavity electrodynamics offers a unique avenue for tailoring ground-state material properties, excited-state engineering, and versatile control of quantum matter. Merging these concepts with high-field physics in the terahertz (THz) spectral range opens the door to explore low-energy, field-driven cavity electrodynamics, emerging from fundamental resonances or order parameters. Despite this demand, leveraging the full potential of field-driven material control in cavities is hindered by the lack of direct access to the intra-cavity fields. Here, we demonstrate a new concept of active cavities, consisting of electro-optic Fabry-Perot resonators, which measure their intra-cavity electric fields on sub-cycle timescales. We thereby demonstrate quantitative retrieval of the cavity modes in amplitude and phase, over a broad THz frequency range. To enable simultaneous intra-cavity sampling alongside excited-state material control, we design a tunable multi-layer cavity, enabling deterministic design of hybrid cavities for polaritonic systems. Our theoretical models reveal the origin of the avoided crossings embedded in the intricate mode dispersion, and will enable fully-switchable polaritonic effects within arbitrary materials hosted by the hybrid cavity. Electro-optic cavities (EOCs) will therefore serve as integrated probes of light-matter interactions across all coupling regimes, laying the foundation for field-resolved intra-cavity quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Vertical CNT-Si Photodiode Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A photodiode consisting of nanopillars of thin-film silicon p-i-n on an array of vertically aligned carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with a noncontinuous cathode electrode is demonstrated. The structure exploits the intrinsic enhancement of the CNTs electric field, which leads to reduction in the photodiodes operating voltage and response time and enhancement of optical coupling due to better light trapping, as compared with the conventional planar photodiode. These improvements translate to higher resolution and higher frame rate flat-panel imaging systems for a broad range of applications, including computed tomography and particle detection.</description>

      <title>Manipulating Spectral Windings and Skin Modes through Nonconservative Couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) has revolutionized our understanding of wave propagation in non-Hermitian systems, highlighting unexpected localization effects beyond conventional theories. Here, we discover that NHSE, accompanied by multi-type spectral phases, can be induced by manipulating nonconservative couplings. By characterizing the spectrum through the windings of the energy bands, we demonstrate that band structures with identical, opposite, and even twisted windings can be achieved. These inequivalent types of spectra originate from the multi-channel interference resulting from the interplay between conservative and nonconservative couplings. Associated with the multi-type spectra, unipolar and bipolar NHSE with different eigenmode localizations can be observed. Additionally, our findings link the nonreciprocal transmission properties of the system to multiple spectral phases, indicating a connection with the skin modes. This work paves new pathways for investigating non-Hermitian topological effects and manipulating nonreciprocal energy flow.</description>

      <title>Towards a second generation of metascintillators using the Purcell effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study focuses on advancing metascintillators to break the 100 ps barrier and approach the 10 ps target. We exploit nanophotonic features, specifically the Purcell effect, to shape and enhance the scintillation properties of the first-generation metascintillator. We demonstrate that a faster emission is achievable along with a more efficient conversion efficiency. This results in a coincidence time resolution improved by a factor of 1.6, crucial for TOF-PET applications.</description>

      <title>Thickness-dependent properties of transparent conductive oxides for epsilon-near-zero applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) materials have attracted much attention due to their unique properties that can be tuned under electrical and optical signals. Furthermore, they allow for a strong enhancement of a nonlinearity close to the ENZ regime, which can have a direct impact on many fields ranging from telecommunications, sensing, quantum optics, to neuromorphic computing. Among the many materials belonging to the ENZ class, transparent conductive oxides (TCOs) are of particular interest because they are very well known to the community and possess very well understood electrical and optical properties. This work extends the direct control of the optical properties of transparent conductive oxides by tailoring the film thickness, which opens new possibilities for ENZ-enhanced photonic applications. It is shown that the thickness-dependent ENZ resonance in the TCO films is equivalent to the power-dependent ENZ resonance as for the same amount of power provided to the TCO film the electric field confinement in the thinner films is highly enhanced for TM polarized light, resulting in the higher electrons effective mass. Thus, the optical properties of TCO can be optically tuned in the ENZ regime, which opens possibilities for a new type of devices that can operate under all-optical switching mechanism.</description>

      <title>Breaking the angular dispersion limit in thin film optics by ultra-strong light-matter coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin film interference is integral to modern photonics and optoelectronics, e.g. allowing for precise design of high performance optical filters1, efficiency enhancements in photovoltaics and light-emitting devices, as well as the realization of microlasers and high-performance photodetectors. However, interference inevitably leads to a change of spectral characteristics with angle, which is generally undesired and can limit the usefulness of thin-film coatings and devices. Here, we introduce a strategy to overcome this fundamental limit in optics by utilizing and tuning the exciton-polariton modes arising in ultra-strongly coupled microcavities. We demonstrate optical filters with narrow pass bands that shift by less than their half width (&lt;15 nm) even at extreme angles. Our filters cover the entire visible range and surpass comparable metal-dielectric-metal filters in all relevant metrics. By expanding this strategy to strong coupling with the photonic sidebands of dielectric multilayer stacks, we also obtain filters with high extinction ratios. Based on these findings, we realize ultrathin and flexible narrowband filter films, monolithically integrate our filters with organic photodiodes, and demonstrate polarization-sensitive polariton filters. These results illustrate how strong coupling provides additional degrees of freedom in thin film optics that will enable a multitude of exciting new applications in micro-optics, sensing, and biophotonics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, quantum nanophotonics has forged a rich nexus of nanotechnology with photonic quantum information processing, offering remarkable prospects for advancing quantum technologies beyond their current technical limits in terms of physical compactness, energy efficiency, operation speed, temperature robustness and scalability. In this perspective, we highlight a number of recent studies that reveal the especially compelling potential of nanoplasmonic cavity quantum electrodynamics for driving quantum technologies down to nanoscale spatial and ultrafast temporal regimes, whilst elevating them to ambient temperatures. Our perspective encompasses innovative proposals for quantum plasmonic biosensing, driving ultrafast single-photon emission and achieving near-field multipartite entanglement in the strong coupling regime, with a notable emphasis on the use of industry-grade devices. We conclude with an outlook emphasizing how the bespoke characteristics and functionalities of plasmonic devices are shaping contemporary research directives in ultrafast and room-temperature quantum nanotechnologies.</description>

      <title>Edge states in all-dielectric square-lattice arrays of bianisotropic microwave resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a bianisotropic response associated with a broken mirror symmetry of a dielectric resonator allows opening the bandgap in simple square lattice arrays of such resonators. Realizing the proposed system as an array of high-index ceramic resonators working at GHz frequencies, we numerically and experimentally demonstrate the presence of edge states at the interface between two domains with opposite orientations of the bianisotropic resonators as well as at the boundary between a single domain and free space. For both cases, we characterize the dispersion of edge states, examine their propagation along sharp bends, their resilience towards various types of geometrical defects, and a spin-momentum locked unidirectional propagation in the case of circularly polarized excitation. The considered design opens novel possibilities in constructing optical and microwave structures simultaneously featuring edge states at the interfaces between distinct resonator domains or a resonator domain and free space.</description>

      <title>Phase distribution in 1D localization and phase transitions in single-mode waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Localization of electrons in 1D disordered systems is usually described in the random phase approximation, when distributions of phases \varphi and \theta, entering the transfer matrix, are considered as uniform. In the general case, the random phase approximation is violated, and the evolution equations (when the system length L is increased) contain three independent variables, i.e. the Landauer resistance \rho and the combined phases \psi=\theta-\varphi and \chi=\theta+\varphi. The phase \chi does not affect the evolution of \rho and was not considered in previous papers. The distribution of the phase \psi is found to exhibit an unusual phase transition at the point E_0 when changing the electron energy E, which manifests itself in the appearance of the imaginary part of \psi. The distribution of resistance P(\rho) has no singularity at the point E_0, and the transition looks unobservable in the electron disordered systems. However, the theory of 1D localization is immediately applicable to propagation of waves in single-mode optical waveguides. The optical methods are more efficient and provide possibility to measure phases \psi and \chi. On the one hand, it makes observable the phase transition in the distribution P(\psi), which can be considered as a 'trace' of the mobility edge remaining in 1D systems. On the other hand, observability of the phase \chi makes actual derivation of its evolution equation, which is presented below. Relaxation of the distribution P(\chi) to the limiting distribution P_\infty(\chi) at L\to\infty is described by two exponents, whose exponentials have jumps of the second derivative, when the energy E is changed.</description>

      <title>Recovering particle velocity and size distributions in ejecta with Photon Doppler Velocimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When a solid metal is struck, its free surface can eject fast and fine particles. Despite the many diagnostics that have been implemented to measure the mass, size, velocity or temperature of ejecta, these efforts provide only a partial picture of this phenomenon. Ejecta characterization, especially in constrained geometries, is an inherently ill-posed problem. In this context, Photon Doppler Velocimetry (PDV) has been a valuable diagnostic, measuring reliably particles and free surface velocities in the single scattering regime. Here we present ejecta experiments in gas and how, in this context, PDV allows one to retrieve additional information on the ejecta, i.e. information on the particles' size. We explain what governs ejecta transport in gas and how it can be simulated. To account for the multiple scattering of light in these ejecta, we use the Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE) that quantitatively describes PDV spectrograms, and their dependence on the velocity but also on the size distribution of the ejecta. We remind how spectrograms can be simulated by solving numerically this RTE and we show how to do so on hydrodynamic ejecta simulation results. Finally, we use this complex machinery in different ejecta transport scenarios to simulate the corresponding spectrograms. Comparing these to experimental results, we iteratively constrain the ejecta description at an unprecedented level. This work demonstrates our ability to recover particle size information from what is initially a velocity diagnostic, but more importantly it shows how, using existing simulation of ejecta, we capture through simulation the complexity of experimental spectrograms.</description>

      <title>Deep-learning-assisted reconfigurable metasurface antenna for real-time holographic beam steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a metasurface antenna capable of real time holographic beam steering. An array of reconfigurable dipoeles can generate on demand far field patterns of radiation through the specific encoding of meta atomic states. i.e., the configuration of each dipole. Suitable states for the generation of the desired patterns can be identified using iteartion, but this is very slow and needs to be done for each far field pattern. Here, we present a deep learning based method for the control of a metasurface antenna with point dipole elements that vary in their state using dipole polarizability. Instead of iteration, we adopt a deep learning algorithm that combines an autoencoder with an electromagnetic scattering equation to determin the states required for a target far field pattern in real time. The scattering equation from Born approximation is used as the decoder in training the neural network, and analytic Green's function calculation is used to check the validity of Born approximation. Our learning based algorithm requires a computing time of within in 200 microseconds to determine the meta atomic states, thus enabling the real time opeartion of a holographic antenna.</description>

      <title>Frustrated ferroelectricity from interlocked topological defects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ferroelectrics undergoing spontaneous symmetry breaking can manifest intricate domain patterns that allow the exploration of topological defects and their potential applications, such as domain-wall nanoelectronics. Engineering actual devices remains a challenge as domain patterns have complexity-driven properties whose origin and nature are still obscure. In relaxor ferroelectrics, dominant unconventional behavior, including thermal hysteresis and dielectric dispersion, is believed to result from frustrated dynamics of mesoscopic polar nanoregions (PNRs), where competing interaction terms among multiple components allow emergent phenomena as the result of minimizing conflicts. Existing theories propose analogies with Griffiths' phases or glassy states but fail to provide a full description, making relaxors a paradigm of hereto unexplained non-ergodic phenomenology. Here, we propose an explanatory mechanism based on the competition between intrinsic mesoscopic scales that naturally arise from discrete-inversion-symmetry-breaking and topological charge-screening flux-closure constraints. Computational analysis and experimental results on domain patterns in potassium-lithium-tantalate-niobate (KTN:Li) identify the key role of spontaneous polarization vortices, dependent on the ratio between collinear and non-collinear interactions. Our findings introduce a new perspective on frustration mechanisms, demonstrating how geometrical concepts are a fundamental ingredient in emergent ferroelectric behavior. They also shed light on the physics of ferroelectric topological defects, a possible route to noise-resistant memory and processing mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Predicting atmospheric turbulence for secure quantum communications in free space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence is the main barrier to large-scale free-space quantum communication networks. Aberrations distort optical information carriers, thus limiting or preventing the possibility of establishing a secure link between two parties. For this reason, forecasting the turbulence strength within an optical channel is highly desirable, as it allows for knowing the optimal timing to establish a secure link in advance. Here, we train a Recurrent Neural Network, TAROCCO, to predict the turbulence strength within a free-space channel. The training is based on weather and turbulence data collected over 9 months for a 5.4 km intra-city free-space link across the City of Ottawa. The implications of accurate predictions from our network are demonstrated in a simulated high-dimensional Quantum Key Distribution protocol based on orbital angular momentum states of light across different turbulence regimes. TAROCCO will be crucial in validating a free-space channel to optimally route the key exchange for secure communications in real experimental scenarios.</description>

      <title>Additive Manufacturing of functionalised atomic vapour cells for next-generation quantum technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomic vapour cells are an indispensable tool for quantum technologies (QT), but potential improvements are limited by the capacities of conventional manufacturing methods. Using an additive manufacturing (AM) technique - vat polymerisation by digital light processing - we demonstrate, for the first time, a 3D-printed glass vapour cell. The exploitation of AM capacities allows intricate internal architectures, overprinting of 2D optoelectronical materials to create integrated sensors and surface functionalisation, while also showing the ability to tailor the optical properties of the AM glass by in-situ growth of gold nanoparticles. The produced cells achieve ultra-high vacuum of $2 \times 10^{-9}$ mbar and enable Doppler-free spectroscopy; we demonstrate laser frequency stabilisation as a QT application. These results highlight the transformative role that AM can play for QT in enabling compact, optimised and integrated multi-material components and devices.</description>

      <title>High photon-number efficiencies with a fast 28-pixel parallel SNSPD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since their inception, superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors have been enabling quantum optical applications and the rise of the photonic quantum industry. The evolution in the detector design and read-out strategies has led to the introduction of devices with a plurality of independent pixels, which have been able to operate with high system detection efficiency at high speed while also supporting photon number resolution capabilities. However, this comes at the cost of a complex readout that requires one coaxial cable for each pixel of the array. Here, we report a 28-pixel SNSPD with a dedicated parallel architecture that, while maintaining a simple readout with a single coaxial line, enables the detector to operate at high speed with low-performance degradation. The device shows a maximum single-photon efficiency (SDE) of 88% and is able to maintain its SDE above 50%, coupled with a timing jitter lower than 80~ps, up to a detection rate of 200 million counts per second (Mcps). The detector also provides state-of-the-art PNR performances with a 2-photon efficiency of 75% and a 3-photon efficiency of 60%.</description>

      <title>Negative Refraction in isotropic achiral and chiral materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that negative refraction in materials can occur at frequencies $\omega$ where the real parts of the permittivity $\veps(\omega)$ and the permeability $\mu(\omega)$ have different sign, and that light with such frequencies can propagate just as well as light with frequencies where they have equal sign. Therefore, for negative refraction one does not need to be in the ``double-negative'' regime. We consider negative refractive index achiral materials using the Drude-Lorentz model and chiral materials using the Drude-Born-Fedorov model. We find that the time-averaged Poynting vector always points along the wave vector, the time-averaged energy-flux density is always positive, and the time-averaged energy density is positive (negative) when the refractive index is positive (negative). The phase velocity is negative when the real part of the refractive index is negative, and the group velocity generally changes sign several times as a function of frequency near resonance.</description>

      <title>A local model for the optical energy and momentum transfer in dielectric media and the microscopic origin of Abraham's force density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the continuity equations for linear momentum and energy associated to a recently introduced electromagnetic formulation based on classical dipolar sources [Eur. Phys. J. Plus 138, 1034 (2023)]. When connected to the mass-polariton quasi-particle dynamics, these equations provide a consistent microscopic description of the local optical energy and momentum transfer inside dielectric media, called microscopic mass-polariton formulation. This procedure also unveils the true microscopic origin of the long-known Abraham optical force density as an interplay between induced dipoles and mechanical stresses generated within the material.</description>

      <title>Quantum limits of covert target detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11013v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In covert target detection, Alice attempts to send optical or microwave probes to determine the presence or absence of a weakly-reflecting target embedded in thermal background radiation within a target region, while striving to remain undetected by an adversary, Willie, who is co-located with the target and collects all light that does not return to Alice. We formulate this problem in a realistic setting and derive quantum-mechanical limits on Alice's error probability performance in entanglement-assisted target detection for any fixed level of her detectability by Willie. We demonstrate how Alice can approach this performance limit using two-mode squeezed vacuum probes in the regime of small to moderate background brightness, and how such protocols can outperform any conventional approach using Gaussian-distributed coherent states. In addition, we derive a universal performance bound for non-adversarial quantum illumination without requiring the passive-signature assumption.</description>
