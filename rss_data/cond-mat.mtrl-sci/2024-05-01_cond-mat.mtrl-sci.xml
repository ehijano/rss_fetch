      <title>On the kinetics of homogeneous nucleation of incoherent precipitates in solid solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By critically examining the traditional theory of homogeneous nucleation of precipitates in solid solutions, it is revealed that the theory's assertion regarding an increase in the nucleation free energy due to elastic strain associated with the difference in atomic volumes between the two phases is applicable to coherent precipitates, but becomes incorrect when applied to incoherent precipitates. This conclusion is obtained by accounting for thermal point defects in the matrix, which can be absorbed at the interface between an incoherent particle and the matrix during nucleation, thereby relieving elastic stresses. Accordingly, a new kinetic model based on the Reiss theory for binary nucleation is proposed for predicting the nucleation rate of incoherent precipitates by agglomeration of solute atoms and point defects, with a further extension to account for excess vacancies formed under non-equilibrium conditions of quenching experiments.</description>

      <title>Investigation of ideal shear strength of dilute binary and ternary Ni-based alloys using first-principles calculations, CALPHAD modeling and correlation analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, the ideal shear strength (Tis) of dilute Ni34XZ ternary alloys (X or Z = Al, Co, Cr, Fe, Mn, Mo, Nb, Si, Ti) are predicted by first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) in terms of pure alias shear deformations. The results show that within the concentration up to 8.3% of the alloying elements, Tis increases with composition in binary systems with Mn, Fe, Co in ascending order, and decreases with composition with Nb, Si, Mo, Ti, Al, Cr in descending order. Combined with Ni34XZ in the present work and Ni11X in the literature from DFT-based calculations, the composition dependence of Tis in binary and ternary systems is modeled using the CALculation of PHAse Diagrams (CALPHAD) approach considering lattice instability, indicating that atomic bonding strength significantly influences Tis. Furthermore, correlational analyses show that Burgers vector and elastic constant C11 affect Tis the most out of the elemental features.</description>

      <title>Strong Damping-Like Torques in Wafer-Scale MoTe${}_2$ Grown by MOCVD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scalable synthesis of strong spin orbit coupling (SOC) materials such as 1T${}^\prime$ phase MoTe${}_2$ is crucial for spintronics development. Here, we demonstrate wafer-scale growth of 1T${}^\prime$ MoTe${}_2$ using metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) with sputtered Mo and (C${}_4$H${}_9$)${}_2$Te. The synthesized films show uniform coverage across the entire sample surface. By adjusting the growth parameters, a synthesis process capable of producing 1T${}^\prime$ and 2H MoTe${}_2$ mixed phase films was achieved. Notably, the developed process is compatible with back-end-of-line (BEOL) applications. The strong spin-orbit coupling of the grown 1T${}^\prime$ MoTe${}_2$ films was demonstrated through spin torque ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) measurements conducted on a 1T${}^\prime$ MoTe${}_2$/permalloy bilayer RF waveguide. These measurements revealed a significant damping-like torque in the wafer-scale 1T${}^\prime$ MoTe${}_2$ film and indicated high spin-charge conversion efficiency. The BEOL compatible process and potent spin orbit torque demonstrate promise in advanced device applications.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Strategy for Rapid Discovery of Abundant Fractional Quantum Ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional ferroelectrics are limited by Neumann's principle, which confines exploration of ferroelectrics within polar point groups. Our recent work [Nat. Commun. 15, 135, (2024)] proposes the concept of fractional quantum ferroelectricity (FQFE) that extend the playground of ferroelectricity to non-polar point groups. Here, we apply group theory and introduce an efficient symmetry strategy to identify FQFE candidates. Integrated with a high-throughput screening scheme, we go through 171,527 materials and identify 202 potential FQFE candidates, which are already experimentally synthesized. In addition, we point out that the essence of FQFE is fractional atomic displacements with respect to lattice vectors, which can actually result in both fractional (type-I) and integer (type-II) quantized polarization, respectively. Through performing first-principles calculations, we verify the symmetry-predicted switchable FQFE properties in bulk AlAgS2 and monolayer HgI2. Notably, AlAgS2 exhibits an ultra-low switching barrier of 23 meV/f.u. and interlocked in-plane/out-of-plane polarization, while HgI2 demonstrates large spontaneous polarization of 42 {\mu}C/cm2. Our findings not only advance the understanding on FQFE, but also offer guidance for experimental exploration and design of novel ferroelectric materials.</description>

      <title>Room temperature realization of artificial chiral magnets with reprogrammable magnon nonreciprocity at zero field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral magnets are materials which possess unique helical arrangements of magnetic moments, which give rise to nonreciprocal transport and fascinating physics phenomena. On the one hand, their exploration is guided by the prospects of unconventional signal processing, computation schemes and magnetic memory. On the other hand, progress in applications is hindered by the challenging materials synthesis, limited scalability and typically low critical temperature. Here, we report the creation and exploration of artificial chiral magnets (ACMs) at room temperature. By employing a mass production compatible deposition technology, we synthesize ACMs, which consist of helical Ni surfaces on central cylinders. Using optical microscopy, we reveal nonreciprocal magnon transport at GHz frequencies. It is controlled by programmable toroidal moments which result from the ACM's geometrical handedness and field-dependent spin chirality. We present materials-by-design rules which optimize the helically curved ferromagnets for 3D nonreciprocal transport at room temperature and zero magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Conductivity Freeze-Out in Isotopically Pure Si-28 at milli-Kelvin Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon is a key semiconducting material for electrical devices and hybrid quantum systems where low temperatures and zero-spin isotopic purity can enhance quantum coherence. Electrical conductivity in Si is characterised by carrier freeze out at around 40 K allowing microwave transmission which is a key component for addressing spins efficiently in silicon quantum technologies. In this work, we report an additional sharp transition of the electrical conductivity in a Si-28 cylindrical cavity at around 1 Kelvin. This is observed by measuring microwave resonator Whispering Gallery Mode frequencies and Q factors with changing temperature and comparing these results with finite element models. We attribute this change to a transition from a relaxation mechanism-dominated to a resonant phonon-less absorption-dominated hopping conduction regime. Characterising this regime change represents a deeper understanding of a physical phenomenon in a material of high interest to the quantum technology and semiconductor device community and the impact of these results is discussed.</description>

      <title>Tunable Collective Excitations in Epitaxial Perovskite Nickelates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of plasmons through the collective excitation of charge density has generated intense discussions, offering insights to fundamental sciences and potential applications. While the underlying physical principles have been well-established, the effects of multibody interactions and orbital hybridization on plasmonic dynamics remain understudied. In this work, we present the observation of conventional metallic and correlated plasmons in epitaxial La1-xSrxNiO3 (LSNO) films with varying Sr doping concentrations (x = 0, 0.125, 0.25), unveiling their intriguing evolution. Unlike samples at other doping concentrations, the x = 0.125 intermediate doping sample does not exhibit the correlated plasmons despite showing high optical conductivity. Through experimental investigation using spectroscopic ellipsometry and X-ray absorption spectroscopy, that is further supported by theoretical calculations, the O2p-Ni3d orbital hybridization for x = 0.125 is found to be significantly enhanced, alongside a considerable weakening of its effective correlation U*. These factors account for the absence of correlated plasmons and the high optical conductivity observed in LSNO (0.125). Our findings highlight the significant impact of orbital hybridization on the electronic structures and the formation of quasiparticles in strongly correlated systems, thereby marking a notable advancement in plasmonics, emphasizing LSNO's compelling potential as a substitute material in optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>First-order rhombohedral to cubic phase transition in photoexcited GeTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoexcited GeTe undergoes a non-thermal phase transition from a rhombohedral to a rocksalt crystalline phase. The microscopic mechanism and the nature of the transition are unclear. By using constrained density functional perturbation theory and by accounting for quantum anharmonicity within the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation, we show that the non-thermal phase transition is strongly first order and does not involve phonon softening, at odd with the thermal one. The transition is driven by the closure of the single particle gap in the photoexcited rhombohedral phase. Finally, we show that ultrafast X-ray diffraction data are consistent with a coexistence of the two phases, as expected in a first order transition. Our results are relevant for the understanding of phase transitions and bonding in phase change materials.</description>

      <title>Toward thermoelectric characterization of (nano)materials by in situ transmission electron microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the possibility to perform an in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) thermoelectric characterization of materials. A differential heating element on a custom in situ TEM microchip allows to generate a temperature gradient across the studied materials, which are simultaneously measured electrically. A thermovoltage was induced in all studied devices, whose sign corresponds to the sign of the Seebeck coefficient of the tested materials. The results indicate that in situ thermoelectric TEM studies can help to profoundly understand the interplay between the thermoelectric properties on one side and the structure/composition of the materials down to the atomic level on the other side, including grain boundaries, dopants or crystal defects. We propose an improved in situ TEM microchip design, which should facilitate a full quantitative measurement of the induced temperature gradient, the electrical and thermal conductivities, as well as the Seebeck coefficient.</description>

      <title>Cerium Oxide-based Solid-State Thermal Transistors with Wide Switching Width of 9.5 W/mK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal transistors that electrically switch heat flow on and off have attracted attention as thermal management devices. Electrochemical reduction/oxidation switches the thermal conductivity (\k{appa}) of active metal oxide layers. The \k{appa}-switching width (difference between on-state and off-state \k{appa}) of the previously proposed electrochemical thermal transistors is narrow, less than 5 W/mK. Here, we show solid-state electrochemical thermal transistors with a wide \k{appa}-switching width of 9.5 W/mK. We used CeO2 thin film as the active layer directly deposited on a solid electrolyte YSZ substrate. A Pt thin film was deposited on the surface of the CeO2 thin film and the back surface of the YSZ substrate to create a solid-state electrochemical thermal transistor. When the CeO2 thin film was once reduced (off-state) and then oxidized (on-state), the \k{appa} was approximately 2.5 W/mK in its most reduced state, and \k{appa} increased with oxidation to 11.8 W/mK (on-state). This reduction (off-state)/oxidation (on-state) cycle was repeated five times and the average value of \k{appa} was 2.5 W/mK after reduction (off-state) and 12 W/mK after oxidation (on-state). The \k{appa}-switching width was 9.5 W/mK. The CeO2-based solid-state electrochemical thermal transistors are potential materials for thermal shutters and thermal displays.</description>

      <title>Electronic decoupling and hole-doping of graphene nanoribbons on metal substrates by chloride intercalation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomically precise graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) have a wide range of electronic properties that depend sensitively on their chemical structure. Several types of GNRs have been synthesized on metal surfaces through selective surface-catalyzed reactions. The resulting GNRs are adsorbed on the metal surface, which may lead to hybridization between the GNR orbitals and those of the substrate. This makes investigation of the intrinsic electronic properties of GNRs more difficult, and also rules out capacitive gating. Here we demonstrate the formation of a dielectric gold chloride adlayer that can intercalate underneath GNRs on the Au(111) surface. The intercalated gold chloride adlayer electronically decouples the GNRs from the metal and leads to a substantial hole doping of the GNRs. Our results introduce an easily accessible tool in the in situ characterization of GNRs grown on Au(111) that allows for exploration of their electronic properties in a heavily hole-doped regime.</description>

      <title>Negative transit time in non-tunneling electron transmission through graphene multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attosecond dynamics of electron transmission through atomically-thin crystalline films is studied with an {\em ab initio} scattering theory. The temporal character of the electron propagation through graphene multilayers is traced to the band structure of bulk graphite: In the forbidden gaps the wave packet transit time $\tau_\mathrm{T}$ saturates with thickness and in the allowed bands $\tau_\mathrm{T}$ oscillates following transmission resonances. Hitherto unknown negative transit time due to in-plane scattering is discovered in monolayers of graphene, h-BN, and oxygen. Moreover, Wigner time delay is found to diverge at the scattering resonances caused by the emergence of secondary diffracted beams. This offers a way to manipulate the propagation timing of the wave packet without sacrificing the transmitted intensity. The spatial reshaping of the wave packet at the resonances may help elucidate details of the streaking by an inhomogeneous field at the surface.</description>

      <title>Phase transition and polar cluster behavior above Curie temperature in ferroelectric BaTi$_{0.8}$Zr$_{0.2}$O$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the phase transition behavior of the ferroelectric BaTi$_{0.8}$Zr$_{0.2}$O$_3$ in the paraelectric region. The temperature dependencies of thermal, polar, elastic and dielectric properties indicate the presence of local structures above the paraelectric-ferroelectric transition temperature Tc = 292 K. The non-zero remnant polarization is measured up to a characteristic temperature T* ~350 K, which coincides with the temperature where the dielectric constant deviates from Curie-Weiss law. Resonant Piezoelectric Spectroscopy shows that DC field-cooling above Tc using fields smaller than the coercive field leads to an elastic response and remnant piezoelectricity below T*, which likely corresponds to the coherence temperature associated with polar nanostructures in ferroelectrics. The observed remnant effect is attributed to the reorientation of polar nanostructures above Tc.</description>

      <title>Self-assembling of multilayered polymorphs with ion beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymorphism contributes to the diversity of nature, so that even materials having identical chemical compositions exhibit variations in properties because of different lattice symmetries. Thus, if stacked together into multilayers, polymorphs may work as an alternative approach to the sequential deposition of layers with different chemical compositions. However, selective polymorph crystallization during conventional thin film synthesis is not trivial; e.g. opting for step-like changes of temperature and/or pressure correlated with switching from one polymorph to another during synthesis is tricky, since it may cause degradation of the structural quality. In the present work, applying the disorder-induced ordering approach we fabricated such multilayered polymorph structures using ion beams. We show that during ion irradiation of gallium oxide, the dynamic annealing of disorder may be tuned towards self-assembling of several polymorph interfaces, consistently with theoretical modelling. Specifically, we demonstrated multilayers with two polymorph interface repetitions obtained in one ion beam assisted fabrication step. Importantly, single crystal structure of the polymorphs was maintained in between interfaces exhibiting repeatable crystallographic relationships, correlating with optical cross-sectional maps. This data paves the way for enhancing functionalities in materials with not previously thought capabilities of ion beam technology.</description>

      <title>Single Atom Substituents in Copper Surfaces May Adsorb Multiple CO Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Copper is a good CO2 electroreduction catalyst as products beyond CO form, but efficiency and selectivity is low. Experiments have shown that admixture of other elements can help, and computational screening studies have pointed out various promising candidates based on the adsorption of a single CO molecule as a descriptor. Our calculations of CO adsorption on surfaces where a first row transition metal atom replaces a Cu atom show that multiple CO molecules, not just one, bind to the substitutional atom. For Fe, Co, and Ni atoms, a decrease in binding energy is found, but the reverse trend, namely increasing bond strength, is found for V, Cr, and Mn and the first three CO molecules. Magnetic moment, charge, and position of the substitutional atom are also strongly affected by the CO adsorption in most cases. Magnetic moment is stepwise reduced to zero, and the outward displacement of the substitutional atom increased.</description>

      <title>High-throughput discovery of metal oxides with high thermoelectric performance via interpretable feature engineering on small data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we have proposed a data-driven screening framework combining the interpretable machine learning with high-throughput calculations to identify a series of metal oxides that exhibit both high-temperature tolerance and high power factors. Aiming at the problem of weak generalization ability of small data with power factors at high temperatures, we employ symbolic regression for feature creation which enhances the robustness of the model while preserving the physical meaning of features. 33 candidate metal oxides are finally targeted for high-temperature thermoelectric applications from a pool of 48,694 compounds in the Materials Project database. The Boltzmann transport theory is utilized to perform electrical transport properties calculations at 1,000 K. The relaxation time is approximated by employing constant electron-phonon coupling based on the deformation potential theory. Considering band degeneracy, the electron group velocity is obtained using the momentum matrix element method, yielding 28 materials with power factors greater than 50 ${\mu}W cm^{-1} K^{-2} $. The high-throughput framework we proposed is instrumental in the selection of metal oxides for high-temperature thermoelectric applications. Furthermore, our data-driven analysis and transport calculation suggest that metal oxides rich in elements such as cerium (Ce), tin (Sn), and lead (Pb) tend to exhibit high power factors at high temperatures.</description>

      <title>Derivative learning of tensorial quantities -- Predicting finite temperature infrared spectra from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a strategy that integrates machine learning and first-principles calculations to achieve technical accurate predictions of infrared spectra. Specifically, the methodology allows to predict infrared spectra for complex systems at finite temperatures. The method's effectiveness is demonstrated in challenging scenarios, such as the analysis of water and the organic-inorganic halide perovskite MAPbI$_{3}$, where our results consistently align with experimental data. A distinctive feature of the methodology is the incorporation of derivative learning, which proves indispensable for obtaining accurate polarization data in bulk materials and facilitates the training of a machine learning surrogate model of the polarization adapted to rotational and translational symmetries. We achieve polarisation prediction accuracies of about 1 % by training only on the predicted Born effective charges.</description>

      <title>The finite-$T$ Lorentz number and the thermal conductivity. Aluminum and carbon conductivities from ambient to millions of degrees Kelvin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical prediction of the thermal conductivity $\kappa$ of metal-like electron-ion systems would be greatly simplified if a convenient generalization of the Lorentz number $L_N$ for arbitrary temperatures ($T$) and densities were available. Such calculations are needed in astrophysics, high-energy-density physics, semiconductor physics as well as in materials science. We present a finite-$T$ form of $L_N(T)$, expressed in terms of elementary Fermi integrals. It is a universal function of $t=T/E_F$, where $E_F$ is the Fermi energy of the electrons. A convenient four-parameter fit to $L_N(t)$ for $t=0-\infty$ further simplifies the applications. The effect of electron-electron interactions is also briefly discussed. Calculations for $L_N(t)$ and thermal conductivities $\kappa$ for Al and C are presented at several compressions and into the million-Kelvin range. Experimental isobaric conductivities for Al just above the meting point, and isochoric conductivities for Al and C from available density-functional theory simulations and average-atom calculations are used as comparisons.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Fluctuations in Viscoelastic Stress: A Comparison of the Temporary Network and Dumbbell models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditionally, stress fluctuations in flowing and deformed materials are overlooked, with an obvious focus on average stresses in a continuum mechanical approximation. However, these fluctuations, often dismissed as noise, hold the potential to provide direct insights into the material structure and its structure-stress coupling, uncovering detailed aspects of fluid transport and relaxation behaviors. Despite advancements in experimental techniques allowing for the visualization of these fluctuations, their significance remains largely untapped, as modeling efforts continue to target Newtonian fluids within the confines of Gaussian noise assumptions. In the present work a comparative analysis of stress fluctuations in two distinct microstructural models is carried out: the temporary network model and the dumbbell model. Despite both models conforming to the Upper Convected Maxwell Model at a macroscopic level, the temporary network model predicts non-Gaussian fluctuations. We find that stress fluctuations within the temporary network model exhibit more pronounced abruptness at local scale, with only an enlargement of the control volume leading to a gradual Gaussian-like noise, diminishing the differences between the two models. These findings underscore the heightened sensitivity of fluctuating rheology to microstructural details and the microstructure-flow coupling, beyond what is captured by macroscopically averaged stresses.</description>

      <title>Depth-Resolved Characterization of Centrifugal Disk Finishing of Additively Manufactured Inconel 718</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface characteristics are a major contributor to the in-service performance, particularly fatigue life, of additively manufactured (AM) components. Centrifugal disk finishing (CDF) is one of many rigid media, abrasive machining processes employed to smooth the surfaces and edges of AM components. Within the general family of abrasive machining processes currently applied to AM, CDF is moderate in terms of material removal rate and the inertial forces exerted. How CDF alters the underlying microstructure of the processed surface is currently unknown. Here we employ profilometry and high-energy X-ray diffraction to characterize surface finish, crystallographic texture, and anisotropic distributions of residual microscale strain as a function of depth in CDF-finished Inconel 718 manufactured with laser powder bed fusion. Surfaces are finished using both unimodal and bimodal finishing media size distributions. We find that CDF will remove surface textures from AM components, but generally not alter the bulk texture. CDF is also found to impart significant amounts of residual microscale strain into the first 100 $\mu$m from the sample surface.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-dimensional materials, in which the electronic and transport properties are drastically modified in comparison to those of three-dimensional bulk materials, yield a key class of thermoelectric materials with high conversion efficiency. Among such materials, the organic compounds may serve peculiar properties owing to their unique molecular-based low-dimensional structures with highly anisotropic molecular orbitals. Here we present the thermoelectric transport properties of the quasi-one-dimensional dimer-Mott insulator $\beta'$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$ICl$_2$, where BEDT-TTF stands for bis(ethylenedithio)-tetrathiafulvalene. We find that the thermopower exhibits typical activation-type temperature variation expected for insulators but its absolute value is anomalously large compared to the expected value from the activation-type temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity. Successively, the Jonker-plot analysis, in which the thermopower is usually scaled by the logarithm of the resistivity, shows an unusual relation among such transport quantities. We discuss a role of the low dimensionality for the enhanced thermopower along with recent observations of such a large thermopower in several low-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Efficient Mixed-Precision Matrix Factorization of the Inverse Overlap Matrix in Electronic Structure Calculations with AI-Hardware and GPUs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, a new kind of accelerated hardware has gained popularity in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) communities which enables extremely high-performance tensor contractions in reduced precision for deep neural network calculations. In this article, we exploit Nvidia Tensor cores, a prototypical example of such AI/ML hardware, to develop a mixed precision approach for computing a dense matrix factorization of the inverse overlap matrix in electronic structure theory, $S^{-1}$. This factorization of $S^{-1}$, written as $ZZ^T=S^{-1}$, is used to transform the general matrix eigenvalue problem into a standard matrix eigenvalue problem. Here we present a mixed precision iterative refinement algorithm where $Z$ is given recursively using matrix-matrix multiplications and can be computed with high performance on Tensor cores. To understand the performance and accuracy of Tensor cores, comparisons are made to GPU-only implementations in single and double precision. Additionally, we propose a non-parametric stopping criteria which is robust in the face of lower precision floating point operations. The algorithm is particularly useful when we have a good initial guess to $Z$, for example, from previous time steps in quantum-mechanical molecular dynamics simulations or from a previous iteration in a geometry optimization.</description>

      <title>Length and torsion dependence of thermal conductivity in twisted graphene nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research on the physical properties of materials at the nanoscale is crucial for the development of breakthrough nanotechnologies. One of the key properties to consider is the ability to conduct heat, i.e., its thermal conductivity. Graphene is a remarkable nanostructure with exceptional physical properties, including one of the highest thermal conductivities (TC) ever measured. Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) share most fundamental properties with graphene, with the added benefit of having a controllable electronic bandgap. One method to achieve such control is by twisting the GNR, which can tailor its electronic properties, as well as change their TC. Here, we revisit the dependence of the TC of twisted GNRs (TGNRs) on the number of applied turns to the GNR by calculating more precise and mathematically well defined geometric parameters related to the TGNR shape, namely, its twist and writhe. We show that the dependence of the TC on twist is not a simple function of the number of turns initially applied to a straight GNR. In fact, we show that the TC of TGNRs requires at least two parameters to be properly described. Our conclusions are supported by atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to obtain the TC of suspended TGNRs prepared under different values of initially applied turns and different sizes of their suspended part. Among possible choices of parameter pairs, we show that TC can be appropriately described by the initial number of turns and the initial twist density of the TGNRs.</description>

      <title>Strong enhancement of magnetic coercivity induced by uniaxial stress</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of permanent magnets is intricately tied to their magnetic hysteresis loop. In this study, we investigate the heavy-fermion ferromagnet CeAgSb$_2$ through magnetization measurements under uniaxial stress. We observe a 2400 % increase in magnetic coercivity with just a modest stress of approximately 1 kbar. This effect persists even after pressure release, attributable to stress-induced defects that efficiently pin domain walls. Other magnetic properties such as ordering temperature and saturation moment exhibit only weak pressure dependencies and display full reversibility. Our findings offer a promising route for increasing coercive field strength and enhancing the energy product in ferromagnetic materials and are potentially applicable to a broad spectrum of commercial or emerging magnetic applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum Modelling of Magnetism in Strongly Correlated Materials: Evaluating Constrained DFT and LDA+$U$+$J$ for Y114</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transition-metal compounds represent a fascinating playground for exploring the intricate relationship between structural distortions, electronic properties, and magnetic behaviour, holding significant promise for technological advancements. Among these compounds, YBaCo$_4$O$_{7}$ (Y114) is attractive due to its manifestation of a ferrimagnetic component at low temperature intertwined with distortion effect due to the charge disproportionation on Co ions, exerting profound impact on its magnetic properties. In this perspective paper, we study the structural and magnetic intricacies of the Y114 crystal. Traditionally, the investigation of such materials has relied heavily on computational modelling using density-functional theory (DFT) with the on-site Coulomb interaction correction $U$ (DFT+$U$) based on the Hubbard model (sometimes including Hund's exchange coupling parameter $J$, DFT+$U$+$J$) to unravel their complexities. Herein, we analysed the spurious effects of magnetic-moment delocalisation and spillover to non-magnetic ions in the lattice on electronic structure and magnetic properties of Y114. To overcome this problem we have applied constrained DFT (cDFT) based on the potential self-consistency approach, and comprehensively explore the Y114 crystal's characteristics in its ferrimagnetic order. We find that cDFT yields magnetic moments of Co ions much closer to the experimental values than LDA+$U$+$J$ with the parameters $U$ and $J$ fitted to reproduce experimental lattice constants. cDFT allows for an accurate prediction of magnetic properties using oxidation states of magnetic ions as well-defined parameters. Through this perspective, we not only enhance our understanding of the magnetic interactions in Y114 crystal, but also pave the way for future investigations into magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Composite antiferromagnetic and orbital order with altermagnetic properties at a cuprate/manganite interface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heterostructures from complex oxides allow one to combine various electronic and magnetic orders as to induce new quantum states. A prominent example is the coupling between superconducting and magnetic orders in multilayers from high-Tc cuprates and manganites. A key role is played here by the interfacial CuO2 layer whose distinct properties remain to be fully understood. Here, we study with resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) the magnon excitations of this interfacial CuO2 layer. In particular, we show that the underlying antiferromagnetic exchange interaction at the interface is strongly suppressed to J ~ 70 meV, as compared to J ~ 130 meV for the CuO2 layers away from the interface. Moreover, we observe an anomalous momentum dependence of the intensity of the interfacial magnon mode and show that it suggests that the antiferromagnetic order is accompanied by a particular kind of orbital order that yields a so-called altermagnetic state. Such a two-dimensional altermagnet has recently been predicted to enable new spintronic applications and superconducting proximity effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear frequency conversion by optical rectification, as well as difference- and sum-frequency generation are fundamental processes for producing electromagnetic radiation at different frequencies. Here, we demonstrate that coherently excited infrared-active phonons can be used as transducers for generating nonlinear electric polarizations and magnetizations via phonon-phonon and phonon-magnon interactions, in a way similar to nonlinear optical frequency conversion. We derive analytical solutions for the time-dependent polarizations and magnetizations for the second-order response to the electric field component of an ultrashort laser pulse. These allow us to define second-order nonlinear electric and magneto-electric susceptibilities that capture the rectification, as well as the impulsive and sum-frequency excitation of coherent phonons and magnons. Our theoretical framework naturally incorporates existing mechanisms and further leads to the prediction of a hybrid magneto-opto-phononic inverse Faraday effect involving photon-phonon-magnon scattering. Our work demonstrates nonlinear phononics as a pathway to controlling the electric polarization and magnetization in solids.</description>

In this study, we show how to treat Hamiltonians with non-linear terms, that are relevant for describing uniaxial anisotropies and mechanical constraints. These interactions can be expressed solely through quadratic terms of the spin operator along one axis, that can be identified with the quantisation axis.</description>

      <title>Topology in a Su--Schrieffer--Heeger plasmonic crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the topology of the bands of a polaritonic crystal composed of graphene and of a metallic grating. We first derive a Kronig--Penney type of equation for the polaritonic bands as function of the Bloch wavevector and discuss the propagation of the surface plasmon polaritons on the polaritonic crystal using a transfer-matrix approach. Secondly, we reformulate the problem as a tight-binding model that resembles the Su--Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) Hamiltonian, one difference being that the hopping amplitudes are, in this case, energy dependent. In possession of the tight-binding equations it is a simple task to determine the topology of the bands. Similarly to the SSH model, we show that there is a tunable parameter that induces topological phase transitions from trivial to non-trivial. In our case, it is the distance $d$ between the graphene sheet and the metallic grating. We note that $d$ is a parameter that can be easily tuned experimentally simply by controlling the thickness of the spacer between the grating and the graphene sheet. It is then experimentally feasible to engineer devices with the required topological properties.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure of the surface superconducting Weyl semimetal PtBi$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trigonal PtBi$_2$ is a layered semimetal without inversion symmetry, featuring 12 Weyl points in the vicinity of the Fermi energy. Its topological Fermi arcs were recently shown to superconduct at low temperatures where bulk superconductivity is absent. Here, we perform first-principles calculations to investigate in detail the bulk and surface electronic structure of PtBi$_2$, and obtain the spin texture as well as the momentum-dependent localization of the arcs. Motivated by the experimentally observed recovery of inversion symmetry under pressure or upon doping, we interpolate between the two structures and determine the energy and momentum dependence of the Weyl nodes. For deeper insights into the surface superconductivity of PtBi$_2$, we construct a symmetry-adapted effective four-band model that accurately reproduces the Weyl points of PtBi$_2$. We supplement this model with an analysis of the symmetry-allowed pairings between the Fermi arcs, which naturally mix spin-singlet and spin-triplet channels. Moreover, the presence of surface-only superconductivity facilitates an intrinsic superconductor-semimetal-superconductor Josephson junction, with the semimetallic phase sandwiched between the two superconducting surfaces. For a phase difference of $\pi$, zero-energy Andreev bound states develop between the two terminations.</description>

      <title>Controlled Spalling of Single Crystal 4H-SiC Bulk Substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We detail several scientific and engineering innovations which enable the controlled spalling of 10 - 50 micron thick films of single crystal 4H silicon carbide (4H-SiC) from bulk substrates. 4H-SiC's properties, including high thermal conductivity and a wide bandgap, make it an ideal candidate for high-temperature, high-voltage power electronic devices. Moreover, 4H-SiC has been shown to be an excellent host of solid-state atomic defect qubits for quantum computing and quantum networking. Because 4H-SiC single crystal substrates are expensive (due to long growth times and limited yield), techniques for removal and transfer of layers in the tens-of-microns thickness range are highly desirable for substrate reuse and heterogenous integration of separated layers. In this work we utilize novel approaches for stressor layer thickness control and spalling crack initiation to demonstrate controlled spalling of 4H-SiC, the highest fracture toughness material spalled to date. Additionally, we demonstrate substrate re-use, bonding of the spalled films to carrier substrates, and explore the spin coherence of the spalled films. In preliminary studies we are able to achieve coherent spin control of neutral divacancy ($VV^{0}$) qubit ensembles and measure a spin T2* of 0.581 $\mu$s in such spalled films.</description>

      <title>An electronic structure investigation of PEDOT with AlCl4- anions, a promising redox combination for energy storage applications</title>

Abstract: The conducting polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) is one of the most researched materials. The 1980s bipolaron model remains the dominant interpretation of the electronic structure of PEDOT. Recent theoretical studies have provided updated definitions of key concepts such as bipolarons or polaron pairs, but these have not yet become widely known. In this work, we use density functional theory to investigate the electronic structure of PEDOT oligomers with co-located AlCl4- anions, a promising combination for energy storage. By considering the influence of oligomer length, oxidation or anion concentration and spin state, we find no evidence for self-localisation of positive charges in PEDOT as predicted by the bipolaron model at the hybrid functional level. Our results show distortions that exhibit either a single or a double peak in bond length alternations and charge density. Either can occur at different oxidation or anion concentrations. We note that other distortion shapes are also possible. Rather than representing bipolarons or polaron pairs in the original model, these are electron distributions driven by a range of factors. Localisation of distortions occurs with anions, and distortions can span an arbitrary number of nearby anions. Conductivity in conducting polymers has been observed to reduce at anion concentrations above 0.5. We show at high anion concentrations, the energy of the localised, non-bonding anionic orbitals approaches that of the system HOMO due to Coulombic repulsion between anions. We hypothesize that with nucleic motion in the macropolymer, these orbitals will interfere with the hopping of charge carriers between sites of similar energy, lowering conductivity.</description>

      <title>Enabling discovery of materials through enhanced generalisability of deep learning models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The road towards the discovery of new, useful materials is full of imperfections. Machine learning, which is currently the power horse of material discovery when it works in concert with density functional theory, has been able to accelerate the discovery of new materials for various applications by learning the properties of known, stable materials to infer the properties of unknown, deformed materials. Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) is particularly believed to bridge the gap between known materials and the virtually infinite space of crystal structures with imperfections such as defects, grain boundaries, composition disorders and others. State of the art PIML models struggle to bridge this gap, however. In this work we show that a critical correction of the physics underpinning a PIML, our direct integration of external potential (DIEP) method, which mimics the integration of the external potential term in typical density functional theory calculations, improves the generalisability of the model to a range of imperfect structures, including diamond defects. By training DIEP to predict the potential energy surface, we demonstrate the ability of the model in predicting the onset of fracture of pristine and defective carbon nanotubes.</description>

      <title>Tuning of the ultrafast demagnetization by ultrashort spin polarized currents in multi-sublattice ferrimagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11739v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Femtosecond laser pulses can be used to induce ultrafast changes of the magnetization in magnetic materials. Several microscopic mechanisms have been proposed to explain the observations, including the transport of ultrashort spin-polarized hot-electrons (SPHE). Such ultrafast spin currents find growing interest because of the recent challenges in ultrafast spintronics however they are only poorly characterized. One of the key challenges is to characterize the spin-polarized ultrafast currents and the microscopic mechanisms behind SPHE induced manipulation of the magnetization, especially in the case of technologically relevant ferrimagnetic alloys. Here, we have used a combined approach using time- and element-resolved X-ray magnetic circular dichroism and theoretical calculations based on atomistic spin-dynamics simulations to address the ultrafast transfer of the angular momentum from spin-polarized currents into ferrimagnetic Fe74Gd26 films and the concomitant reduction of sub-lattice magnetization. Our study shows that using a Co/Pt multilayer as a polarizer in a spin-valve structure, the SPHE drives the demagnetization of the two sub-lattices of the Fe74Gd26 film. This behaviour is explained based on two physical mechanisms, i.e., spin transfer torque and thermal fluctuations induced by the SPHE. We provide a quantitative description of the heat transfer of the ultrashort SPHE pulse to the Fe74Gd26 films, as well as the degree of spin-polarization of the SPHE current density responsible for the observed magnetization dynamics. Our work finally characterizes the spin-polarization of the SPHEs revealing unexpected opposite spin polarization to the Co magnetization, explaining our experimental results.</description>

      <title>A source of entangled photons based on a cavity-enhanced and strain-tuned GaAs quantum dot</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.12506v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A quantum-light source that delivers photons with a high brightness and a high degree of entanglement is fundamental for the development of efficient entanglement-based quantum-key distribution systems. Among all possible candidates, epitaxial quantum dots are currently emerging as one of the brightest sources of highly entangled photons. However, the optimization of both brightness and entanglement currently requires different technologies that are difficult to combine in a scalable manner. In this work, we overcome this challenge by developing a novel device consisting of a quantum dot embedded in a circular Bragg resonator, in turn, integrated onto a micromachined piezoelectric actuator. The resonator engineers the light-matter interaction to empower extraction efficiencies up to 0.69(4). Simultaneously, the actuator manipulates strain fields that tune the quantum dot for the generation of entangled photons with corrected fidelities to a maximally entangled state up to 0.96(1). This hybrid technology has the potential to overcome the limitations of the key rates that plague QD-based entangled sources for entanglement-based quantum key distribution and entanglement-based quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Proper Orthogonal Descriptors for Multi-element Chemical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.14549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the proper orthogonal descriptors for efficient and accurate interatomic potentials of multi-element chemical systems. The potential energy surface of a multi-element system is represented as a many-body expansion of parametrized potentials which are functions of atom positions, atom types, and parameters. The proper orthogonal decomposition is employed to decompose the parametrized potentials {as a linear combination} of orthogonal basis functions. The orthogonal basis functions are used to construct proper orthogonal descriptors based on the elements of atoms, thus leading to multi-element descriptors. We compose the multi-element proper orthogonal descriptors to develop linear and quadratic interatomic potentials. We devise an algorithm to efficiently compute the total energy and forces of the interatomic potentials constructed from the proper orthogonal descriptors. The potentials are demonstrated for indium phosphide and titanium dioxide in comparison with the spectral neighbor analysis potential (SNAP) and atomic cluster expansion (ACE) potentials.</description>

      <title>Signature of long-ranged spin triplets across a two-dimensional superconductor/helimagnet van der Waals interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The combination of a superconductor with a magnetically inhomogeneous material has been established as an efficient mechanism for the generation of long-ranged spin-polarized (spin-triplet) Cooper pairs. Evidence for this mechanism, however, has been established based on studies done on three-dimensional systems, where the strong bonds existing at the interface between the superconductor and the magnetic material should in principle enhance proximity effects and strengthen any electronic correlations. Here, we fabricate devices based on van der Waals stacks of flakes of the two-dimensional superconductor $NbS_2$ combined with flakes of $Cr_{1/3}NbS_2$, which has a built-in magnetic inhomogeneity due to its helimagnetic spin texture at low temperatures. We find that the critical temperature of these vdW bilayers is strongly dependent on the magnetic state of $Cr_{1/3}NbS_2$, whose degree of magnetic inhomogeneity can be controlled via an applied magnetic field. Our results demonstrate evidence for the generation of long-ranged spin-triplet pairs across the $Cr_{1/3}NbS_2$/$NbS_2$ vdW interface.</description>

      <title>Orbital magnetization of a metal is not a bulk property in the mesoscopic regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03957v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find that, in the mesoscopic regime, modification of the material's surface can induce an extensive change of the material's magnetic moment. In other words, perturbation of order $N^2$ atoms on the surface of a 3-dimensional solid can change the magnetic moment proportionally to $N^3$. When the solid's surface is perturbed, it triggers two changes in the magnetization. One arises from variations of the electron wavefunction and energy, while the other arises from a modification in the kinetic angular momentum operator. In the macroscopic regime of our model, these two bulk effects cancel each other, resulting in no impact of the surface perturbation on the magnetization - consistent with prior work. In the mesoscopic regime, we find a departure from this behavior, as the cancelation of two terms is not complete.</description>

      <title>Feasible route to high-temperature ambient-pressure hydride superconductivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A key challenge in materials discovery is to find high-temperature superconductors. Hydrogen and hydride materials have long been considered promising materials displaying conventional phonon-mediated superconductivity. However, the high pressures required to stabilize these materials have restricted their application. Here, we present results from high-throughput computation, considering a wide range of high-symmetry ternary hydrides from across the periodic table at ambient pressure. This large composition space is then reduced by considering thermodynamic, dynamic, and magnetic stability, before direct estimations of the superconducting critical temperature. This approach has revealed a metastable ambient-pressure hydride superconductor, Mg$_2$IrH$_6$, with a predicted critical temperature of 160 K, comparable to the highest temperature superconducting cuprates. We propose a synthesis route via a structurally related insulator, Mg$_2$IrH$_7$, which is thermodynamically stable above 15 GPa and discuss the potential challenges in doing so.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In cosmology, the axion is a hypothetical particle that is currently considered as candidate for dark matter. In condensed matter, a counterpart of the axion (the "axion quasiparticle") has been predicted to emerge in magnetoelectric insulators with fluctuating magnetic order and in charge-ordered Weyl semimetals. To date, both the cosmological and condensed-matter axions remain experimentally elusive or unconfirmed. Here, we show theoretically that ordinary lattice vibrations can form an axion quasiparticle in Dirac insulators with broken time- and space-inversion symmetries, even in the absence of magnetic fluctuations. The physical manifestation of the phononic axion is a magnetic-field-induced phonon effective charge, which can be probed in optical spectroscopy. By replacing magnetic fluctuations with lattice vibrations, our theory widens the scope for the observability of the axion quasiparticle in condensed matter.</description>

      <title>Metasurface of strongly coupled excitons and nanoplasmonic arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metasurfaces allow to manipulate light at the nanoscale. Integrating metasurfaces with transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers provides additional functionality to ultrathin optics, including tunable optical properties with enhanced light-matter interactions. In this work, we demonstrate the realization of a polaritonic metasurface utilizing the sizable light-matter coupling of excitons in monolayer WSe2 and the collective lattice resonances of nanoplasmonic gold arrays. To this end, we developed a novel fabrication method to integrate gold nanodisk arrays in hexagonal boron nitride and thus simultaneously ensure spectrally narrow exciton transitions and their immediate proximity to the near-field of array surface lattice resonances. In the regime of strong light-matter coupling, the resulting van der Waals metasurface exhibits all key characteristics of lattice polaritons, with a directional and linearly-polarized far-field emission profile dictated by the underlying nanoplasmonic lattice. Our work can be straightforwardly adapted to other lattice geometries, establishing structured van der Waals metasurfaces as means to engineer polaritonic lattices.</description>

      <title>Tunable transport in bi-disperse porous materials with vascular structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study transport in synthetic, bi-disperse porous structures, with arrays of microchannels interconnected by a nanoporous layer. These structures are inspired by the xylem tissue in vascular plants, in which sap water travels from the roots to the leaves to maintain hydration and carry micronutrients. We experimentally evaluate transport in three conditions: high pressure-driven flow, spontaneous imbibition, and transpiration-driven flow. The latter case resembles the situation in a living plant, where bulk liquid water is transported upwards in a metastable state (negative pressure), driven by evaporation in the leaves; here we report stable, transpiration-driven flows down to $\sim -15$ MPa of driving force. By varying the shape of the microchannels, we show that we can tune the rate of these transport processes in a predictable manner, using a simple analytical (effective medium) approach and numerical simulations of the flow field in the bi-disperse media. We also show that the spontaneous imbibition behavior of a single structure - with fixed geometry - can behave very differently depending on its preparation (filled with air, vs. evacuated), because of a dramatic change in the conductance of vapor in the microchannels; this change offers a second way to tune the rate of transport in bi-disperse, xylem-like structures, by switching between air-filled and evacuated states.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity from On-Chip Metallization on 2D Topological Chalcogenides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is a versatile class of quantum materials of interest to various fields including, e.g., nanoelectronics, optical devices, and topological and correlated quantum matter. Tailoring the electronic properties of TMDs is essential to their applications in many directions. Here, we report that a highly controllable and uniform on-chip 2D metallization process converts a class of atomically thin TMDs into robust superconductors, a property belonging to none of the starting materials. As examples, we demonstrate the introduction of superconductivity into a class of 2D air-sensitive topological TMDs, including monolayers of Td-WTe2, 1T'-MoTe2 and 2H-MoTe2, as well as their natural and twisted bilayers, metalized with an ultrathin layer of Palladium. This class of TMDs are known to exhibit intriguing topological phases ranging from topological insulator, Weyl semimetal to fractional Chern insulator. The unique, high-quality two-dimensional metallization process is based on our recent findings of the long-distance, non-Fickian in-plane mass transport and chemistry in 2D that occur at relatively low temperatures and in devices fully encapsulated with inert insulating layers. Highly compatible with existing nanofabrication techniques for van der Waals (vdW) stacks, our results offer a route to designing and engineering superconductivity and topological phases in a class of correlated 2D materials.</description>
