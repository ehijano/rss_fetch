      <title>Symmetry breaking of three self-organization rules:A general theory for the origin of complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex spatiotemporal patterns in nature significantly challenge reductionism-based modern science. The lack of a paradigm beyond reductionism hinders our understanding of the emergence of complexity. The diversity of countless patterns undermines any notion of universal mechanisms. Here, however, we show that breaking the symmetry of three simple and self-organization rules give rise to nearly all patterns in nature, such as a wide variety of Turing patterns, fractals, spiral, target and plane waves, as well as chaotic patterns. The symmetry breaking is rooted in basic physical quantities, such as positive and negative forces, space, time and bounds. Besides reproducing the hallmarks of complexity, we discover some novel phenomena, such as abrupt percolation of Turing patterns, phase transition between fractals and chaos, chaotic edge in travelling waves, etc. Our asymmetric self-organization theory established a simple and unified framework for the origin of complexity in all fields, and unveiled a deep relationship between the first principles of physics and the complex world</description>

      <title>Integrating GNN and Neural ODEs for Estimating Two-Body Interactions in Mixed-Species Collective Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyzing the motion of multiple biological agents, be it cells or individual animals, is pivotal for the understanding of complex collective behaviors. With the advent of advanced microscopy, detailed images of complex tissue formations involving multiple cell types have become more accessible in recent years. However, deciphering the underlying rules that govern cell movements is far from trivial. Here, we present a novel deep learning framework to estimate the underlying equations of motion from observed trajectories, a pivotal step in decoding such complex dynamics. Our framework integrates graph neural networks with neural differential equations, enabling effective prediction of two-body interactions based on the states of the interacting entities. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through two numerical experiments. First, we used a simulated data from a toy model to tune the hyperparameters. Based on the obtained hyperparameters, we then applied this approach to a more complex model that describes interacting cells of cellular slime molds. Our results show that the proposed method can accurately estimate the function of two-body interactions, thereby precisely replicating both individual and collective behaviors within these systems.</description>

      <title>Uncovering multiscale structure in the variability of larval zebrafish navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Animals chain movements into long-lived motor strategies, exhibiting variability across scales that reflects the interplay between internal states and environmental cues. To reveal structure in such variability, we build Markov models of movement sequences that bridges across time scales and enables a quantitative comparison of behavioral phenotypes among individuals. Applied to larval zebrafish responding to diverse sensory cues, we uncover a hierarchy of long-lived motor strategies, dominated by changes in orientation distinguishing cruising versus wandering strategies. Environmental cues induce preferences along these modes at the population level: while fish cruise in the light, they wander in response to aversive stimuli, or in search for appetitive prey. As our method encodes the behavioral dynamics of each individual fish in the transitions among coarse-grained motor strategies, we use it to uncover a hierarchical structure in the phenotypic variability that reflects exploration-exploitation trade-offs. Across a wide range of sensory cues, a major source of variation among fish is driven by prior and/or immediate exposure to prey that induces exploitation phenotypes. A large degree of variability that is not explained by environmental cues unravels motivational states that override the sensory context to induce contrasting exploration-exploitation phenotypes. Altogether, by extracting the timescales of motor strategies deployed during navigation, our approach exposes structure among individuals and reveals internal states tuned by prior experience.</description>

      <title>Arbitrage equilibria in active matter systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) phenomenon in active matter has been of great interest for the past decade or so. A central conceptual puzzle is that this behavior, which is generally characterized as a nonequilibrium phenomenon, can yet be explained using simple equilibrium models of thermodynamics. Here, we address this problem using a new theory, statistical teleodynamics, which is a conceptual synthesis of game theory and statistical mechanics. In this framework, active agents compete in their pursuit of maximum effective utility, and this self-organizing dynamics results in an arbitrage equilibrium in which all agents have the same effective utility. We show that MIPS is an example of arbitrage equilibrium and that it is mathematically equivalent to other phase-separation phenomena in entirely different domains, such as sociology and economics. As examples, we present the behavior of Janus particles in a potential trap and the effect of chemotaxis on MIPS.</description>

      <title>Dual network structure of the AV node</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological systems, particularly the brain, are frequently analyzed as networks, conveying mechanistic insights into their function and pathophysiology. This is the first study of a functional network of cardiac tissue. We use calcium imaging to obtain two functional networks in a subsidiary but essential pacemaker of the heart, the atrioventricular node (AVN). The AVN is a small cellular structure with dual functions: a) to delay the pacemaker signal passing from the sinoatrial node (SAN) to the ventricles, and b) to serve as a back-up pacemaker should the primary SAN pacemaker fail. Failure of the AVN can lead to syncope and death. We found that the shortest path lengths and clustering coefficients of the AVN are remarkably similar to those of the brain. The network is ``small-world," thus optimized for energy use vs transmission efficiency. We further study the network properties of AVN tissue with knock-out of the sodium-calcium exchange transporter. In this case, the average shortest path-lengths remained nearly unchanged showing network resilience, while the clustering coefficient was somewhat reduced, similar to schizophrenia in brain networks. When we removed the global action potential using principal component analysis (PCA) in wild-type model, the network lost its ``small-world" characteristics with less information-passing efficiency due to longer shortest path lengths but more robust signal propagation resulting from higher clustering. These two wild-type networks (with and without global action potential) may correspond to fast and slow conduction pathways. Laslty, a one-parameter non-linear preferential attachment model is a good fit to all three AVN networks.</description>

      <title>NCIDiff: Non-covalent Interaction-generative Diffusion Model for Improving Reliability of 3D Molecule Generation Inside Protein Pocket</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancements in deep generative modeling have changed the paradigm of drug discovery. Among such approaches, target-aware methods that exploit 3D structures of protein pockets were spotlighted for generating ligand molecules with their plausible binding modes. While docking scores superficially assess the quality of generated ligands, closer inspection of the binding structures reveals the inconsistency in local interactions between a pocket and generated ligands. Here, we address the issue by explicitly generating non-covalent interactions (NCIs), which are universal patterns throughout protein-ligand complexes. Our proposed model, NCIDiff, simultaneously denoises NCI types of protein-ligand edges along with a 3D graph of a ligand molecule during the sampling. With the NCI-generating strategy, our model generates ligands with more reliable NCIs, especially outperforming the baseline diffusion-based models. We further adopted inpainting techniques on NCIs to further improve the quality of the generated molecules. Finally, we showcase the applicability of NCIDiff on drug design tasks for real-world settings with specialized objectives by guiding the generation process with desired NCI patterns.</description>

      <title>Active gel model for one-dimensional cell migration coupling actin flow and adhesion dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Migration of animal cells is based on the interplay between actin polymerization at the front, adhesion along the cell-substrate interface, and actomyosin contractility at the back. Active gel theory has been used before to demonstrate that actomyosin contractility is sufficient for polarization and self-sustained cell migration in the absence of external cues, but did not consider the dynamics of adhesion. Likewise, migration models based on the mechanosensitive dynamics of adhesion receptors usually do not include the global dynamics of intracellular flow. Here we show that both aspects can be combined in a minimal active gel model for one-dimensional cell migration with dynamic adhesion. This model demonstrates that load sharing between the adhesion receptors leads to symmetry breaking, with stronger adhesion at the front, and that bistability of migration arises for intermediate adhesiveness. Local variations in adhesiveness are sufficient to switch between sessile and motile states, in qualitative agreement with experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At the 2023 Les Houches Summer School on Theoretical Biological Physics, several students asked for some background on information theory, and so we added a tutorial to the scheduled lectures. This is largely a transcript of that tutorial, lightly edited. It covers basic definitions and context rather than detailed calculations. We hope to have maintained the informality of the presentation, including exchanges with the students, while still being useful.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.17193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Super-resolution microscopy, or nanoscopy, enables the use of fluorescent-based molecular localization tools to study molecular structure at the nanoscale level in the intact cell, bridging the mesoscale gap to classical structural biology methodologies. Analysis of super-resolution data by artificial intelligence (AI), such as machine learning, offers tremendous potential for discovery of new biology, that, by definition, is not known and lacks ground truth. Herein, we describe the application of weakly supervised paradigms to super-resolution microscopy and its potential to enable the accelerated exploration of the nanoscale architecture of subcellular macromolecules and organelles.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Theory for Adaptive Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01403v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The investigation of adaptive dynamics, involving many degrees of freedom on two separated timescales, one for fast changes of state variables and another for the slow adaptation of parameters controlling the former's dynamics is crucial for understanding feedback mechanisms underlying evolutionary and learning processes. We present an extension of the Martin-Siggia-Rose-DeDominicis-Janssen (MSRDJ) path-integral approach to the study of nonequilibrium phase transitions in such dynamical systems. As an illustration, we apply our framework to biological adaptation under the genotype-phenotype feedback: phenotypic variations are shaped by the fast stochastic gene-expression dynamics and are coupled to the slow evolution of the distribution of genotypes, each encoded by a gene-regulatory network architecture. We establish that under this coevolution, genotypes responsible for high fitness are selected, leading to the emergence of phenotypic robustness within an intermediate level of environmental noise in reciprocal genetic networks.</description>

      <title>Heavy-element damage seeding in proteins under X-ray free electron laser illumination conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emerging technique of serial femtosecond X-ray crystallography (SFX) can be used to study the structure and dynamics of biological macromolecules to high spatial and temporal resolutions. An ongoing challenge for SFX is the damage caused by the ultrabright X-ray free electron laser pulse. Though it is often assumed that sufficiently femtosecond pulses `outrun' radiation damage, in reality electronic damage processes commence during exposure. We model the electronic damage to protein nanocrystals using a plasma model that tracks the continuous changes to the energy distribution of the unbound electrons. Tracking the continuous energy distribution is of particular importance for distinguishing the influence of differing elements on secondary damage processes. Heavy atoms have a ubiquitous but small presence in protein targets - typically as integral components of the macromolecule and as salts in the solvent. We find that these atoms considerably influence the simulated ionization and scattering behavior of realistic targets due to their rapid seeding of secondary ionization processes. In lysozyme, even the presence of native sulfur atoms significantly contributes to theoretical measures of damage-induced noise for &gt;= 6 keV, 15 fs pulses. Contributing to the effect is that heavy atoms seed `intermediate' energy electron cascades that are particularly effective at ionizing the target on the femtosecond timescale. In addition, the disproportionate effect of heavy atoms means the damage to a protein crystal can be sensitive to their presence in the solvent. Outside of reducing the concentration of heavy atoms in the target, these results suggest the dose limits of SFX targets will be higher where the ionization of deep &gt;~ 6 keV absorption edges is minimized, or, to a lesser extent, when such edges are only ionized with X-rays &gt;&gt; 2 keV above their binding energy.</description>
