      <title>Navigating Weight Prediction with Diet Diary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current research in food analysis primarily concentrates on tasks such as food recognition, recipe retrieval and nutrition estimation from a single image. Nevertheless, there is a significant gap in exploring the impact of food intake on physiological indicators (e.g., weight) over time. This paper addresses this gap by introducing the DietDiary dataset, which encompasses daily dietary diaries and corresponding weight measurements of real users. Furthermore, we propose a novel task of weight prediction with a dietary diary that aims to leverage historical food intake and weight to predict future weights. To tackle this task, we propose a model-agnostic time series forecasting framework. Specifically, we introduce a Unified Meal Representation Learning (UMRL) module to extract representations for each meal. Additionally, we design a diet-aware loss function to associate food intake with weight variations. By conducting experiments on the DietDiary dataset with two state-of-the-art time series forecasting models, NLinear and iTransformer, we demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves superior performance compared to the original models. We make our dataset, code, and models publicly available at: https://yxg1005.github.io/weight-prediction/.</description>

      <title>Palantir: Towards Efficient Super Resolution for Ultra-high-definition Live Streaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural enhancement through super-resolution deep neural networks opens up new possibilities for ultra-high-definition live streaming over existing encoding and networking infrastructure. Yet, the heavy SR DNN inference overhead leads to severe deployment challenges. To reduce the overhead, existing systems propose to apply DNN-based SR only on selected anchor frames while upscaling non-anchor frames via the lightweight reusing-based SR approach. However, frame-level scheduling is coarse-grained and fails to deliver optimal efficiency. In this work, we propose Palantir, the first neural-enhanced UHD live streaming system with fine-grained patch-level scheduling. In the presented solutions, two novel techniques are incorporated to make good scheduling decisions for inference overhead optimization and reduce the scheduling latency. Firstly, under the guidance of our pioneering and theoretical analysis, Palantir constructs a directed acyclic graph (DAG) for lightweight yet accurate quality estimation under any possible anchor patch set. Secondly, to further optimize the scheduling latency, Palantir improves parallelizability by refactoring the computation subprocedure of the estimation process into a sparse matrix-matrix multiplication operation. The evaluation results suggest that Palantir incurs a negligible scheduling latency accounting for less than 5.7% of the end-to-end latency requirement. When compared to the state-of-the-art real-time frame-level scheduling strategy, Palantir reduces the energy overhead of SR-integrated mobile clients by 38.1% at most (and 22.4% on average) and the monetary costs of cloud-based SR by 80.1% at most (and 38.4% on average).</description>

      <title>Rethinking Video with a Universal Event-Based Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditionally, video is structured as a sequence of discrete image frames. Recently, however, a novel video sensing paradigm has emerged which eschews video frames entirely. These "event" sensors aim to mimic the human vision system with asynchronous sensing, where each pixel has an independent, sparse data stream. While these cameras enable high-speed and high-dynamic-range sensing, researchers often revert to a framed representation of the event data for existing applications, or build bespoke applications for a particular camera's event data type. At the same time, classical video systems have significant computational redundancy at the application layer, since pixel samples are repeated across frames in the uncompressed domain.
  To address the shortcomings of existing systems, I introduce Address, Decimation, {\Delta}t Event Representation (AD{\Delta}ER, pronounced "adder"), a novel intermediate video representation and system framework. The framework transcodes a variety of framed and event camera sources into a single event-based representation, which supports source-modeled lossy compression and backward compatibility with traditional frame-based applications. I demonstrate that AD{\Delta}ER achieves state-of-the-art application speed and compression performance for scenes with high temporal redundancy. Crucially, I describe how AD{\Delta}ER unlocks an entirely new control mechanism for computer vision: application speed can correlate with both the scene content and the level of lossy compression. Finally, I discuss the implications for event-based video on large-scale video surveillance and resource-constrained sensing.</description>

      <title>Style-Preserving Lip Sync via Audio-Aware Style Reference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-driven lip sync has recently drawn significant attention due to its widespread application in the multimedia domain. Individuals exhibit distinct lip shapes when speaking the same utterance, attributed to the unique speaking styles of individuals, posing a notable challenge for audio-driven lip sync. Earlier methods for such task often bypassed the modeling of personalized speaking styles, resulting in sub-optimal lip sync conforming to the general styles. Recent lip sync techniques attempt to guide the lip sync for arbitrary audio by aggregating information from a style reference video, yet they can not preserve the speaking styles well due to their inaccuracy in style aggregation. This work proposes an innovative audio-aware style reference scheme that effectively leverages the relationships between input audio and reference audio from style reference video to address the style-preserving audio-driven lip sync. Specifically, we first develop an advanced Transformer-based model adept at predicting lip motion corresponding to the input audio, augmented by the style information aggregated through cross-attention layers from style reference video. Afterwards, to better render the lip motion into realistic talking face video, we devise a conditional latent diffusion model, integrating lip motion through modulated convolutional layers and fusing reference facial images via spatial cross-attention layers. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of the proposed approach in achieving precise lip sync, preserving speaking styles, and generating high-fidelity, realistic talking face videos.</description>

      <title>High-fidelity and Lip-synced Talking Face Synthesis via Landmark-based Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-driven talking face video generation has attracted increasing attention due to its huge industrial potential. Some previous methods focus on learning a direct mapping from audio to visual content. Despite progress, they often struggle with the ambiguity of the mapping process, leading to flawed results. An alternative strategy involves facial structural representations (e.g., facial landmarks) as intermediaries. This multi-stage approach better preserves the appearance details but suffers from error accumulation due to the independent optimization of different stages. Moreover, most previous methods rely on generative adversarial networks, prone to training instability and mode collapse. To address these challenges, our study proposes a novel landmark-based diffusion model for talking face generation, which leverages facial landmarks as intermediate representations while enabling end-to-end optimization. Specifically, we first establish the less ambiguous mapping from audio to landmark motion of lip and jaw. Then, we introduce an innovative conditioning module called TalkFormer to align the synthesized motion with the motion represented by landmarks via differentiable cross-attention, which enables end-to-end optimization for improved lip synchronization. Besides, TalkFormer employs implicit feature warping to align the reference image features with the target motion for preserving more appearance details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can synthesize high-fidelity and lip-synced talking face videos, preserving more subject appearance details from the reference image.</description>

      <title>Single Image Dehazing Using Scene Depth Ordering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Images captured in hazy weather generally suffer from quality degradation, and many dehazing methods have been developed to solve this problem. However, single image dehazing problem is still challenging due to its ill-posed nature. In this paper, we propose a depth order guided single image dehazing method, which utilizes depth order in hazy images to guide the dehazing process to achieve a similar depth perception in corresponding dehazing results. The consistency of depth perception ensures that the regions that look farther or closer in hazy images also appear farther or closer in the corresponding dehazing results, and thus effectively avoid the undesired visual effects. To achieve this goal, a simple yet effective strategy is proposed to extract the depth order in hazy images, which offers a reference for depth perception in hazy weather. Additionally, a depth order embedded transformation model is devised, which performs transmission estimation under the guidance of depth order to realize an unchanged depth order in the dehazing results. The extracted depth order provides a powerful global constraint for the dehazing process, which contributes to the efficient utilization of global information, thereby bringing an overall improvement in restoration quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can better recover potential structure and vivid color with higher computational efficiency than the state-of-the-art dehazing methods.</description>

      <title>A Simple Task-aware Contrastive Local Descriptor Selection Strategy for Few-shot Learning between inter class and intra class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Few-shot image classification aims to classify novel classes with few labeled samples. Recent research indicates that deep local descriptors have better representational capabilities. These studies recognize the impact of background noise on classification performance. They typically filter query descriptors using all local descriptors in the support classes or engage in bidirectional selection between local descriptors in support and query sets. However, they ignore the fact that background features may be useful for the classification performance of specific tasks. This paper proposes a novel task-aware contrastive local descriptor selection network (TCDSNet). First, we calculate the contrastive discriminative score for each local descriptor in the support class, and select discriminative local descriptors to form a support descriptor subset. Finally, we leverage support descriptor subsets to adaptively select discriminative query descriptors for specific tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both general and fine-grained datasets.</description>

      <title>Freehand Sketch Generation from Mechanical Components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drawing freehand sketches of mechanical components on multimedia devices for AI-based engineering modeling has become a new trend. However, its development is being impeded because existing works cannot produce suitable sketches for data-driven research. These works either generate sketches lacking a freehand style or utilize generative models not originally designed for this task resulting in poor effectiveness. To address this issue, we design a two-stage generative framework mimicking the human sketching behavior pattern, called MSFormer, which is the first time to produce humanoid freehand sketches tailored for mechanical components. The first stage employs Open CASCADE technology to obtain multi-view contour sketches from mechanical components, filtering perturbing signals for the ensuing generation process. Meanwhile, we design a view selector to simulate viewpoint selection tasks during human sketching for picking out information-rich sketches. The second stage translates contour sketches into freehand sketches by a transformer-based generator. To retain essential modeling features as much as possible and rationalize stroke distribution, we introduce a novel edge-constraint stroke initialization. Furthermore, we utilize a CLIP vision encoder and a new loss function incorporating the Hausdorff distance to enhance the generalizability and robustness of the model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance for generating freehand sketches in the mechanical domain.

      <title>DPDETR: Decoupled Position Detection Transformer for Infrared-Visible Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infrared-visible object detection aims to achieve robust object detection by leveraging the complementary information of infrared and visible image pairs. However, the commonly existing modality misalignment problem presents two challenges: fusing misalignment complementary features is difficult, and current methods cannot accurately locate objects in both modalities under misalignment conditions. In this paper, we propose a Decoupled Position Detection Transformer (DPDETR) to address these problems. Specifically, we explicitly formulate the object category, visible modality position, and infrared modality position to enable the network to learn the intrinsic relationships and output accurate positions of objects in both modalities. To fuse misaligned object features accurately, we propose a Decoupled Position Multispectral Cross-attention module that adaptively samples and aggregates multispectral complementary features with the constraint of infrared and visible reference positions. Additionally, we design a query-decoupled Multispectral Decoder structure to address the optimization gap among the three kinds of object information in our task and propose a Decoupled Position Contrastive DeNosing Training strategy to enhance the DPDETR's ability to learn decoupled positions. Experiments on DroneVehicle and KAIST datasets demonstrate significant improvements compared to other state-of-the-art methods. The code will be released at https://github.com/gjj45/DPDETR.</description>

      <title>MultiHateClip: A Multilingual Benchmark Dataset for Hateful Video Detection on YouTube and Bilibili</title>

Abstract: Hate speech is a pressing issue in modern society, with significant effects both online and offline. Recent research in hate speech detection has primarily centered on text-based media, largely overlooking multimodal content such as videos. Existing studies on hateful video datasets have predominantly focused on English content within a Western context and have been limited to binary labels (hateful or non-hateful), lacking detailed contextual information. This study presents MultiHateClip1 , an novel multilingual dataset created through hate lexicons and human annotation. It aims to enhance the detection of hateful videos on platforms such as YouTube and Bilibili, including content in both English and Chinese languages. Comprising 2,000 videos annotated for hatefulness, offensiveness, and normalcy, this dataset provides a cross-cultural perspective on gender-based hate speech. Through a detailed examination of human annotation results, we discuss the differences between Chinese and English hateful videos and underscore the importance of different modalities in hateful and offensive video analysis. Evaluations of state-of-the-art video classification models, such as VLM, GPT-4V and Qwen-VL, on MultiHateClip highlight the existing challenges in accurately distinguishing between hateful and offensive content and the urgent need for models that are both multimodally and culturally nuanced. MultiHateClip represents a foundational advance in enhancing hateful video detection by underscoring the necessity of a multimodal and culturally sensitive approach in combating online hate speech.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.13840v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have enabled impressive image generation capabilities guided by text prompts. However, extending these techniques to video generation remains challenging, with existing text-to-video (T2V) methods often struggling to produce high-quality and motion-consistent videos. In this work, we introduce Control-A-Video, a controllable T2V diffusion model that can generate videos conditioned on text prompts and reference control maps like edge and depth maps. To tackle video quality and motion consistency issues, we propose novel strategies to incorporate content prior and motion prior into the diffusion-based generation process. Specifically, we employ a first-frame condition scheme to transfer video generation from the image domain. Additionally, we introduce residual-based and optical flow-based noise initialization to infuse motion priors from reference videos, promoting relevance among frame latents for reduced flickering. Furthermore, we present a Spatio-Temporal Reward Feedback Learning (ST-ReFL) algorithm that optimizes the video diffusion model using multiple reward models for video quality and motion consistency, leading to superior outputs. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our framework generates higher-quality, more consistent videos compared to existing state-of-the-art methods in controllable text-to-video generation</description>

      <title>UniAV: Unified Audio-Visual Perception for Multi-Task Video Event Localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video localization tasks aim to temporally locate specific instances in videos, including temporal action localization (TAL), sound event detection (SED) and audio-visual event localization (AVEL). Existing methods over-specialize on each task, overlooking the fact that these instances often occur in the same video to form the complete video content. In this work, we present UniAV, a Unified Audio-Visual perception network, to achieve joint learning of TAL, SED and AVEL tasks for the first time. UniAV can leverage diverse data available in task-specific datasets, allowing the model to learn and share mutually beneficial knowledge across tasks and modalities. To tackle the challenges posed by substantial variations in datasets (size/domain/duration) and distinct task characteristics, we propose to uniformly encode visual and audio modalities of all videos to derive generic representations, while also designing task-specific experts to capture unique knowledge for each task. Besides, we develop a unified language-aware classifier by utilizing a pre-trained text encoder, enabling the model to flexibly detect various types of instances and previously unseen ones by simply changing prompts during inference. UniAV outperforms its single-task counterparts by a large margin with fewer parameters, achieving on-par or superior performances compared to state-of-the-art task-specific methods across ActivityNet 1.3, DESED and UnAV-100 benchmarks.</description>

      <title>KeyVideoLLM: Towards Large-scale Video Keyframe Selection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03104v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, with the rise of web videos, managing and understanding large-scale video datasets has become increasingly important. Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have emerged in recent years due to their strong video understanding capabilities. However, training and inference processes for VideoLLMs demand vast amounts of data, presenting significant challenges to data management, particularly regarding efficiency, robustness, and effectiveness. In this work, we present KeyVideoLLM, a text-video frame similarity-based keyframe selection method designed to manage VideoLLM data efficiently, robustly, and effectively. Specifically, KeyVideoLLM achieves a remarkable data compression rate of up to 60.9 times, substantially lowering disk space requirements, which proves its high efficiency. Additionally, it maintains a 100% selection success rate across all video formats and scales, enhances processing speed by up to 200 times compared to existing keyframe selection methods, and does not require hyperparameter tuning. Beyond its outstanding efficiency and robustness, KeyVideoLLM further improves model performance in video question-answering tasks during both training and inference stages. Notably, it consistently achieved the state-of-the-art (SoTA) experimental results on diverse datasets.</description>

Abstract: This study aims to share a teaching experience teaching sound design for audiovisual productions and compares different projects tackled by students. It is not intended to be a comparative analysis of different types of teaching but rather an analysis of different problems observed in different profiles of students of the subject who study it in different grades. The world of audio can be very interesting for a large part of the students, both those with creative and technical inclinations. Musical creation and production, synchronization with images, dubbing, etc. They are disciplines that are generally interesting but can have a very high barrier to entry due to their great technical complexity. Sometimes it can take weeks or even months for the uninitiated to begin to use audio editing programs with the necessary ease, which are not always particularly intuitive for students. Learning through the use of PBL methodologies generates, in our experience, results much superior to those that can be observed through the use of other teaching methods such as master classes. Students acquire technical skills while developing creative projects in which they get personally involved. Despite everything mentioned above, most interactions between teachers and students focus on aspects of technical correction. From different parameters in reverbs (such as pre-delay, decay, modulation...) to how to correctly adjust compressors, noise gates, etc.; The number of tools with which to work with audio is incredibly extensive, as well as many of its features that can present serious differences depending on their manufacturers.</description>
