      <title>Induced complete hereditary cotorsion pairs in D(R) with respect to Cartan-Eilenberg exact sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a complete hereditary cotorsion pair (A,B) in ModR, we construct a complete hereditary cotorsion pair in the derived category D(R) of unbounded complexes with respect to the proper class {\xi} of cohomologically ghost triangles induced by the Cartan-Eilenberg exact sequences. More specifically, we prove that, each of the classes of projectively coresolved {\xi}-Gflat complexes PGF({\xi}), {\xi}-Gflat complexes GF({\xi}), {\xi}-Ginjective complexes GI({\xi}), {\xi}-Gprojective complexes GP({\xi}) (the last when R is virtually Gorenstein), forms one half of a complete hereditary cotorsion pair in D(R) with respect to {\xi}. Moreover, various homological dimensions offer additional way to obtain such cotorsion pairs in D(R) with respect to {\xi}.</description>

      <title>On braided simple extensions and braided non-semisimple near-group categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a finite tensor category with a decomposition $\mathcal{C}\cong \mathcal{D}\oplus{\mathcal{M}}$ into full abelian categories such that $\mathcal{D}$ is a tensor subcategory and $\mathcal{M}$ has a single simple projective object. We call $\mathcal{C}$ a simple extension of $\mathcal{D}$. When $\mathcal{C}$ is braided and $\mathcal{D}$ is a braided subcategory, we will call $\mathcal{C}$ a braided simple extension. Applying the notion of a simple extension to a pointed non-semisimple category $\mathcal{D}$ gives a natural generalization to the family of near-group categories, which was first introduced by Siehler. Braided near-group categories were fully classified by Siehler and Thornton. In this paper, we study the structure of braided simple extensions of a braided finite tensor category $\mathcal{D}$ in general, and specifically when $\mathcal{D}$ is pointed. In particular, we classify non-degenerate braided non-semisimple near-group categories, and prove that any braided non-semisimple near-group category $\mathcal{C}$ is "an extension" of a non-degenerate braided non-semisimple near-group category by $Rep(G)$, where $G$ is the Picard group of a "canonical" symmetric subcategory of $\mathcal{C}$.</description>

      <title>Layered Monoidal Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the first part, we develop layered monoidal theories - a generalisation of monoidal theories combining descriptions of a system at several levels. Via their representation as string diagrams, monoidal theories provide a graphical syntax with a visually intuitive notions of information flow and composition. Layered monoidal theories allow mixing several monoidal theories (together with translations between them) within the same string diagram, while retaining mathematical precision and semantic interpretability. We define three flavours of layered monoidal theories, provide a recursively generated syntax for each, and construct a free-forgetful adjunction with respect to three closely related semantics: opfibrations, fibrations and deflations. We motivate the general theory by providing several examples from existing literature.
  In the second part, we develop a formal approach to retrosynthesis - the process of backwards reaction search in synthetic chemistry. Chemical processes are treated at three levels of abstraction: (1) (formal) reactions encode all chemically feasible combinatorial rearrangements of molecules, (2) reaction schemes encode transformations applicable to 'patches' of molecules (including the functional groups), and (3) disconnection rules encode local chemical rewrite rules applicable to a single bond or atom at a time. We show that the three levels are tightly linked: the reactions are generated by the reaction schemes, while there is a functorial translation from the disconnection rules to the reactions. Moreover, the translation from the disconnection rules to the reactions is shown to be sound, complete and universal - allowing one to treat the disconnection rules as a formal syntax with the semantics provided by the reactions. We tie together the two parts by providing a formalisation of retrosynthesis within a certain layered monoidal theory.</description>

      <title>Moduli stacks of quiver connections and non-Abelian Hodge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In arXiv:2407.11958, a moduli stack parametrizing $I$--indexed diagrams of Higgs bundles over a base stack $X$ was constructed for any finite simplicial set $I$, inspiring speculations about extending the non-Abelian Hodge correspondence to these moduli stacks. In the present work, we formalize the de Rham side of this conjectural extension. We construct moduli stacks parametrizing diagrams of bundles with $\lambda$--connections over a base prestack $X$, where $\lambda$ can be a fixed number or a parameter. Taking $\lambda$ to be $1$ gives a moduli stack parametrizing diagrams of bundles with connection, while taking it to be a parameter gives a version of Simpson's non-Abelian Hodge filtration for digrams of bundles with connection. We show that when $X$ is a smooth and projective scheme over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic $0$, these moduli stacks are algebraic and locally of finite presentation, and have affine diagonal.</description>

      <title>Localizing invariants of constructible sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an open-closed decomposition of the stratifying poset, we construct a new semi-orthogonal decomposition of the $\infty$-category of constructible sheaves on a stratified space admitting an exit-path $\infty$-category. From this we obtain a direct sum decomposition of the localizing invariants of the $\infty$-category of constructible sheaves. Since the $\ast$-pullback to the open stratum in the usual (recollement) semi-orthogonal decomposition is not strongly left adjoint, this splitting does not follow from pure sheaf theory considerations. Instead, the splitting crucially relies on the exodromy equivalence: it implies that on the level of constructible sheaves, the $\ast$-pullback to a closed stratum and the $!$-pushforward from an open stratum admit left adjoints. These new functors provide an additional semi-orthogonal decomposition (with the roles of open and closed reversed) in which the relevant functors are strongly left adjoint.</description>

      <title>A homological approach to (Grothendieck's) completeness problem for regular LB-spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the long-standing question of whether every regular LB-space is complete. The latter is open since the 1950s and is based on Grothendieck's early work in functional analysis. Rather than looking for a proof or counterexample, we categorify the question and formulate homological versions in terms of derived categories with respect to several natural exact structures. In one case we establish a bounded derived equivalence between the categories of regular and complete LB-spaces.</description>

      <title>Intervals of torsion pairs and generalized Happel-Reiten-Smal{\o} tilting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{A}$ be an abelian category with a torsion pair $(\mathcal{T},\mathcal{F})$. Happel-Reiten-Smalo tilting provides a method to construct a new abelian category $\mathcal{B}$ with a torsion pair associated to $(\mathcal{T},\mathcal{F})$, which is exactly the heart of a certain $t$-structure on the bounded derived category $D^b(\mathcal{A})$. In this paper, we mainly study generalized HRS tilting. We first show that an interval of torsion pairs in extriangulated categories with negative first extensions is bijectively associated with torsion pairs in the corresponding heart, which yields several new observations in triangulated categories. Then we obtain a generalization of HRS tilting by replacing hearts of $t$-structures with extended hearts. As an application, we show that certain $t$-structures on triangulated subcategories can be extended to $t$-structures on the whole triangulated categories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider epimorphisms and several variant notions -- split, effective, regular, strong, and extremal -- and determine which of these coincide in the metric coarse and coarsely Lipschitz categories. In particular, we characterise extremal epis in the coarsely Lipschitz category via a relative maximality condition on the codomain metric; this can be viewed as a morphism-relative analogue of Rosendal's maximal metrics for topological groups.</description>

      <title>An enhanced extriangulated subquotient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bondal-Kapranov's notion of enhanced triangulated categories behaves well in the framework of localization theory, in the sense that the Verdier quotient of triangulated categories can be lifted to the Drinfeld dg quotient of pretriangulated dg categories. In this paper, we develop a parallel enhancement for Nakaoka-Palu's notion of extriangulated categories, which unifies exact and triangulated categories. The enhancement of extriangulated categories was recently initiated by Xiaofa Chen under the name exact dg categories. Moreover, it is known that certain ideal quotients of extriangulated categories remain extriangulated, and that such ideal quotients admit dg enhancements via the dg quotient of the corresponding connective exact dg category. Motivated by Chen's framework of enhanced extriangulated categories, we introduce the concept of a cohomological envelope of an exact dg category and generalize his construction of the enhanced ideal quotient. We show that the dg quotient of exact dg categories, when passing to cohomological envelopes and their substructures -- referred to as exact dg subquotients -- is compatible with a broad class of extriangulated quotients in the sense of Nakaoka-Ogawa-Sakai. To further clarify the scope of our approach, we formulate the notion of an extriangulated subquotient, which enables the localization of any extriangulated category by extension-closed subcategories. This construction encompasses not only ideal and Verdier quotients, but also the quotient of an exact category by a biresolving subcategory. Notably, the extriangulated subquotient admits a natural lifting to the exact dg subquotient.</description>

Abstract: We give an elementary construction of the exact completion of a weakly lex category for categories enriched in the cartesian closed category $\mathsf{Pos}$ of partially ordered sets. Paralleling the ordinary case, we characterize categories which arise as such completions in terms of projective objects. We then apply the results to categories of Eilenberg-Moore algebras for monads on $\mathsf{Pos}$. In particular, we show that every variety of ordered algebras is the exact completion of a subcategory on certain free algebras, thereby answering a question of A. Kurz and J. Velebil.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.06522v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the triangular prism equations (TPE) for fusion categories, obtained by evaluating triangular prisms in terms of tetrahedra. Using an oriented graphical calculus, we show that the geometric symmetries of the regular tetrahedron are preserved. In the spherical case, we prove that the TPE are equivalent to the pentagon equations after a suitable change of basis. These equations provide new insight for managing complexity via localization. As a consequence, and using the Fuchs-Runkel-Schweigert theorem on the second Frobenius-Schur indicator, we obtain new categorification criteria. As an application, we solve all remaining open cases to complete the classification of unitary 1-Frobenius simple integral fusion categories up to rank 8 and up to Frobenius-Perron dimension 20000.</description>

      <title>The equifibered approach to $\infty$-properads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.02576v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a notion of $\infty$-properads that generalises $\infty$-operads by allowing operations with multiple outputs. Specializing to the case where each operation has a single output provides a simple new perspective on $\infty$-operads, but at the same time the extra generality allows for examples such as bordism categories. We also give an interpretation of our $\infty$-properads as Segal presheaves on a category of graphs by comparing them to the Segal $\infty$-properads of Hackney-Robertson-Yau. Combining these two approaches yields a flexible tool for doing higher algebra with operations that have multiple inputs and outputs. Crucially, this allows for a definition of algebras over an $\infty$-properad such that, for example, topological field theories are algebras over the bordism $\infty$-properad. The key ingredient to this paper is the notion of an equifibered map between $E_\infty$-monoids, which is a well-behaved generalisation of free maps. We also use this to prove facts about free $E_\infty$-monoids, for example that free $E_\infty$-monoids are closed under pullbacks along arbitrary maps.</description>

      <title>On t-structures adjacent and orthogonal to weight structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07855v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study $t$-structures (on triangulated categories) that are closely related to weight structures.
  A $t$-structure couple $t=(C_{t\le 0},C_{t\ge 0})$ is said to be adjacent to a weight structure $w=(C_{w\le 0}, C_{w\ge 0})$ if $C_{t\ge 0}=C_{w\ge 0}$.
  For a category $C$ that satisfies the Brown representability property we prove that $t$ that is adjacent to $w$ exists if and only if $w$ is smashing (that is, "respects C-coproducts"). The heart $Ht$ of this $t$ is the category of those functors $Hw^{op}\to Ab$ that respect products (here $Hw$ is the heart of $w$); the result has important applications.
  We prove several more statements on constructing $t$-structures starting from weight structures; we look for a strictly orthogonal $t$-structure $t$ on some $C'$ (where $C,C'$ are triangulated subcategories of a common $D$) such that $C'_{t\le 0}$ (resp. $C'_{t\ge 0}$) is characterized by the vanishing of morphisms from $C_{w\ge 1}$ (resp. $C_{w\le -1}$). Some of these results generalize properties of semi-orthogonal decompositions proved in the previous paper, and can be applied to various derived categories of (quasi)coherent sheaves on a scheme $X$ that is projective over an affine noetherian one. We also study hearts of orthogonal $t$-structures and their restrictions, and prove some statements on "reconstructing" weight structures from orthogonal $t$-structures.</description>

      <title>Groupoid Graded Semisimple Rings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the theory of groupoid graded semisimple rings. Our rings are neither unital nor one-sided artinian. Instead, they exhibit a strong version of having local units and being locally artinian, and we call them $\Gamma_0$-artinian. One of our main results is a groupoid graded version of the Wedderburn-Artin Theorem, where we characterize groupoid graded semisimple rings as direct sums of graded simple $\Gamma_0$-artinian rings and we exhibit the structure of this latter class of rings. In this direction, we also prove a groupoid graded version of Jacobson-Chevalley density theorem. We need to define and study properties of groupoid gradings on matrix rings (possibly of infinite size) over groupoid graded rings, and specially over groupoid graded division rings. Because of that, we study groupoid graded division rings and their graded modules. We consider a natural notion of freeness for groupoid graded modules that, when specialized to group graded rings, gives the usual one, and show that for a groupoid graded division ring all graded modules are free (in this sense). Contrary to the group graded case, there are groupoid graded rings for which all graded modules are free according to our definition, but they are not graded division rings. We exhibit an easy example of this kind of rings and characterize such class among groupoid graded semisimple rings. We also relate groupoid graded semisimple rings with the notion of semisimple category defined by B. Mitchell. For that, we show the link between functors from a preadditive category to abelian groups and graded modules over the groupoid graded ring associated to this category, generalizing a result of P. Gabriel. We characterize simple artinian categories and categories for which every functor from them to abelian groups is free in the sense of B. Mitchell.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10434v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a 2-functor from the Kac-Moody 2-category for the extended quantum affine sl(3) to the homotopy 2-category of bounded chain complexes with values in the Kac-Moody 2-category for quantum gl(3), categorifying the evaluation map between the corresponding quantum Kac-Moody algebras.</description>

      <title>Why quantum state verification cannot be both efficient and secure: a categorical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advantage of quantum protocols lies in the inherent properties of the shared quantum states. These states are sometimes provided by sources that are not trusted, and therefore need to be verified. Finding secure and efficient quantum state verification protocols remains a big challenge, and recent works illustrate trade-offs between efficiency and security for different groups of states in restricted settings. However, whether a universal trade-off exists for all quantum states and all verification strategies remains unknown. In this work, we instantiate the categorical composable cryptography framework to show a fundamental limit for quantum state verification for all cut-and-choose approaches used to verify arbitrary quantum states. Our findings show that the prevailing cut-and-choose techniques cannot lead to quantum state verification protocols that are both efficient and secure.</description>

      <title>Realizing compatible pairs of transfer systems by combinatorial $N_\infty$-operads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate how the notions of pairings of operads of May and compatible pairs of indexing systems of Blumberg--Hill relate via the correspondence between indexing systems and $N_{\infty}$-operads. We show that a pairing of operads induces a pairing on the associated indexing systems. Conversely, we show that in many cases, compatible pairs of indexing systems can be realized by a pairing of $N_{\infty}$-operads.</description>

      <title>Discontinuous actions on cones, joins, and $n$-universal bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that locally countably-compact Hausdorff topological groups $\mathbb{G}$ act continuously on their iterated joins $E_n\mathbb{G}:=\mathbb{G}^{*(n+1)}$ (the total spaces of the Milnor-model $n$-universal $\mathbb{G}$-bundles) as well as the colimit-topologized unions $E\mathbb{G}=\varinjlim_n E_n\mathbb{G}$, and the converse holds under the assumption that $\mathbb{G}$ is first-countable. In the latter case other mutually equivalent conditions provide characterizations of local countable compactness: the fact that $\mathbb{G}$ acts continuously on its first self-join $E_1\mathbb{G}$, or on its cone $\mathcal{C}\mathbb{G}$, or the coincidence of the product and quotient topologies on $\mathbb{G}\times \mathcal{C}X$ for all spaces $X$ or, equivalently, for the discrete countably-infinite $X:=\aleph_0$. These can all be regarded as weakened versions of $\mathbb{G}$'s exponentiability, all to the effect that $\mathbb{G}\times -$ preserves certain colimit shapes in the category of topological spaces; the results thus extend the equivalence (under the separation assumption) between local compactness and exponentiability.</description>
