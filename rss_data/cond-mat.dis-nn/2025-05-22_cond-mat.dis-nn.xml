      <title>Impact of Clifford operations on non-stabilizing power and quantum chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-stabilizerness, alongside entanglement, is a crucial ingredient for fault-tolerant quantum computation and achieving a genuine quantum advantage. Despite recent progress, a complete understanding of the generation and thermalization of non-stabilizerness in circuits that mix Clifford and non-Clifford operations remains elusive. While Clifford operations do not generate non-stabilizerness, their interplay with non-Clifford gates can strongly impact the overall non-stabilizing dynamics of generic quantum circuits. In this work, we establish a direct relationship between the final non-stabilizing power and the individual powers of the non-Clifford gates, in circuits where these gates are interspersed with random Clifford operations. By leveraging this result, we unveil the thermalization of non-stabilizing power to its Haar-averaged value in generic circuits. As a precursor, we analyze two-qubit gates and illustrate this thermalization in analytically tractable systems. Extending this, we explore the operator-space non-stabilizing power and demonstrate its behavior in physical models. Finally, we examine the role of non-stabilizing power in the emergence of quantum chaos in brick-wall quantum circuits. Our work elucidates how non-stabilizing dynamics evolve and thermalize in quantum circuits and thus contributes to a better understanding of quantum computational resources and of their role in quantum chaos.</description>

      <title>Statistical field theory of equilibrium amorphous solids and the intrinsic heterogeneity distributions that characterize them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A rich variety of amorphous solids are found in nature and technology, including ones formed via the vulcanization of long, flexible molecules. A special class -- those featuring a wide gap between the long timescales over which constraints in them release and the much shorter timescales over which their unconstrained freedoms relax -- exhibit states of thermodynamic equilibrium and are thus amenable to the framework of equilibrium statistical physics. The approach reviewed here is the least specific -- and thus the most general -- approach to the statistical mechanics of equilibrium amorphous solid-formers: statistical field theory. An overview is given of the key elements and results of this theory. The field of the theory is constructed to detect and diagnose the amorphous solid state. Its form turns out to be unusual, in ways that are essential for its application, so it is examined in detail, as is the form of the field theory controlling the field. What this theory can predict for the equilibrium properties of amorphous solids is then discussed, including: the transition to the amorphous solid state and the heterogeneity of the resulting solid; the impact of fluctuations on the transition and connections with percolation theory; the pattern of symmetry-breaking and the nature of the resulting elasticity; and field correlations and the information they provide. Emphasis is placed on the idea, peculiar to amorphous solids, that their equilibrium states are naturally characterized in terms of distributions that capture the intrinsic spatial heterogeneity of the thermal motions of their constituents. The theory's field has an internal structure that subtly encodes this information, via the wave-vector dependencies of the average field and its correlations. Reflections are made on the applicability of theses ideas and results to a range of amorphous solids and related systems.</description>

      <title>Mott transition and correlation effects on strictly localized states in an octagonal quasicrystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flat-band systems have attracted significant attention as platforms for studying strongly correlated electron physics, where the dominance of electron-electron interactions over kinetic energy gives rise to a variety of emergent phenomena. Quasicrystals are compelling systems for studying these phenomena as they host degenerate strictly localized states at zero energy due to perfect destructive interference patterns. In this study, we use the slave-rotor mean-field approach to investigate the effects of electron interactions within the Hubbard model on the Ammann-Beenker quasicrystal. The phase diagram characterizing metallic and Mott insulator regions indicates a first-order phase transition. Our analysis shows that the local coordination number affects the local quasiparticle weight, displaying varying metallicity across the sites. Furthermore, we focus on the strictly localized states that arise in the non-interacting limit. We find that interactions and deviation from particle-hole symmetry induce spectral splitting, broadening, and partial delocalization of the localized states, depending on the local environment. In particular, certain localized states with higher coordination numbers remain more robust compared to others. Our results highlight the critical role of local geometry in shaping correlation effects in flat-band quasicrystals.</description>

      <title>Congestion and extreme events in urban street networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Congestion and extreme events in transportation networks are emergent phenomena with significant socio-economic implications. In this work, we study congestion and extreme event properties on real urban street (planar) networks drawn from four cities and compare it with that on a regular square grid. For dynamics, we employ three variants of random walk with additional realistic transport features. In all the four urban street networks and 2D square grid and with all dynamical models, phase transitions are observed from a free flow to congested phase as a function of birth rate of vehicles. These transitions can be modified by traffic-aware routing protocols, but congestion cannot be entirely mitigated. In organically evolved street networks, we observe a semi-congested regime which has both congested and free-flow components. In the free-flow regime, the extreme event occurrence probability is larger for small degree nodes than for hubs, a feature originally observed in non-planar scale-free networks. In general, with respect to congestion and extreme events, the urban street networks and regular square grid display similar properties.</description>

      <title>Bilinear Sequence Regression: A Model for Learning from Long Sequences of High-dimensional Tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current progress in artificial intelligence is centered around so-called large language models that consist of neural networks processing long sequences of high-dimensional vectors called tokens. Statistical physics provides powerful tools to study the functioning of learning with neural networks and has played a recognized role in the development of modern machine learning. The statistical physics approach relies on simplified and analytically tractable models of data. However, simple tractable models for long sequences of high-dimensional tokens are largely underexplored. Inspired by the crucial role models such as the single-layer teacher-student perceptron (aka generalized linear regression) played in the theory of fully connected neural networks, in this paper, we introduce and study the bilinear sequence regression (BSR) as one of the most basic models for sequences of tokens. We note that modern architectures naturally subsume the BSR model due to the skip connections. Building on recent methodological progress, we compute the Bayes-optimal generalization error for the model in the limit of long sequences of high-dimensional tokens, and provide a message-passing algorithm that matches this performance. We quantify the improvement that optimal learning brings with respect to vectorizing the sequence of tokens and learning via simple linear regression. We also unveil surprising properties of the gradient descent algorithms in the BSR model.</description>

      <title>Glassy dynamics near the interpolation transition in deep recurrent networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine learning dynamics in deep recurrent networks, focusing on the behavior near the boundary in the depth-width plane separating under- from over-parametrized networks, known as the interpolation transition. The training data are Bach chorales in 4-part harmony, and the learning is by stochastic gradient descent with a cross-entropy loss function. We find critical slowing down of the learning approaching the transition from the overparametrized side: For a given network depth, learning times to reach small training loss values appear to diverge proportional to $1/(w - w_c)$ as the width w approaches a (loss-dependent) critical value $w_c$. We identify the zero-loss limit of this value with the interpolation transition. We also study aging (the slowing down of fluctuations as the time since the beginning of learning increases). Taking a system that has been learning for a time $\tau_w$, we measure the subsequent mean-square fluctuations of the weight values at times $\tau &gt; \tau_w$. In the underparametrized phase, we find that they are well-described by a single function of $\tau/\tau_w$. While this scaling holds approximately at short times at the transition and in the overparametrized phase, it breaks down at longer times when the training loss gets close to the lower limit imposed by the stochastic gradient descent dynamics. Both this kind of aging and the critical slowing down are also found in certain spin glass models, suggesting that those models contain the most essential features of the learning dynamics.</description>

      <title>Quantum complexity and localization in random and time-periodic unitary circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the growth and saturation of Krylov spread (K-) complexity under random quantum circuits. In Haar-random unitary evolution, we show that, for large system sizes, K-complexity grows linearly before saturating at a late-time value of $D/2$, where $D$ is the Hilbert space dimension, at timescales $\sim D$. Our numerical analysis encompasses two classes of random circuits: brick-wall random unitary circuits and Floquet random circuits. In brick-wall case, K-complexity exhibits dynamics consistent with Haar-random unitary evolution, while the inclusion of measurements significantly slows its growth down. For Floquet random circuits, we show that localized phases lead to reduced late-time saturation values of K-complexity, forbye we utilize these saturation values to probe the transition between thermal and many-body localized phases.</description>

      <title>Disorder-Order Interface Propagating over the Ferromagnetic Ground State in the Transverse Field Ising Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04089v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider time evolution of order parameters and entanglement asymmetries in the ferromagnetic phase of the transverse-field Ising chain. One side of the system is prepared in a ferromagnetic ground state and the other side either in equilibrium at higher temperature or out of equilibrium. We focus on the disorder-order interface in which the order parameter attains a nonzero value, different from the ground state one. In that region, correlations follow a universal behaviour. We analytically compute the asymptotic scaling functions of the one- and two-point equal time correlations of the order parameter and provide numerical evidence that also the non-equal time correlations are universal. We analyze the R\'enyi entanglement asymmetries of subsystems and obtain a prediction that is expected to hold also in the von Neumann limit. Finally, we show that the Wigner-Yanase skew information of the order paramerter in subsystems within the interfacial region scales as their length squared. We propose a semiclassical approximation that is particularly effective close to the edge of the lightcone.</description>
