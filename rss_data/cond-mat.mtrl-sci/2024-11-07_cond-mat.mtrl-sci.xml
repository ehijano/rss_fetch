      <title>Boosting electrode performance and bubble management via Direct Laser Interference Patterning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser-structuring techniques like Direct Laser Interference Patterning show great potential for optimizing electrodes for water electrolysis. Therefore, a systematic experimental study based on statistical design of experiments is performed to analyze the influence of the spatial period and the aspect ratio between spatial period and structure depth on the electrode performance for pure Ni electrodes. The electrochemically active surface area could be increased by a factor of 12 compared to a non-structured electrode. For oxygen evolution reaction, a significantly lower onset potential and overpotential ($\approx$-164 mV at 100 mA/cm$^2$) is found. This is explained by a lower number of active nucleation sites and, simultaneously, larger detached bubbles, resulting in reduced electrode blocking and thus, lower ohmic resistance. It is found that the spatial distance between the laser-structures is the decisive processing parameter for the improvement of the electrode performance.</description>

      <title>Rational Design Heterobilayers Photocatalysts for Efficient Water Splitting Based on 2D Transition-Metal Dichalcogenide and Their Janus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct Z-scheme heterostructures with enhanced redox potential are increasingly regarded as promising materials for solar-driven water splitting. This potential arises from the synergistic interaction between the intrinsic dipoles in Janus materials and the interfacial electric fields across the layers. In this study, we explore the photocatalytic potential of 20 two-dimensional (2D) Janus transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) heterobilayers for efficient water splitting. Utilizing density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we first screen these materials based on key properties such as band gaps and the magnitude of intrinsic electric fields to identify promising candidates. We then evaluate additional critical factors, including carrier mobility and surface chemical reactions, to fully assess their performance. The intrinsic dipole moments in Janus materials generate built-in electric fields that enhance charge separation and reduce carrier recombination, thereby improving photocatalytic efficiency. Furthermore, we employ the Fr\"{o}hlich interaction model to quantify the mobility contributions from the longitudinal optical phonon mode, providing detailed insights into how carrier mobility, influenced by phonon scattering, affects photocatalytic performance. Our results reveal that several Janus-TMDC heterobilayers, including WSe$_2$-SWSe, WSe$_2$-TeWSe, and WS$_2$-SMoSe, exhibit strong absorption in the visible spectrum and achieve solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiencies of up to 33.24%. These findings demonstrate the potential of Janus-based Z-scheme systems to overcome existing limitations in photocatalytic water splitting by optimizing the electronic and structural properties of 2D materials. This research highlights a viable pathway for advancing clean energy generation through enhanced photocatalytic processes.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic inverse band gap versus polarization relation in ferroelectric materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectric materials have promising applications in solar-energy conversion and electro-optic devices. The internal gradient fields produced by the macroscopic polarization may improve electronic and transport semiconducting properties. However, ferroelectrics tend to display relatively large band gaps and hence low solar-energy conversion efficiencies. In this work, we explore materials with an intrinsic inverse relation between band gap and polarization in a single ferroelectric phase. Ferroelectrics with an inverse band gap versus polarization relation are characterized by low density of states contribution at the conduction states and negligible orbital hybridization at the valence states. We use high-throughput and first principles methods to find 11 ferroelectric materials with an inverse band gap versus polarization relation in the Materials Project database. Our work provides a new pathway to design small-band gap large-polarization ferroelectrics, by simultaneously tailoring the band gap and polarization of ferroelectrics with an inverse relation through an external tuning parameter.</description>

      <title>Automated, LLM enabled extraction of synthesis details for reticular materials from scientific literature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated knowledge extraction from scientific literature can potentially accelerate materials discovery. We have investigated an approach for extracting synthesis protocols for reticular materials from scientific literature using large language models (LLMs). To that end, we introduce a Knowledge Extraction Pipeline (KEP) that automatizes LLM-assisted paragraph classification and information extraction. By applying prompt engineering with in-context learning (ICL) to a set of open-source LLMs, we demonstrate that LLMs can retrieve chemical information from PDF documents, without the need for fine-tuning or training and at a reduced risk of hallucination. By comparing the performance of five open-source families of LLMs in both paragraph classification and information extraction tasks, we observe excellent model performance even if only few example paragraphs are included in the ICL prompts. The results show the potential of the KEP approach for reducing human annotations and data curation efforts in automated scientific knowledge extraction.</description>

      <title>Distinct topological Hall responses in CeCu$_2$-type EuZn$_2$ and EuCd$_2$ films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare earth intermetallic compounds crystallized in AlB$_2$-type and its low-symmetry derivative CeCu$_2$-type structures potentially host diverse frustrated magnetic structures and rich magnetotransport phenomena. We report the film growth of CeCu$_2$-type EuZn$_2$ by molecular beam epitaxy and the observation of topological Hall responses highly contrastive to isostructural EuCd$_2$. While their magnetization curves are rather similar, the topological Hall effect observed in EuZn$_2$ is simpler, with the only one component enhanced at the magnetic transition field. EuZn$_2$ may be a unique system for studying the magnetic domain boundary effect on topological Hall responses among the CeCu$_2$-type rare-earth intermetallic compounds.</description>

      <title>A Predictive First-Principles Framework of Chiral Charge Density Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implementing and tuning chirality is fundamental in physics, chemistry, and material science. Chiral charge density waves (CDWs), where chirality arises from correlated charge orders, are attracting intense interest due to their exotic transport and optical properties. However, a general framework for predicting chiral CDW materials is lacking, primarily because the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we address this challenge by developing the first comprehensive predictive framework, systematically identifying chiral CDW materials via first-principles calculations. The key lies in the previously overlooked phase difference of the CDW Q-vectors between layers, which is linked to opposite collective atomic displacements across different layers. This phase difference induces a spiral arrangement of the Q-vectors, ultimately giving rise to a chiral structure in real space. We validate our framework by applying it to the kagome lattice AV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ (A = K, Rb, Cs), successfully predicting emergent structural chirality. To demonstrate the generality of our approach, we extend it to predict chiral CDWs in the triangular-lattice NbSe$_{2}$. Beyond material predictions, our theory uncovers a universal and unprecedented Hall effect in chiral CDW materials, occurring without external magnetic fields or intrinsic magnetization. Our experiments on CsV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ confirm this prediction, observing a unique signature where the Hall conductivity's sign reverses when the input current is reversed, a phenomenon distinct from known Hall effects. Our findings elucidate the mechanisms behind chiral CDWs and open new avenues for discovering materials with unconventional quantum properties, with potential applications in next-generation electronic and spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>The method to improve the speed of RF switches based on vanadium dioxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article proposes a method to improve the switching rate of RF switches based on thermally induced phase change materials.Based on the principle that during the heating process, the increase in heat provided by the heating element plays a major role, while the heat dissipation effect of the bottom heat dissipation layer during the cooling process plays a major role. By replacing the heat dissipation layer material in the phase change RF switch with a high thermal conductivity material, the temperature rise rate of the phase change switch slightly decreases, while the temperature drop rate is significantly increased. Ultimately, the switching speed of the switch instances in this article increased by nearly 28.4%. The proposal of this method provides a new idea for optimizing the switching rate of RF switches based on thermally induced phase change materials in the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the contemporary era of rapid advancements in materials science, the development of new compounds and materials is proceeding at an accelerated pace. The concept of the potential energy landscape (PEL) plays a pivotal role in supporting the meticulous engineering of novel structures. This review article examines the historical evolution of the PEL concept and its diverse applications in materials design. A comprehensive overview of the major methods employed to sample the PEL is presented, accompanied by a critical discussion highlighting relevant modern endeavors. Specific applications of the PEL in rationalizing the design of molecules and materials for energy storage, electrolytic solutions, and greenhouse gas capture are exemplified. This review serves as an up-to-date guide for exploring and analyzing the PEL, facilitating a deeper understanding of its significance in materials science.</description>

      <title>Magnetic order induced truly chiral phonons in a ferromagnetic Weyl semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral phonons are vibrational modes in a crystal that possess a well-defined handedness or chirality, typically found in materials that lack inversion symmetry. Here we report the discovery of truly chiral phonon modes in the kagome ferromagnetic Weyl semimetal Co3Sn2S2, a material that preserves inversion symmetry but breaks time-reversal symmetry. Using helicity-resolved magneto-Raman spectroscopy, we observe the spontaneous splitting of the doubly degenerate in-plane Eg modes into two distinct chiral phonon modes of opposite helicity when the sample is zero-field cooled below the Curie temperature, without the application of an external magnetic field. As we sweep the out-of-plane magnetic field, this Eg phonon splitting exhibits a well-defined hysteresis loop directly correlated with the material's magnetization. The observed spontaneous splitting reaches up to 1.27 cm-1 at low temperatures and diminishes with increasing temperature, ultimately vanishing at the Curie temperature. Our findings highlight the role of the magnetic order in inducing chiral phonons, paving the way for novel methods to manipulate chiral phonons through magnetization and vice versa. Additionally, our work introduces new possibilities for controlling chiral Weyl fermions using chiral phonons.</description>

      <title>Effect of crystal symmetry of lead halide perovskites on the optical orientation of excitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The great variety of lead halide perovskite semiconductors represents an outstanding platform for studying crystal symmetry effects on the spin-dependent properties. Access to them is granted through optical orientation of exciton and carrier spins by circularly polarized photons. Here, the exciton spin polarization is investigated at $1.6$\,K cryogenic temperature in four lead halide perovskite crystals with different symmetries: (almost) cubic in FA$_{0.9}$Cs$_{0.1}$PbI$_{2.8}$Br$_{0.2}$ and FAPbBr$_3$, and orthorhombic in MAPbI$_3$ and CsPbBr$_3$. Giant optical orientation of 85\% is found for the excitons in FA$_{0.9}$Cs$_{0.1}$PbI$_{2.8}$Br$_{0.2}$, MAPbI$_3$, and CsPbBr$_3$, while it amounts to 20\% in FAPbBr$_3$. For all studied crystals, the optical orientation is robust to detuning of the laser photon energy from the exciton resonance, remaining constant for high energy detunings up to 0.3~eV, above which it continuously decreases to zero for detunings exceeding 1~eV. No acceleration of the spin relaxation for excitons with large kinetic energy is found in the cubic and orthorhombic crystals. This evidences the absence of the Dyakonov-Perel spin relaxation mechanism, which is based on the Rashba-Dresselhaus splitting of spin states at finite $k$-vectors. This indicates that the spatial inversion symmetry is maintained in perovskite crystals, independent of the cubic or orthorhombic phase.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of high electron-mobility, unpaired spins, and superconductivity at high carrier density SrTiO$_3$-based interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $t_{2g}$ band-structure of SrTiO$_3$-based two-dimensional electron gasses (2DEGs), have been found to play a role in features such as the superconducting dome, high-mobility transport, and the magnitude of spin-orbit coupling. This adds to the already very diverse range of phenomena, including magnetism and extreme magnetoresistance, exhibited by this particular material platform. Tuning and/or combining these intriguing attributes could yield significant progress within quantum and spintronics technologies. Doing so demands precise control of the parameters, which requires a better understanding of the factors that affect them. Here we present effects of the $t_{2g}$ band-order inversion, stemming from the growth of spinel-structured $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$ onto perovskite SrTiO$_3$. Electronic transport measurements show that with LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ as the reference, the carrier density and electron mobility are enhanced, and the sample displays a reshaping of the superconducting dome. Additionally, unpaired spins are evidenced by increasing Anomalous Hall Effect with decreasing temperature, entering the same temperature range as the superconducting transition, and a Kondo-like upturn in the sheet resistance. Finally, it is argued that the high-mobility $d_{xz/yz}$-band is more likely than the $d_{xy}$-band to host the supercurrent.</description>

      <title>Truly Chiral Phonons Arising From Chirality-Selective Magnon-Phonon Coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral phonons are desirable for applications in spintronics but their generation and control remains a challenge. Here we demonstrate the emergence of truly chiral phonons from selective magnon-phonon coupling in inversion-symmetric magnetic systems. Considering bcc Fe as example, we quantitatively calculate hybridized magnon-phonon quasiparticle states across the entire Brillouin zone utilizing first-principles calculations. Our findings challenge conventional magneto-elastic interpretations and reveal finite zero-point phonon angular momentum and strong anomalous Hall responses linked to finite (spin) Berry curvatures. Our results further establish that the existence of chiral phonons, particularly along high-symmetry directions, is common in many magnetic materials, offering promising avenues for novel spintronic and phononic devices.</description>

      <title>A Molecular Perspective of Exciton Condensation from Particle-hole Reduced Density Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exciton condensation, the Bose-Einstein-like condensation of quasibosonic particle-hole pairs, has been the subject of much theoretical and experimental interest and holds promise for ultra-energy-efficient technologies. Recent advances in bilayer systems, such as transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures, have brought us closer to the experimental realization of exciton condensation without the need for high magnetic fields. In this perspective, we explore progress towards understanding and realizing exciton condensation, with a particular focus on the characteristic theoretical signature of exciton condensation: an eigenvalue greater than one in the particle-hole reduced density matrix, which signifies off-diagonal long-range order. This metric bridges the gap between theoretical predictions and experimental realizations by providing a unifying framework that connects exciton condensation to related phenomena, such as Bose-Einstein condensation and superconductivity. Furthermore, our molecular approach integrates exciton condensation with broader excitonic phenomena, including exciton-related entanglement and correlation, unlocking potential advancements in fields like quantum materials and energy transport. We discuss connections between recent experimental and theoretical work and highlight the discoveries that may arise from approaching exciton condensation from a molecular perspective.</description>

      <title>Charge-constrained Atomic Cluster Expansion</title>

Abstract: The atomic cluster expansion (ACE) efficiently parameterizes complex energy surfaces of pure elements and alloys. Due to the local nature of the many-body basis, ACE is inherently local or semilocal for graph ACE. Here, we employ descriptor-constrained density functional theory for parameterizing ACE with charge or other degrees of freedom, thereby transfering the variational property of the density functional to ACE. The descriptors can be of scalar, vectorial or tensorial nature. From the simplest case of scalar atomic descriptors we directly obtain charge-dependent ACE with long-range electrostatic interactions between variable charges. We observe that the variational properties of the charges greatly help in training, avoiding the need for charge-constrained DFT calculations.</description>

      <title>A Printed Microscopic Universal Gradient Interface for Super Stretchable Strain-Insensitive Bioelectronics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stretchable electronics capable of conforming to nonplanar and dynamic human body surfaces are central for creating implantable and on-skin devices for high-fidelity monitoring of diverse physiological signals. While various strategies have been developed to produce stretchable devices, the signals collected from such devices are often highly sensitive to local strain, resulting in inevitable convolution with surface strain-induced motion artifacts that are difficult to distinguish from intrinsic physiological signals. Here we report all-printed super stretchable strain-insensitive bioelectronics using a unique universal gradient interface (UGI) to bridge the gap between soft biomaterials and stiff electronic materials. Leveraging a versatile aerosol-based multi-materials printing technique that allows precise spatial control over the local stiffnesses with submicron resolution, the UGI enables strain-insensitive electronic devices with negligible resistivity changes under a 180% stretch ratio. We demonstrate various stretchable devices directly printed on the UGI for on-skin health monitoring with high signal quality and near perfect immunity to motion artifacts, including semiconductor-based photodetectors for sensing blood oxygen saturation levels and metal-based temperature sensors. The concept in this work will significantly simplify the fabrication and accelerate the development of a broad range of wearable and implantable bioelectronics for real-time health monitoring and personalized therapeutics.</description>

      <title>Tutorial: Classifying Photonic Topology Using the Spectral Localizer and Numerical $K$-Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the spectral localizer framework has emerged as an efficient approach to classifying topology in photonic systems featuring local nonlinearities and radiative environments. In nonlinear systems, this framework provides rigorous definitions for concepts like topological solitons and topological dynamics, where a system's occupation induces a local change in its topology due to the nonlinearity. For systems embedded in radiative environments that do not possess a shared bulk spectral gap, this framework enables the identification of local topology and shows that local topological protection is preserved despite the lack of a common gap. However, as the spectral localizer framework is rooted in the mathematics of $C^*$-algebras, and not vector bundles, understanding and using this framework requires developing intuition for a somewhat different set of underlying concepts than those that appear in traditional approaches to classifying material topology. In this tutorial, we introduce the spectral localizer framework from a ground-up perspective, and provide physically motivated arguments for understanding its local topological markers and associated local measure of topological protection. In doing so, we provide numerous examples of the framework's application to a variety of topological classes, including crystalline and higher-order topology. We then show how Maxwell's equations can be reformulated to be compatible with the spectral localizer framework, including the possibility of radiative boundary conditions. To aid in this introduction, we also provide a physics-oriented introduction to multi-operator pseudospectral methods and numerical $K$-theory, two mathematical concepts that form the foundation for the spectral localizer framework.</description>

      <title>Self-Healing in Dielectric Capacitors: a Universal Method to Computationally Rate Newly Introduced Energy Storage Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metal-film dielectric capacitors provide lump portions of energy on demand. While the capacities of various capacitor designs are comparable in magnitude, their stabilities make a difference. Dielectric breakdowns - micro-discharges - routinely occur in capacitors due to the inevitable presence of localized structure defects. The application of polymeric dielectric materials featuring flexible structures helps obtain more uniform insulating layers. At the modern technological level, it is impossible to completely avoid micro-discharges upon device exploitation. Every micro-discharge results in the formation of a soot channel, which is empirically known to exhibit semiconductor behavior. Because of its capability to conduct electricity, the emerged soot channels harm the subsequent capacitor performance and decrease the amount of stored energy. The accumulation of the soot throughout a dielectric capacitor ultimately results in irreversible overall failure. In the context of the dielectric breakdown, self-healing designates a range of chemical processes, which spontaneously rearrange the atoms in the soot channels to partially return their insulative function. We developed a universal method capable of rating new capacitor designs including electrode and polymer material and their proportions. We found the best-performing designs produce abundant volatile by-products after micro-discharge, whereas the soot samples exhibit lower electronic conductivities. We proved the capability of the theoretical method to rate the empirical performance of the known capacitors. The method relies on various electronic-structure simulations and potential landscape explorations. The reported advance opens an impressive avenue to computationally probe thousands of hypothetical capacitor designs.</description>

      <title>The effects of fibre spatial distribution and relative orientation on the percolation and mechanics of stochastic fibre networks: A model of peptide hydrogels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structures of fibre networks can vary greatly due to fibre interactions during formation. We have modified the steps of generating Mikado networks to create two new model classes by altering the spatial distribution and relative orientation of their fibres to mimic the structures of self-assembling peptide hydrogels (SAPHs), whose physical properties depend strongly on their fibres' interactions. The results of our models and experiments on a set of beta-sheet forming SAPHs show that modifying a network's structure affects the percolation threshold and the mechanical behaviour of the material, both near percolation and at higher densities.</description>

      <title>Explicit demonstration of the equivalence between DFT+U and the Hartree-Fock limit of DFT+DMFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several methods have been developed to improve the predictions of density functional theory (DFT) in the case of strongly correlated electron systems. Out of these approaches, DFT+$U$, which corresponds to a static treatment of the local interaction, and DFT combined with dynamical mean field theory (DFT+DMFT), which considers local fluctuations, have both proven incredibly valuable in tackling the description of materials with strong local electron-electron interactions. While it is in principle known that the Hartree-Fock (HF) limit of the DFT+DMFT approach should recover DFT+$U$, demonstrating this equivalence in practice is challenging, due to the very different ways in which the two approaches are generally implemented. In this work, we introduce a way to perform DFT+$U$ calculations in Quantum ESPRESSO using Wannier functions as calculated by Wannier90, which allows us to use the same Hubbard projector functions both in DFT+$U$ and in DFT+DMFT. We benchmark these DFT+$U$ calculations against DFT+DMFT calculations where the DMFT impurity problem is solved within the HF approximation. Considering a number of prototypical materials including NiO, MnO, LaMnO$_3$, and LuNiO$_3$, we establish the sameness of the two approaches. Finally, we showcase the versatility of our approach by going beyond the commonly used atomic orbital-like projectors by performing DFT+$U$ calculations for VO$_2$ using a special set of bond-centered Wannier functions.</description>

      <title>Impact of surface treatments on the transport properties of germanium 2DHGs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Holes in planar germanium (Ge) heterostructures show promise for quantum applications, particularly in superconducting and spin qubits, due to strong spin-orbit interaction, low effective mass, and absence of valley degeneracies. However, charge traps cause issues such as gate hysteresis and charge noise. This study examines the effect of surface treatments on the accumulation behaviour and transport properties of Ge-based two dimensional hole gases (2DHGs). Oxygen plasma treatment reduces conduction in a setting without applied top-gate voltage and improves the mobility and lowers the percolation density, while hydrofluoric acid (HF) etching provides no benefit. The results suggest that interface traps from the partially oxidised silicon (Si) cap pin the Fermi level, and that oxygen plasma reduces the trap density by fully oxidising the Si cap. Therefore, optimising surface treatments is crucial for minimising the charge traps and thereby enhancing the device performance.</description>

      <title>Octupolar vortex crystal and toroidal moment in twisted bilayer MnPSe$_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experimental detection of antiferromagnetic order in two-dimensional materials is a challenging task due to the absence of net dipole moments. Identifying multi-domain antiferromagnetic textures via the current techniques is even more difficult. In order to address this challenge, we investigate the higher order multipole moments in twisted bilayer MnPSe$_3$. While the monolayers of MnPSe$_3$ exhibit in-plane N\'eel antiferromagnetic order, our atomistic simulations indicate that the moir\'e superlattices display a two-domain phase on each layer. We show that the octupolar moments $M_{33}^+$ and $M_{33}^-$ are significant in this multi-domain phase at the domain walls. In addition, when $[M_{33}^+,M_{33}^-]$ are represented by the $x$ and $y$ components of a vector, the resultant pattern of these octupole moments winds around the antiferromagnetic domains and forms to vortex crystals which leads to octupolar toroidal moments, $T_{xyz}$ and $T_{z}^{\beta}$. $T_{xyz}$ and $T_{z}^{\beta}$ can give rise to a magnetoelectric effect and gyrotropic birefringence that may provide indirect ways of detecting multi-domain antiferromagnetic order. Our results highlight the importance of higher-order multipole moments for identification of complex spin textures in moir\'e magnets.</description>

      <title>Influence of graphene on the electronic and magnetic properties of an iron(III) porphyrin chloride complex</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although iron-based single atom catalysts are regarded as a promising alternative to precious metal catalysts, their precise electronic structures during catalysis still pose challenges for computational descriptions. A particularly urgent question is the influence of the environment on the electronic structure, and how to describe this properly with computational methods. Here, we study an iron porphyrin chloride complex adsorbed on a graphene sheet using density functional theory calculations to probe how much the electronic structure is influenced by the presence of a graphene layer. Our results indicate that weak interactions due to van der Waals forces dominate between the porphyrin complex and graphene, and only a small amount of charge is transferred between the two entities. Furthermore, the interplay of the ligand field environment, strong $p$ $-$ $d$ hybridization, and correlation effects within the complex are strongly involved in determining the spin state of the iron ion. By bridging molecular chemistry and solid state physics, this study provides first steps towards a joint analysis of the properties of iron-based catalysts from first principles.</description>

      <title>Predicting phase transitions in PbTiO$_3$ using zentropy through quasiharmonic phonon calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18425v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: According to x-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements, PbTiO$_3$ undergoes a phase transition from a tetragonal ferroelectric (FE) phase to a cubic paraelectric phase at 763 K. However, x-ray absorption fine-structure (XAFS) measurements indicate that PbTiO$_3$ is locally tetragonal even after the phase transition. The difference in these results is because XAFS measurements can probe local features of a structure, while XRD averages over such local features. For both measurements to be consistent, PbTiO$_3$ is macroscopically cubic but locally tetragonal after the phase transition. Despite this, most models, such as the Laundau-Ginsburg-Devonshire theory and effective Hamiltonians, are still unable to explain this phenomenon. Moreover, these methods involve model parameters fitted to experimental or theoretical data and do not consider other tetragonal configurations, such as domain walls, to predict the phase transition. In our previous study, we used our zentropy approach to predict the phase transition by considering the tetragonal FE ground-state configuration and the tetragonal 90{\deg} and 180{\deg} domain wall configurations with their total energies at 0 K. In this paper, the Helmholtz energies of the three configurations are obtained from density functional theory calculations through energy-volume curves and phonon calculations. The predicted phase transition temperature using the meta-GGA $r^2\text{SCAN}$ and revised multiplicities of configurations is 716 K, showing good agreement with the experimental value of 763 K.</description>

Abstract: Efficient heuristics have predicted many functional materials such as high-temperature superconducting hydrides, while inorganic structural chemistry explains why and how the crystal structures are stabilized. Here we develop the paired mathematical programming formalism for searching and systematizing the structural prototypes of crystals. The first is the minimization of the volume of the unit cell under the constraints of only the minimum and maximum distances between pairs of atoms. We show the capabilities of linear relaxations of inequality constraints to optimize structures by the steepest-descent method, which is computationally very efficient. The second is the discrete optimization to assign five kinds of geometrical constraints including chemical bonds for pairs of atoms. Under the constraints, the two object functions, formulated as mathematical programming, are alternately optimized to realize the given coordination numbers of atoms. This approach successfully generates a wide variety of crystal structures of oxides such as spinel, pyrochlore-$\alpha$, and $\mathrm{K}_2 \mathrm{NiF}_4$ structures.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Enhanced Electrochemical Simulations for Dendrites Nucleation in Li Metal Battery</title>

Abstract: Uncontrollable dendrites growth during electrochemical cycles leads to low Coulombic efficiency and critical safety issues in Li metal batteries. Hence, a comprehensive understanding of the dendrite formation mechanism is essential for further enhancing the performance of Li metal batteries. Machine learning accelerated molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can provide atomic-scale resolution for various key processes at an ab-initio level accuracy. However, traditional MD simulation tools hardly capture Li electrochemical depositions, due to lack of an electrochemical constant potential (ConstP) condition. In this work, we propose a ConstP approach that combines a machine learning force field with the charge equilibration method to reveal the dynamic process of dendrites nucleation at Li metal anode surfaces. Our simulations show that inhomogeneous Li depositions, following Li aggregations in amorphous inorganic components of solid electrolyte interphases, can initiate dendrites nucleation, accompanied by dead Li cluster formation. Our study provides microscopic insights for Li dendrites formations in Li metal anodes. More importantly, we present an efficient and accurate simulation method for modeling realistic ConstP conditions, which holds considerable potential for broader applications in modeling complex electrochemical interfaces.</description>

      <title>Towards Verifying Exact Conditions for Implementations of Density Functional Approximations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05316v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) is used extensively in the computation of electronic properties of matter, with various applications. Approximating the exchange-correlation (XC) functional is the key to the Kohn-Sham DFT approach, the basis of most DFT calculations. The choice of this density functional approximation (DFA) depends crucially on the particular system under study, which has resulted in the development of hundreds of DFAs. Though the exact density functional is not known, researchers have discovered analytical properties of this exact functional. Furthermore, these exact conditions are used when designing DFAs. We present XCVerifier, the first approach for verifying whether a DFA implementation satisfies the DFT exact conditions. XCVerifier was evaluated on five DFAs from the popular Libxc library and seven exact conditions from recent work. XCVerifier was able to verify or find violations for a majority of the DFA/condition pairs, demonstrating the feasibility of using formal methods to verify DFA implementations.</description>

      <title>Response of any arbitrary initially stressed reference and the stress-free reference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We often determine the constitutive relation for an initially stressed reference using the response of a virtual stress-free reference. However, it is usually difficult to identify the constitutive relation of the associated stress-free reference without conducting destructive tests. In this paper, we introduce three approaches to determine the response of the stress-free, or any arbitrary initially stressed reference, while the response of a particular initially stressed reference is known. The first and third approaches directly find the constitutive relations for one stressed reference from another. The second approach uses the response of a given stressed reference to identify the stress-free material and thereafter determines the response of any stressed reference. Quite interestingly, even though the given (known) initially stressed state is Green elastic, the stress-free material, or the reference in the presence of any other initial stress, may become implicit. We also derive several examples of explicit constitutive relations. The present approaches to changing the reference configuration do not start from a known stress-free state, which is standard practice. The present work also develops the universal relations for stress-free isotropic implicit elastic materials.</description>

Abstract: Most reported negative linear compressibility (NLC) materials exhibit either a small NLC over a large pressure range or a high NLC over a very small pressure range. Here, we report the remarkable discovery of giant NLC in the low-temperature form of CuCN (LT-CuCN) over an unusually large pressure range. High-pressure XRD studies on LT-CuCN observed the NLC of -20.5 TPa-1 along the a-axis at zero pressure, and the ambient orthorhombic phase remained stable up to 9.8 GPa. Pressure and temperature-dependent Raman studies identified the phonon vibrations responsible for NLC and negative thermal expansion (NTE).</description>

      <title>Single-domain imaging in topological insulator Bi2Te3 thin films</title>

Abstract: Single crystalline materials, different from polycrystalline and twinning structures, are desired for investigating the intrinsic physical properties, as grain and twin boundaries often work as a source of artifacts. Bismuth chalcogenides, which are van der Waals materials notable as topological insulators, have attracted significant interest due to their rich physical properties. However, the formation of 60{\deg} twin domains is common in these materials. Here, we demonstrate single-domain bismuth chalcogenides. Using atomic force microscopy, we investigated the morphology of Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3 grown on Al2O3. Despite lattice constants of Bi2Se3 and Al2O3 substrates being well matched with hybrid symmetry epitaxy, Bi2Se3 exhibited 60{\deg} twin boundaries across the surface. Interestingly, Bi2Te3 showed a single-domain feature across the 10 mm by 10 mm sample even with lattice mismatch. While further in-depth studies are required to understand this difference in the morphology between Bi2Se3/Al2O3 and Bi2Te3/Al2O3, we suggest that the formation of twin boundaries in bismuth chalcogenides is related to the interaction between quintuple layers across the van der Waals gap rather than strain or defects.</description>

      <title>Transverse Bending Mimicry of Longitudinal Piezoelectricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of frequently observed ultrahigh electric-induced longitudinal strain, ranging from 1% to 26%, remains an open question. Recent evidence suggests that this phenomenon is linked to the bending deformation of samples, but the mechanisms driving this bending and the strong dependence of nominal strain on sample thickness have yet to be fully understood. Here, we demonstrate that the bending in piezoceramics can be induced by non-zero gradient of d31 acrcoss thickness direction. Our calculations show that in standard perovskite piezoceramics, such as KNbO3, a 0.69% concentration of oxygen vacancies results in a 6.3 pC/N change in d31 by inhibiting polarization rotation, which is sufficient to produce ultrahigh nominal strain in thin samples. The gradients of defect concentration, composition, and stress can all cause sufficient inhomogeneity in the distribution of d31, leading to the bending effect. We propose several approaches to distinguish true electric-induced strain from bending-induced effects. Our work provides clarity on the origin of nominal ultrahigh electricinduced strain and offers valuable insights for advancing piezoelectric materials.</description>

      <title>Interplay of superexchange and vibronic effects in the hidden order of Ba$_2$MgReO$_6$ from first principles</title>

Abstract: The origin of the "hidden" quadrupolar and unconventional magnetic low-temperature orders observed in the spin-orbit double perovskite Ba$_2$MgReO$_6$ defies explanation through standard experimental and theoretical techniques. Here we address this problem by deriving and solving an ab initio low-temperature effective Hamiltonian including inter-site electronic exchange and vibronic (electron-lattice) couplings between $J_{eff}=3/2$ Jahn-Teller-active Rhenium states. Our findings disclose the nature of these elusive states, attributing it to intertwined exchange and electron-lattice couplings, thus diverging from the conventional dichotomy of purely electronic or lattice driving mechanisms. Our results indicate the resilience of the quadrupolar hidden order under pressure, yet its rapid suppression under uniaxial strain suggests that external or lattice-induced distortions play a pivotal role in determining the relative stability of competing phases in Ba$_2$MgReO$_6$ and similar $d^1$ double perovskites.</description>

      <title>Complete mathematical theory of the jamming transition</title>

Abstract: The jamming transition of frictionless athermal particles is a paradigm to understand the mechanics of amorphous materials at the atomic scale. Concepts related to the jamming transition and the mechanical response of jammed packings have cross-fertilized into other areas such as atomistic descriptions of the elasticity and plasticity of glasses. In this perspective article, the microscopic mathematical theory of the jamming transition is reviewed from first-principles. The starting point of the derivation is a microscopically-reversible particle-bath Hamiltonian from which the governing equation of motion for the grains under an external deformation is derived. From this equation of motion, microscopic expressions are obtained for both the shear modulus and the viscosity as a function of the distance from the jamming transition (respectively, above and below the transition). Regarding the vanishing of the shear modulus at the unjamming transition, this theory, as originally demonstrated in [Zaccone \&amp; Scossa-Romano, Phys. Rev. B 83, 184205 (2011)], is currently the only quantitative microscopic theory in parameter-free agreement with numerical simulations of [O'Hern et al. Phys. Rev. E 68, 011306 (2003)] for jammed packings. The divergence of the viscosity upon approaching the jamming transition from below is derived here, for the first time, from the same microscopic Hamiltonian. The quantitative microscopic prediction of the diverging viscosity is shown to be in fair agreement with numerical results of sheared 2D soft disks from [Olsson \&amp; Teitel, Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 178001 (2007)].</description>

      <title>Half-Metallicity in Triangulene-based Superatomic Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of two-dimensional (2D) magnets has opened up new possibilities for miniaturizing spintronic devices to the monolayer limit. 2D half-metals, capable of conducting fully spin-polarized currents when spin-orbit coupling is minimal, provide a key advantage in improving device performance. Extensive theoretical research has been carried out to discover 2D half-metals, yet their realization remains elusive. Here we report the bottom-up synthesis of superatomic graphene and the demonstration of its half-metallic properties. The produced graphene half-metal is fabricated through an on-surface synthetic approach with phosphorus-doped triangulene as its building block. Scanning tunneling microscopy measurements reveal its metallic band structures and identify its ferromagnetism through magnon excitation under varying magnetic fields. Density functional theory simulations accurately capture its half-metallic characteristics, uncovering the origin of spin-polarized bands from the p$_x,_y$-like orbital of superatomic graphene. Our work demonstrates intrinsic 2D carbon magnetism, paving the way for harnessing its advantages in spintronics.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal topology of plasmonic spin meron pairs revealed by polarimetric photo-emission microscopy</title>

Abstract: Topology is the study of geometrical properties and spatial relations unaffected by continuous changes, and has become an important tool for understanding complex physical systems. Although recent optical experiments have inferred the existence of vector fields with the topologies of merons, the inability to extract the full three dimensional vectors misses a richer set of topologies that have not yet been fully explored. In our work, we extend the study of the topology of electromagnetic fields on surfaces to a spin quasi-particle with the topology of a meron pair, formed by interfering surface plasmon polaritons, and show that the in-plane vectors are constrained by the embedding topology of the space as dictated by the Poincare-Hopf theorem. In addition we explore the time evolution of the three dimensional topology of the spin field formed by femtosecond laser pulses. These experiments are possible using our here developed method called polarimetric photoemission electron microscopy (polarimetric PEEM) that combines an optical pump-probe technique and polarimetry with photo-emission electron microscopy. This method allows for the accurate generation of surface plasmon polariton fields and their subsequent measurement, revealing both the spatial distribution of the full three-dimensional electromagnetic fields at deep sub-wavelength resolution and their time evolution.</description>
