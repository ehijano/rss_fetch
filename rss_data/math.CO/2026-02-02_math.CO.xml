      <title>On a square packing conjecture of Erd\H{o}s</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f(n)$ be the maximum sum of the sides of non-overlapping squares (or equilateral triangles) packed inside a unit square or (unit equilateral triangle). In this paper, we explore some properties of $f$ and examine how the square and triangle cases are similar. We prove that a conjecture of Erd\H{o}s, which says that $f(k^2+1) = k$ for all $k$, is equivalent to the convergence of the series $\sum_{k\geqslant 1}(f(k^2+1)-k)$. We also explore the case of parallelograms and discuss how that is similar to the case of unit square and triangle.</description>

      <title>Transitive Sets of Mutually Orthogonal Latin Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate MacNeish's conjecture (known to be false in general) in the setting of what we call "transitive" Mutually Orthogonal Latin Squares (MOLS). When we restrict our attention to "simply transitive" MOLS, we find that the conjecture holds. We provide some partial results towards the transitive case, as well as the outcome of a computer search, which introduces a new construction of MOLS. In particular, we were unable to find any transitive large (conjecture-violating) sets of MOLS in the literature.</description>

      <title>Quaternionic Perfect Sequences and Hadamard Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A finite sequence of numbers is perfect if it has zero periodic autocorrelation after a nontrivial cyclic shift. In this work, we study quaternionic perfect sequences having a one-to-one correspondence with the binary sequences arising in Williamson's construction of quaternion-type Hadamard matrices. Using this correspondence, we devise an enumeration algorithm that is significantly faster than previously used algorithms and does not require the sequences to be symmetric. We implement our algorithm and use it to enumerate all circulant and possibly non-symmetric Williamson-type matrices of orders up to 21; previously, the largest order exhaustively enumerated was 13. We prove that when the blocks of a quaternion-type Hadamard matrix are circulant, the blocks are necessarily pairwise amicable. This dramatically improves the filtering power of our algorithm: in order 20, the number of block pairs needing consideration is reduced by a factor of over 25,000. We use our results to construct quaternionic Hadamard matrices of interest in quantum communication and prove they are not equivalent to those constructed by other means. We also study the properties of quaternionic Hadamard matrices analytically, and demonstrate the feasibility of characterizing quaternionic Hadamard matrices with a fixed pattern of entries. These results indicate a richer set of properties and suggest an abundance of quaternionic Hadamard matrices for sufficiently large orders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $H$ be a multiplicatively written monoid with identity $1_H$ and let $\mathcal{P}_{\text{fin},1}(H)$ denote the reduced finitary power monoid of $H$, that is, the monoid consisting of all finite subsets of $H$ containing $1_H$ with set multiplication as operation. Building on work of Tringali and Yan, we give a complete description of pairs of commutative and cancellative monoids $H,K$ for which $\mathcal{P}_{\text{fin},1}(H)$ and $\mathcal{P}_{\text{fin},1}(K)$ are isomorphic.</description>

      <title>Periods of Ehrhart coefficients of rational polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{P} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n}$ be a polytope whose vertices have rational coordinates. By a seminal result of E. Ehrhart, the number of integer lattice points in the $k$th dilate of $\mathcal{P}$ ($k$ a positive integer) is a quasi-polynomial function of $k$ -- that is, a "polynomial" in which the coefficients are themselves periodic functions of $k$. It is an open problem to determine which quasi-polynomials are the Ehrhart quasi-polynomials of rational polytopes. As partial progress on this problem, we construct families of polytopes in which the periods of the coefficient functions take on various prescribed values.</description>

      <title>Bipartite Graphs Are Not Well-Ordered by Bipartite Minors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In "Bipartite minors," Chudnovsky etal. introduced the bipartite minor relation, a partial order on the set of bipartite graphs somewhat analogous the minor relation on general graphs and asked whether it is a well-order. We answer this question negatively by giving an infinite set of $2$-connected bipartite graphs that are pairwise incomparable with respect to the bipartite minor relation. We additionally give two sets of infinitely many pairs of bipartite graphs: one set of pairs $G,H$ such that $H$ is a bipartite minor, but not a minor, of $G$, and one set of pairs $G,H$ such that $H$ is a minor, but not a bipartite minor, of $G$.</description>

      <title>Series-Parallel and Planar Graphs for Efficient Broadcasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The broadcasting problem concerns the efficient dissemination of information in graphs. In classical broadcasting, a single originator vertex initially has a message to be transmitted to all vertices. Every vertex which has received the message informs at most one uninformed neighbor at each discrete time unit. In this paper, we introduce infinite families of series-parallel graphs with efficient broadcast times: graphs on $n$ vertices with broadcast time at most $\lceil\log_2 n \rceil + 1$ for any $n$, graphs on $n$ vertices with broadcast time $\lfloor \frac{3 \lceil \log_2 n \rceil}{2} \rfloor$ and maximum degree $\lceil \log_2 n \rceil - 1$ for any $n$, and broadcast graphs on up to $2^{k-1} + 2^{\lfloor \frac{k}{2} \rfloor }$ vertices with broadcast time $k$ for any $k$. We also introduce an infinite family of planar broadcast graphs on up to $2^{k-1} + 2^{\lfloor \frac{3k}{4} \rfloor - 1}$ vertices with broadcast time $k$ for any $k$, which improves the known lower bound on the maximum number of vertices in a planar broadcast graph.</description>

      <title>The Total Chromatic Quasisymmetric Functions of a Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and study two variants of the chromatic quasisymmetric function of a graph: the total chromatic quasisymmetric function via vertex labeling and via acyclic orientations. The original definition of the chromatic quasisymmetric function of a graph by Shareshian and Wachs depends on a labeling of the vertices of the graph, which directly affects the properties of the coefficients appearing in the decomposition of the chromatic quasisymmetric function of a graph into different bases. Motivated by this, we construct the first variant of the chromatic quasisymmetric function of a graph by normalizing it with respect to all the labelings of the vertices. The second variant is motivated by the \emph{tree isomorphism conjecture} and is constructed in terms of acyclic orientations.
  We investigate the properties of the coefficients in the expansion in the monomial quasisymmetric basis for both variants and provide a comparative analysis. Furthermore, we derive explicit formulas for the coefficients in the monomial decomposition of the two variants for the star graph. For the labeling-based variant, these coefficients arise from a binomial identity for which we provide a combinatorial proof.</description>

      <title>On graphs with girth at least five achieving Steffen's edge coloring bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vizing and Gupta showed that the chromatic index $\chi'(G)$ of a graph $G$ is bounded above by $\Delta(G) + \mu(G)$, where $\Delta(G)$ and $\mu(G)$ denote the maximum degree and the maximum multiplicity of $G$, respectively. Steffen refined this bound, proving that $\chi'(G) \leq \Delta(G) + \left\lceil \mu(G)/\left\lfloor g(G)/2 \right\rfloor \right\rceil$, where $g(G)$ is the girth of the graph $G$. A {\it ring graph} is a graph obtained from a cycle by duplicating some edges. The equality in Steffen's bound is achieved by ring graphs of the form $\mu C_g$, obtained from an odd cycle $C_g$ by duplicating each edge $\mu$ times. We answer two questions posed by Stiebitz et al. regarding the characterization of graphs which achieve Steffen's bound. In particular, we show that if $G$ is a critical graph which achieves Steffen's bound with $g(G)\geq 5$ and $\chi'(G)\geq \Delta+2$, then $G$ must be a ring graph of odd girth.</description>

      <title>Semi-Autonomous Mathematics Discovery with Gemini: A Case Study on the Erd\H{o}s Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a case study in semi-autonomous mathematics discovery, using Gemini to systematically evaluate 700 conjectures labeled 'Open' in Bloom's Erd\H{o}s Problems database. We employ a hybrid methodology: AI-driven natural language verification to narrow the search space, followed by human expert evaluation to gauge correctness and novelty. We address 13 problems that were marked 'Open' in the database: 5 through seemingly novel autonomous solutions, and 8 through identification of previous solutions in the existing literature. Our findings suggest that the 'Open' status of the problems was through obscurity rather than difficulty. We also identify and discuss issues arising in applying AI to math conjectures at scale, highlighting the difficulty of literature identification and the risk of ''subconscious plagiarism'' by AI. We reflect on the takeaways from AI-assisted efforts on the Erd\H{o}s Problems.</description>

      <title>Multisets of finite intervals and a universal category of poset representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For any finite totally ordered set, the multisets of intervals form an abelian category. Various classes of subcategories admit natural combinatorial descriptions, and counting them yields familiar integer sequences. Surprisingly, in some cases new integer sequences arise. The formulation of this counting problem leads to a universal construction which assigns to any poset a finitely cocomplete additive category; it is abelian when the poset is finite and does not depend on the choice of any ring of coefficients. For a general poset the universal category of representations is abelian if and only if for the lattice of ideals the meet of two compact elements is again compact.</description>

      <title>The two-nest ants process on triangle-series-parallel graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ants process is a stochastic process introduced by Kious, Mailler and Schapira as a model for the phenomenon of ants finding shortest paths between their nest and a source of food (seen as two marked nodes in a finite graph), with no other means of communications besides the pheromones they lay behind them as they explore their environment. The ants process relies on a reinforcement learning mechanism. In this paper, we modify the ants process by having more than one ants nest (and still one source of food). For technical reasons, we restrict ourselves to the case when there are two nests, and when the graph is a triangle between the two nests and the source of food, whose edges have been replaced by series-parallel graphs. In this setting, using stochastic approximation techniques, comparison with P\'olya urns, and combinatorial arguments, we are able to prove that the ants process converges and to describe its limit.</description>

      <title>Poset modules of the $0$-Hecke algebras of type $B$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2001, Chow developed the theory of the $B_n$ posets $P$ and the type $B$ $P$-partition enumerators $K^B_P$. To provide a representation-theoretic interpretation of $K^B_P$, we define the poset modules $M^B_P$ of the 0-Hecke algebra $H_n^B(0)$ of type $B$ by endowing the set of type-$B$ linear extensions of $P$ with an $H_n^B(0)$-action. We then show that the Grothendieck group of the category associated to type-$B$ poset modules is isomorphic to the space of type $B$ quasisymmetric functions as both a $\mathrm{QSym}$-module and comodule, where $\mathrm{QSym}$ denotes the Hopf algebra of quasisymmetric functions. Considering an equivalence relation on $B_n$ posets, where two posets are equivalent if they share the same set of type-$B$ linear extensions, we identify a natural representative of each equivalence class, which we call a distinguished poset. We further characterize the distinguished posets whose sets of type-$B$ linear extensions form intervals in the right weak Bruhat order on the the hyperoctahedral groups. Finally, we discuss the relationship among the categories associated to type-$B$ weak Bruhat interval modules, $B_n$ poset modules, and finite-dimensional $H_n^B(0)$-modules.</description>

      <title>The Coxeter Flag Variety</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.23111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a Coxeter element $c$ in a Weyl group $W$, we define the $c$-Coxeter flag variety $\operatorname{CFl}_c\subset G/B$ as the union of left-translated Richardson varieties $w^{-1}X^{wc}_w$. This is a complex of toric varieties whose geometry is governed by the lattice $\operatorname{NC}(W,c)$ of $c$-noncrossing partitions. We show that $\operatorname{CFl}_c$ is the common vanishing locus of the generalized Pl\"ucker coordinates indexed by $W\setminus\operatorname{NC}(W,c)$. We also construct an explicit affine paving of $\operatorname{CFl}_c$ and identify the $T$-weights of each cell in terms of $c$-clusters. This paving gives a GKM description of $H^\bullet(\operatorname{CFl}_c)$ and $H^\bullet_{T_{ad}}(\operatorname{CFl}_c)$ in terms of the induced Cayley subgraph on $\operatorname{NC}(W,c)$, and we show these rings are naturally isomorphic for different choices of $c$. In type $\mathrm{A}$, this recovers the quasisymmetric flag variety for a special $c$, and for general $c$ we show the cohomology ring has a presentation as permuted quasisymmetric coinvariants.</description>

      <title>Tilings in quasi-random $k$-partite hypergraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.10539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given $k\ge 2$ and two $k$-graphs ($k$-uniform hypergraphs) $F$ and $H$, an $F$-factor in $H$ is a set of vertex disjoint copies of $F$ that together cover the vertex set of $H$. Lenz and Mubayi were first to study the $F$-factor problems in quasi-random $k$-graphs with a minimum degree condition. Recently, Ding, Han, Sun, Wang and Zhou gave the density threshold for having all $3$-partite $3$-graphs factors in quasi-random $3$-graphs with vanishing minimum codegree condition $\Omega(n)$.
  In this paper, we consider embedding factors when the host $k$-graph is $k$-partite and quasi-random with partite minimum codegree condition. We prove that if $p&gt;1/2$ and $F$ is a $k$-partite $k$-graph with each part having $m$ vertices, then for $n$ large enough and $m\mid n$, any $p$-dense $k$-partite $k$-graph with each part having $n$ vertices and partite minimum codegree condition $\Omega(n)$ contains an $F$-factor. We also present a construction showing that $1/2$ is best possible. Furthermore, for $1\leq \ell \leq k-2$, by constructing a sequence of $p$-dense $k$-partite $k$-graphs with partite minimum $\ell$-degree $\Omega(n^{k-\ell})$ having no $K_k(m)$-factor, we show that the partite minimum codegree constraint can not be replaced by other partite minimum degree conditions. On the other hand, we prove that $n/2$ is the asymptotic partite minimum codegree threshold for having all fixed $k$-partite $k$-graph factors in sufficiently large host $k$-partite $k$-graphs even without quasi-randomness.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of minimal transversals of hypergraphs of bounded VC-dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00694v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of enumerating all minimal transversals (also called minimal hitting sets) of a hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$. An equivalent formulation of this problem known as the \emph{transversal hypergraph} problem (or \emph{hypergraph dualization} problem) is to decide, given two hypergraphs, whether one corresponds to the set of minimal transversals of the other. The existence of a polynomial time algorithm to solve this problem is a long standing open question. In \cite{fredman_complexity_1996}, the authors present the first sub-exponential algorithm to solve the transversal hypergraph problem which runs in quasi-polynomial time, making it unlikely that the problem is (co)NP-complete.
  In this paper, we show that when one of the two hypergraphs is of bounded VC-dimension, the transversal hypergraph problem can be solved in polynomial time, or equivalently that if $\mathcal{H}$ is a hypergraph of bounded VC-dimension, then there exists an incremental polynomial time algorithm to enumerate its minimal transversals. This result generalizes most of the previously known polynomial cases in the literature since they almost all consider classes of hypergraphs of bounded VC-dimension. As a consequence, the hypergraph transversal problem is solvable in polynomial time for any class of hypergraphs closed under partial subhypergraphs. We also show that the proposed algorithm runs in quasi-polynomial time in general hypergraphs and runs in polynomial time if the conformality of the hypergraph is bounded, which is one of the few known polynomial cases where the VC-dimension is unbounded.</description>

      <title>Zarankiewicz bounds from distal regularity lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13695v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since K\H{o}v\'ari, S\'os, and Tur\'an proved upper bounds for the Zarankiewicz problem in 1954, much work has been undertaken to improve these bounds, and some have done so by restricting to particular classes of graphs. In 2017, Fox, Pach, Sheffer, Suk, and Zahl proved better bounds for semialgebraic binary relations, and this work was extended by Do in the following year to arbitrary semialgebraic relations. In this paper, we show that Zarankiewicz bounds in the shape of Do's are enjoyed by all relations satisfying the distal regularity lemma, an improved version of the Szemer\'edi regularity lemma satisfied by relations definable in distal structures (a vast generalisation of o-minimal structures).</description>

      <title>Generalized ovals, 2.5-dimensional additive codes, and multispreads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present constructions and bounds for additive codes over a finite field in terms of their geometric counterpart, i.e., projective systems. It is known that the maximum number of $(h-1)$-spaces in PG$(2,q)$, such that no hyperplane contains three, is given by $q^h+1$ if $q$ is odd. Those geometric objects are called generalized ovals. We show that cardinality $q^h+2$ is possible if we decrease the dimension a bit. We completely determine the minimum possible lengths of additive codes over GF$(9)$ of dimension $2.5$ and give improved constructions for other small parameters, including codes outperforming the best linear codes. As an application, we consider multispreads in PG$(4,q)$, in particular, completing the characterization of parameters of GF$(4)$-linear $64$-ary one-weight codes.

      <description>arXiv:2512.11504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we relate the location of the complex zeros of the reliability polynomial to parameters at which a certain family of rational functions derived from the reliability polynomial exhibits chaotic behaviour. We use this connection to prove new results about the location of reliability zeros. In particular we show that there are zeros with modulus larger than $1$ with essentially any possible argument. We moreover use this connection to show that approximately evaluating the reliability polynomial for planar graphs at a non-positive algebraic number in the unit disk is #P-hard.</description>

      <title>Ehrhart quasi-polynomials via Barnes polynomials and discrete moments of parallelepipeds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give novel and explicit formulas for the Ehrhart quasi-polynomials of rational simple polytopes, in terms of Barnes polynomials and discrete moments of half-open parallelepipeds. These formulas also hold for all positive dilations of a rational polytope. There is an interesting appearance of an extra complex z-parameter, which seems to allow for more compact formulations. We also give similar formulas for discrete moments of rational polytopes, and their positive dilates, objects known in the literature as sums of polynomials over a polytope. The appearance of the Barnes polynomials and the Barnes numbers allow for explicit computations. From this work, it is clear that the complexity of computing Ehrhart quasi-polynomials lies mainly in the computation of various discrete moments of parallelepipeds. These discrete moments are in general summed over a particular lattice flow on a compact torus, defined in this paper. Some of the consequences involve novel vanishing identities for rational polytopes. As another consequence, we obtain a differential equation for discrete moments of rational polytopes, which extends the work of Eva Linke. For smooth polytopes, we obtain novel and much simpler formulations of Ehrhart polynomials, discrete moments, and vanishing identities that may be of independent interest from the perspective of Barnes polynomials and Barnes numbers. These formulations show the utility of Barnes polynomials in geometric combinatorics, due to their very rich structure that extends the 1-dimensional Bernoulli polynomials.</description>

      <title>Some Families of Type $B$ Set Partitions Counted by the Dowling Numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study type $B$ set partitions without zero block.
  Certain classes of these partitions, such as merging-free and separated
  partitions (enumerated by the Dowling numbers), are investigated.
  We show that these classes are in bijection with type $B$ set partitions.
  The intersection of these two classes is also studied, and we prove that their block-generating polynomials
  are real-rooted.
  Finally, we study the descent statistics on the class of permutations obtained by flattening type $B$ merging-free partitions. Using the valley-hopping action,
  we prove the Gamma-positivity of the descent
  distribution and provide a combinatorial interpretation of the Gamma-coefficients.
  We also show that the descent statistic is homomesic under valley-hopping.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish that every set of $k=10$ natural numbers determines at least $30$ distinct pairwise sums or at least $30$ distinct pairwise products, as well as the analogous result for $k=11$ and at least $34$ sums/products, with sharpness exhibited by $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18\}$ and $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 24\}$, respectively. This extends previous work of the fifth author with Clevenger, Havard, Heard, Lott, and Wilson, which established the corresponding thresholds for $k\leq 9$. Included is a classification result for sets of $10$ real numbers (resp. positive real numbers) determining at most $29$ pairwise sums (resp. pairwise products) that do not contain $8$ elements of any single arithmetic progression (resp. geometric progression), as well as some observations controlling additive quadruples in small subsets of two-dimensional generalized geometric progressions.</description>

      <title>The Partition-Frequency Enumeration Matrix</title>

      <description>arXiv:2102.04191v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a calculus that gives an elementary approach to enumerate partition-like objects using an infinite upper-triangular number-theoretic matrix. We call this matrix the Partition-Frequency Enumeration (PFE) matrix. This matrix unifies a large number of results connecting number-theoretic functions to partition-type functions. The calculus is extended to arbitrary generating functions, and functions with Weierstrass products. As a by-product, we recover (and extend) some well-known recurrence relations for many number-theoretic functions, including the sum of divisors function, Ramanujan's $\tau$ function, sums of squares and triangular numbers, and for $\zeta(2n)$, where $n$ is a positive integer. These include classical results due to Euler, Ewell, Ramanujan, Lehmer and others. As one application, we embed Ramanujan's famous congruences $p(5n+4)\equiv 0$ (mod $5)$ and $\tau(5n+5)\equiv 0$ (mod $5)$ into an infinite family of such congruences.</description>

Abstract: We formulate a series of conjectures on the stable tensor product of irreducible representations of symmetric groups, which are closely related to the reduced Kronecker coefficients. These conjectures are certain generalizations of Okounkov's conjecture on the log-concavity of the Littlewood--Richardson coefficients and the Schur log-concavity theorem of Lam--Postnikov--Pylyavskyy. We prove our conjectures in some special cases and discuss some implications of these conjectures.</description>

      <title>Amending the Lonely Runner Spectrum Conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.10417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $||x||$ be the absolute distance from $x$ to the nearest integer. For a set of distinct positive integral speeds $v_1, \ldots, v_n$, we define its maximum loneliness, also known as the gap $\delta$, to be
  $$ML(v_1,\ldots,v_n) = \max_{t \in \mathbb{R}}\min_{1 \leq i \leq n} || tv_i||.$$
  The Loneliness Spectrum Conjecture, recently proposed by Kravitz (2021), asserts that
  $$\exists s \in \mathbb{N}, \text{ML}(v_1,\ldots,v_n) = \frac{s} {sn + 1} \text{ or } \text{ML}(v_1,\ldots,v_n) \geq \frac{1}{n}.
  $$
  We disprove the Loneliness Spectrum Conjecture for $n = 4$ with an infinite family of counterexamples and propose an alternative conjecture. We confirm the amended conjecture for $n = 4$ whenever there exists a pair of speeds with a common factor of at least $3$ and also prove some related results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03855v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many systems of interest in cryptography consist of equations of the same degree. Under the assumption that the degree of regularity is finite, we prove upper bounds on the degree of regularity of a system of equations of the same degree, with or without adding the field equations to the system. The bounds translate into upper bounds on the solving degree of the systems, and hence on the complexity of solving them via Gr\"obner bases methods. Our bounds depend on the number of equations in the system, the number of variables, and the degree of the equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07744v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum adiabatic optimization has long been expected to outperform classical methods in solving NP-type problems. While this has been proven in certain experiments, its main applications still reside in academic problems where the size of the system to be solved would not represent an obstacle to any modern desktop computer. Here we develop a systematic procedure to find the global optima of the modularity function to discover community structure in complex networks solely relying on pure annealers rather than hybrid solutions. We bypass the one-hot encoding constraints by hierarchically and recursively encoding binary instances of the problem that can be solved without the need to guess the exact penalties for the Lagrange multipliers. We study the variability, and robustness of the annealing process as a function of network size, directness of connections, topology, and the resolution of the communities. We show how our approach produces meaningful and at least equally optimal solutions to state-of-the-art community detection algorithms while maintaining tractable computing times. Lastly, due to its recursive nature, the annealing process returns intermediate subdivisions thus offering interpretable rather than black-box solutions. These \textit{dendrograms} can be used to unveil normal and pathological hidden hierarchies in brain networks hence opening the door to clinical workflows. Overall, this represents a first step towards an applicable practice-oriented usage of pure quantum annealing potentially bridging two segregated communities in modern science and engineering; that of network science and quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08258v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main motivation for this article is to explore the connections between the existence of certain combinatorial patterns (as in van der Corputs's theorem on arithmetic progressions of length $3$) with well-known tools and theorems for definable groups in simple theories. In the last sections of this article, we apply our model-theoretic results to bound the number of initial points starting few arithmetic progression of length $3$ in the structure of the additive group of integers with a predicate for the prime integers, assuming Dickson's conjecture, or with a predicate for the square-free integers, as well as for asymptotic limits of finite fields. Our techniques yield similar results for the elements appearing as distances in skew-corners and for S\'ark\"ozy's theorem on the distance of distinct elements being perfect squares.</description>

Abstract: Lusztig varieties are subvarieties in flag manifolds $G/B$ associated to an element $w$ in the Weyl group $W$ and an element $x$ in $G$, introduced in Lusztig's papers on character sheaves. We study the geometry of these varieties when $x$ is regular semisimple.
  In the first part, we establish that they are normal, Cohen-Macaulay, of pure expected dimension and have rational singularities. We then show that the cohomology of ample line bundles vanishes in positive degrees, in arbitrary characteristic. This extends to nef line bundles when the base field has characteristic zero or sufficiently large characteristic. Along the way, we prove that Lusztig varieties are Frobenius split in positive characteristic and that their open cells are affine. We also prove that the open cells in Deligne-Lusztig varieties are affine, settling a question that has been open since the foundational paper of Deligne and Lusztig.
  In the second part, we explore their relationship with regular semisimple Hessenberg varieties. Both varieties admit Tymoczko's dot action of $W$ on their (intersection) cohomology. We associate to each element $w$ in $W$ a Hessenberg space using the tangent cone of the Schubert variety associated with $w$, and show that the cohomology of the associated regular semisimple Lusztig varieties and Hessenberg varieties is isomorphic as graded $W$-representations when they are smooth.
  This relationship extends to the level of varieties: we construct a flat degeneration of regular semisimple Lusztig varieties to regular semisimple Hessenberg varieties. In particular, this proves a conjecture of Abreu and Nigro on the homeomorphism types of regular semisimple Lusztig varieties in type $A$, and generalizes it to arbitrary Lie types.</description>

Abstract: Volume polynomials form a distinguished class of log-concave polynomials with remarkable analytic and combinatorial properties. I will survey realization problems related to them, review fundamental inequalities they satisfy, and discuss applications to the combinatorics of algebraic matroids. These notes are based on lectures given at the 2025 Summer Research Institute in Algebraic Geometry at Colorado State University.</description>
