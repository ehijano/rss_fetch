      <title>Operator algebras over the p-adic integers - II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue the study of operator algebras over the $p$-adic integers, initiated in our previous work [1]. In this sequel, we develop further structural results and provide new families of examples. We introduce the notion of $p$-adic von Neumann algebras, and analyze those with trivial center, that we call ''factors''. In particular we show that ICC groups provide examples of factors. We then establish a characterization of $p$-simplicity for groupoid operator algebras, showing its relation to effectiveness and minimality. A central part of the paper is devoted to a $p$-adic analogue of the GNS construction, leading to a representation theorem for Banach $^*$-algebras over $\mathbb{Z}_p$. As applications, we exhibit large classes of $p$-adic operator algebras, including residually finite-rank algebras and affinoid algebras with the spectral norm. Finally, we investigate the $K$-theory of $p$-adic operator algebras, including the computation of homotopy analytic $K$-theory of continuous $\mathbb{Z}_p$-valued functions on a compact Hausdorff space and the analytic (non-homotopy invariant) $K$-theory of certain $p$-adically complete Banach algebras in terms of continuous $K$-theory. Together, these results extend the foundations of the emerging theory of $p$-adic operator algebras.</description>

      <title>Vanishing of Topological Invariants For Unnormalized Schatten $p$ multiplicative Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A result of Dadarlat shows that nonzero even rational cohomology obstructs the matricial stability of many discrete groups. In the author's previous work, 2-cohomology is used to argue that certain groups are not stable in unnormalized Schatten $p$-norms for $p &gt; 1$, although 2-cohomology is known not to obstruct stability in the unnormalized 2-norm in general. The main result of this paper demonstrates that we should not expect $2k$ cohomology to obstruct in the unnormalized Schatten $p$-norm for $p\ge k$, because the invariant in Dadarlat's argument vanishes for maps that are asymptotically multiplicative in the Schatten $p$-norm.</description>

      <title>A Riesz-Fredholm type theorem on certain Hilbert C*-modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $C$ be compact modular operator on a Hilbert C*-module $E$ satisfying property $\mathbb{[H]}$ [{\it J. Math. Phys.} {\bf 49} (2008), 033519], and let $ L :=I-C$. We prove the existence of a unique natural number $r$ for which $L^r$ is an EP operator on $E$. Moreover, we show that the kernel of $L^r$ is a finitely generated submodule of $E$ and that $E$ admits the decomposition $E=Ker(L^r) \oplus Ran(L^r)$. These results provide a framework for analyzing the solvability of the equation $x-Cx=f$ on $E$.</description>

      <title>The type I dichotomy for two-step nilpotent locally compact groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the type I dichotomy for two-step nilpotent locally compact groups. Invoking work of Baggett-Kleppner, we characterize the closed points of the unitary dual of such a group $G$ purely in terms of the group structure. An algebraic criterion characterizing when $G$ is a type I group is derived. We show that this criterion automatically holds if $G$ is a central extension of vector groups over a non-discrete locally compact field $k$ such that the commutator map is $k$-bilinear. As an application, we show that the unipotent radicals of minimal parabolics in simple algebraic groups of $k$-rank one are type I groups. We also discuss the type I dichotomy for $p$-torsion contraction groups, and exhibit, for each prime $p$, uncountably many pairwise non-isomorphic such groups that are not type I. This answers a recently posed question by the second author. Finally, we adapt a recent construction of Chirvasitu to obtain numerous examples of two-step nilpotent torsion locally compact groups that are not type I, but that embed as closed cocompact normal subgroups in two-step nilpotent groups that are type I.</description>

      <title>Topological full groups arising from Cuntz and Cuntz-Toeplitz algebras and their crossed products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05145v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the topological full groups arising from the Cuntz and Cuntz-Toeplitz algebras and their crossed products with the Cartan subalgebras of Cuntz and Cuntz-Toeplitz algebras. We study the normal subgroups and abelianization of these groups and completely determine the KMS states of the reduced crossed products with respect to some canonical gauge actions.</description>

      <title>A new characterization of (pre)liminary C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an arbitrary countable ordinal $\alpha $, we introduce the notion of type $I_{\alpha }$ C*-algebra and $\alpha $-subhomogeneous C*-algebra. When $\alpha =0$, these recover the notions of Fell C*-algebra and of commutative C*-algebra, respectively. When $\alpha = n &lt;\omega $, these recover the notions of type $I_{n}$ C*-algebra and of $n$-subhomogeneous C*-algebra, respectively. We prove that a separable C*-algebra is liminary if and only if it is type $I_{\alpha }$ for some $\alpha &lt;\omega _{1}$, and it is preliminary (i.e., has no infinite-dimensional irreducible representation) if and only if it is $\alpha $-subhomogeneous for some $\alpha &lt;\omega _{1}$ . We also prove that for any countable ordinal $\alpha $ there exists a separable C*-algebra that is type $I_{\alpha }$ and not type $I_{\beta }$ for $\beta &lt;\alpha $, and a separable C*-algebra that is $\alpha $-subhomogeneous and not $\beta $-subhomogeneous for any $\beta &lt;\alpha $.</description>
