      <title>Necessary and sufficient conditions for high dimensional Central Limit Theorem under moment conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High dimensional central limit theorems (the CLTs) have been extensively studied in recent years under a variety of sufficient moment conditions connecting the dimension growth rate with the tail decay rate. In this article, we investigate whether the existing moment conditions are also necessary under the independence of the components. We consider four exhaustive classes, viz. when underlying random variables (I) have all polynomial moments, (II) have some polynomial moment of order higher than two, (III) have only second moment but no polynomial moment higher than two exists, and (IV) have infinite second moment, but belong to the domain of attraction of normal distribution. We find the optimal growth rate of the dimension with respect to sample size in the high dimensional CLTs over hyper-rectangles. More precisely, we derive necessary and sufficient moment conditions for the validity of the the CLT over hyper-rectangles in each of the four regimes listed above, showing that the CLT may hold under much weaker conditions compared to those considered in the existing literature.</description>

      <title>Revisiting De Moivre-Laplace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the proof of the de Moivre--Laplace theorem, which is the ancestor of the central limit theorem for the binomial distribution. Our goal is to provide a proof that can be reasonably presented to undergraduate students within a basic course of probability theory. We follow the strategies presented in two classical references, the books of Breiman and Feller, but we replace the arguments involving series expansions of the logarithm or the exponential by the basic inequality $\exp(t)\geq 1+t$. This way we avoid completely the use of uniform convergence and power series. We also avoid using Stirling's formula, instead we use the exact formula for the Wallis integral. As a by product of the proof, we also obtain a non-asymptotic inequality linking the binomial and the Gaussian distributions.</description>

      <title>On the duality between consensus problems and Markov processes, with application to delay systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider consensus of multi-agent systems as a dual problem to Markov processes. Based on an exchange of relevant notions and results between the two fields, we present a uniform framework which admits the introduction and treatment of time delays in a common setting. We study both information propagation and information processing delays, and for each case derive conditions for reaching consensus and calculate the consensus value.</description>

      <title>Limit theorems for critical branching processes in an extremely unfavorable random environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\{Z_{m},m\geq 0\}$ be a critical branching process in random environment and $\{S_{m},m\geq 0\}$ be its associated random walk. Assuming that the increments distribution of the associated random walk belongs without centering to the domain of attraction of an $\alpha $-stable law we prove conditional limit theorems describing, as $n\rightarrow \infty $, the distribution the number of particles in the process $\{Z_{m},0\leq m\leq n\}$ given $Z_{n}&gt;0$ and $S_{n}\leq const$.</description>

      <title>Exact Recovery in the Geometric SBM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Community detection is the problem of identifying dense communities in networks. Motivated by transitive behavior in social networks ("thy friend is my friend"), an emerging line of work considers spatially-embedded networks, which inherently produce graphs containing many triangles. In this paper, we consider the problem of exact label recovery in the Geometric Stochastic Block Model (GSBM), a model proposed by Baccelli and Sankararaman as the spatially-embedded analogue of the well-studied Stochastic Block Model. Under mild technical assumptions, we completely characterize the information-theoretic threshold for exact recovery, generalizing the earlier work of Gaudio, Niu, and Wei.</description>

      <title>Fast mixing in Ising models with a negative spectral outlier via Gaussian approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the mixing time of Glauber dynamics for Ising models in which the interaction matrix contains a single negative spectral outlier. This class includes the anti-ferromagnetic Curie-Weiss model, the anti-ferromagnetic Ising model on expander graphs, and the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with disorder of negative mean. Existing approaches to rapid mixing rely crucially on log-concavity or spectral width bounds and therefore can break down in the presence of a negative outlier.
  To address this difficulty, we develop a new covariance approximation method based on Gaussian approximation. This method is implemented via an iterative application of Stein's method to quadratic tilts of sums of bounded random variables, which may be of independent interest. The resulting analysis provides an operator-norm control of the full correlation structure under arbitrary external fields. Combined with the localization schemes of Eldan and Chen, these estimates lead to a modified logarithmic Sobolev inequality and near-optimal mixing time bounds in regimes where spectral width bounds fail. As a complementary result, we prove exponential lower bounds on the mixing time for low temperature anti-ferromagnetic Ising models on sparse Erd\"os-R\'enyi graphs, based on the existence of gapped states as in the recent work of Sellke.</description>

      <title>Submartingale Condition for Weak Convergence for Semi-Markov Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a modified version of a well-known submartingale condition fortheweak convergence of probabilitymeasures, adapted to the semi-Markov case. In this setting, it is convenient to work with an embedded Markov chain and the filtration generated by jump times. We demonstrate that a straightforward restatement of the classical result is not valid, and that an additional condition is required.</description>

      <title>Discrete Feynman-Kac approximation for parabolic Anderson model using random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a natively positive approximation method based on the Feynman-Kac representation using random walks, to approximate the solution to the one-dimensional parabolic Anderson model of Skorokhod type, with either a flat or a Dirac delta initial condition. Assuming the driving noise is a fractional Brownian sheet with Hurst parameters $H \geq \frac{1}{2}$ and $H_* \geq \frac{1}{2}$ in time and space, respectively, we also provide an error analysis of the proposed method. The error in $L^p (\Omega)$ norm is of order \[ O \big(h^{\frac{1}{2}[(2H + H_* - 1) \wedge 1] - \epsilon}\big), \] where $h &gt; 0$ is the step size in time (resp. $\sqrt{h}$ in space), and $\epsilon &gt; 0$ can be chosen arbitrarily small. This error order matches the H\"older continuity of the solution in time with a correction order $\epsilon$, making it `almost' optimal. Furthermore, these results provide a quantitative framework for convergence of the partition function of directed polymers in Gaussian environments to the parabolic Anderson model.</description>

      <title>Convergence rates for the $p$-Wasserstein distance of the empirical measures of an ergodic Markov process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X:=(X_t)_{t\geq 0}$ be an ergodic Markov process on $\real^d$, and $p&gt;0$. We derive upper bounds of the $p$-Wasserstein distance between the invariant measure and the empirical measures of the Markov process $X$. For this we assume, e.g.\ that the transition semigroup of $X$ is exponentially contractive in terms of the $1$-Wasserstein distance, or that the iterated Poincar\'e inequality holds together with certain moment conditions on the invariant measure. Typical examples include diffusions and underdamped Langevin dynamics.</description>

      <title>Infinite divisibility of $\alpha$-Cauchy and related variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the infinite divisibility of the $\alpha$-Cauchy variable $\mathcal{C}_\alpha$, $\alpha &gt; 1$. The distribution of $\mathcal{C}_2$ is the well-known Cauchy distribution, which is infinitely divisible and even stable. But when $\alpha \neq 2$, there is no known result on the infinite divisibility of $\mathcal{C}_\alpha$. In this paper, we prove that $\mathcal{C}_\alpha$ is infinitely divisible if $1 &lt; \alpha \leq 6/5$, and we give some sufficient conditions for $|\mathcal{C}_\alpha|^p, \, p\in \mathbb{R},$ to be infinitely divisible, which partially answers the open questions raised by Yano, Yano and Yor in 2009. In the proofs, a class of positive random variables having moments of Gamma type plays an important role, and we investigate the conditions for their existence.</description>

Abstract: By the Pr\'ekopa-Leindler inequality, the difference $X-X'$ has a log-concave density provided that $X$ has a log-concave density and $X, X'$ are independent and identically distributed. We prove that the opposite direction does not always hold true by giving an explicit example.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of Replica-symmetric Saddle Point for Ising Perceptron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the replica-symmetric saddle point equations for the Ising perceptron with Gaussian disorder and margin $\kappa\ge 0$. We prove that for each $\kappa\ge 0$ there is a critical capacity $\alpha_c(\kappa)=\frac{2}{\pi\,\mathbb E[(\kappa-Z)_+^2]}$, where $Z$ is a standard normal and $(x)_+=\max\{x,0\}$, such that the saddle point equation has a unique solution for $\alpha\in(0,\alpha_c(\kappa))$ and has no solution when $\alpha\ge \alpha_c(\kappa)$. When $\alpha\uparrow \alpha_c(\kappa)$ and $\kappa&gt;0$, the replica-symmetric free energy at this solution diverges to $-\infty$. In the zero-margin case $\kappa=0$, Ding and Sun obtained a conditional uniqueness result, with one step verified numerically. Our argument gives a fully analytic proof without computer assistance. We used GPT-5 to help develop intermediate proof steps and to perform sanity-check computations.</description>

      <title>Average-weight percolation on the complete graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attach to each edge of the complete graph on $n$ vertices, i.i.d. exponential random variables with mean $n$. Aldous [1] proved that the longest path with average weight below $p$ undergoes a phase transition at $p=\frac{1}{e}$: it is $o(n)$ when $p&lt;\frac{1}{e}$ and of order $n$ if $p&gt;\frac1e$. Later, Ding [4] revealed a finer phase transition around $\frac{1}{e}$: there exist $c'&gt;c&gt;0$ such that the length of the longest path is of order $\ln^3 n$ if $ p \le \frac{1}{e}+\frac{c}{\ln^2 n}$ and is polynomial if $p\ge \frac{1}{e}+\frac{c'}{\ln^2 n}$. We identify the location of this phase transition and obtain sharp asymptotics of the length near criticality. The proof uses an exploration mechanism mimicking a branching random walk with selection introduced by Brunet and Derrida [3].</description>

Abstract: Under nondegeneracy assumptions on the diffusion coefficients, we establish the derivative formulae of Bismut-Elworthy-Li's type for forward-backward stochastic differential equations with respect to Poisson random measure using the lent particle method created by Bouleau and Denis, which is not given before. Applying this formula, the existence and uniqueness of a solution of nonlocal quasi-linear integral partial differential equations, which are differentiable with respect to the space variable, are obtained, even if the initial datum and coefficients of this equation are not.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study nonlinear wave equations perturbed by transport noise acting either on the displacement or on the velocity. Such noise models random advection and, under suitable scaling of space covariance, may generate an effective dissipative term. We establish well-posedness in both cases and analyse the associated scaling limits. When the noise acts on the displacement, the system preserves its original structure and converges to the deterministic nonlinear wave equation, whereas if it acts on the velocity, the rescaled dynamics produce an additional Laplacian damping term, leading to a stochastic derivation of a Westervelt-type acoustic model.</description>

      <title>On a Class of Partitions with Lower Expected Star Discrepancy and Its Upper Bound than Jittered Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the expected star discrepancy under a newly designed class of convex equivolume partition models. The main contributions are two-fold. First, we establish a strong partition principle for the star discrepancy, showing that our newly designed partitions yield stratified sampling point sets with lower expected star discrepancy than both classical jittered sampling and simple random sampling. Specifically, we prove that $\mathbb{E}(D^{*}_{N}(Z))\leq\mathbb{E}(D^{*}_{N}(Y))&lt;\mathbb{E}(D^{*}_{N}(X))$, where $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ represent simple random sampling, jittered sampling, and our new partition sampling, respectively. Second, we derive explicit upper bounds for the expected star discrepancy under our partition models, which improve upon existing bounds for jittered sampling. Our results resolve Open Question 2 posed in Kiderlen and Pausinger (2021) regarding the strong partition principle for star discrepancy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Backward stochastic Volterra integral equation driven by G-Brownian motion (G-BSVIE). By adopting a different backward iteration method, we construct the approximating sequences on each local interval. With the help of G-stochastic analysis techniques and the monotone convergence theorem, the existence, uniqueness, and continuity of the solution over the entire interval are established. Moreover, we derive the comparison theorem.</description>

      <title>Spectral norm of matrices with independent entries up to polyloglog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the expectation of the operator norm of the random matrix (a_{ij} X_{ij}) for i,j &lt;= n, under the assumption that the random variables (X_{ij}) are independent, symmetric and satisfy the moment growth condition ||X_{ij}||{2p} &lt;= C ||X_{ij}||{p} for every p &gt;= 1. We derive an upper bound expressed in terms of quantities that can be explicitly computed in many cases. This bound implies a two-sided estimate, up to a factor given by a power of an iterated logarithm. This factor is considerably smaller than the natural scale of the problem. Our result thus provides positive evidence supporting a conjecture formulated by Rafal Latala and Jan Swiatkowski.</description>

Abstract: The quantum internet is a rapidly developing technological reality, yet, it remains unclear what kind of quantum network structures might emerge. Since indirect quantum communication is already feasible and preserves absolute security of the communication channel, a new node joining the quantum network does not need to connect directly to its desired target. Instead, in our proposed quantum preferential attachment model, it uniformly randomly connects to any node within the proximity of the target, including, but not restricted to, the target itself. This local flexibility is found to qualitatively change the global network behavior, leading to two distinct classes of complex network architectures, both of which are small-world, but neither of which is scale-free. Our numerical findings are supported by rigorous analytic results, in a framework that incorporates quantum and classical variants of preferential attachment in a unified phase diagram. Besides quantum networks, we expect that our results will have broad implications for classical scenarios where there is flexibility in establishing new connections.</description>

      <title>The Stochastic Six Vertex model and discrete Orthogonal Polynomial ensembles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic growth models in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class exhibit remarkable fluctuation phenomena. While a variety of powerful methods have led to a detailed understanding of their typical fluctuations or large deviations, much less is known about behavior on intermediate, or moderate deviation, scales. Addressing this problem requires refined asymptotic control of the integrable structures underlying KPZ models.
  Motivated by this perspective, we study multiplicative statistics of discrete orthogonal polynomial ensembles (dOPEs) in different scaling regimes, with a particular focus on applications to tail probabilities of the height function in the stochastic six-vertex model. For a large class of dOPEs, we obtain robust singular asymptotic estimates for multiplicative statistics critically scaled near a saturated-to-band transition. These asymptotics exhibit universal crossover behavior, interpolating between Airy, Painlev\'e XXXIV, and Bessel-type regimes. Our proofs employ the Riemann-Hilbert Problem (RHP) approach to obtain asymptotics for the correlation kernel of a deformed version of the dOPE across the critical scaling windows. These asymptotics are then used on a double integral formula relating this kernel to partition function ratios, which may be of independent interest. At the technical level, the RHP analysis requires a novel parameter-dependent local parametrix, which needs a separate asymptotic analysis of its own.
  Using these results, together with a known identity relating a Laplace-type transform of the stochastic six-vertex model height function to a multiplicative statistic of the Meixner point process, we derive moderate deviation estimates for the height function in both the upper and lower tail regimes, with sharp exponents and constants.</description>

      <title>Infinitesimal moments in free and c-free probability and Motzkin paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infinitesimal moments associated with infinitesimal freeness and infinitesimal conditional freeness are studied. For free random variables, we consider continuous deformations of moment functionals associated with Motzkin paths $w$, which provide a decomposition of their moments, and we compute their derivatives at zero. We show that the first-order derivative of each functional vanishes unless the path has exactly one local maximum. Geometrically, this means that $w$ is a pyramid path, which is consistent with the characteristic formula for alternating moments of infinitesimally free centered random variables. In this framework, infinitesimal Boolean independence is also obtained and it corresponds to flat paths. A similar approach is developed for infinitesimal conditional freeness, for which we show that the only moment functionals that have a non-zero first-order derivative are associated with concatenations of a pyramid path and a flat path. This charaterization leads to a Leibniz-type definition of infinitesimal conditional freeness at the level of moments.</description>

      <title>Global Martingale Entropy Solutions to the Stochastic Isentropic Euler Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the existence and compactness of global martingale entropy solutions with finite relative-energy for the stochastically forced system of isentropic Euler equations governed by a general pressure law. To achieve these, a stochastic compensated compactness framework in $L^p$ is developed to overcome the difficulty that the uniform $L^{\infty}$ bound for the stochastic approximate solutions is unavailable, owing to the stochastic forcing term. The convergence of the vanishing viscosity method is established by employing the stochastic compactness framework, along with careful uniform estimates of the stochastic approximate solutions, to obtain the existence of global martingale entropy solutions with finite relative-energy. In particular, in the polytropic pressure case for all adiabatic exponents, we prove that the global solutions satisfy the local mechanical energy inequality when the initial data are only required to have finite relative-energy (while the higher moment estimates for entropy are not required here, as needed in the earlier work). Higher-order relative energy estimates for approximate solutions are also derived to establish the entropy inequality for more convex entropy pairs and to then prove the compactness of solutions to the stochastic isentropic Euler system. The stochastic compensated compactness framework and the uniform estimate techniques for approximate solutions developed in this paper should be useful in the study of other similar problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study standing waves for the Anderson-Gross-Pitaevskii equation in dimension 1 and 2. The Anderson-Gross-Pitaevskii equation is a nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a confining potential and a multiplicative spatial white noise. Standing waves are characterized by a profile which is invariant by the dynamic and solves a nonlinear elliptic equation with spatial white noise potential. We construct such solutions via variational methods and obtain some results on their regularity, localization and stability.</description>

      <title>Generalised Entanglement Entropies from Unit-Invariant Singular Value Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce generalisations of von Neumann entanglement entropy that are invariant with respect to certain scale transformations. These constructions are based on Unit-Invariant Singular Value Decomposition (UISVD) with its right-, left-, and bi-invariant incarnations, which itself are variations of the standard Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) that remain invariant under (appropriate set of) diagonal transformations. These measures are naturally defined for non-Hermitian or rectangular operators and remain useful when the input and output spaces possess different dimensions or metric weights. We apply the UISVD entropy and discuss its advantages in the physically interesting framework of Biorthogonal Quantum Mechanics, whose important aspect is indeed the behavior under scale transformations. Further, we illustrate features of UISVD-based entropies in other representative settings, from simple quantum mechanical bipartite states to random matrices relevant to quantum chaos and holography, and in the context of Chern-Simons theory. In all cases, the UISVD yields stable, physically meaningful entropic spectra that are invariant under rescalings and normalisations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lambda Value-at-Risk (Lambda$-VaR) is a generalization of the Value-at-Risk (VaR), which has been actively studied in quantitative finance. Over the past two decades, the Expected Shortfall (ES) has become one of the most important risk measures alongside VaR because of its various desirable properties in the practice of optimization, risk management, and financial regulation. Analogously to the intimate relation between ES and VaR, we introduce the Lambda Expected Shortfall (Lambda-ES), as a generalization of ES and a counterpart to Lambda-VaR. Our definition of Lambda-ES has an explicit formula and many convenient properties, and we show that it is the smallest quasi-convex and law-invariant risk measure dominating Lambda-VaR under mild assumptions. We examine further properties of Lambda-ES, its dual representation, and related optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Graph Limits via Quotients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new notion of limits of weighted directed graphs of growing size based on convergence of their random quotients. These limits are specified in terms of random exchangeable measures on the unit square. We call our limits grapheurs and show that these are dual to graphons in a precise sense. Grapheurs are well-suited to modeling hubs and connections between them in large graphs; previous notions of graph limits based on subgraph densities fail to adequately model such global structures as subgraphs are inherently local. Using our framework, we present an edge-based sampling approach for testing properties pertaining to hubs in large graphs. This method relies on an edge-based analog of the Szemer\'edi regularity lemma, whereby we show that sampling a small number of edges from a large graph approximately preserves its quotients. Finally, we observe that the random quotients of a graph are related to each other by equipartitions, and we conclude with a characterization of such random graph models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear covariance (LinCov) techniques have gained widespread traction in the modeling of uncertainty, including in the preliminary study of spacecraft navigation performance. While LinCov methods offer improved computational efficiency compared to Monte Carlo based uncertainty analysis, they inherently rely on linearization approximations. Understanding the fidelity of these approximations and identifying when they are deficient is critically important for spacecraft navigation and mission planning, especially when dealing with highly nonlinear systems and large state uncertainties. This work presents a number of computational techniques for assessing linear covariance performance. These new LinCov fidelity measures are formulated using higher-order statistics, constrained optimization, and the unscented transform.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the five-vertex model on a rectangular domain of the square lattice, with the so-called `scalar-product' boundary conditions. We address the evaluation of the free-energy density of the model in the scaling limit, that is when the number of sites is sent to infinity and the mesh of the lattice to zero, while keeping the size of the domain constant. To this aim, we reformulate the partition function of the model in terms of a discrete log-gas, and study its behaviour in the thermodynamic limit. We reproduce previous results, obtained by using a differential equation approach. Moreover, we provide the explicit form of the resolvent in all possible regimes. This work is preliminary to further studies of limit shape phenomena in the model.</description>

      <title>A new adaptive two-layer model for opinion spread in hypergraphs: parameter sensitivity and estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When opinion spread is studied, peer pressure is often modeled by interactions of more than two individuals (higher-order interactions). In our work, we introduce a two-layer random hypergraph model, in which hyperedges represent households and workplaces. Within this overlapping, adaptive structure, individuals react if their opinion is in majority in their groups. The process evolves through random steps: individuals can either change their opinion, or quit their workplace and join another one in which their opinion belongs to the majority. Based on computer simulations, our first goal is to describe the effect of the parameters responsible for the probability of changing opinion and quitting workplace on the homophily and speed of polarization. We also analyze the model as a Markov chain, and study the frequency of the absorbing states. Then, we quantitatively compare how different statistical and machine learning methods, in particular, linear regression, xgboost and a convolutional neural network perform for estimating these probabilities, based on partial information from the process, for example, the distribution of opinion configurations within households and workplaces. Among other observations, we conclude that all methods can achieve the best results under appropriate circumstances, and that the amount of information that is necessary to provide good results depends on the strength of the peer pressure effect.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Whittle--Mat\'ern fields and sparse spatial extremes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intrinsic Gaussian fields are used in many areas of statistics as models for spatial or spatio-temporal dependence, or as priors for latent variables. However, there are two major gaps in the literature: first, the number and flexibility of existing intrinsic models are very limited; second, theory, fast inference, and software are currently underdeveloped for intrinsic fields. We tackle these challenges by introducing the new flexible class of intrinsic Whittle--Mat\'ern Gaussian random fields obtained as the solution to a stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE). Exploiting sparsity resulting from finite-element approximations, we develop fast estimation and simulation methods for these models. We demonstrate the benefits of this intrinsic SPDE approach for the important task of kriging under extrapolation settings. Leveraging the connection of intrinsic fields to spatial extreme value processes, we translate our theory to an SPDE approach for Brown--Resnick processes for sparse modeling of spatial extreme events. This new paradigm paves the way for efficient inference in unprecedented dimensions. To demonstrate the wide applicability of our new methodology, we apply it in two very different areas: a longitudinal study of renal function data, and the modeling of marine heat waves using high-resolution sea surface temperature data.</description>

      <title>On the Brown measure of $x + i y$, with $x,y$ selfadjoint and $y$ free Poisson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $x,y$ be freely independent selfadjoint elements in a $W^{*}$-probability space, where $y$ has free Poisson distribution of parameter $p$. We pursue a methodology for computing the absolutely continuous part of the Brown measure of $x + i y$, which relies on the matrix-valued subordination function $\Omega$ of the Hermitization of $x + i y$, and on the fact that $\Omega$ has an explicitly described left inverse $H$. Our main point is that the Brown measure of $x + i y$ becomes more approachable when it is reparametrized via a certain change of variable $h : \mathcal{D} \to \mathcal{M}$, with $\mathcal{D}, \mathcal{M}$ open subsets of $\mathbb{C}$, where $\mathcal{D}$ and $h$ are defined in terms of the aforementioned left inverse $H$, and $\mathrm{cl} \,(\mathcal{M})$ contains the support of the Brown measure. More precisely, we find (with some conditions on the distribution of $x$, which have to be imposed for certain values of the parameter $p$) the following formula: \[ f(s + i \, t) =\frac{1}{4\pi}\left[\frac{2}{t}\left(\frac{\partial \alpha}{\partial s} +\frac{\partial \beta}{\partial t}\right)-\frac{2}{t}-\frac{2\beta}{t^2}\right], \ \ s + i \, t \in \mathcal{M}, \] where $f$ is the density of the absolutely continuous part of the Brown measure and the functions $\alpha, \beta : \mathcal{M} \to \mathbb{R}$ are the real and respectively the imaginary part of $h^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Sub-Poissonian estimates for exponential moments of additive functionals over pairs of particles with respect to determinantal and symplectic Pfaffian point processes governed by entire functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this note is to estimate the tail of the distribution of the number of particles in an interval under determinantal and Pfaffian point processes. The main result of the note is that the square of the number of particles under the determinantal point process whose correlation kernel is an entire function of finite order has sub-Poissonian tails. The same result also holds in the symplectic Pfaffian case. As a corollary, sub-Poissonian estimates are also obtained for exponential moments of additive functionals over pairs of particles.</description>

      <title>Time-inhomogeneous random walks on finite groups and cokernels of random integer block matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11435v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study time-inhomogeneous random walks on finite groups in the case where each random walk step need not be supported on a generating set of the group. When the supports of the random walk steps satisfy a natural condition involving normal subgroups of quotients of the group, we show that the random walk converges to the uniform distribution on the group and give bounds for the convergence rate using spectral properties of the random walk steps. As an application, we use the moment method of Wood to prove a universality theorem for cokernels of random integer matrices allowing some dependence between entries.</description>

      <title>On a connection between total positivity and Bernoulli stopping problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07103v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a discrete-time optimal selection problem where one observes a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials and receives a nonnegative reward upon stopping on a success. The aim is to find a single-choice strategy that maximises the expected payoff. These Bernoulli stopping problems are characterised by two key properties: (i) a recurrence relation connecting the reward sequence to the continuation payoff sequence, and (ii) the total positivity of the Markov chain embedded in success epochs of the trials. The recurrence is fundamental in proving the optimality of the myopic strategy under unimodal continuation payoff sequence, while the total positivity ensures that the expectation of a quasi-unimodal function of the chain remains quasi-unimodal with respect to the initial state. In particular, if the number of successes is finite almost surely, the quasi-unimodality of the reward sequence is sufficient for the myopic rule to be optimal. Illustrative examples are given in various last-success settings.</description>

      <title>Concentration via metastable mixing, with applications to the supercritical exponential random graph model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Folklore belief holds that metastable wells in low-temperature statistical mechanics models exhibit high-temperature behavior. We make this rigorous in the exponential random graph model (ERGM) through the lens of concentration of measure. We make use of the supercritical (low-temperature) metastable mixing which was recently proven by Bresler, Nagaraj, and Nichani, and obtain a novel concentration inequality for Lipschitz observables of the ERGM in a large metastable well, answering a question posed by those authors. To achieve this, we prove a new connectivity property for metastable mixing in the ERGM and introduce a new general result yielding concentration inequalities, which extends a result of Chatterjee. We also use a result of Barbour, Brightwell, and Luczak to cover all cases of interest. Our work extends a result of Ganguly and Nam from the subcritical (high-temperature) regime to metastable wells, and we also extend applications of this concentration, namely a central limit theorem for small subcollections of edges and a bound on the Wasserstein distance between the ERGM and the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph. Finally, to supplement the mathematical content of the article, we present a simulation study of metastable wells in the supercritical ERGM.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of distributions via record-like observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterise probability distributions via a martingale property associated with a natural generalisation of record values, known as $\delta$-records. For an independent and identically distributed sequence $(X_n)$ with running maximum $M_n$, let $N_n$ be the number of $\delta$-records (those $X_k$ with $X_k&gt;M_{k-1}+\delta$). We determine distributions for which $N_n-cM_n$ is a martingale, and show that this property uniquely determines the underlying distribution within broad classes.
  We show that the problem can be reformulated in terms of a delay-integrated Cauchy functional equation. A distinctive feature of this equation is that it is required to hold on a set that depends on the unknown distribution itself, which both complicates the analysis and allows for a rich variety of solutions.
  A complete characterisation is obtained when $\delta&lt;0$. For $\delta&gt;0$, all solutions with bounded support are identified. In the case of $\delta&gt;0$ and unbounded support, we consider both continuous and lattice distributions. In the continuous case, the characterisation reduces to a delay differential equation, which admits classical exponential-type solutions as well as broader families, including mixtures of exponential and gamma distributions. An analogous discrete analysis leads to difference equations whose solutions include mixtures of geometric and negative binomial distributions. In particular, this yields a new characterisation of the geometric distribution based on weak records.</description>

      <title>Scaling Limit of Dependent Random Walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a generalized Bernoulli process (GBP) was developed as a stationary binary sequence that can have long-range dependence. In this paper, we find the scaling limit of a random walk that follows GBP. The result is a new class of non-Markovian diffusion processes. The limiting processes include continuous-time stochastic processes with stationary increments whose correlation decays with an exponential rate, a power law, or an exponentially tempered power law. The limit densities solve a time tempered fractional diffusion equation or time fractional diffusion equation. The second-family of Mittag-Leffler distribution and exponential distribution arise as special cases of the limiting distributions. Subordinated processes are considered as time-changed L\'evy processes, and the governing equations and dependence structure of the subordinated processes are discussed.</description>

      <title>Non-exchangeable mean-field theory for adaptive weights: propagation of dissociatedness and graphon sampling lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13587v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a mean-field theory for large, non-exchangeable particle (agent) systems where the states and interaction weights co-evolve in a coupled system of SDEs. A first main result is the establishment of the propagation of dissociatedness, a conceptual generalization of the classical propagation of chaos that accommodates the intrinsic local correlations between particles and their weights. The limiting McKean-Vlasov process is characterized by an Aldous-Hoover representation on a filtered probability space, beyond the standard one-particle law (or a family thereof). Paralleling the classical equivalence between propagation of chaos and the convergence of empirical measures to the one-particle law, we show that the propagation of dissociatedness corresponds to the convergence of the empirical structure under a distance unifying the Wasserstein distance for particles and the cut distance for weights. This quantitative stability is grounded in an adaptation of the sampling lemma from dense graph theory, analogous to the classical concentration results for empirical measures in the Wasserstein distance.</description>

      <title>Quantitative central limit theorems for exponential random graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ferromagnetic exponential random graph models (ERGMs) are nonlinear exponential tilts of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi models, under which the presence of certain subgraphs such as triangles may be emphasized. These models are mixtures of metastable wells which each behave macroscopically like new Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi models themselves, exhibiting the same laws of large numbers for the overall edge count as well as all subgraph counts. However, the microscopic fluctuations of these quantities remained elusive for some time. Building on a recent breakthrough by Fang, Liu, Shao and Zhao [FLSZ24] driven by Stein's method, we prove quantitative central limit theorems (CLTs) for these quantities and more in metastable wells under ferromagnetic ERGMs. One main novelty of our results is that they apply also in the supercritical (low temperature) regime of parameters, which has previously been relatively unexplored. To accomplish this, we develop a novel probabilistic technique based on the careful analysis of the evolution of relevant quantities under the ERGM Glauber dynamics. Our technique allows us to deliver the main input to the method developed by [FLSZ24], which is the fact that the fluctuations of subgraph counts are driven by those of the overall edge count. This was first shown for the triangle count by Sambale and Sinulis [SS20] in the Dobrushin (very high temperature) regime via functional-analytic methods. We feel our technique clarifies the underlying mechanisms at play, and it also supplies improved bounds on the Wasserstein and Kolmogorov distances between the observables at hand and the limiting Gaussians, as compared to the results of [FLSZ24] in the subcritical (high temperature) regime beyond the Dobrushin regime. Moreover, our technique is flexible enough to also yield quantitative CLTs for vertex degrees and local subgraph counts, which have not appeared before in any parameter regime.</description>

Abstract: We study a general class of nonlinear Ginzburg-Landau SPDEs in infinite volume under weak nonlinearity scaling and with non-equilibrium initial data. We derive the KPZ equation as a continuum limit of these equations. This makes rigorous the original derivation of the KPZ equation from physics in the full-space setting, which was a problem posed by Hairer-Quastel '18. Our analysis is based on a stochastic heat kernel for a linearization of said SPDEs.</description>

Abstract: For a class of time inhomogenous distribution dependent birth-death processes, we derive the well-posedness, $\mathbb{W}_p$-estimate, exponential ergodicity, and uniform in time propagation of chaos. These extend the corresponding results derived for distribution dependent SDEs and mean field particle systems. As preparation, a criterion on the well-posedness of inhomogenous jump process is presented in the end of the paper, which should be interesting by itself.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article introduces a novel construction of the two-dimensional fractional Brownian motion (2D fBm) with dependent components. Unlike similar models discussed in the literature, our approach uniquely accommodates the full range of model parameters and explicitly incorporates cross-dependencies and anisotropic scaling through a matrix-valued Hurst operator. We thoroughly analyze the theoretical properties of the proposed causal and well-balanced 2D fBm versions, deriving their auto- and cross-covariance structures in both time and frequency domains. In particular, we present the power spectral density of these processes and their increments. Our analytical findings are validated with numerical simulations. This work provides a comprehensive framework for modeling anomalous diffusion phenomena in multidimensional systems where component interdependencies are crucial.</description>

Abstract: In 2020, F.

In this paper we extend the allowed generators to transpositions and any diagonal elements, and characterise completely the set of representations from which the spectral gap arises. This settles a conjecture posed in Cesi's paper.</description>

Abstract: We study a Markov chain with very different mixing rates depending on how mixing is measured. The chain is the "Burnside process on the hypercube $C_2^n$." Started at the all-zeros state, it mixes in a bounded number of steps, no matter how large $n$ is, in $\ell^1$ and in $\ell^2$. And started at general $x$, it mixes in at most $\log n$ steps in $\ell^1$. But, in $\ell^2$, it takes $\frac{n}{\log n}$ steps for most starting $x$. The $\ell^2$ mixing results follow from an explicit diagonalization of the Markov chain into binomial-coefficient-valued eigenvectors.</description>

Abstract: We prove the a.e. nonamenability of locally finite quasi-pmp Borel graphs whose every component admits at least three nonvanishing ends with respect to the underlying Radon--Nikodym cocycle. We witness their nonamenability by constructing Borel subforests with at least three nonvanishing ends per component, and then applying Tserunyan and Tucker-Drob's recent characterization of amenability for acyclic quasi-pmp Borel graphs. Our main technique is a weighted cycle-cutting algorithm, which yields a weight-maximal spanning forest. We also introduce a random version of this forest, which generalizes the Free Minimal Spanning Forest, to capture nonunimodularity in the context of percolation theory.</description>

      <title>Connecting classical finite exchangeability to quantum theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03869v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exchangeability is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics. It allows to model situations where the order of observations does not matter. The classical de Finetti's theorem provides a representation of infinitely exchangeable sequences of random variables as mixtures of independent and identically distributed variables. The quantum de Finetti theorem extends this result to symmetric quantum states on tensor product Hilbert spaces. It is well known that both theorems do not hold for finitely exchangeable sequences. The aim of this work is to investigate two lesser-known representation theorems, which were developed in classical probability theory to extend de Finetti's theorem to finitely exchangeable sequences by using quasi-probabilities and quasi-expectations. With the aid of these theorems, we illustrate how a de Finetti-like representation theorem for finitely exchangeable sequences can be formulated through a mathematical representation which is formally equivalent to quantum theory (with boson-symmetric density matrices). We then show a promising application of this connection to the challenge of defining entanglement for indistinguishable bosons.</description>

      <title>Gaussian entropic optimal transport: Schr\"odinger bridges and the Sinkhorn algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18432v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entropic optimal transport problems are regularized versions of optimal transport problems. These models play an increasingly important role in machine learning and generative modelling. For finite spaces, these problems are commonly solved using Sinkhorn algorithm (a.k.a. iterative proportional fitting procedure). However, in more general settings the Sinkhorn iterations are based on nonlinear conditional/conjugate transformations and exact finite-dimensional solutions cannot be computed.
  This article presents a finite-dimensional recursive formulation of the iterative proportional fitting procedure for general Gaussian multivariate models. As expected, this recursive formulation is closely related to the celebrated Kalman filter and related Riccati matrix difference equations, and it yields algorithms that can be implemented in practical settings without further approximations. We extend this filtering methodology to develop a refined and self-contained convergence analysis of Gaussian Sinkhorn algorithms, including closed form expressions of entropic transport maps and Schr\"odinger bridges.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the entropic regularizations of optimal transport problems under suitable summability assumptions on the point-wise transport cost. These summability assumptions already appear in the literature. However, we show that the weakest compactness conditions that can be derived are already enough to obtain the convergence of the regularized functionals. This approach allows us to characterize the variational limit of the regularization even when it does not converge to the original problem. The results apply also to problems with more than two marginals.</description>

      <title>Computational Lower Bounds for Correlated Random Graphs via Algorithmic Contiguity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09832v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, assuming the low-degree conjecture, we provide evidence of computational hardness for two problems: (1) the (partial) matching recovery problem in the sparse correlated Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs $\mathcal G(n,q;\rho)$ when the edge-density $q=n^{-1+o(1)}$ and the correlation $\rho&lt;\sqrt{\alpha}$ lies below the Otter's threshold, this resolves a remaining problem in \cite{DDL23+}; (2) the detection problem between a pair of correlated sparse stochastic block models $\mathcal S(n,\tfrac{\lambda}{n};k,\epsilon;s)$ and a pair of independent stochastic block models $\mathcal S(n,\tfrac{\lambda s}{n};k,\epsilon)$ when $\epsilon^2 \lambda s&lt;1$ lies below the Kesten-Stigum (KS) threshold and $s&lt;\sqrt{\alpha}$ lies below the Otter's threshold, this resolves a remaining problem in \cite{CDGL24+}.
  One of the main ingredient in our proof is to derive certain forms of \emph{algorithmic contiguity} between two probability measures based on bounds on their low-degree advantage. To be more precise, consider the high-dimensional hypothesis testing problem between two probability measures $\mathbb{P}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$ based on the sample $\mathsf Y$. We show that if the low-degree advantage $\mathsf{Adv}_{\leq D} \big( \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbb{P}}{\mathrm{d}\mathbb{Q}} \big)=O(1)$, then (assuming the low-degree conjecture) there is no efficient algorithm $\mathcal A$ such that $\mathbb{Q}(\mathcal A(\mathsf Y)=0)=1-o(1)$ and $\mathbb{P}(\mathcal A(\mathsf Y)=1)=\Omega(1)$. This framework provides a useful tool for performing reductions between different inference tasks, without requiring a strengthened version of the low-degree conjecture as in \cite{MW23+, DHSS25+}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12037v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find the information geometry of tempered stable processes. Beginning with the derivation of $\alpha$-divergence between two tempered stable processes, we obtain the corresponding Fisher information matrices and the $\alpha$-connections on their statistical manifolds. Furthermore, we explore statistical applications of this geometric framework. Various tempered stable processes such as generalized tempered stable processes, classical tempered stable processes, and rapidly-decreasing tempered stable processes are presented as illustrative examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the linear-quadratic control problem for a class of non-exchangeable mean-field systems, which model large populations of heterogeneous interacting agents. We explicitly characterize the optimal control in terms of a new infinite-dimensional system of Riccati equations, for which we establish existence and uniqueness. To illustrate our results, we apply this framework to a systemic risk model involving heterogeneous banks, demonstrating the impact of agent heterogeneity on optimal risk mitigation strategies.</description>

      <title>A Lanczos-Based Algorithmic Approach for Spike Detection in Large Sample Covariance Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new approach for estimating the number of spikes in a general class of spiked covariance models without directly computing the eigenvalues of the sample covariance matrix. This approach is based on the Lanczos algorithm and the asymptotic properties of the associated Jacobi matrix and its Cholesky factorization. A key aspect of the analysis is interpreting the eigenvector spectral distribution as a perturbation of its asymptotic counterpart. The specific exponential-type asymptotics of the Jacobi matrix enables an efficient approximation of the Stieltjes transform of the asymptotic spectral distribution via a finite continued fraction. As a consequence, we also obtain estimates for the density of the asymptotic distribution and the location of outliers. We provide consistency guarantees for our proposed estimators, proving their convergence in the high-dimensional regime. We demonstrate that, when applied to standard spiked covariance models, our approach outperforms existing methods in computational efficiency and runtime, while still maintaining robustness to exotic population covariances.</description>

      <title>Detection and Reconstruction of a Random Hypergraph from Noisy Graph Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a $d$-uniform random hypergraph on $n$ vertices in which hyperedges are included i.i.d.\ so that the average degree in the hypergraph is $n^{\delta+o(1)}$, the projection of such a hypergraph is a graph on the same $n$ vertices where an edge connects two vertices if and only if they belong to a same hyperedge. In this work, we study the inference problem where the observation is a \emph{noisy} version of the graph projection where each edge in the projection is kept with probability $p=n^{-1+\alpha+o(1)}$ and each edge not in the projection is added with probability $q=n^{-1+\beta+o(1)}$. For all constant $d$, we establish sharp thresholds for both detection (distinguishing the noisy projection from an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph with edge density $q$) and reconstruction (estimating the original hypergraph). Notably, our results reveal a \emph{detection-reconstruction gap} phenomenon in this problem. Our work also answers a problem raised in \cite{BGPY25+}.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Tensor-Based Deferral of Gaussian Splitting for Orbit Uncertainty Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate propagation of orbital uncertainty is essential for a range of applications within space domain awareness. Adaptive Gaussian mixture-based approaches offer tractable nonlinear uncertainty propagation through splitting mixands to increase resolution in areas of stronger nonlinearities, as well as by reducing mixands to prevent unnecessary computational effort. Recent work introduced principled heuristics that incorporate information from the system dynamics and initial uncertainty to determine optimal directions for splitting. This paper develops adaptive uncertainty propagation methods based on these robust splitting techniques. A deferred splitting algorithm tightly integrated with higher-order splitting techniques is proposed and shown to offer substantial gains in computational efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Second-order propagation of mixand moments is also seen to improve accuracy while retaining significant computational savings from deferred splitting. Different immediate and deferred splitting methods are compared in four representative test cases, including a low Earth orbit, a geostationary orbit, a Molniya orbit, and a multi-body cislunar orbit.</description>

      <title>Estimating the growth rate of a birth and death process using data from a small sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of estimating the growth rate of a birth and death processes based on the coalescence times of a sample of $n$ individuals has been considered by several authors (\cite{stadler2009incomplete, williams2022life, mitchell2022clonal, Johnson2023}). This problem has applications, for example, to cancer research, when one is interested in determining the growth rate of a clone.
  Recently, \cite{Johnson2023} proposed an analytical method for estimating the growth rate using the theory of coalescent point processes, which has comparable accuracy to more computationally intensive methods when the sample size $n$ is large. We use a similar approach to obtain an estimate of the growth rate that is not based on the assumption that $n$ is large.
  We demonstrate, through simulations using the R package \texttt{cloneRate}, that our estimator of the growth rate performs well in comparison with previous approaches when $n$ is small.</description>

      <title>Divergence-kernel method for linear responses of densities and generative models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the divergence-kernel formula for the linear response of random dynamical systems. Specifically, the pathwise expression is for the parameter-derivative of the marginal or stationary density, not an averaged observable. Our formula works for multiplicative and parameterized noise over any period of time; it does not require hyperbolicity. Then we derive a Monte-Carlo algorithm for linear responses.
  We develop a new framework of generative models, DK-SDE, where the model is a parameterized SDE, that (1) directly uses the KL divergence between the empirical data distribution and the marginal density of the SDE as the training objective, and (2) accommodates parametrizations in both drift and diffusion over a long time span, allowing prior structural knowledge to be incorporated explicitly. The optimization is done by gradient-descent enabled by the divergence-kernel method, which involves only forward processes and therefore substantially reduces memory cost. We demonstrate the new model on a 20-dimensional Lorenz system.</description>

      <title>Persistence-Based Statistics for Detecting Structural Changes in High-Dimensional Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the probabilistic behavior of persistence-based statistics and propose a novel nonparametric framework for detecting structural changes in high-dimensional random point clouds. We establish moment bounds and tightness results for classical persistence statistics-total and maximum persistence-under general distributions, with explicit variance-scaling behavior derived for Gaussian mixture models. Building on these results, we introduce a bounded and normalized statistic based on persistence landscapes combined with the Jensen-Shannon divergence, and we prove its Holder continuity with respect to perturbations of the input point clouds. The resulting measure is stable, scale- and shift-invariant, and well suited for finite-sample nonparametric inference via permutation testing. An illustrative numerical study using dynamic attribute vectors from decentralized governance data demonstrates the practical applicability of the proposed method. Overall, this work provides a statistically rigorous and computationally stable approach to change-point detection in complex, high-dimensional data.</description>

      <title>An alternative approach to well-posedness of McKean-Vlasov equations arising in Consensus-Based Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19446v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we study the mean-field description of Consensus-Based Optimization (CBO), a derivative-free particle optimization method. Such a description is provided by a non-local SDE of McKean-Vlasov type, whose fields lack of global Lipschitz continuity. We propose a novel approach to prove the well-posedness of the mean-field CBO equation based on a truncation argument. The latter is performed through the introduction of a cut-off function, defined on the space of probability measures, acting on the fields. This procedure allows us to study the well-posedness problem in the classical framework of Sznitman. Through this argument, we recover the established result on the existence of strong solutions, and we extend the class of solutions for which pathwise uniqueness holds.</description>
