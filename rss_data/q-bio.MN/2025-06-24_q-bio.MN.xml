      <title>Identifying the sources of noise synergy and redundancy in the feed-forward loop motif</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The propagation of noise through parallel regulatory pathways is a prominent feature of feed-forward loops in genetic networks. Although the contributions of the direct and indirect regulatory pathways of feed-forward loops to output variability have been well characterized, the impact of their joint action arising from their shared input and output remains poorly understood. Here, we identify an additional component of noise that emerges specifically from this convergent nature of the pathways. Using inter-gene correlations, we reveal the regulatory basis of the additional noise and interpret it as synergy or redundancy in noise propagation, depending on whether the combined pathways amplify or suppress fluctuations. This framework not only accounts for previously observed differences in noise behavior across coherent and incoherent feed-forward loops but also provides a generalizable strategy to connect network structure with stochastic gene regulation.</description>

      <title>Single-Cell Proteomic Technologies: Tools in the quest for principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the last decade, proteomic analysis of single cells by mass spectrometry transitioned from an uncertain possibility to a set of robust and rapidly advancing technologies supporting the accurate quantification of thousands of proteins. We review the major drivers of this progress, from establishing feasibility to powerful and increasingly scalable methods. We focus on the tradeoffs and synergies of different technological solutions within a coherent conceptual framework, which projects considerable room both for throughput scaling and for extending the analysis scope to functional protein measurements. We highlight the potential of these technologies to support the development of mechanistic biophysical models and help uncover new principles.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Molecular Moieties through Hierarchical Grad-CAM Graph Explainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01744v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: Virtual Screening (VS) has become an essential tool in drug discovery, enabling the rapid and cost-effective identification of potential bioactive molecules. Among recent advancements, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained prominence for their ability to model complex molecular structures using graph-based representations. However, the integration of explainable methods to elucidate the specific contributions of molecular substructures to biological activity remains a significant challenge. This limitation hampers both the interpretability of predictive models and the rational design of novel therapeutics. Results: We trained 20 GNN models on a dataset of small molecules with the goal of predicting their activity on 20 distinct protein targets from the Kinase family. These classifiers achieved state-of-the-art performance in virtual screening tasks, demonstrating high accuracy and robustness on different targets. Building upon these models, we implemented the Hierarchical Grad-CAM graph Explainer (HGE) framework, enabling an in-depth analysis of the molecular moieties driving protein-ligand binding stabilization. HGE exploits Grad-CAM explanations at the atom, ring, and whole-molecule levels, leveraging the message-passing mechanism to highlight the most relevant chemical moieties. Validation against experimental data from the literature confirmed the ability of the explainer to recognize a molecular pattern of drugs and correctly annotate them to the known target. Conclusion: Our approach may represent a valid support to shorten both the screening and the hit discovery process. Detailed knowledge of the molecular substructures that play a role in the binding process can help the computational chemist to gain insights into the structure optimization, as well as in drug repurposing tasks.</description>

      <title>Interplay between Contractivity and Monotonicity for Reaction Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a new relationship between monotonicity and contractivity and use this connection to describe a new general class of weakly contractive reaction networks. The new class is characterized by the stoichiometry matrix of the reaction network admitting a precise matrix factorization that can be verified computationally. Reaction networks in this class are weakly contractive, implying global convergence to equilibria under appropriate technical conditions. Furthermore, we describe the novel subclass of cross-polytope networks. We also show that our results provide a unified proof of global convergence for several classes of networks previously studied in the literature. The practical relevance of the results is demonstrated by examples from systems biology and signaling pathways.</description>

      <title>Computation of Immediate Neighbours of Monotone Boolean Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Boolean networks constitute relevant mathematical models to study the behaviours of genetic and signalling networks. These networks define regulatory influences between molecular nodes, each being associated to a Boolean variable and a regulatory (local) function specifying its dynamical behaviour depending on its regulators. However, existing data is mostly insufficient to adequately parametrise a model, that is to uniquely define a regulatory function for each node. With the intend to support model parametrisation, this paper presents results on the set of Boolean functions compatible with a given regulatory structure, i.e. the partially ordered set of monotone non-degenerate Boolean functions. More precisely, we present original rules to obtain the direct neighbours of any function of this set. Besides a theoretical interest, presented results will enable the development of more efficient methods for Boolean network synthesis and revision, benefiting from the progressive exploration of the vicinity of regulatory functions.</description>
