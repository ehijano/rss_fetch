      <title>What makes an Ensemble (Un) Interpretable?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensemble models are widely recognized in the ML community for their limited interpretability. For instance, while a single decision tree is considered interpretable, ensembles of trees (e.g., boosted trees) are often treated as black-boxes. Despite this folklore recognition, there remains a lack of rigorous mathematical understanding of what particularly makes an ensemble (un)-interpretable, including how fundamental factors like the (1) *number*, (2) *size*, and (3) *type* of base models influence its interpretability. In this work, we seek to bridge this gap by applying concepts from computational complexity theory to study the challenges of generating explanations for various ensemble configurations. Our analysis uncovers nuanced complexity patterns influenced by various factors. For example, we demonstrate that under standard complexity assumptions like P$\neq$NP, interpreting ensembles remains intractable even when base models are of constant size. Surprisingly, the complexity changes drastically with the number of base models: small ensembles of decision trees are efficiently interpretable, whereas interpreting ensembles with even a constant number of linear models remains intractable. We believe that our findings provide a more robust foundation for understanding the interpretability of ensembles, emphasizing the benefits of examining it through a computational complexity lens.</description>

      <title>Towards universally optimal sorting algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formalize a new paradigm for optimality of algorithms, that generalizes worst-case optimality based only on input-size to problem-dependent parameters including implicit ones. We re-visit some existing sorting algorithms from this perspective, and also present a novel measure of sortedness that leads to an optimal algorithm based on partition sort. This paradigm of measuring efficiency of algorithms looks promising for further interesting applications beyond the existing ones.</description>

      <title>POLARON: Precision-aware On-device Learning and Adaptive Runtime-cONfigurable AI acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing complexity of AI models requires flexible hardware capable of supporting diverse precision formats, particularly for energy-constrained edge platforms. This work presents PARV-CE, a SIMD-enabled, multi-precision MAC engine that performs efficient multiply-accumulate operations using a unified data-path for 4/8/16-bit fixed-point, floating point, and posit formats. The architecture incorporates a layer adaptive precision strategy to align computational accuracy with workload sensitivity, optimizing both performance and energy usage. PARV-CE integrates quantization-aware execution with a reconfigurable SIMD pipeline, enabling high-throughput processing with minimal overhead through hardware-software co-design. The results demonstrate up to 2x improvement in PDP and 3x reduction in resource usage compared to SoTA designs, while retaining accuracy within 1.8% FP32 baseline. The architecture supports both on-device training and inference across a range of workloads, including DNNs, RNNs, RL, and Transformer models. The empirical analysis establish PARVCE incorporated POLARON as a scalable and energy-efficient solution for precision-adaptive AI acceleration at edge.</description>

      <title>Equations over Finite Monoids with Infinite Promises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06762v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Larrauri and \v{Z}ivn\'y [ICALP'25/ACM ToCL'24] recently established a complete complexity classification of the problem of solving a system of equations over a monoid $N$ assuming that a solution exists over a monoid $M$, where both monoids are finite and $M$ admits a homomorphism to $N$. Using the algebraic approach to promise constraint satisfaction problems, we extend their complexity classification in two directions: we obtain a complexity dichotomy in the case where arbitrary relations are added to the monoids, and we moreover allow the monoid $M$ to be finitely generated.</description>

      <title>Decision DNNFs with imbalanced conjunction cannot efficiently represent CNFs of bounded width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decomposable Negation Normal Forms \textsc{dnnf} [Darwiche, 'Decomposable Negation Normal Form', JACM, 2001] is a landmark Knowledge Compilation (\textsc{kc}) model, highly important both in \textsc{ai} and Theoretical Computer Science. Numerous restrictions of the model have been studied. In this paper we consider the restriction where all the gates are $\alpha$-imbalanced that is, at most one input of each gate depends on more than $n^{\alpha}$ variables (where $n$ is the number if variables of the function being represented).
  The concept of imbalanced gates has been first considered in [Lai, Liu, Yin 'New canonical representations by augmenting OBDDs with conjunctive decomposition', JAIR, 2017]. We consider the idea in the context of representation of \textsc{cnf}s of bounded primal treewidth. We pose an open question as to whether \textsc{cnf}s of bounded primal treewidth can be represented as \textsc{fpt}-sized \textsc{dnnf} with $\alpha$-imbalanced gates.
  We answer the question negatively for Decision \textsc{dnnf} with $\alpha$-imbalanced conjunction gates. In particular, we establish a lower bound of $n^{\Omega((1-\alpha) \cdot k)}$ for the representation size (where $k$ is the primal treewidth of the input \textsc{cnf}). The main engine for the above lower bound is a combinatorial result that may be of an independent interest in the area of parameterized complexity as it introduces a novel concept of bidimensionality.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary dynamics of any multiplayer game on regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11686v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiplayer games on graphs are at the heart of theoretical descriptions of key evolutionary processes that govern vital social and natural systems. However, a comprehensive theoretical framework for solving multiplayer games with an arbitrary number of strategies on graphs is still missing. Here, we solve this by drawing an analogy with the Balls-and-Boxes problem, based on which we show that the local configuration of multiplayer games on graphs is equivalent to distributing $k$ identical co-players among $n$ distinct strategies. We use this to derive the replicator equation for any $n$-strategy multiplayer game under weak selection, which can be solved in polynomial time. As an example, we revisit the second-order free-riding problem, where costly punishment cannot truly resolve social dilemmas in a well-mixed population. Yet, in structured populations, we derive an accurate threshold for the punishment strength, beyond which punishment can either lead to the extinction of defection or transform the system into a rock-paper-scissors-like cycle. The analytical solution also qualitatively agrees with the phase diagrams that were previously obtained for non-marginal selection strengths. Our framework thus allows an exploration of any multi-strategy multiplayer game on regular graphs.</description>
