      <title>FinAgentBench: A Benchmark Dataset for Agentic Retrieval in Financial Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14052v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate information retrieval (IR) is critical in the financial domain, where investors must identify relevant information from large collections of documents. Traditional IR methods-whether sparse or dense-often fall short in retrieval accuracy, as it requires not only capturing semantic similarity but also performing fine-grained reasoning over document structure and domain-specific knowledge. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened up new opportunities for retrieval with multi-step reasoning, where the model ranks passages through iterative reasoning about which information is most relevant to a given query. However, there exists no benchmark to evaluate such capabilities in the financial domain. To address this gap, we introduce FinAgentBench, the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating retrieval with multi-step reasoning in finance -- a setting we term agentic retrieval. The benchmark consists of 3,429 expert-annotated examples on S&amp;P-100 listed firms and assesses whether LLM agents can (1) identify the most relevant document type among candidates, and (2) pinpoint the key passage within the selected document. Our evaluation framework explicitly separates these two reasoning steps to address context limitations. This design enables to provide a quantitative basis for understanding retrieval-centric LLM behavior in finance. We evaluate a suite of state-of-the-art models and further demonstrated how targeted fine-tuning can significantly improve agentic retrieval performance. Our benchmark provides a foundation for studying retrieval-centric LLM behavior in complex, domain-specific tasks for finance. We will release the dataset publicly upon acceptance of the paper and plan to expand and share dataset for the full S&amp;P 500 and beyond.</description>

      <title>Dual-Phase Playtime-guided Recommendation: Interest Intensity Exploration and Multimodal Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The explosive growth of the video game industry has created an urgent need for recommendation systems that can scale with expanding catalogs and maintain user engagement. While prior work has explored accuracy and diversity in recommendations, existing models underutilize playtime, a rich behavioral signal unique to gaming platforms, and overlook the potential of multimodal information to enhance diversity. In this paper, we propose DP2Rec, a novel Dual-Phase Playtime-guided Recommendation model designed to jointly optimize accuracy and diversity. First, we introduce a playtime-guided interest intensity exploration module that separates strong and weak preferences via dual-beta modeling, enabling fine-grained user profiling and more accurate recommendations. Second, we present a playtime-guided multimodal random walks module that simulates player exploration using transitions guided by both playtime-derived interest similarity and multimodal semantic similarity. This mechanism preserves core preferences while promoting cross-category discovery through latent semantic associations and adaptive category balancing. Extensive experiments on a real-world game dataset show that DP2Rec outperforms existing methods in both recommendation accuracy and diversity.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Network for Product Recommendation on the Amazon Co-purchase Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying relevant information among massive volumes of data is a challenge for modern recommendation systems. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant potential by utilizing structural and semantic relationships through graph-based learning. This study assessed the abilities of four GNN architectures, LightGCN, GraphSAGE, GAT, and PinSAGE, on the Amazon Product Co-purchase Network under link prediction settings. We examined practical trade-offs between architectures, model performance, scalability, training complexity and generalization. The outcomes demonstrated each model's performance characteristics for deploying GNN in real-world recommendation scenarios.</description>

      <title>GPT-2 as a Compression Preprocessor: Improving Gzip for Structured Text Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the modern era, large volumes of data are being produced continuously, especially in domain-specific fields such as medical records and clinical files, defence logs and HTML-based web traffic. Data with such volume and complexity needs to be compressed before storing and transmitting efficiently. Data compression has gained significant attention from modern researchers, resulting in the development of fast and efficient compression algorithms such as Gzip. However, since gzip works on the principle of repetition of binary patterns, one of the limitations of gzip is that domain-specific formats like JSON, XML, HTML, and log files, while structured, may have semantic repetition but not syntactic repetition, which gzip finds difficult to compress. In this article, we propose a GPT-based preprocessor for such domain-specific files. We propose a pipeline made up of GPT-2 taking domain-specific files as input, which pattern-based compressors like gzip find difficult to work on. The preprocessor results are output in a file that is designed for compressors like gzip. After preprocessing, the gzip works on the other end of the pipeline and compresses the data as usual. We used different types of both real-world and synthetically generated data, such as logs and HTML files, for the experiment of the proposed model. We found promising results and an improvement of the Defence logs by 0.34 per cent and HTML files by 5.8 per cent.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Agent Approach to Neurological Clinical Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in medical domains, but their ability to handle specialized neurological reasoning requires systematic evaluation. We developed a comprehensive benchmark using 305 questions from Israeli Board Certification Exams in Neurology, classified along three complexity dimensions: factual knowledge depth, clinical concept integration, and reasoning complexity. We evaluated ten LLMs using base models, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and a novel multi-agent system. Results showed significant performance variation. OpenAI-o1 achieved the highest base performance (90.9% accuracy), while specialized medical models performed poorly (52.9% for Meditron-70B). RAG provided modest benefits but limited effectiveness on complex reasoning questions. In contrast, our multi-agent framework, decomposing neurological reasoning into specialized cognitive functions including question analysis, knowledge retrieval, answer synthesis, and validation, achieved dramatic improvements, especially for mid-range models. The LLaMA 3.3-70B-based agentic system reached 89.2% accuracy versus 69.5% for its base model, with substantial gains on level 3 complexity questions. The multi-agent approach transformed inconsistent subspecialty performance into uniform excellence, addressing neurological reasoning challenges that persisted with RAG enhancement. We validated our approach using an independent dataset of 155 neurological cases from MedQA. Results confirm that structured multi-agent approaches designed to emulate specialized cognitive processes significantly enhance complex medical reasoning, offering promising directions for AI assistance in challenging clinical contexts.</description>

      <title>Personalized Contest Recommendation in Fantasy Sports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In daily fantasy sports, players enter into "contests" where they compete against each other by building teams of athletes that score fantasy points based on what actually occurs in a real-life sports match. For any given sports match, there are a multitude of contests available to players, with substantial variation across 3 main dimensions: entry fee, number of spots, and the prize pool distribution. As player preferences are also quite heterogeneous, contest personalization is an important tool to match players with contests. This paper presents a scalable contest recommendation system, powered by a Wide and Deep Interaction Ranker (WiDIR) at its core. We productionized this system at our company, one of the large fantasy sports platforms with millions of daily contests and millions of players, where online experiments show a marked improvement over other candidate models in terms of recall and other critical business metrics.</description>

      <title>Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Industry: An Interview Study on Use Cases, Requirements, Challenges, and Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a well-established and rapidly evolving field within AI that enhances the outputs of large language models by integrating relevant information retrieved from external knowledge sources. While industry adoption of RAG is now beginning, there is a significant lack of research on its practical application in industrial contexts. To address this gap, we conducted a semistructured interview study with 13 industry practitioners to explore the current state of RAG adoption in real-world settings. Our study investigates how companies apply RAG in practice, providing (1) an overview of industry use cases, (2) a consolidated list of system requirements, (3) key challenges and lessons learned from practical experiences, and (4) an analysis of current industry evaluation methods. Our main findings show that current RAG applications are mostly limited to domain-specific QA tasks, with systems still in prototype stages; industry requirements focus primarily on data protection, security, and quality, while issues such as ethics, bias, and scalability receive less attention; data preprocessing remains a key challenge, and system evaluation is predominantly conducted by humans rather than automated methods.</description>

      <title>RewardRank: Optimizing True Learning-to-Rank Utility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional ranking systems rely on proxy loss functions that assume simplistic user behavior, such as users preferring a rank list where items are sorted by hand-crafted relevance. However, real-world user interactions are influenced by complex behavioral biases, including position bias, brand affinity, decoy effects, and similarity aversion, which these objectives fail to capture. As a result, models trained on such losses often misalign with actual user utility, such as the probability of any click or purchase across the ranked list. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework for modeling user behavior through counterfactual reward learning. Our method, RewardRank, first trains a deep utility model to estimate user engagement for entire item permutations using logged data. Then, a ranking policy is optimized to maximize predicted utility via differentiable soft permutation operators, enabling end-to-end training over the space of factual and counterfactual rankings. To address the challenge of evaluation without ground-truth for unseen permutations, we introduce two automated protocols: (i) $\textit{KD-Eval}$, using a position-aware oracle for counterfactual reward estimation, and (ii) $\textit{LLM-Eval}$, which simulates user preferences via large language models. Experiments on large-scale benchmarks, including Baidu-ULTR and the Amazon KDD Cup datasets, demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms strong baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of modeling user behavior dynamics for utility-optimized ranking.

      <title>You Only Evaluate Once: A Tree-based Rerank Method at Meituan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reranking plays a crucial role in modern recommender systems by capturing the mutual influences within the list. Due to the inherent challenges of combinatorial search spaces, most methods adopt a two-stage search paradigm: a simple General Search Unit (GSU) efficiently reduces the candidate space, and an Exact Search Unit (ESU) effectively selects the optimal sequence. These methods essentially involve making trade-offs between effectiveness and efficiency, while suffering from a severe \textbf{inconsistency problem}, that is, the GSU often misses high-value lists from ESU. To address this problem, we propose YOLOR, a one-stage reranking method that removes the GSU while retaining only the ESU. Specifically, YOLOR includes: (1) a Tree-based Context Extraction Module (TCEM) that hierarchically aggregates multi-scale contextual features to achieve "list-level effectiveness", and (2) a Context Cache Module (CCM) that enables efficient feature reuse across candidate permutations to achieve "permutation-level efficiency". Extensive experiments across public and industry datasets validate YOLOR's performance, and we have successfully deployed YOLOR on the Meituan food delivery platform.</description>

      <title>Diverse Negative Sampling for Implicit Collaborative Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implicit collaborative filtering recommenders are usually trained to learn user positive preferences. Negative sampling, which selects informative negative items to form negative training data, plays a crucial role in this process. Since items are often clustered in the latent space, existing negative sampling strategies normally oversample negative items from the dense regions. This leads to homogeneous negative data and limited model expressiveness. In this paper, we propose Diverse Negative Sampling (DivNS), a novel approach that explicitly accounts for diversity in negative training data during the negative sampling process. DivNS first finds hard negative items with large preference scores and constructs user-specific caches that store unused but highly informative negative samples. Then, its diversity-augmented sampler selects a diverse subset of negative items from the cache while ensuring dissimilarity from the user's hard negatives. Finally, a synthetic negatives generator combines the selected diverse negatives with hard negatives to form more effective training data. The resulting synthetic negatives are both informative and diverse, enabling recommenders to learn a broader item space and improve their generalisability. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DivNS in improving recommendation quality while maintaining computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Distribution-Guided Auto-Encoder for User Multimodal Interest Cross Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional recommendation methods rely on correlating the embedding vectors of item IDs to capture implicit collaborative filtering signals to model the user's interest in the target item. Consequently, traditional ID-based methods often encounter data sparsity problems stemming from the sparse nature of ID features. To alleviate the problem of item ID sparsity, recommendation models incorporate multimodal item information to enhance recommendation accuracy. However, existing multimodal recommendation methods typically employ early fusion approaches, which focus primarily on combining text and image features, while neglecting the contextual influence of user behavior sequences. This oversight prevents dynamic adaptation of multimodal interest representations based on behavioral patterns, consequently restricting the model's capacity to effectively capture user multimodal interests. Therefore, this paper proposes the Distribution-Guided Multimodal-Interest Auto-Encoder (DMAE), which achieves the cross fusion of user multimodal interest at the behavioral level.Ultimately, extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DMAE.</description>

      <title>Global-Distribution Aware Scenario-Specific Variational Representation Learning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the emergence of e-commerce, the recommendations provided by commercial platforms must adapt to diverse scenarios to accommodate users' varying shopping preferences. Current methods typically use a unified framework to offer personalized recommendations for different scenarios. However, they often employ shared bottom representations, which partially hinders the model's capacity to capture scenario uniqueness. Ideally, users and items should exhibit specific characteristics in different scenarios, prompting the need to learn scenario-specific representations to differentiate scenarios. Yet, variations in user and item interactions across scenarios lead to data sparsity issues, impeding the acquisition of scenario-specific representations. To learn robust scenario-specific representations, we introduce a Global-Distribution Aware Scenario-Specific Variational Representation Learning Framework (GSVR) that can be directly applied to existing multi-scenario methods. Specifically, considering the uncertainty stemming from limited samples, our approach employs a probabilistic model to generate scenario-specific distributions for each user and item in each scenario, estimated through variational inference (VI). Additionally, we introduce the global knowledge-aware multinomial distributions as prior knowledge to regulate the learning of the posterior user and item distributions, ensuring similarities among distributions for users with akin interests and items with similar side information. This mitigates the risk of users or items with fewer records being overwhelmed in sparse scenarios. Extensive experimental results affirm the efficacy of GSVR in assisting existing multi-scenario recommendation methods in learning more robust representations.</description>

      <title>DGenCTR: Towards a Universal Generative Paradigm for Click-Through Rate Prediction via Discrete Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have inspired the field of recommender systems to explore generative approaches, but most existing research focuses on sequence generation, a paradigm ill-suited for click-through rate (CTR) prediction. CTR models critically depend on a large number of cross-features between the target item and the user to estimate the probability of clicking on the item, and discarding these cross-features will significantly impair model performance. Therefore, to harness the ability of generative models to understand data distributions and thereby alleviate the constraints of traditional discriminative models in label-scarce space, diverging from the item-generation paradigm of sequence generation methods, we propose a novel sample-level generation paradigm specifically designed for the CTR task: a two-stage Discrete Diffusion-Based Generative CTR training framework (DGenCTR). This two-stage framework comprises a diffusion-based generative pre-training stage and a CTR-targeted supervised fine-tuning stage for CTR. Finally, extensive offline experiments and online A/B testing conclusively validate the effectiveness of our framework.</description>

      <title>MISS: Multi-Modal Tree Indexing and Searching with Lifelong Sequential Behavior for Retrieval Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale industrial recommendation systems typically employ a two-stage paradigm of retrieval and ranking to handle huge amounts of information. Recent research focuses on improving the performance of retrieval model. A promising way is to introduce extensive information about users and items. On one hand, lifelong sequential behavior is valuable. Existing lifelong behavior modeling methods in ranking stage focus on the interaction of lifelong behavior and candidate items from retrieval stage. In retrieval stage, it is difficult to utilize lifelong behavior because of a large corpus of candidate items. On the other hand, existing retrieval methods mostly relay on interaction information, potentially disregarding valuable multi-modal information. To solve these problems, we represent the pioneering exploration of leveraging multi-modal information and lifelong sequence model within the advanced tree-based retrieval model. We propose Multi-modal Indexing and Searching with lifelong Sequence (MISS), which contains a multi-modal index tree and a multi-modal lifelong sequence modeling module. Specifically, for better index structure, we propose multi-modal index tree, which is built using the multi-modal embedding to precisely represent item similarity. To precisely capture diverse user interests in user lifelong sequence, we propose collaborative general search unit (Co-GSU) and multi-modal general search unit (MM-GSU) for multi-perspective interests searching.</description>

      <title>OneLoc: Geo-Aware Generative Recommender Systems for Local Life Service</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local life service is a vital scenario in Kuaishou App, where video recommendation is intrinsically linked with store's location information. Thus, recommendation in our scenario is challenging because we should take into account user's interest and real-time location at the same time. In the face of such complex scenarios, end-to-end generative recommendation has emerged as a new paradigm, such as OneRec in the short video scenario, OneSug in the search scenario, and EGA in the advertising scenario. However, in local life service, an end-to-end generative recommendation model has not yet been developed as there are some key challenges to be solved. The first challenge is how to make full use of geographic information. The second challenge is how to balance multiple objectives, including user interests, the distance between user and stores, and some other business objectives. To address the challenges, we propose OneLoc. Specifically, we leverage geographic information from different perspectives: (1) geo-aware semantic ID incorporates both video and geographic information for tokenization, (2) geo-aware self-attention in the encoder leverages both video location similarity and user's real-time location, and (3) neighbor-aware prompt captures rich context information surrounding users for generation. To balance multiple objectives, we use reinforcement learning and propose two reward functions, i.e., geographic reward and GMV reward. With the above design, OneLoc achieves outstanding offline and online performance. In fact, OneLoc has been deployed in local life service of Kuaishou App. It serves 400 million active users daily, achieving 21.016% and 17.891% improvements in terms of gross merchandise value (GMV) and orders numbers.</description>

      <title>Benefiting from Negative yet Informative Feedback by Contrasting Opposing Sequential Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the task of learning from both positive and negative feedback in a sequential recommendation scenario, as both types of feedback are often present in user interactions. Meanwhile, conventional sequential learning models usually focus on considering and predicting positive interactions, ignoring that reducing items with negative feedback in recommendations improves user satisfaction with the service. Moreover, the negative feedback can potentially provide a useful signal for more accurate identification of true user interests. In this work, we propose to train two transformer encoders on separate positive and negative interaction sequences. We incorporate both types of feedback into the training objective of the sequential recommender using a composite loss function that includes positive and negative cross-entropy as well as a cleverly crafted contrastive term, that helps better modeling opposing patterns. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in terms of increasing true-positive metrics compared to state-of-the-art sequential recommendation methods while reducing the number of wrongly promoted negative items.</description>

      <title>SurveyGen-I: Consistent Scientific Survey Generation with Evolving Plans and Memory-Guided Writing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Survey papers play a critical role in scientific communication by consolidating progress across a field. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising solution by automating key steps in the survey-generation pipeline, such as retrieval, structuring, and summarization. However, existing LLM-based approaches often struggle with maintaining coherence across long, multi-section surveys and providing comprehensive citation coverage. To address these limitations, we introduce SurveyGen-I, an automatic survey generation framework that combines coarse-to-fine retrieval, adaptive planning, and memory-guided generation. SurveyGen-I first performs survey-level retrieval to construct the initial outline and writing plan, and then dynamically refines both during generation through a memory mechanism that stores previously written content and terminology, ensuring coherence across subsections. When the system detects insufficient context, it triggers fine-grained subsection-level retrieval. During generation, SurveyGen-I leverages this memory mechanism to maintain coherence across subsections. Experiments across four scientific domains demonstrate that SurveyGen-I consistently outperforms previous works in content quality, consistency, and citation coverage.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning to Rank Using Coarse-grained Rewards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.07563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning to rank (LTR) plays a crucial role in various Information Retrieval (IR) tasks. Although supervised LTR methods based on fine-grained relevance labels (e.g., document-level annotations) have achieved significant success, their reliance on costly and potentially biased annotations limits scalability and alignment with realistic goals. In contrast, coarse-grained feedback signals, such as duration time and session-level engagement, are more accessible and affordable. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising framework to directly optimize these objectives using reward signals, but most existing Reinforcement Learning to Rank (RLTR) approaches suffer from high variance and low sample efficiency. Motivated by recent advances in large language models (LLMs), we re-examine the problem of RLTR with coarse-grained rewards and propose new RLTR methods based on widely used RL algorithms for LLMs. We systematically compare supervised learning and RL-based methods across various model architectures and coarse-grained reward functions on large-scale LTR benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that advanced RL methods can directly learn from coarse-grained rewards and outperform strong supervised learning baselines even with fine-grained labels. This shows the great potential of RLTR for metric-agnostic ranking optimization.</description>

      <title>PathGPT: Reframing Path Recommendation as a Natural Language Generation Task with Retrieval-Augmented Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Path recommendation (PR) aims to generate travel paths that are customized to a user's specific preferences and constraints. Conventional approaches often employ explicit optimization objectives or specialized machine learning architectures; however, these methods typically exhibit limited flexibility and generalizability, necessitating costly retraining to accommodate new scenarios. This paper introduces an alternative paradigm that conceptualizes PR as a natural language generation task. We present PathGPT, a retrieval-augmented large language model (LLM) system that leverages historical trajectory data and natural language user constraints to generate plausible paths. The proposed methodology first converts raw trajectory data into a human-interpretable textual format, which is then stored in a database. Subsequently, a hybrid retrieval system extracts path-specific context from this database to inform a pretrained LLM. The primary contribution of this work is a novel framework that demonstrates how integrating established information retrieval and generative model components can enable adaptive, zero-shot path generation across diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments on large-scale trajectory datasets indicate that PathGPT's performance is competitive with specialized, learning-based methods, underscoring its potential as a flexible and generalizable path generation system that avoids the need for retraining inherent in previous data-driven models.</description>

      <title>Diagnostic-Guided Dynamic Profile Optimization for LLM-based User Simulators in Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12645v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled realistic user simulators for developing and evaluating recommender systems (RSs). However, existing LLM-based simulators for RSs face two major limitations: (1) static and single-step prompt-based inference that leads to inaccurate and incomplete user profile construction; (2) unrealistic and single-round recommendation-feedback interaction pattern that fails to capture real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose DGDPO (Diagnostic-Guided Dynamic Profile Optimization), a novel framework that constructs user profile through a dynamic and iterative optimization process to enhance the simulation fidelity. Specifically, DGDPO incorporates two core modules within each optimization loop: firstly, a specialized LLM-based diagnostic module, calibrated through our novel training strategy, accurately identifies specific defects in the user profile. Subsequently, a generalized LLM-based treatment module analyzes the diagnosed defect and generates targeted suggestions to refine the profile. Furthermore, unlike existing LLM-based user simulators that are limited to single-round interactions, we are the first to integrate DGDPO with sequential recommenders, enabling a bidirectional evolution where user profiles and recommendation strategies adapt to each other over multi-round interactions. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Reference-Aligned Retrieval-Augmented Question Answering over Heterogeneous Proprietary Documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19596v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Proprietary corporate documents contain rich domain-specific knowledge, but their overwhelming volume and disorganized structure make it difficult even for employees to access the right information when needed. For example, in the automotive industry, vehicle crash-collision tests, each costing hundreds of thousands of dollars, produce highly detailed documentation. However, retrieving relevant content during decision-making remains time-consuming due to the scale and complexity of the material. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based Question Answering (QA) systems offer a promising solution, building an internal RAG-QA system poses several challenges: (1) handling heterogeneous multi-modal data sources, (2) preserving data confidentiality, and (3) enabling traceability between each piece of information in the generated answer and its original source document. To address these, we propose a RAG-QA framework for internal enterprise use, consisting of: (1) a data pipeline that converts raw multi-modal documents into a structured corpus and QA pairs, (2) a fully on-premise, privacy-preserving architecture, and (3) a lightweight reference matcher that links answer segments to supporting content. Applied to the automotive domain, our system improves factual correctness (+1.79, +1.94), informativeness (+1.33, +1.16), and helpfulness (+1.08, +1.67) over a non-RAG baseline, based on 1-5 scale ratings from both human and LLM judge.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Temporal Sensitivity of Large Language Model for Recommendation with Counterfactual Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances have applied large language models (LLMs) to sequential recommendation, leveraging their pre-training knowledge and reasoning capabilities to provide more personalized user experiences. However, existing LLM-based methods fail to sufficiently leverage the rich temporal information inherent in users' historical interaction sequences, stemming from fundamental architectural constraints: LLMs process information through self-attention mechanisms that lack inherent sequence ordering and rely on position embeddings designed primarily for natural language rather than user interaction sequences. This limitation significantly impairs their ability to capture the evolution of user preferences over time and predict future interests accurately.
  To address this critical gap, we propose \underline{C}ounterfactual \underline{E}nhanced \underline{T}emporal Framework for LLM-Based \underline{Rec}ommendation (CETRec). CETRec is grounded in causal inference principles, which allow it to isolate and measure the specific impact of temporal information on recommendation outcomes. Combined with our counterfactual tuning task derived from causal analysis, CETRec effectively enhances LLMs' awareness of both absolute order (how recently items were interacted with) and relative order (the sequential relationships between items). Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our CETRec. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CETRec-B9CE/.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10772v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Labeled property graphs often contain rich textual attributes that can enhance analytical tasks when properly leveraged. This work explores the use of pretrained text embedding models to enable efficient semantic analysis in such graphs. By embedding textual node and edge properties, we support downstream tasks including node classification and relation prediction with improved contextual understanding. Our approach integrates language model embeddings into the graph pipeline without altering its structure, demonstrating that textual semantics can significantly enhance the accuracy and interpretability of property graph analysis.</description>

      <title>Hybrid-Hierarchical Fashion Graph Attention Network for Compatibility-Oriented and Personalized Outfit Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of the fashion industry and the growing variety of products have made it increasingly challenging for users to identify compatible items on e-commerce platforms. Effective fashion recommendation systems are therefore crucial for filtering irrelevant options and suggesting suitable ones. However, simultaneously addressing outfit compatibility and personalized recommendations remains a significant challenge, as these aspects are typically treated independently in existing studies, thereby overlooking the complex interactions between items and user preferences. This research introduces a new framework named FGAT, which leverages a hierarchical graph representation together with graph attention mechanisms to address this problem. The framework constructs a three-tier graph of users, outfits, and items, integrating visual and textual features to jointly model outfit compatibility and user preferences. By dynamically weighting node importance during representation propagation, the graph attention mechanism captures key interactions and produces precise embeddings for both user preferences and outfit compatibility. Evaluated on the POG dataset, FGAT outperforms strong baselines such as HFGN, achieving notable improvements in accuracy, precision, HR, recall, and NDCG. These results demonstrate that combining multimodal visual and textual features with a hierarchical graph structure and attention mechanisms significantly enhances the effectiveness and efficiency of personalized fashion recommendation systems.</description>

      <title>TASER: Table Agents for Schema-guided Extraction and Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-world financial documents report essential information about an entity's financial holdings that can span millions of different financial instrument types. Yet, these details are often buried in messy, multi-page, fragmented tables - for example, 99.4% of the tables in our dataset have no bounding boxes with the maximum number of rows amounting to 426 per table across 44 pages. To tackle these unique challenges from real-world tables, we present a continuously learning, agentic table extraction system, TASER (Table Agents for Schema-guided Extraction and Recommendation) that extracts highly unstructured, multi-page, heterogeneous tables into normalized, schema-conforming outputs. Our table agents execute on table detection, classification, extraction, and recommendations by leveraging an initial schema. Then, our Recommender Agent reviews the outputs, recommends schema revisions, and decides on the final recommendations, enabling TASER to outperform existing table detection models such as Table Transformer by 10.1%. Within this continuous learning process, we highlight that larger batch sizes result in a 104.3% increase in schema recommendations that are actionable and utilized, resulting in a 9.8% increase in extracted holdings - highlighting the importance of a continuous learning process. To train TASER, we have manually labeled 22,584 pages (28,150,449 tokens), 3,213 tables for $731,685,511,687 of holdings culminating in one of the first real financial table datasets. We release our dataset TASERTab to enable the research community to access real-world financial tables and outputs. Our results highlight the promise of agentic, schema-guided extraction systems for robust understanding of real-world financial tables.</description>
