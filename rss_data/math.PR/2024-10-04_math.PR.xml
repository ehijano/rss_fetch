      <title>Convergence of distributions on paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the convergence of distributions on finite paths of weighted digraphs, namely the family of Boltzmann distributions and the sequence of uniform distributions. Targeting applications to the convergence of distributions on paths, we revisit some known results from reducible nonnegative matrix theory and obtain new ones, with a systematic use of tools from analytic combinatorics. In several fields of mathematics, computer science and system theory, including concurreny theory, one frequently faces non strongly connected weighted digraphs encoding the elements of combinatorial structures of interest; this motivates our study.</description>

      <title>Length of the longest branches in a Bellman--Harris tree</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a Bellman--Harris-type branching process, in which individuals evolve independently of one another, giving birth after a random time $T$ to a random number $L$ of children. In this article, we study the asymptotic behaviour of the length of the longest branches of this branching process at time $t$, both pendant branches (corresponding to individuals still alive at time $t$) and interior branches (corresponding to individuals dead before time $t$).</description>

      <title>On the First Passage Times of Branching Random Walks in $\mathbb{R}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a discrete-time non-lattice supercritical branching random walk in $\mathbb{R}^d$, we investigate its first passage time to a shifted unit ball of a distance $x$ from the origin, conditioned upon survival. We provide precise asymptotics up to $O(1)$ (tightness) for the first passage time as a function of $x$ as $x\to\infty$, thus resolving a conjecture in Blanchet-Cai-Mohanty-Zhang (2024). Our proof builds on the previous analysis of Blanchet-Cai-Mohanty-Zhang (2024) and employs a careful multi-scale analysis on the genealogy of particles within a distance of $\asymp \log x$ near extrema of a one-dimensional branching random walk, where the cluster structure plays a crucial role.</description>

      <title>Weak Generative Sampler to Efficiently Sample Invariant Distribution of Stochastic Differential Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sampling invariant distributions from an Ito diffusion process presents a significant challenge in stochastic simulation. Traditional numerical solvers for stochastic differential equations require both a fine step size and a lengthy simulation period, resulting in both biased and correlated samples. Current deep learning-based method solves the stationary Fokker--Planck equation to determine the invariant probability density function in form of deep neural networks, but they generally do not directly address the problem of sampling from the computed density function. In this work, we introduce a framework that employs a weak generative sampler (WGS) to directly generate independent and identically distributed (iid) samples induced by a transformation map derived from the stationary Fokker--Planck equation. Our proposed loss function is based on the weak form of the Fokker--Planck equation, integrating normalizing flows to characterize the invariant distribution and facilitate sample generation from the base distribution. Our randomized test function circumvents the need for mini-max optimization in the traditional weak formulation. Distinct from conventional generative models, our method neither necessitates the computationally intensive calculation of the Jacobian determinant nor the invertibility of the transformation map. A crucial component of our framework is the adaptively chosen family of test functions in the form of Gaussian kernel functions with centres selected from the generated data samples. Experimental results on several benchmark examples demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which offers both low computational costs and excellent capability in exploring multiple metastable states.</description>

      <title>Continuity of Lyapunov exponents for stochastic differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For non-autonomous linear stochastic differential equations (SDEs), we establish that the top Lyapunov exponent is continuous if the coefficients "almost" uniformly converge. For autonomous SDEs, assuming the existence of invariant measures and the convergence of coefficients and their derivatives in pointwise sense, we get the continuity of all Lyapunov exponents. Furthermore, we demonstrate that for autonomous SDEs with strict monotonicity condition, all Lyapunov exponents are Lipschitz continuous with respect to the coefficients under the $L^{p,p}$ norm ($p&gt;2$). Similarly, the H\"older continuity of Lyapunov exponents holds under weaker regularity conditions. It seems that the continuity of Lyapunov exponents has not been studied for SDEs so far, in spite that there are many results in this direction for discrete-time dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Invariant measures and their limiting behavior of the Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch equation in unbounded domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with the existence and limiting behavior of invariant measures of the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch equation driven by linear multiplicative noise and additive noise defined in the entire space $\mathbb{R}^d$ for $d=1,2$, which describes the phase spins in ferromagnetic materials around the Curie temperature. We first establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions by a domain expansion method. We then prove the existence of invariant measures by the weak Feller argument. In the case $d=1$, we show the uniform tightness of the set of all invariant measures of the stochastic equation, and prove any limit of a sequence of invariant measures of the perturbed equation must be an invariant measure of the limiting system. The cut-off arguments, stopping time techniques and uniform tail-ends estimates of solutions are developed to overcome the difficulty caused by the high-order nonlinearity and the non-compactness of Sobolev embeddings in unbounded domain.</description>

      <title>Free Stein Kernel and Moments maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a free analogue to Fathi's construction of Stein kernels using moment maps (2019). This is possible for a class of measures called free moment measures, introduced in the free case by Bahr and Boschert, by using the notion of free moment maps which areconvex function solutions of a variant of the free Monge-Ampere equation discovered by Guionnet and Shlyakhtenko. We then show how regularity estimates in some weighted non-commutative Sobolev spaces on these maps control the transport distances to the semicircular law. We also prove in the one-dimensional case a free analogue of the moment map version of the Cafarelli contraction theorem (2001), discovered by Klartag (2014) in the classical case, and which leads to a uniform bound for the free moment Stein kernel. Finally, we discuss the applications of these results: we prove a stability result characterising the semicircular distribution among a certain subclass of free Gibbs measures, the probabilistic interpretation of this free moment Stein kernel in terms of free diffusion processes, and its connections with the theory of non-commutative Dirichlet forms.</description>

      <title>A sharp symmetrized free transport-entropy inequality for the semicircular law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, following the recent work of Fathi (2018) in the classical case, we provide by two different methods a sharp symmetrized free Talagrand inequality for the semicircular law, which improves the free TCI of Biane and Voiculescu (2000). The first proof holds only in the one-dimensional case and has the advantage of providing a connection with the machinery of free moment maps introduced by Bahr and Boschert (2023) and a free reverse Log-Sobolev inequality. This case also and sheds light on a dual formulation via the free version of the functional Blaschke-Santalo inequality. The second proof gives the result in a multidimensional setting and relies on a random matrix approximation approach developed by Biane (2003), Hiai, Petz and Ueda (2004) combined with Fathi's inequality on Euclidean spaces.</description>

Abstract: We study the Vitale zonoid (a convex body associated to a probability distribution) associated to a non--centered Gaussian vector. This defines a family of convex bodies, that contains and generalizes ellipsoids, which we call Gaussian zonoids. We show that each Gaussian zonoid can be approximated by an ellipsoid that we compute explicitely. We use this result to give new estimates for the expectation of the absolute value of the determinant of a non--centered Gaussian matrix in terms of mixed volume of ellipsoids. Finally, exploiting a recent link between random fields and zonoids uncovered by Stecconi and the author, we apply our results to the study of the zero set of non--centered Gaussian random fields. We show how these can be approximated by a suitable centered Gaussian random field and give a quantitative asymptotic in the limit where the variance goes to zero.</description>

      <title>Nonnegativity preserving convolution kernels. Application to Stochastic Volterra Equations in closed convex domains and their approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.07758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work defines and studies one-dimensional convolution kernels that preserve nonnegativity. When the past dynamics of a process is integrated with a convolution kernel like in Stochastic Volterra Equations or in the jump intensity of Hawkes processes, this property allows to get the nonnegativity of the integral. We give characterizations of these kernels and show in particular that completely monotone kernels preserve nonnegativity. We then apply these results to analyze the stochastic invariance of a closed convex set by Stochastic Volterra Equations. We also get a comparison result in dimension one. Last, when the kernel is a positive linear combination of decaying exponential functions, we present a second order approximation scheme for the weak error that stays in the closed convex domain under suitable assumptions. We apply these results to the rough Heston model and give numerical illustrations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05176v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Whole-plane SLE$_\kappa$ is a random fractal curve between two points on the Riemann sphere. Zhan established for $\kappa \leq 4$ that whole-plane SLE$_\kappa$ is reversible, meaning invariant in law under conformal automorphisms swapping its endpoints. Miller and Sheffield extended this to $\kappa \leq 8$. We prove whole-plane SLE$_\kappa$ is reversible for $\kappa &gt; 8$, resolving the final case and answering a conjecture of Viklund and Wang. Our argument depends on a novel mating-of-trees theorem of independent interest, where Liouville quantum gravity on the disk is decorated by an independent radial space-filling SLE curve.</description>

      <title>Non-explicit formula of boundary crossing probabilities by the Girsanov theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07101v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper derives several formulae for the probability that a Wiener process, which has a stochastic drift and random variance, crosses a one-sided stochastic boundary within a finite time interval. A non-explicit formula is first obtained by the Girsanov theorem when considering an equivalent probability measure in which the boundary is constant and equal to its starting value. A more explicit formula is then achieved by decomposing the Radon-Nikodym derivative inverse. This decomposition expresses it as the product of a random variable, which is measurable with respect to the Wiener process's final value, and an independent random variable. We also provide an explicit formula based on a strong theoretical assumption. To apply the Girsanov theorem, we assume that the difference between the drift increment and the boundary increment, divided by the standard deviation, is absolutely continuous. Additionally, we assume that its derivative satisfies Novikov's condition.</description>

Abstract: Consider a log-correlated Gaussian field $\Gamma$ and its associated imaginary multiplicative chaos $:e^{i \beta \Gamma}:$ where $\beta$ is a real parameter. In [AJJ22], we showed that for any nonzero test function $f$, the law of $\int f :e^{i \beta \Gamma}:$ possesses a smooth density with respect to Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{C}$. In this note, we show that this density is strictly positive everywhere on $\mathbb{C}$. Our simple and direct strategy could be useful for studying other functionals on Gaussian spaces.</description>

      <title>Notes on hyperbolic branching Brownian motion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Euclidean branching Brownian motion (BBM) has been intensively studied during many decades by renowned researchers. BBM on hyperbolic space has received less attention. A profound study of Lalley and Sellke (1997) provided insight on the recurrent, resp. transient regimes of BBM on the Poincare' disk. In particular, they determined the Hausdorff dimension of the limit set on the boundary circle in dependence on the fission rate of the branching particles. In the present notes, further features are exhibited. The rates of the maximal and minimal hyperbolic distances to the starting point are determined, as well as refined asymptotic estimates in the transient regime. The other main issues studied here concern the behaviour of the empiricial distributions of the branching population, as time goes to infinity, and their convergence to an infinitely supported random limit probability measure on the boundary.</description>

Abstract: Given a compact planar region $A$, let $\tau_A$ be the (random) time it takes for $A$ to be fully covered by a spatial birth-growth process in $A$ with seeds arriving as a unit-intensity Poisson point process in $A \times [0,\infty)$, where upon arrival each seed grows at unit rate in all directions. We show that if $\partial A$ is smooth or polygonal then $\Pr [ \pi \tau_{sA}^3 - 6 \log s - 4 \log \log s \leq x]$ tends to $\exp(- (\frac{81}{4\pi})^{1/3} |A|e^{-x/3} -
  (\frac{9}{2\pi^2})^{1/3} |\partial A| e^{-x/6})$ in the large-$s$ limit; the second term in the exponent is due to boundary effects, the importance of which was not recognized in earlier work on this model. We present similar results in higher dimensions (where boundary effects dominate). These results are derived using new results on the asymptotic probability of covering $A$ with a high-intensity spherical Poisson Boolean model restricted to $A$ with grains having iid small random radii, which generalize recent work of the first author that dealt only with grains of deterministic radius.</description>

      <title>Randomized Runge-Kutta-Nystr\"om Methods for Unadjusted Hamiltonian and Kinetic Langevin Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce $5/2$- and $7/2$-order $L^2$-accurate randomized Runge-Kutta-Nystr\"{o}m methods, tailored for approximating Hamiltonian flows within non-reversible Markov chain Monte Carlo samplers, such as unadjusted Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and unadjusted kinetic Langevin Monte Carlo. We establish quantitative $5/2$-order $L^2$-accuracy upper bounds under gradient and Hessian Lipschitz assumptions on the potential energy function. The numerical experiments demonstrate the superior efficiency of the proposed unadjusted samplers on a variety of well-behaved, high-dimensional target distributions.</description>

      <title>Unichain and Aperiodicity are Sufficient for Asymptotic Optimality of Average-Reward Restless Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05689v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the infinite-horizon, average-reward restless bandit problem in discrete time. We propose a new class of policies that are designed to drive a progressively larger subset of arms toward the optimal distribution. We show that our policies are asymptotically optimal with an $O(1/\sqrt{N})$ optimality gap for an $N$-armed problem, assuming only a unichain and aperiodicity assumption. Our approach departs from most existing work that focuses on index or priority policies, which rely on the Global Attractor Property (GAP) to guarantee convergence to the optimum, or a recently developed simulation-based policy, which requires a Synchronization Assumption (SA).</description>

      <title>Continuous dependence for McKean-Vlasov SDEs under distribution-dependent Lyapunov conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the continuous dependence on initial values and parameters of solutions as well as invariant measures for McKean-Vlasov SDEs under distribution-dependent Lyapunov conditions. In contrast to the classical SDEs, the solutions for McKean-Vlasov SDEs do not converge in probability although the initial values converge in probability, which is due to the mismatch of the distances between measures. Finally, we give some examples to illustrate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>On the second moment of the determinant of random symmetric, Wigner, and Hermitian matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the second moment of the determinant of random symmetric, Wigner, and Hermitian matrices. Using analytic combinatorics techniques, we determine the second moment of the determinant of Hermitian matrices whose entries on the diagonal are i.i.d and whose entries above the diagonal are i.i.d. and have real expected values. Our results extend previous work analyzing the second moment of the determinant of symmetric and Wigner matrices, providing a unified approach for this analysis.</description>

      <title>WHOMP: Optimizing Randomized Controlled Trials via Wasserstein Homogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate methods for partitioning datasets into subgroups that maximize diversity within each subgroup while minimizing dissimilarity across subgroups. We introduce a novel partitioning method called the $\textit{Wasserstein Homogeneity Partition}$ (WHOMP), which optimally minimizes type I and type II errors that often result from imbalanced group splitting or partitioning, commonly referred to as accidental bias, in comparative and controlled trials. We conduct an analytical comparison of WHOMP against existing partitioning methods, such as random subsampling, covariate-adaptive randomization, rerandomization, and anti-clustering, demonstrating its advantages. Moreover, we characterize the optimal solutions to the WHOMP problem and reveal an inherent trade-off between the stability of subgroup means and variances among these solutions. Based on our theoretical insights, we design algorithms that not only obtain these optimal solutions but also equip practitioners with tools to select the desired trade-off. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of WHOMP through numerical experiments, highlighting its superiority over traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Sign changes of the partial sums of a random multiplicative function III: Average</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $V(x)$ be the number of sign changes of the partial sums up to $x$, say $M_f(x)$, of a Rademacher random multiplicative function $f$. We prove that the averaged value of $V(x)$ is at least $\gg (\log x)(\log\log x)^{-1}$. Our new method applies for the counting of sign changes of the partial sums of a system of orthogonal random variables having variance $1$ under additional hypothesis on the moments of these partial sums. The main input in our method is the ``linearity'' phase in $1\leq q\leq 1.9$ of the quantity $\log \mathbb{E} |M_f(x)|^q$, provided by the Harper's better than squareroot cancellation phenomenon for small moments of $M_f(x)$.</description>
