      <title>Study of the mass of pseudoscalar glueball with a deep neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A deep neural network (DNN) is utilized to study the mass of the pseudoscalar glueball in lattice QCD based on Monte Carlo simulations. To obtain an accurate and stable mass value, I constructed a new network. The results show that this DNN provides a more precise and stable mass estimate compared to the traditional least squares method.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Structure of Non-Gaussian States and How to Measure It</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapidly growing capabilities of quantum simulators to probe quantum many-body phenomena require new methods to characterize increasingly complex states. We present a protocol that constrains quantum states by experimentally measured correlation functions which only scales polynomially with system size. This method enables measurement of a quantum state's entanglement structure, opening a new route to study entanglement-related phenomena. Our approach extends Gaussian state parameterizations by systematically incorporating higher-order correlations. We show the protocol's usefulness in conjunction with current and forthcoming experimental capabilities, focusing on weakly interacting fermions as a proof of concept. Here, the lowest non-trivial expansion quantitatively predicts early time thermalization dynamics, including signaling the on-set of quantum chaos indicated by the entanglement Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Gapless deconfined phase in a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetric Hamiltonian created in a cold-atom setup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a quasi-two-dimensional system consisting of two species of alkali atoms confined in a specific optical lattice potential [Phys. Rev. A 95, 053608 (2017)]. In the low-energy regime, this system is governed by a unique $\mathbb{Z}_N$ gauge theory, where field theory arguments have suggested that it may exhibit two exotic gapless deconfined phases, namely a dipolar liquid phase and a Bose liquid phase, along with two gapped (confined and deconfined) phases. We address these predictions numerically by using large-scale density matrix renormalization group simulations. Our findings provide conclusive evidence for the existence of a gapless Bose liquid phase for $N \geq 7$. We demonstrate that this gapless phase shares the same critical properties as one-dimensional critical phases, resembling weakly coupled chains of Luttinger liquids. In the range of geometries and $N$ considered, the gapless dipolar phase predicted theoretically is still elusive and its characterization will probably require a full two-dimensional treatment.</description>

      <title>Thermal pion condensation: holography meets lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The holographic Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto model is often employed to describe strongly-coupled baryonic and isospin-asymmetric matter, for example in the context of neutron stars. Here we consider the case of vanishing baryon chemical potential, where detailed comparisons to data from lattice QCD are possible. To this end, we extend previous works by including a realistic pion mass and pion condensation into the decompactified limit of the model and evaluate the system for arbitrary isospin chemical potentials and temperatures. After suitably fixing the 3 parameters of the model, we find that the overall phase structure is in excellent agreement with lattice results. This also holds for observables at low temperatures in the strongly coupled regime, while we discover and discuss some discrepancies at large temperatures. Our findings give reassurance for the validity of previous and future applications of this model and highlight the aspects where improvements are needed.</description>

      <title>Landscape of QCD Vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The moduli space of covariantly constant gauge fields is infinite-dimensional and describes non-perturbative solutions of the Yang-Mills equation of superposed chromomagnetic flux tubes (vortices) of opposite magnetic charges. These gauge field configurations are stretched along the potential valleys of a constant energy density and are separated by potential barriers between classically degenerate vacua that are forming a complicated potential landscape of the QCD vacuum. It is suggested that the solutions describe the condensate of dense chromomagnetic vortices representing a dual analog of the Cooper pairs condensate in a superconductor. The solutions represent exact non-perturbative solutions of the YM equation in the background chromomagnetic field.</description>
