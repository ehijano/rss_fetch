      <title>Foundations of Double Operator Integrals with a Variant Approach to the Nonseparable Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to give a self-contained and detailed yet simplified account of the foundations of the theory of double operator integrals, in order to provide an accessible entry point to the theory. We make two new contributions to these foundations: (1) a new proof of the existence of the product of two projection-valued measures, which allows for the definition of the double operator integral for Hilbert-Schmidt operators, and (2) a variant approach to the integral projective tensor product on arbitrary (not necessarily separable) Hilbert spaces using a somewhat more explicit norm than has previously been given. We prove the Daletskii-Krein formula for strongly differentiable perturbations of a densely-defined self-adjoint operator and conclude by reviewing an application of the theory to quantum statistical mechanics.</description>

      <title>Group theoretic quantization of punctured plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We quantize punctured plane, $X=\mathbb{R}^2-\{0\}$, employing Isham's group theoretic quantization procedure. After sketching out a brief review of group theoretic quantization procedure, we apply the quantization scheme to the phase space, $M=X \times \R^2$, corresponding to the punctured plane, $X$. Particularly, we find the canonical Lie group, $\mathscr{G}$, corresponding to the phase space, $M=X \times \R^2$, to be $\mathscr{G} = \R^2 \rtimes (SO(2)\times \R^+)$. We establish an algebra homomorphism between the Lie algebra corresponding to the canonical group, $\mathscr{G} = \R^2 \rtimes (SO(2)\times \R^+)$, and the smooth functions, $f\in C^{\infty}(M)$, in the phase space, $M=X \times \R^2$. Making use of this homomorphism and unitary representation of the canonical group, $\mathscr{G} = \R^2 \rtimes (SO(2)\times \R^+)$, we deduce a quantization map that maps a subspace of classical observables, $f\in C^{\infty}(M)$, to self-adjoint operators on the Hilbert space, $\mathscr{H}$, which is the space of all square integrable functions on $X=\mathbb{R}^2-\{0\}$ with respect to the measure $\dd \mu = \dd \phi\dd\rho/(2\pi\rho)$.</description>

      <title>Strong Kantorovich duality for quantum optimal transport with generic cost and optimal couplings on quantum bits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove Kantorovich duality for a linearized version of a recently proposed non-quadratic quantum optimal transport problem, where quantum channels realize the transport. As an application, we determine optimal solutions of both the primal and the dual problem using this duality in the case of quantum bits and distinguished cost operators, with certain restrictions on the states involved. Finally, we use this information on optimal solutions to give an analytical proof of the triangle inequality for the induced quantum Wasserstein divergences.</description>

      <title>On a semi-discrete model of Maxwell's equations in three and two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a geometric, structure-preserving semi-discrete formulation of Maxwell's equations in both three- and two-dimensional settings within the framework of discrete exterior calculus. This approach preserves the intrinsic geometric and topological structures of the continuous theory while providing a consistent spatial discretization. We analyze the essential properties of the proposed semi-discrete model and compare them with those of the classical Maxwell's equations. As a special case, the model is illustrated on a combinatorial two-dimensional torus, where the semi-discrete Maxwell's equations take the form of a system of first-order linear ordinary differential equations. An explicit expression for the general solution of this system is also derived.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Mixture Models and Surrogate Models for Precision Additive Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we leverage a mixture model learning approach to identify defects in laser-based Additive Manufacturing (AM) processes. By incorporating physics based principles, we also ensure that the model is sensitive to meaningful physical parameter variations. The empirical evaluation was conducted by analyzing real-world data from two AM processes: Directed Energy Deposition and Laser Powder Bed Fusion. In addition, we also studied the performance of the developed framework over public datasets with different alloy type and experimental parameter information. The results show the potential of physics-guided mixture models to examine the underlying physical behavior of an AM system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove existence and finite degeneracy of ground states of energy forms satisfying logarithmic Sobolev inequalities with respect to non vacuum states of Clifford algebras. We then derive the stability of the ground state with respect to certain unbounded perturbations of the energy form. Finally, we show how this provides an infinitesimal approach to existence and uniqueness of the ground state of Hamiltonians considered by L. Gross in QFT, describing spin $1/2$ Dirac particles subject to interactions with an external scalar field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note presents a canonical construction of global observables -sometimes referred to in the literature as macroscopic observables or observables at infinity- in statistical mechanics, providing a unified treatment of both commutative and non-commutative cases. Unlike standard approaches, the framework is formulated directly in the $C^*$-algebraic setting, without relying on any specific representation.</description>

      <title>The Semi-Classical Limit of Quantum Gravity on Corners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study quantum and classical systems defined by the quantum corner symmetry group $QCS = \widetilde{SL}(2,\mathbb{R}) \ltimes H_3$, which arises in the context of quantum gravity. In particular, we relate the quantum observables, defined by representation-theoretic data, to their classical counterparts through generalized Perelomov coherent states and the framework of Berezin quantization. The resulting procedure provides a mathematically well-defined notion of the semi-classical limit of quantum gravity, viewed as the representation theory of the corner symmetry group.</description>

      <title>An Immersed Interface Method for Incompressible Flows and Near Contact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an enhanced immersed interface method for simulating incompressible fluid flows in thin gaps between closely spaced immersed boundaries. This regime, common in engineered structures such as including tribological interfaces and bearing assemblies, poses significant computational challenges because of limitations in grid resolution and the prohibitive cost of mesh refinement near contact. The immersed interface method imposes jump conditions that capture stress discontinuities generated by forces that are concentrated along immersed boundaries. Our approach introduces a bilinear velocity interpolation operator that incorporates jump conditions from multiple nearby interfaces when they occupy the same interpolation stencil. Numerical results demonstrate substantial improvements in both interface and Eulerian velocity accuracy compared to lubrication-based immersed boundary and immersed interface methods. The proposed method improves upon previous interpolation schemes, and eliminates the need for prior knowledge of interface orientation or geometry. This makes it broadly applicable to a wide range of fluid--structure interaction problems involving near-contact dynamics.</description>

      <title>Ensuring Outcome-Based Curriculum Coherence through Systematic CLO-PLO Alignment and Feedback Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study proposes a quantitative framework to enhance curriculum coherence through the systematic alignment of Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs) and Program Learning Outcomes (PLOs), contributing to continuous improvement in outcome-based education. Grounded in accreditation standards such as ABET and NCAAA, the model introduces mathematical tools that map exercises, assessment questions, teaching units (TUs), and student assessment components (SACs) to CLOs and PLOs. This dual-layer approach-combining micro-level analysis of assessment elements with macro-level curriculum evaluation-enables detailed tracking of learning outcomes and helps identify misalignments between instructional delivery, assessment strategies, and program objectives. The framework incorporates alignment matrices, weighted relationships, and practical indicators to quantify coherence and evaluate course or program performance. Application of this model reveals gaps in outcome coverage and underscores the importance of realignment, especially when specific PLOs are underrepresented or CLOs are not adequately supported by assessments. The proposed model is practical, adaptable, and scalable, making it suitable for academic programs. Its systematic structure supports institutions in implementing evidence-based curriculum improvements and provides a reliable mechanism for aligning teaching practices with desired learning outcomes. Ultimately, this framework offers a valuable tool for closing the feedback loop between instructional design, assessment execution, and learning outcomes, thus promoting greater transparency, accountability, and educational effectiveness. Institutions that adopt this model can expect to strengthen their quality assurance processes and help ensure that students graduate with the competencies required by academic standards and professional expectations.</description>

      <title>Equation Discovery, Parametric Simulation, and Optimization Using the Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) Method for the Heat Conduction Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, the capabilities of the Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) method are investigated for three major tasks: modeling, simulation, and optimization in the context of the heat conduction problem. In the modeling phase, the governing equation of heat transfer by conduction is reconstructed through equation discovery using fractional-order derivatives, enabling the identification of the fractional derivative order that best describes the physical behavior. In the simulation phase, the thermal conductivity is treated as a physical parameter, and a parametric simulation is performed to analyze its influence on the temperature field. In the optimization phase, the focus is placed on the inverse problem, where the goal is to infer unknown physical properties from observed data. The effectiveness of the PINN approach is evaluated across these three fundamental engineering problem types and compared against conventional numerical methods. The results demonstrate that although PINNs may not yet outperform traditional numerical solvers in terms of speed and accuracy for forward problems, they offer a powerful and flexible framework for parametric simulation, optimization, and equation discovery, making them highly valuable for inverse and data-driven modeling applications.</description>

      <title>Equivalent class of Emergent Single Weyl Fermion in 3d Topological States: gapless superconductors and superfluids Vs chiral fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we put forward a practical but generic approach towards constructing a large family of $(3+1)$ dimension lattice models which can naturally lead to a single Weyl cone in the infrared (IR) limit. Our proposal relies on spontaneous charge $U(1)$ symmetry breaking to evade the usual no-go theorem of a single Weyl cone in a 3d lattice. We have explored three concrete paths in this approach, all involving fermionic topological symmetry protected states (SPTs). Path a) is to push a gapped SPT in a 3d lattice with time-reversal symmetry (or $T$-symmetry) to a gapless topological quantum critical point (tQCP) which involves a minimum change of topologies,i.e. $\delta N_w=2$ where $\delta N_w$ is the change of winding numbers across the tQCP. Path b) is to peal off excessive degrees of freedom in the gapped SPT via applying $T$-symmetry breaking fields which naturally result in a pair of gapless nodal points of real fermions. Path c) is a hybrid of a) and b) where tQCPs, with $\delta N_w \geq 2$, are further subject to time-reversal-symmetry breaking actions. In the infrared limit, all the lattice models with single Weyl fermions studied here are isomorphic to either a tQCP in a DIII class topological superconductor with a protecting $T$-symmetry, or its dual, a $T$-symmetry breaking superconducting nodal point phase, and therefore form an equivalent class. For a generic $T$-symmetric tQCP along Path a), the conserved-charge operators span a six-dimensional linear space while for a $T$-symmetry breaking gapless state along Path b), c), charge operators typically span a two-dimensional linear space instead. Finally, we pinpoint connections between three spatial dimensional lattice chiral fermion models and gapless real fermions that can naturally appear in superfluids or superconductors studied previously.</description>

      <title>A fast spectral overlapping domain decomposition method with discretization-independent conditioning bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A domain decomposition method for the solution of general variable-coefficient elliptic partial differential equations on regular domains is introduced. The method is based on tessellating the domain into overlapping thin slabs or shells, and then explicitly forming a reduced linear system that connects the different domains. Rank-structure ('H-matrix structure') is exploited to handle the large dense blocks that arise in the reduced linear system. Importantly, the formulation used is well-conditioned, as it converges to a second kind Fredholm equation as the precision in the local solves is refined. Moreover, the dense blocks that arise are far more data-sparse than in existing formulations, leading to faster and more efficient H-matrix arithmetic. To form the reduced linear system, black-box randomized compression is used, taking full advantage of the fact that sparse direct solvers are highly efficient on the thin sub-domains. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our solver can handle oscillatory 2D and 3D problems with as many as 28 million degrees of freedom.</description>

Abstract: We study longest and shortest directed paths in the following natural model of directed random planar maps: the uniform infinite bipolar-oriented triangulation (UIBOT), which is the local limit of uniform bipolar-oriented triangulations around a typical edge. We construct the Busemann function which measures directed distance to $\infty$ along a natural interface in the UIBOT. We show that in the case of longest (resp.\ shortest) directed paths, this Busemann function converges in the scaling limit to a $2/3$-stable L\'evy process (resp.\ a $4/3$-stable L\'evy process).
  We also prove up-to-constants bounds for directed distances in finite bipolar-oriented triangulations sampled from a Boltzmann distribution, and for size-$n$ cells in the UIBOT. These bounds imply that in a typical subset of the UIBOT with $n$ edges, longest directed path lengths are of order $n^{3/4}$ and shortest directed path lengths are of order $n^{3/8}$. These results give the scaling dimensions for discretizations of the (hypothetical) $\sqrt{4/3}$-directed Liouville quantum gravity metrics.
  The main external input in our proof is the bijection of Kenyon-Miller-Sheffield-Wilson (2015). We do not use any continuum theory. We expect that our techniques can also be applied to prove similar results for directed distances in other random planar map models and for longest increasing subsequences in pattern-avoiding permutations.</description>

      <title>Efficient And Stable Third-order Method for Micromagnetics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To address the magnetization dynamics in ferromagnetic materials described by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation under large damping parameters, a third-order accurate numerical scheme is developed by building upon a second-order method \cite{CaiChenWangXie2022} and leveraging its efficiency. This method boasts two key advantages: first, it only involves solving linear systems with constant coefficients, enabling the use of fast solvers and thus significantly enhancing numerical efficiency over existing first or second-order approaches. Second, it achieves third-order temporal accuracy and fourth-order spatial accuracy, while being unconditionally stable for large damping parameters. Numerical tests in 1D and 3D scenarios confirm both its third-order accuracy and efficiency gains. When large damping parameters are present, the method demonstrates unconditional stability and reproduces physically plausible structures. For domain wall dynamics simulations, it captures the linear relationship between wall velocity and both the damping parameter and external magnetic field, outperforming lower-order methods in this regard.</description>

      <title>Strict monotonicity of critical points in independent long-range percolation models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider independent long-range percolation models on locally finite vertex-transitive graphs. Using coupling ideas we prove strict monotonicity of the critical points with respect to local perturbations in the connection function, thereby improving upon previous results obtained via the classical essential enhancement method of Aizenman and Grimmett in several ways. In particular, our approach allows us to work under minimal assumptions, namely shift-invariance and summability of the connection function, and it applies to both undirected and directed bond percolation models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the formalism of Maya diagrams and ladder operators, we describe the algebra of annihilating operators for the class of rational extensions of the harmonic oscillator. This allows us to construct the corresponding coherent state in the sense of Barut and Girardello. The resulting time-dependent function is an exact solution of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation and a joint eigenfunction of the algebra of annihilators. Using an argument based on Schur functions, we also show that the newly exhibited coherent states asymptotically minimize position-momentum uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Quantum Speedup for Finding Independent Set of a Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quadratic speedup of the quantum adiabatic algorithm (QAA) for finding independent sets (ISs) in a graph is proven analytically. In comparison to the best classical algorithm with $O(n^2)$ scaling, where $n$ is the number of vertexes, our quantum algorithm achieves a time complexity of $O(n^2)$ for finding a large IS, which reduces to $O(n)$ for identifying a size-2 IS. The complexity bounds we obtain are confirmed numerically for a specific case with the $O(n^2)$ quantum algorithm outperforming the classical greedy algorithm, that also runs in $O(n^2)$. The definitive analytical and numerical evidence for the quadratic quantum speedup benefited from an analytical framework based on the Magnus expansion in the interaction picture (MEIP), which overcomes the dependence on the ground state degeneracy encountered in conventional energy gap analysis. In addition, our analysis links the performance of QAA to the spectral structure of the median graph, bridging algorithmic complexity, graph theory, and experimentally realizable Rydberg Hamiltonians. The understanding gained provides practical guidance for optimizing near-term Rydberg atom experiments by revealing the significant impact of detuning on blockade violations.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in hyperbolic spaces: Cayley trees, hyperbolic continuum, and BCS theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate $s$-wave superconductivity in negatively curved geometries, focusing on Cayley trees and the hyperbolic plane. Using a self-consistent Bogoliubov-de Gennes approach for trees and a BCS treatment of the hyperbolic continuum, we establish a unified mean-field framework that captures the role of boundaries in hyperbolic spaces. For finite Cayley trees with open boundaries, the superconducting order parameter localizes at the edge while the interior can remain normal, leading to two distinct critical temperatures: $T_\textrm{c}^\textrm{edge} &gt; T_\textrm{c}^\textrm{bulk}$. A corresponding boundary-dominated phase also emerges in hyperbolic annuli and horodisc regions, where radial variations of the local density of states enhance edge pairing. We also demonstrate that the enhancement of the density of states at the boundary is significantly more pronounced for the discrete tree geometry. Our results show that, owing to the macroscopic extent of the boundary, negative curvature can stabilize boundary superconductivity as a phase that persists in the thermodynamic limit on par with the bulk superconductivity. These results highlight fundamental differences between bulk and boundary ordering in hyperbolic matter, and provide a theoretical framework for future studies of correlated phases in negatively curved systems.</description>

Abstract: We appeal to the theory of Jouanolou torsors to model the coherent cohomology of configuration spaces of points in d-dimensional affine space. Using this model, we develop the operadic notion of chiral operations, thus generalizing the notion of chiral algebras of Beilinson and Drinfeld to higher dimensions. To produce examples, we use a higher-dimensional conceptualization of the residue which is inspired by Feynman graph integrals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish optimal stability estimates in terms of the Fraenkel asymmetry with universal dimensional constants for a Lorentzian isoperimetric inequality due to Bahn and Ehrlich and, as a consequence, for a special version of a Lorentzian isoperimetric inequality due to Cavalletti and Mondino. For the Bahn--Ehrlich inequality the Fraenkel asymmetry enters the stability result quadratically like in the Euclidean case while for the Cavalletti--Mondino inequality the Fraenkel asymmetry enters linearly. As it turns out, refining the latter inequality through an additional geometric term allows us to recover the more common quadratic stability behavior. Along the way, we provide simple self-contained proofs for the above isoperimetric-type inequalities.</description>

Abstract: In this letter we show that the one-loop QCD $\beta$-function can be obtained from an index theorem on twistor space. This is achieved by recalling that the $\theta$-angle of self-dual gauge theory flows according the one-loop $\beta$-function. Rewriting self-dual gauge theory as a holomorphic theory on twistor space this flow can be computed as the anomaly to scale invariance. The one-loop Weyl anomaly coefficient $a-c$ can be recovered similarly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the sense in which the continuum limit of a broad class of discrete materials with periodic structures can be viewed as a nonlinear elastic material. While we are not the first to consider this question, our treatment is more general and more physical than those in the literature. Indeed, it applies to a broad class of systems, including ones that possess mechanisms; and we discuss how the degeneracy that plagues prior work in this area can be avoided by penalizing change of orientation. A key motivation for this work is its relevance to mechanism-based mechanical metamaterials. Such systems often have ``soft modes'', achieved in typical examples by modulating mechanisms. Our results permit the following more general definition of a soft mode: it is a macroscopic deformation whose effective energy vanishes -- in other words, one whose spatially-averaged elastic energy tends to zero in the continuum limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In connection with recent work on smallest gaps, C. Charlier proves that the 1-point function of a suitable planar Coulomb system $\{z_j\}_1^n$, in the determinantal case with respect to an external potential $Q(z)$, admits the expansion, as $n\to\infty$, $$R_n\bigg(z_0+\frac t {\sqrt{2n\partial\bar{\partial} Q(z_0)}}\nu(z_0)\bigg)=n\partial\bar{\partial} Q(z_0)\frac {\operatorname{erfc} t}2+\sqrt{n\partial\bar{\partial} Q(z_0)}\,C(z_0;t)+\mathcal{O}(\log^3 n).$$ Here $t$ is a real parameter, $z_0$ is a regular boundary point of the (connected) Coulomb droplet and $\nu(z_0)$ is the outwards unit normal; the coefficient $C(z_0;t)$ has an apriori structure depending on a number of parameters.
  In this note we identify the parameters and obtain a formula for $C(z_0;t)$ in potential theoretic and geometric terms. Our formula holds for a large class of potentials such that the droplet is connected with smooth boundary. Our derivation uses the well known expectation of fluctuations formula.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the canonical ensemble of a system of point particles on the sphere interacting via a logarithmic pair potential. In this setting, we study the associated Gibbs measure and partition function, and we derive explicit formulas relating the critical temperature, at which the partition function diverges, to a certain discrete optimization problem. We further show that the asymptotic behavior of both the partition function and the Gibbs measure near the critical temperature is governed by the same optimization problem. Our approach relies on the Fulton--MacPherson compactification of configuration spaces and analytic continuation of complex powers. To illustrate the results, we apply them to well-studied systems, including the two-component plasma and the Onsager model of turbulence. In particular, for the two-component plasma with general charges, we describe the formation of dipoles close to the critical temperature, which we determine explicitly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2006.10105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that quantum groups are relevant to describe the quantum regime of 3d gravity. They encode a deformation of the gauge symmetries parametrized by the value of the cosmological constant. They appear as a form of regularization either through the quantization of the Chern-Simons formulation or the state sum approach of Turaev-Viro. Such deformations are perplexing from a continuum and classical picture since the action is defined in terms of undeformed gauge invariance. We present here a novel way to derive from first principle and from the classical action such quantum group deformation. The argument relies on two main steps. First we perform a canonical transformation, which deformed the gauge invariance and the boundary symmetries, and makes them depend on the cosmological constant. Second we implement a discretization procedure relying on a truncation of the degrees of freedom from the continuum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11350v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relaxing the postulates of an axiomatic theory is a natural way to find more general theories, and historically, the discovery of non-Euclidean geometry is a famous example of this procedure. Here, we use this way to extend quantum mechanics by ignoring the heart of Heisenberg's quantum mechanics -- We do not assume the existence of a position operator that satisfies the Heisenberg commutation relation, $[\hat x,\hat p]=i\hbar$. The remaining axioms of quantum theory, besides Galilean symmetry, lead to a more general quantum theory with a free parameter $l_0$ of length dimension, such that as $l_0 \to 0$ the theory reduces to standard quantum theory. Perhaps surprisingly, this non-Heisenberg quantum theory, without a priori assumption of the non-commutation relation, leads to a modified Heisenberg uncertainty relation, $\Delta x \Delta p\geq \sqrt{\hbar^2/4+l_0^2(\Delta p)^2}$, which ensures the existence of a minimal position uncertainty, $l_0$, as expected from various quantum gravity studies. By comparing the results of this framework with some observed data, which includes the first longitudinal normal modes of the bar gravitational wave detector AURIGA and the $1S-2S$ transition in the hydrogen atom, we obtain upper bounds on the $l_0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We combine the theory of Cartan-Tanaka prolongations with the Molien-Weyl integral formula and Hilbert-Poincar\'e series to compute the Spencer cohomology groups of the $D=11$ Poincar\'e superalgebra $\mathfrak p$, relevant for superspace formulations of $11$-dimensional supergravity in terms of nonholonomic superstructures. This includes novel fermionic Spencer groups, providing with new cohomology classes of $\mathbb Z$-grading $1$ and form number $2$. Using the Hilbert-Poincar\'e series and the Euler characteristic, we also explore Spencer cohomology contributions in higher form numbers. We then propose a new general definition of filtered deformations of graded Lie superalgebras along first-order fermionic directions and investigate such deformations of $\mathfrak p$ that are maximally supersymmetric. In particular, we establish a no-go type theorem for maximally supersymmetric filtered subdeformations of $\mathfrak p$ along timelike (i.e., generic) first-order fermionic directions.</description>

      <title>Error Estimates and Higher Order Trotter Product Formulas in Jordan-Banach Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20604v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In quantum computing, Trotter estimates are critical for enabling efficient simulation of quantum systems and quantum dynamics, help implement complex quantum algorithms, and provide a systematic way to control approximate errors. In this paper, we extend the analysis of Trotter-Suzuki approximations, including third and higher orders, to Jordan-Banach algebras. We solve an open problem in our earlier paper on the existence of second-order Trotter formula error estimation in Jordan-Banach algebras. To illustrate our work, we apply our formula to simulate Trotter-factorized spins, and show improvements in the approximations. Our approach demonstrates the adaptability of Trotter product formulas and estimates to non-associative settings, which offers new insights into the applications of Jordan algebra theory to operator dynamics.</description>

      <title>Mirror symmetric Gamma conjecture for toric GIT quotients via Fourier transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal X=[(\mathbb C^r\setminus Z)/G]$ be a toric Fano orbifold. We compute the Fourier transform of the $G$-equivariant quantum cohomology central charge of any $G$-equivariant line bundle on $\mathbb C^r$ with respect to certain choice of parameters. This gives the quantum cohomology central charge of the corresponding line bundle on $\mathcal X$, while in the oscillatory integral expression it becomes the oscillatory integral in the mirror Landau-Ginzburg mirror of $\mathcal X$. Moving these parameters to real numbers simultaneously deforms the integration cycle to the mirror Lagrangian cycle of that line bundle. This computation produces a new proof the mirror symmetric Gamma conjecture for $\mathcal X$.</description>

      <title>A Constrained Saddle Search Approach for Constructing Singular and Flexible Bar Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Singularity analysis is essential in robot kinematics, as singular configurations cause loss of control and kinematic indeterminacy. This paper models singularities in bar frameworks as saddle points on constrained manifolds. Given an under-constrained, non-singular bar framework, by allowing one edge to vary its length while fixing lengths of others, we define the squared length of the free edge as an energy functional and show that its local saddle points correspond to singular and flexible frameworks. Using our constrained saddle search approach, we identify previously unknown singular and flexible bar frameworks, providing new insights into singular robotics design and analysis.</description>

      <title>Critical ageing correlators from Schr\"odinger-invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For ageing systems, quenched onto a critical temperature $T=T_c$ such that the dominant noise comes from the thermal bath, with a non-conserved order-parameter and in addition with dynamical exponent ${z}=2$, the form of the two-time auto-correlator as well as the time-space form of the single-time correlator are derived from Schr\"odinger-invariance, generalised to non-equilibrium ageing. These findings reproduce the exact results in the $1D$ Glauber-Ising model at $T=0$ and the critical spherical model in $d&gt;2$ dimensions.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{N}=2$ AdS hypermultiplets in harmonic superspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the harmonic superspace formulation of $\mathcal{N}=2$ hypermultiplet in AdS$_4$ background, starting from the proper realization of $4D, \mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal group $SU(2,2|2)$ on the analytic subspace coordinates. The key observation is that $\mathcal{N}=2$ AdS$_4$ supergroup $OSp(2|4)$ can be embedded as a subgroup in the superconformal group through introducing a constant symmetric matrix $c^{(ij)}$ and identifying the AdS supercharge as $\Psi^i_\alpha = Q^i_\alpha + c^{ik} S_{k\alpha}$, with $Q$ and $S$ being generators of the standard and conformal $4D, {\cal N}=2$ supersymmetries. Respectively, the AdS cosmological constant is given by the square of $c^{(ij)}$, $\Lambda = -12 c^{ij}c_{ij}$. We construct the $OSp(2|4)$ invariant hypermultiplet mass term by adding, to the coordinate AdS transformations, a piece realized as an extra $SO(2)$ rotation of the hypermultiplet superfield. It is analogous to the central charge $x^5$ transformation of flat $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry and turns into the latter in the super Minkowski limit. As another new result, we explicitly construct the superfield Weyl transformation to the $OSp(2|4)$ invariant AdS integration measure over the analytic superspace, which provides, in particular, a basis for unconstrained superfield formulations of the AdS$_4$-deformed $\mathcal{N}=2$ hyper K\"ahler sigma models. We find the proper redefinition of $\theta$ coordinates ensuring the AdS-covariant form of the analytic superfield component expansions.</description>
