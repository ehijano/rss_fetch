      <title>Single replica spin-glass phase detection using field variation and machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin-glass model used the replica symmetry method to find the phase transition of the system. In 1979-1980, Parisi proposed a solution based on replica symmetry breaking (RSB), which allowed him to identify the underlying phases of complex systems such as spin-glasses. Regardless of the method used for detection, the intrinsic phase of a system exists whether or not replicas are considered. We introduce a single replica method of spin-glass phase detection using the field's variation experienced by each spin in a system configuration. This method focuses on a single replica with quenched random couplings. Each spin inevitably observes a different field from the others. Our results show that the mean and variance of fields named "Spontaneous Configurational Field" experienced by spins are suitable indicators to explore different ferromagnetic, paramagnetic, and mixed phases. To classify different phases of the system with defined indicators we have developed an algorithm based on machine learning to analyze the desired samples.</description>

      <title>Topological Modes in Monitored Quantum Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical quantum systems both driven by unitary evolutions and monitored through measurements have proved to be fertile ground for exploring new dynamical quantum matters. While the entanglement structure and symmetry properties of monitored systems have been intensively studied, the role of topology in monitored dynamics is much less explored. In this work, we investigate novel topological phenomena in the monitored dynamics through the lens of free-fermion systems. Free-fermion monitored dynamics were previously shown to be unified with the Anderson localization problem under the Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classification. Guided by this unification, we identify the topological area-law-entangled phases in the former setting through the topological classification of disordered insulators and superconductors in the latter. As examples, we focus on 1+1D free-fermion monitored dynamics in two symmetry classes, DIII and A. We construct quantum circuit models to study different topological area-law phases and their domain walls in the respective symmetry classes. We find that the domain wall between topologically distinct area-law phases hosts dynamical topological modes whose entanglement is protected from being quenched by the measurements in the monitored dynamics. We demonstrate how to manipulate these topological modes by programming the domain-wall dynamics. In particular, for topological modes in class DIII, which behave as unmeasured Majorana modes, we devise a protocol to braid them and study the entanglement generated in the braiding process.</description>

      <title>New mechanism to enhance electron transverse transport by composite formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anomalous transverse transport of electrons such as the anomalous Hall effect and the anomalous Nernst effect provide opportunities to realize advanced spintronic and thermoelectric devices. To materialize these opportunities, it is crucial to strengthen the transverse transport. There have been considerable efforts to find new materials that fulfill this goal. Topological materials received a surge of recent attention in this regard. Here we report a different approach to enhance the transverse transport. Instead of searching for new materials, we propose mixing known materials to form composites. We show theoretically that randomly mixed arrays of two materials can exhibit significantly stronger transverse transport than the constituent materials. This enhancement is experimentally demonstrated for mixtures of crystallized and amorphous ferromagnetic metals. We identify the requirement of this enhancement, which can be satisfied by a wide class of materials. Thus, this scheme provides a universal method to strengthen transverse transport, together with rooms to accommodate various engineering requirements for device applications.</description>

      <title>Efficiency of the hidden fermion determinant states Ansatz in the light of different complexity measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding reliable approximations to the quantum many-body problem is one of the central challenges of modern physics. Elemental to this endeavor is the development of advanced numerical techniques pushing the limits of what is tractable. One such recently proposed numerical technique are neural quantum states. This new type of wavefunction based Ans\"atze utilizes the expressivity of neural networks to tackle fundamentally challenging problems, such as the Mott transition. In this paper we aim to gauge the universalness of one representative of neural network Ans\"atze, the hidden-fermion slater determinant approach. To this end, we study five different fermionic models each displaying volume law scaling of the entanglement entropy. For these, we correlate the effectiveness of the Ansatz with different complexity measures. Each measure indicates a different complexity in the absence of which a conventional Ansatz becomes efficient. We provide evidence that whenever one of the measures indicates proximity to a parameter region in which a conventional approach would work reliable, the neural network approach also works reliable and efficient. This highlights the great potential, but also challenges for neural network approaches: Finding suitable points in theory space around which to construct the Ansatz in order to be able to efficiently treat models unsuitable for their current designs.</description>

      <title>Quantum adiabatic optimization with Rydberg arrays: localization phenomena and encoding strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum dynamics of the encoding scheme proposed in [Nguyen et al., PRX Quantum 4, 010316 (2023)], which encodes optimization problems on graphs with arbitrary connectivity into Rydberg atom arrays. Here, a graph vertex is represented by a wire of atoms, and the (crossing) crossing-with-edge gadget is placed at the intersection of two wires to (de)couple their degrees of freedom and reproduce the graph connectivity. We consider the fundamental geometry of two vertex-wires intersecting via a single gadget and look at minimum gap scaling with system size along adiabatic protocols. We find that both polynomial and exponential scaling are possible and, by means of perturbation theory, we relate the exponential closing of the minimum gap to an unfavorable localization of the ground-state wavefunction. Then, on the QuEra Aquila neutral atom machine, we observe such localization and its effect on the success probability of finding the correct solution to the encoded optimization problem. Finally, we propose possible strategies to avoid this quantum bottleneck, leading to an exponential improvement in the adiabatic performance.</description>

      <title>Crumpled-to-flat transition of quenched disordered membranes at two-loop order</title>

Abstract: We investigate the effects of quenched elastic disorder on the nature of the crumpling-to-flat transition of $D$-dimensional polymerized membranes using a two-loop computation near the upper critical dimension $D_c=4$. While the pure system undergoes fluctuation-induced first order transitions below $D_c$ and for an embedding dimension $d&lt;d_{c,pure}\simeq 218.2$, one observes, in presence of disorder, the emergence of various regions of second order governed by a disordered stable fixed point for $d&lt;d_{c1}\sim d_{c,pure}$. This opens the possibility of a new universality class associated with the crumpling-to-flat transition of disordered membranes in $d=3$</description>

      <title>Complexity-stability relationships in competitive disordered dynamical systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11014v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robert May famously used random matrix theory to predict that large, complex systems cannot admit stable fixed points. However, this general conclusion is not always supported by empirical observation: from cells to biomes, biological systems are large, complex, and often stable. In this paper, we revisit May's argument in light of recent developments in both ecology and random matrix theory. We focus on competitive systems, and, using a nonlinear generalization of the competitive Lotka-Volterra model, we show that there are, in fact, two kinds of complexity-stability relationships in disordered dynamical systems: if self-interactions grow faster with density than cross-interactions, complexity is destabilizing; but if cross-interactions grow faster than self-interactions, complexity is stabilizing.</description>

      <title>Achieving the volume-law entropy regime with random-sign Dicke states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Manipulating entanglement, which reflects non-local correlations in a quantum system and defines the complexity of describing its wave function, represents the extremely tough challenge in the fields of quantum computing, quantum information, and condensed matter physics. In this work, by the example of the well-structured Dicke states we demonstrate that the complexity of these real-valued wave functions can be accurately tuned by introducing a random-sign structure, which allows us to explore the regime of the volume-law entanglement. Importantly, setting nontrivial sign structure one can increase the entanglement entropy of the Dicke state to the values that are close to Page's estimates for Haar-random states. The practical realization of these random-sign Dicke states is possible on different physical platforms with shallow quantum circuits. On the level of the measurements the change in the quantum state complexity due to sign structure can be traced out with the dissimilarity measure that estimates multi-scale variety of patterns in bit-string arrays.</description>

      <title>Temporal Complexity of a Hopfield-Type Neural Model in Random and Scale-Free Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12895v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hopfield network model and its generalizations were introduced as a model of associative, or content-addressable, memory. They were widely investigated both as an unsupervised learning method in artificial intelligence and as a model of biological neural dynamics in computational neuroscience. The complexity features of biological neural networks have attracted the scientific community's interest for the last two decades. More recently, concepts and tools borrowed from complex network theory were applied to artificial neural networks and learning, thus focusing on the topological aspects. However, the temporal structure is also a crucial property displayed by biological neural networks and investigated in the framework of systems displaying complex intermittency. The Intermittency-Driven Complexity (IDC) approach indeed focuses on the metastability of self-organized states, whose signature is a power-decay in the inter-event time distribution or a scaling behaviour in the related event-driven diffusion processes. The investigation of IDC in neural dynamics and its relationship with network topology is still in its early stages. In this work, we present the preliminary results of an IDC analysis carried out on a bio-inspired Hopfield-type neural network comparing two different connectivities, i.e., scale-free vs. random network topology. We found that random networks can trigger complexity features similar to that of scale-free networks, even if with some differences and for different parameter values, in particular for different noise levels</description>

      <title>Effect of Random Pinning on the Yielding Transition of Amorphous Solid under Oscillatory Shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of random pinning, where we freeze the relaxation degrees of freedom for a fraction of randomly selected particles, on the yielding transition under oscillatory shear through extensive computer simulations. Using Kob-Anderson model as our model glass former, we pin a fraction of the particles. These pinned particles can move affinely under the imposed oscillatory shear deformation but are not allowed to relax through subsequent rearrangements due to plastic events. As the fraction of pinned particles increases, the system transitions from being a fragile glass former to a strong glass former. This gives us opportunity to examine how changes in fragility impact the yielding transition. Our results demonstrate notable differences in the yielding transition between strong and fragile glass formers under random pinning. This aligns with previous observations where fragility was altered by changing the packing fraction in soft sphere model albeit with a main difference that random pinning significantly suppresses the formation of shear bands, even in well-annealed glass samples.</description>
