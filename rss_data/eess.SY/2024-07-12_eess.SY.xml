      <title>Analysis of extremum seeking control for wind turbine torque controller optimization by aerodynamic and generator power objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wind turbines degrade over time, resulting in varying structural, aeroelastic, and aerodynamic properties. In contrast, the turbine controller calibrations generally remain constant, leading to suboptimal performance and potential stability issues. The calibration of wind turbine controller parameters is therefore of high interest. To this end, several adaptive control schemes based on extremum seeking control (ESC) have been proposed in the literature. These schemes have been successfully employed to maximize turbine power capture by optimization of the $K\omega^2$-type torque controller. In practice, ESC is performed using electrical generator power, which is easily obtained. This paper analyses the feasibility of torque gain optimization using aerodynamic and generator powers. It is shown that, unlike aerodynamic power, using the generator power objective limits the dither frequency to lower values, reducing the convergence rate unless the phase of the demodulation ESC signal is properly adjusted. A frequency-domain analysis of both systems shows distinct phase behavior, impacting ESC performance. A solution is proposed by constructing an objective measure based on an estimate of the aerodynamic power.</description>

      <title>Performance-Barrier Event-Triggered Control of a Class of Reaction-Diffusion PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ the recent performance-barrier event-triggered control (P-ETC) for achieving global exponential convergence of a class of reaction-diffusion PDEs via PDE backstepping control. Rather than insisting on a strictly monotonic decrease of the Lyapunov function for the closed-loop system, P-ETC allows the Lyapunov function to increase as long as it remains below an acceptable performance-barrier. This approach integrates a performance residual, the difference between the value of the performance-barrier and the Lyapunov function, into the triggering mechanism. The integration adds flexibility and results in fewer control updates than with regular ETC (R-ETC) that demands a monotonic decrease of the Lyapunov function. Our P-ETC PDE backstepping design ensures global exponential convergence of the closed-loop system in the spatial L^2 norm, without encountering Zeno phenomenon. To avoid continuous monitoring of the triggering function that generates events, we develop periodic event-triggered and self-triggered variants (P-PETC and P-STC, respectively) of the P-ETC. The P-PETC only requires periodic evaluation of the triggering function whereas the P-STC preemptively computes the time of the next event at the current event time using the system model and continuously available system states. The P-PETC and P-STC also ensure a Zeno-free behavior and deliver performance equivalent to that of the continuous-time P-ETC which requires continuous evaluation of the triggering function, in addition to the continuous sensing of the state. We provide numerical simulations to illustrate the proposed technique and to compare it with R-ETC associated with strictly decreasing Lyapunov functions.</description>

      <title>Integrated User Matching and Pricing in Round-Trip Car-Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional round-trip car rental systems mandate users to return vehicles to their point of origin, limiting the system adaptability to meet diverse mobility demands. This constraint often leads to fleet under-utilization and incurs high parking costs for idle vehicles. To address this inefficiency, we propose a N-user matching algorithm which is designed to facilitate one-way trips within the round-trip rental framework. Our algorithm addresses the joint problem of optimal pricing and user matching through a Two-Stage Integer Linear Programming (ILP)-based formulation. In the first stage, optimal rental prices are determined by setting a risk factor that governs the likelihood of matching a set of N-user. The second stage involves maximizing expected profit through a novel ILP-based user-matching formulation. Testing our algorithm on real-world scenarios demonstrates an approximate 35\% increase in demand fulfillment. Additionally, we assess the model robustness under uncertainty by varying factors such as the risk factor (probability of user ride acceptance at the offered price), cost factor (rental cost-to-fare ratio), and maximum chain length.</description>

      <title>Improved Model and Analysis for RIS-Assisted Indoor Terahertz Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new model for indoor THz communication assisted by RIS. We conduct a realistic modeling of indoor obstacles and analyze their impact on performance. Order statistics are applied to calculate the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of distances from the transmitter to the selected RIS, i.e., the nearest RIS in the bounded indoor environment to the transmitter, and from the selected RIS to the receiver. We calculate the coverage probability (CP) as a function of RIS number, obstacle density, room size, and the transmitter's location. By comparing the numerical results obtained from the analytical expressions with Monte Carlo simulations, we verify the accuracy of our analysis. Through numerical results, it is observed that room size and obstacle density affect the CP in a significant way. However, by optimizing the transmitter's location and increasing the RIS number deployed in the room, the CP can be significantly improved (e.g., an increase of around 15% by optimizing the transmitter's location, and an increase of around 30% by increasing the RIS number deployed in the room).</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Model Predictive Control for Autonomous Vehicle Steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the development of autonomous driving technology, there are increasing demands for vehicle control, and MPC has become a widely researched topic in both industry and academia. Existing MPC control methods based on vehicle kinematics or dynamics have challenges such as difficult modeling, numerous parameters, strong nonlinearity, and high computational cost. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Data-Driven MPC control method for autonomous vehicle steering. This method avoids the need for complex vehicle system modeling and achieves trajectory tracking with relatively low computational time and small errors. We validate the control effectiveness of our algorithm in specific scenario through CarSim-Simulink simulation and perform comparative analysis with PID and vehicle kinematics MPC, confirming the feasibility and superiority of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>An Optimal Task Planning and Agent-aware Allocation Algorithm in Collaborative Tasks Combining with PDDL and POPF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Industry 4.0 proposes the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into manufacturing and other industries to create smart collaborative systems which enhance efficiency. The aim of this paper is to develop a flexible and adaptive framework to generate optimal plans for collaborative robots and human workers to replace rigid, hard-coded production line plans in industrial scenarios. This will be achieved by integrating the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL), Partial Order Planning Forwards (POPF) task planner, and a task allocation algorithm. The task allocation algorithm proposed in this paper generates a cost function for general actions in the industrial scenario, such as PICK, PLACE, and MOVE, by considering practical factors such as feasibility, reachability, safety, and cooperation level for both robots and human agents. The actions and costs will then be translated into a language understandable by the planning system using PDDL and fed into POPF solver to generate an optimal action plan. In the end, experiments are conducted where assembly tasks are executed by a collaborative system with two manipulators and a human worker to test the feasibility of the theory proposed in this paper.</description>

      <title>Energy-Based Control Approaches for Weakly Coupled Electromechanical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the regulation and trajectory-tracking problems for two classes of weakly coupled electromechanical systems. To this end, we formulate an energy-based model for these systems within the port-Hamiltonian framework. Then, we employ Lyapunov theory and the notion of contractive systems to develop control approaches in the port-Hamiltonian framework. Remarkably, these control methods eliminate the need for solving partial differential equations or implementing any change of coordinates and are endowed with a physical interpretation. We also investigate the effect of coupled damping on the transient performance and convergence rate of the closed-loop system. Finally, the applicability of the proposed approaches is illustrated in two applications of electromechanical systems via simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous driving holds great promise in addressing traffic safety concerns by leveraging artificial intelligence and sensor technology. Multi-Object Tracking plays a critical role in ensuring safer and more efficient navigation through complex traffic scenarios. This paper presents a novel deep learning-based method that integrates radar and camera data to enhance the accuracy and robustness of Multi-Object Tracking in autonomous driving systems. The proposed method leverages a Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory network to incorporate long-term temporal information and improve motion prediction. An appearance feature model inspired by FaceNet is used to establish associations between objects across different frames, ensuring consistent tracking. A tri-output mechanism is employed, consisting of individual outputs for radar and camera sensors and a fusion output, to provide robustness against sensor failures and produce accurate tracking results. Through extensive evaluations of real-world datasets, our approach demonstrates remarkable improvements in tracking accuracy, ensuring reliable performance even in low-visibility scenarios.</description>

      <title>Viability of Low-Cost Infrared Sensors for Short Range Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A classic task in robotics is tracking a target in the external environment. There are several well-documented approaches to this problem. This paper presents a novel approach to this problem using infrared time of flight sensors. The use of infrared time of flight sensors is not common as a tracking approach, typically used for simple motion detectors. However, with the approach highlighted in this paper they can be used to accurately track the position of a moving subject. Traditional approaches to the tracking problem often include cameras, or ultrasonic sensors. These approaches can be expensive and overcompensating in some use cases. The method focused on in this paper can be superior in terms of cost and simplicity.</description>

      <title>Functional Type Expressions of Sequential Circuits with the Notion of Referring Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the notion of referring forms as a new metric for analyzing sequential circuits from a functional perspective. Sequential circuits are modeled as causal stream functions, the outputs of which depend solely on the past and current inputs. Referring forms are defined based on the type expressions of functions and represent how a circuit refers to past inputs. The key contribution of this study is identifying a universal property in multiple clock domain circuits using referring forms. This theoretical framework is expected to enhance the comprehension and analysis of sequential circuits.</description>

      <title>Model Predictive Control For Mobile Manipulators Based On Neural Dynamics(Extended version)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article focuses on the trajectory tracking problem of mobile manipulators (MMs). Firstly, we construct a position and orientation model predictive tracking control (POMPTC) scheme for mobile manipulators. The proposed POMPTC scheme can simultaneously minimize the tracking error, joint velocity, and joint acceleration. Moreover, it can achieve synchronous control for the position and orientation of the end-effector. Secondly, a finite-time convergent neural dynamics (FTCND) model is constructed to find the optimal solution of the POMPTC scheme. Then, based on the proposed POMPTC scheme, a non-singular fast terminal sliding model (NFTSM) control method is presented, which considers the disturbances caused by the base motion on the manipulator at the dynamic level. It can achieve finite-time tracking performance and improve the anti-disturbances ability. Finally, simulation and experiments show that the proposed control method has the advantages of strong robustness, fast convergence, and high control accuracy.</description>

      <title>Evolving Network Modeling Driven by the Degree Increase and Decrease Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ever since the Barab\'{a}si-Albert (BA) scale-free network has been proposed, network modeling has been studied intensively in light of the network growth and the preferential attachment (PA). However, numerous real systems are featured with a dynamic evolution including network reduction in addition to network growth. In this paper, we propose a novel mechanism for evolving networks from the perspective of vertex degree. We construct a queueing system to describe the increase and decrease of vertex degree, which drives the network evolution. In our mechanism, the degree increase rate is regarded as a function positively correlated to the degree of a vertex, ensuring the preferential attachment in a new way. Degree distributions are investigated under two expressions of the degree increase rate, one of which manifests a ``long tail'', and another one varies with different values of parameters. In simulations, we compare our theoretical distributions with simulation results and also apply them to real networks, which presents the validity and applicability of our model.</description>

Abstract: The contributions of this technical note are twofold. Firstly, we formulate an optimization problem to obtain a linear representation of a nonlinear vector field based on a system's trajectory. We also prove that its cost function is strictly convex, given the trajectory is persistently exciting. Under certain observability conditions, we provide results that guarantee the Hurwitz stability of the global minimizer. Secondly, we present a novel algorithm based on point-wise geometric flows to estimate the boundary of the region of attraction. We show that the algorithm converges to the exact boundary of the region of attraction under certain assumptions on the system dynamics. Finally, we validate the results using simulations on various nonlinear autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Large Language Models into Production Systems for Enhanced Task Automation and Flexibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to integrating large language model (LLM) agents into automated production systems, aimed at enhancing task automation and flexibility. We organize production operations within a hierarchical framework based on the automation pyramid. Atomic operation functionalities are modeled as microservices, which are executed through interface invocation within a dedicated digital twin system. This allows for a scalable and flexible foundation for orchestrating production processes. In this digital twin system, low-level, hardware-specific data is semantically enriched and made interpretable for LLMs for production planning and control tasks. Large language model agents are systematically prompted to interpret these production-specific data and knowledge. Upon receiving a user request or identifying a triggering event, the LLM agents generate a process plan. This plan is then decomposed into a series of atomic operations, executed as microservices within the real-world automation system. We implement this overall approach on an automated modular production facility at our laboratory, demonstrating how the LLMs can handle production planning and control tasks through a concrete case study. This results in an intuitive production facility with higher levels of task automation and flexibility. Finally, we reveal the several limitations in realizing the full potential of the large language models in autonomous systems and point out promising benefits.

      <title>Multi-Threshold AoII-Optimum Sampling Policies for CTMC Information Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study push-based sampling and transmission policies for a status update system consisting of a general finite-state continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) information source with known dynamics, with the goal of minimizing the average age of incorrect information (AoII). The problem setting we investigate involves an exponentially distributed delay channel for transmissions and a constraint on the average sampling rate. We first show that the optimum sampling and transmission policy is a 'multi-threshold policy', where the thresholds depend on both the estimation value and the state of the original process, and sampling and transmission need to be initiated when the instantaneous AoII exceeds the corresponding threshold, called the estimation- and state-aware transmission (ESAT) policy. Subsequently, we formulate the problem of finding the thresholds as a constrained semi-Markov decision process (CSMDP) and the Lagrangian approach. Additionally, we propose two lower complexity sub-optimum policies, namely the estimation-aware transmission (EAT) policy, and the single-threshold (ST) policy, for which it is possible to obtain these thresholds for CTMCs with relatively larger number of states. The underlying CSMDP formulation relies on the 'multi-regime phase-type' (MRPH) distribution which is a generalization of the well-known phase-type distribution, which allows us to obtain the distribution of time until absorption in a CTMC whose transition rates change with respect to time in a piece-wise manner. The effectiveness of the proposed ESAT, EAT and ST sampling and transmission policies are shown through numerical examples, along with comparisons with a baseline scheme that transmits packets according to a Poisson process in out-of-sync periods.</description>

      <title>MBD-NODE: Physics-informed data-driven modeling and simulation of constrained multibody systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a framework that can integrate prior physical information, e.g., the presence of kinematic constraints, to support data-driven simulation in multi-body dynamics. Unlike other approaches, e.g., Fully-connected Neural Network (FCNN) or Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-based methods that are used to model the system states directly, the proposed approach embraces a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE) paradigm that models the derivatives of the system states. A central part of the proposed methodology is its capacity to learn the multibody system dynamics from prior physical knowledge and constraints combined with data inputs. This learning process is facilitated by a constrained optimization approach, which ensures that physical laws and system constraints are accounted for in the simulation process.

      <title>Hardware Neural Control of CartPole and F1TENTH Race Car</title>

Abstract: Nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) has proven to be an effective control method, but it is expensive to compute. This work demonstrates the use of hardware FPGA neural network controllers trained to imitate NMPC with supervised learning. We use these Neural Controllers (NCs) implemented on inexpensive embedded FPGA hardware for high frequency control on physical cartpole and F1TENTH race car. Our results show that the NCs match the control performance of the NMPCs in simulation and outperform it in reality, due to the faster control rate that is afforded by the quick FPGA NC inference. We demonstrate kHz control rates for a physical cartpole and offloading control to the FPGA hardware on the F1TENTH car. Code and hardware implementation for this paper are available at https:// github.com/SensorsINI/Neural-Control-Tools.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Anomaly Detection and Reactive Planning with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models, e.g., large language models (LLMs), trained on internet-scale data possess zero-shot generalization capabilities that make them a promising technology towards detecting and mitigating out-of-distribution failure modes of robotic systems. Fully realizing this promise, however, poses two challenges: (i) mitigating the considerable computational expense of these models such that they may be applied online, and (ii) incorporating their judgement regarding potential anomalies into a safe control framework. In this work, we present a two-stage reasoning framework: First is a fast binary anomaly classifier that analyzes observations in an LLM embedding space, which may then trigger a slower fallback selection stage that utilizes the reasoning capabilities of generative LLMs. These stages correspond to branch points in a model predictive control strategy that maintains the joint feasibility of continuing along various fallback plans to account for the slow reasoner's latency as soon as an anomaly is detected, thus ensuring safety. We show that our fast anomaly classifier outperforms autoregressive reasoning with state-of-the-art GPT models, even when instantiated with relatively small language models. This enables our runtime monitor to improve the trustworthiness of dynamic robotic systems, such as quadrotors or autonomous vehicles, under resource and time constraints. Videos illustrating our approach in both simulation and real-world experiments are available on this project page: https://sites.google.com/view/aesop-llm.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Twinning: from digital twins to model-based reinforcement learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03628v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Digital twins promise to revolutionize engineering by offering new avenues for optimization, control, and predictive maintenance. We propose a novel framework for simultaneously training the digital twin of an engineering system and an associated control agent. The twin's training combines adjoint-based data assimilation and system identification methods, while the control agent's training merges model-based optimal control with model-free reinforcement learning. The control agent evolves along two independent paths: one driven by model-based optimal control and the other by reinforcement learning. The digital twin serves as a virtual environment for confrontation and indirect interaction, functioning as an "expert demonstrator." The best policy is selected for real-world interaction and cloned to the other path if training stagnates. We call this framework Reinforcement Twinning (RT). The framework is tested on three diverse engineering systems and control tasks: (1) controlling a wind turbine under varying wind speeds, (2) trajectory control of flapping-wing micro air vehicles (FWMAVs) facing wind gusts, and (3) mitigating thermal loads in managing cryogenic storage tanks. These test cases use simplified models with known ground truth closure laws. Results show that the adjoint-based digital twin training is highly sample-efficient, completing within a few iterations. For the control agent training, both model-based and model-free approaches benefit from their complementary learning experiences. The promising results pave the way for implementing the RT framework on real systems.</description>

      <title>Real-time MPC with Control Barrier Functions for Autonomous Driving using Safety Enhanced Collocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The autonomous driving industry is continuously dealing with safety-critical scenarios, and nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) is a powerful control strategy for handling such situations. However, standard safety constraints are not scalable and require a long NMPC horizon. Moreover, the adoption of NMPC in the automotive industry is limited by the heavy computation of numerical optimization routines. To address those issues, this paper presents a real-time capable NMPC for automated driving in urban environments, using control barrier functions (CBFs). Furthermore, the designed NMPC is based on a novel collocation transcription approach, named RESAFE/COL, that allows to reduce the number of optimization variables while still guaranteeing the continuous time (nonlinear) inequality constraints satisfaction, through regional convex hull approximation. RESAFE/COL is proven to be 5 times faster than multiple shooting and more tractable for embedded hardware without a decrease in the performance, nor accuracy and safety of the numerical solution. We validate our NMPC-CBF with RESAFE/COL on digital twins of the vehicle and the urban environment and show the safe controller's ability to improve crash avoidance by 91\%.

      <title>Nonlinear Observer Design in Discrete-time Systems: Incorporating LMI Relaxation Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10990v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This manuscript focuses on the $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ observer design for a class of nonlinear discrete systems under the presence of measurement noise or external disturbances. Two new Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) conditions are developed in this method through the utilization of the reformulated Lipschitz property, a new variant of Young inequality and the well-known Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) approach. One of the key components of the proposed LMIs is the generalized matrix multipliers. The judicious use of these multipliers enables us to introduce more numbers of decision variables inside LMIs than the one illustrated in the literature. It aids in adding some extra degrees of freedom from a feasibility point of view, thus enhancing the LMI conditions. Thus, the established LMIs are less conservative than existing ones. Later on, the effectiveness of the developed LMIs and observer is highlighted through a numerical example and the application of state of charge (SoC) estimation in the Li-ion battery model.</description>

      <title>Guaranteeing Service in Connected Microgrids: Storage Planning and Optimal Power Sharing Policy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of renewable energy sources (RES) into power distribution grids poses challenges to system reliability due to the inherent uncertainty in their power production. To address this issue, battery energy sources (BESs) are being increasingly used as a promising solution to counter the uncertainty associated with RES power production. During the overall system planning stage, the optimal capacity of the BES has to be decided. In the operational phase, policies on when to charge the BESs and when to use them to support loads must be determined so that the BES remains within its operating range, avoiding depletion of charge on one hand and remaining within acceptable margins of maximum charge on the other. In this paper, a stochastic control framework is used to determine battery capacity, for microgrids, which ensures that during the operational phase, BESs' operating range is respected with pre-specified high probability. We provide an explicit analytical expression of the required BESs energy capacity for a single microgrid with RES as the main power source. Leveraging insights from the single microgrid case, the article focuses on the design and planning of BESs for the two-microgrid scenario. In this setting, microgrids are allowed to share power while respecting the capacity constraints imposed by the power lines. We characterize the optimal power transfer policy between the microgrids and the optimal BES capacity for multiple microgrids. This provides the BES savings arising from connecting the microgrids.</description>

      <title>On the Stability of Networked Nonlinear Negative Imaginary Systems with Applications to Electrical Power Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the transition to achieving net zero emissions, it has been suggested that a substantial expansion of electric power grids will be necessary to support emerging renewable energy zones. In this paper, we propose employing battery-based feedback control and nonlinear negative imaginary (NI) systems theory to reduce the need for such expansion. By formulating a novel Lur\'e-Postnikov-like Lyapunov function, stability results are presented for the feedback interconnection of two single nonlinear NI systems, while output feedback consensus results are established for the feedback interconnection of two networked nonlinear NI systems based on a network topology. This theoretical framework underpins our design of battery-based control in power transmission systems. We demonstrate that the power grid can be gradually transitioned into the proposed NI systems, one transmission line at a time.</description>

      <title>Predict. Optimize. Revise. On Forecast and Policy Stability in Energy Management Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This research addresses the challenge of integrating forecasting and optimization in energy management systems, focusing on the impacts of switching costs, forecast accuracy, and stability. It proposes a novel framework for analyzing online optimization problems with switching costs and enabled by deterministic and probabilistic forecasts. Through empirical evaluation and theoretical analysis, the research reveals the balance between forecast accuracy, stability, and switching costs in shaping policy performance. Conducted in the context of battery scheduling within energy management applications, it introduces a metric for evaluating probabilistic forecast stability and examines the effects of forecast accuracy and stability on optimization outcomes using the real-world case of the Citylearn 2022 competition. Findings indicate that switching costs significantly influence the trade-off between forecast accuracy and stability, highlighting the importance of integrated systems that enable collaboration between forecasting and operational units for improved decision-making. The study shows that committing to a policy for longer periods can be advantageous over frequent updates. Results also show a correlation between forecast stability and policy performance, suggesting that stable forecasts can mitigate switching costs. The proposed framework provides valuable insights for energy sector decision-makers and forecast practitioners when designing the operation of an energy management system.</description>

      <title>Lecture Notes on Control System Theory and Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2007.01367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is a collection of the lecture notes of the three authors for a first-year graduate course on control system theory and design (ECE 515 , formerly ECE 415) at the ECE Department of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. This is a fundamental course on the modern theory of dynamical systems and their control, and builds on a first-level course in control that emphasizes frequency-domain methods (such as the course ECE 486 , formerly ECE 386, at UIUC ). The emphasis in this graduate course is on state space techniques, and it encompasses modeling , analysis (of structural properties of systems, such as stability, controllability, and observability), synthesis (of observers/compensators and controllers) subject to design specifications, and optimization . Accordingly, this set of lecture notes is organized in four parts, with each part dealing with one of the issues identified above. Concentration is on linear systems , with nonlinear systems covered only in some specific contexts, such as stability and dynamic optimization. Both continuous-time and discrete-time systems are covered, with the former, however, in much greater depth than the latter.
  The main objective of this course is to teach the student some fundamental principles within a solid conceptual framework, that will enable her/him to design feedback loops compatible with the information available on the "states" of the system to be controlled, and by taking into account considerations such as stability, performance, energy conservation, and even robustness. A second objective is to familiarize her/him with the available modern computational, simulation, and general software tools that facilitate the design of effective feedback loops</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.11414v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper deals with the setting where two viruses (say virus 1 and virus 2) coexist in a population, and they are not necessarily mutually exclusive, in the sense that infection due to one virus does not preclude the possibility of simultaneous infection due to the other. We develop a coupled bi-virus susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model from a 4n-state Markov chain model, where n is the number of agents (i.e., individuals or subpopulation) in the population. We identify a sufficient condition for both viruses to eventually die out, and a sufficient condition for the existence, uniqueness and asymptotic stability of the endemic equilibrium of each virus. We establish a sufficient condition and multiple necessary conditions for local exponential convergence to the boundary equilibrium (i.e., one virus persists, the other one dies out) of each virus. Under mild assumptions on the healing rate, we show that there cannot exist a coexisting equilibrium where for each node there is a nonzero fraction infected only by virus 1; a nonzero fraction infected only by virus 2; but no fraction that is infected by both viruses 1 and 2. Likewise, assuming that healing rates are strictly positive, a coexisting equilibrium where for each node there is a nonzero fraction infected by both viruses 1 and 2, but no fraction is infected only by virus 1 (resp. virus 2) does not exist. Further, we provide a necessary condition for the existence of certain other kinds of coexisting equilibria. We show that, unlike the competitive bivirus model, the coupled bivirus model is not monotone. Finally, we illustrate our theoretical findings using an extensive set of in-depth simulations.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Safety Concerns in Automated Driving Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in the field of deep learning and impressive performance of deep neural networks (DNNs) for perception have resulted in an increased demand for their use in automated driving (AD) systems. The safety of such systems is of utmost importance and thus requires to consider the unique properties of DNNs.
  In order to achieve safety of AD systems with DNN-based perception components in a systematic and comprehensive approach, so-called safety concerns have been introduced as a suitable structuring element. On the one hand, the concept of safety concerns is -- by design -- well aligned to existing standards relevant for safety of AD systems such as ISO 21448 (SOTIF). On the other hand, it has already inspired several academic publications and upcoming standards on AI safety such as ISO PAS 8800.
  While the concept of safety concerns has been previously introduced, this paper extends and refines it, leveraging feedback from various domain and safety experts in the field. In particular, this paper introduces an additional categorization for a better understanding as well as enabling cross-functional teams to jointly address the concerns.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous System Identification and Model Predictive Control with No Dynamic Regret</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide an algorithm for the simultaneous system identification and model predictive control of nonlinear systems. The algorithm has finite-time near-optimality guarantees and asymptotically converges to the optimal (non-causal) controller. Particularly, the algorithm enjoys sublinear dynamic regret, defined herein as the suboptimality against an optimal clairvoyant controller that knows how the unknown disturbances and system dynamics will adapt to its actions. The algorithm is self-supervised and applies to control-affine systems with unknown dynamics and disturbances that can be expressed in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Such spaces can model external disturbances and modeling errors that can even be adaptive to the system's state and control input. For example, they can model wind and wave disturbances to aerial and marine vehicles, or inaccurate model parameters such as inertia of mechanical systems. The algorithm first generates random Fourier features that are used to approximate the unknown dynamics or disturbances. Then, it employs model predictive control based on the current learned model of the unknown dynamics (or disturbances). The model of the unknown dynamics is updated online using least squares based on the data collected while controlling the system. We validate our algorithm in both hardware experiments and physics-based simulations. The simulations include (i) a cart-pole aiming to maintain the pole upright despite inaccurate model parameters, and (ii) a quadrotor aiming to track reference trajectories despite unmodeled aerodynamic drag effects. The hardware experiments include a quadrotor aiming to track a circular trajectory despite unmodeled aerodynamic drag effects, ground effects, and wind disturbances.</description>
