      <title>A comparative analysis for different finite element types in strain-gradient elasticity simulations performed on Firedrake and FEniCS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The layer-upon-layer approach in additive manufacturing, open or closed cells in polymeric or metallic foams involve an intrinsic microstructure tailored to the underlying applications. Homogenization of such architectured materials creates metamaterials modeled by higher-gradient models, specifically when the microstructure's characteristic length is comparable to the length scale of the structure. In this study, we conduct a comparative analysis of various finite elements methods for solving problems in strain-gradient elasticity. We employ open-source packages from Firedrake and FEniCS. Different finite element formulations are tested: we implement Lagrange, Argyris, Hermite elements, a Hu--Washizu type (mixed) formulation, as well as isogeometric analysis with Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS). For the numerical study, we investigate one- and two-dimensional problems discussed in the literature of strain-gradient modeling. All developed codes are open-access to encourage research in Finite Element Method (FEM) based computation of generalized continua.</description>

      <title>A computational model for inelastic behaviour and fracture of refractory industrial components under high-temperature conditions, application to slide gate plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work aims to provide a computational model that can describe the complex behaviour of refractory industrial components under working conditions. Special attention is given to the asymmetric tension-compression behaviour and its evolution in the full range of working temperatures. The model accounts for inelastic flow in compression and brittle fracture behaviour in tension by leveraging the continuum-mechanics theory of plasticity and phase-field fracture damage. The model is implemented in the Finite Element open-source platform FEniCS and is used to analyze the fracture phenomenon in the refractory plate used in ladle slide gate systems to control the liquid steel flow from the ladle to the tundish.</description>

      <title>Leveraging NFTs for Spectrum Securitization in 6G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic Spectrum Sharing can enhance spectrum resource utilization by promoting the dynamic distribution of spectrum resources. However, to effectively implement dynamic spectrum resource allocation, certain mechanisms are needed to incentivize primary users to proactively share their spectrum resources. This paper, based on the ERC404 standard and integrating Non-Fungible Token and Fungible Token technologies, proposes a spectrum securitization model to incentivize spectrum resource sharing and implements it on the Ethereum test net.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Combinatorial Optimization of Design Structure Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization (CO) is essential for improving efficiency and performance in engineering applications. As complexity increases with larger problem sizes and more intricate dependencies, identifying the optimal solution become challenging. When it comes to real-world engineering problems, algorithms based on pure mathematical reasoning are limited and incapable to capture the contextual nuances necessary for optimization. This study explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in solving engineering CO problems by leveraging their reasoning power and contextual knowledge. We propose a novel LLM-based framework that integrates network topology and domain knowledge to optimize the sequencing of Design Structure Matrix (DSM)-a common CO problem. Our experiments on various DSM cases demonstrate that the proposed method achieves faster convergence and higher solution quality than benchmark methods. Moreover, results show that incorporating contextual domain knowledge significantly improves performance despite the choice of LLMs. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs in tackling complex real-world CO problems by combining semantic and mathematical reasoning. This approach paves the way for a new paradigm in in real-world combinatorial optimization.</description>

      <title>MORE-Stress: Model Order Reduction based Efficient Numerical Algorithm for Thermal Stress Simulation of TSV Arrays in 2.5D/3D IC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermomechanical stress induced by through-silicon vias (TSVs) plays an important role in the performance and reliability analysis of 2.5D/3D ICs. While the finite element method (FEM) adopted by commercial software can provide accurate simulation results, it is very time- and memory-consuming for large-scale analysis. Over the past decade, the linear superposition method has been utilized to perform fast thermal stress estimations of TSV arrays, but it suffers from a lack of accuracy. In this paper, we propose MORE-Stress, a novel strict numerical algorithm for efficient thermal stress simulation of TSV arrays based on model order reduction. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm can realize a 153-504 times reduction in computational time and a 39-115 times reduction in memory usage compared with the commercial software ANSYS, with negligible errors less than 1%. Our algorithm is as efficient as the linear superposition method, with an order of magnitude smaller errors and fast convergence.</description>

      <title>CMBAnalysis: A Modern Framework for High-Precision Cosmic Microwave Background Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I present CMBAnalysis, a state-of-the-art Python framework designed for high-precision analysis of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation data. This comprehensive package implements parallel Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques for robust cosmological parameter estimation, featuring adaptive integration methods and sophisticated error propagation. The framework incorporates recent advances in computational cosmology, including support for extended cosmological models, detailed systematic error analysis, and optimized numerical algorithms. I demonstrate its capabilities through analysis of Planck Legacy Archive data, achieving parameter constraints competitive with established pipelines while offering significant performance improvements through parallel processing and algorithmic optimizations. Notable features include automated convergence diagnostics, comprehensive uncertainty quantification, and publication-quality visualization tools. The framework's modular architecture facilitates extension to new cosmological models and analysis techniques, while maintaining numerical stability through carefully implemented regularization schemes. My implementation achieves excellent computational efficiency, with parallel MCMC sampling reducing analysis time by up to 75\% compared to serial implementations. The code is open-source, extensively documented, and includes a comprehensive test suite, making it valuable for both research applications and educational purposes in modern cosmology.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Airline Reservation Systems with Edge-Enabled Microservices: A Framework for Real-Time Data Processing and Enhanced User Responsiveness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing complexity of the operations of airline reservations requires a smart solution for the adoption of novel approaches to the development of quick, efficient, and adaptive reservation systems. This paper outlines in detail a conceptual framework for the implementation of edge computing microservices in order to address the shortcomings of traditional centralized architectures. Specifically, as edge computing allows for certain activities such as seat inventory checks, booking processes and even confirmation to be done nearer to the user, thus lessening the overall response time and improving the performance of the system. In addition, the framework value should include achieving the high performance of the system such as low latency, high throughput and higher user experience. The major design components include deployed distributed computing microservices orchestrated by Kubernetes, real-time message processing system with Kafka and its elastic scaling. Other operational components include Prometheus and Grafana, which are used to monitor and manage resources, ensuring that all operational processes are optimized. Although this research focuses on a design and theoretical scheming of the framework, its use is foreseen to be more advantageous in facilitating a transform in the provision of services in the airline industry by improving customers' satisfaction, providing infrastructure which is cheap to install and efficiently supporting technology changes such as artificial intelligence and internet of things embedded systems. This research addresses the increasing demand for new technologies with modern well-distributed and real-time-centric systems and also provides a basis for future case implementation and testing. As such, the proposed architecture offers a market-ready, extensible solution to the problems posed by existing airline reservation systems .</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for generating convex approximations of complex contact models, incorporating experimentally validated models like Hunt &amp; Crossley coupled with Coulomb's law of friction alongside the principle of maximum dissipation. Our approach is robust across a wide range of stiffness values, making it suitable for both compliant surfaces and rigid approximations. We evaluate these approximations across a wide variety of test cases, detailing properties and limitations. We implement a fully differentiable solution in the open-source robotics toolkit, Drake. Our novel hybrid approach enables computation of gradients for complex geometric models while reusing factorizations from contact resolution. We demonstrate robust simulation of robotic tasks at interactive rates, with accurately resolved stiction and contact transitions, supporting effective sim-to-real transfer.</description>

      <title>Scientific Machine Learning Based Reduced-Order Models for Plasma Turbulence Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05972v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates non-intrusive Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) Reduced-Order Models (ROMs) for plasma turbulence simulations. In particular, we focus on Operator Inference (OpInf) to build low-cost physics-based ROMs from data for such simulations. As a representative example, we consider the (classical) Hasegawa-Wakatani (HW) equations used for modeling two-dimensional electrostatic drift-wave turbulence. For a comprehensive perspective of the potential of OpInf to construct predictive ROMs, we consider three setups for the HW equations by varying a key parameter, namely the adiabaticity coefficient. These setups lead to the formation of complex and nonlinear dynamics, which makes the construction of predictive ROMs of any kind challenging. We generate the training datasets by performing direct numerical simulations of the HW equations and recording the computed state data and outputs the over a time horizon of $100$ time units in the turbulent phase. We then use these datasets to construct OpInf ROMs for predictions over $400$ additional time units, that is, $400\%$ more than the training horizon. Our results show that the OpInf ROMs capture important statistical features of the turbulent dynamics and generalize beyond the training time horizon while reducing the computational effort of the high-fidelity simulation by up to five orders of magnitude. In the broader context of fusion research, this shows that non-intrusive SciML ROMs have the potential to drastically accelerate numerical studies, which can ultimately enable tasks such as the design of optimized fusion devices.</description>
