      <title>Homomorphisms from ${\rm SL}(2, k)$ to ${\rm SL}(4, k)$ in positive characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field of positive characteistic $p$ and let ${\rm SL}(n, k)$ denote the special linear algebraic group of degree $n$ over $k$. In this paper, we describe homomorphisms from ${\rm SL}(2, k)$ to ${\rm SL}(4, k)$. As by-products of this description, we give a classification of homomorphisms from ${\rm SL}(2, k)$ to ${\rm SL}(4, k)$ and describe the indecomposable decompositions of homomorphisms from ${\rm SL}(2, k)$ to ${\rm SL}(4, k)$.</description>

      <title>A finite Linear Dependence of Discrete Series Multiplicities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected semisimple simply connected Lie group with a compact Cartan subgroup and let $\Gamma$ be a uniform lattice in $G$. Let $\widehat{G}_d$ denote the set of equivalence classes of unitary discrete series representations of $G$. We prove that for any finite subset of $\widehat{G}_d$ satisfying a certain condition, the associated finite set of discrete series multiplicities in $L^2(\Gamma \backslash G)$ determines all discrete series multiplicities in $L^2(\Gamma \backslash G)$. This allows us to obtain a refinement of the strong multiplicity one result for discrete series representations. As an application, we deduce that for two given levels, the equality of the dimensions of the spaces of cusp forms over a suitable finite set of weights implies the equality of the dimensions of the spaces of cusp forms for all weights.</description>

      <title>On cluster structures of bosonic extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the transition maps for Lusztig's parameterization of the global basis for the bosonic extension $\widehat{\mathcal{A}}(b)$ of the quantum coordinate ring of a unipotent group, where $b$ belongs to the positive braid group $\operatorname{Br}^+$. By examining different reduced expressions of $b$, we establish that the cluster structure on $\widehat{\mathcal{A}}(b)$ remains invariant regardless of the chosen reduced expression. For the simply-laced case, we construct a cluster structure on $\widehat{\mathcal{A}}(b)$ for all $b \in \operatorname{Br}^+$, using a proof distinct from Qin's \cite{qin2024based}.</description>

      <title>Graded representations of current Lie superalgebras $\mathfrak{sl}(1|2)[t]$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is the study of finite-dimensional graded representations of current lie superalgebras $\mathfrak{sl}(1|2)[t]$. We define the notion of super POPs, a combinatorial tool to provide another parametrization of the basis of the local Weyl module given in [2]. We derive the graded character formula of local Weyl module for $\mathfrak{sl}(1|2)[t]$. Furthermore, we construct a short exact sequence of Chari-Venkatesh modules for $\mathfrak{sl}(1|2)[t]$. As a consequence, we prove that Chari-Venkatesh modules are isomorphic to the fusion of generalized Kac modules.</description>

Abstract: We study the decomposition of a generic element $g \in G$ of a connected reductive complex algebraic group $G$ in the form $g = N(g) B(g) \bar{u} N(g)^{-1}$ where $N: G \dashrightarrow \mathcal{N}_-$ and $B : G \dashrightarrow \mathcal{B}_+$ are rational maps onto a unipotent subgroup $\mathcal{N}_-$ and a Borel subgroup $\mathcal{B}_+$ opposite to $\mathcal{N}_-$, and $\bar{u}$ is a representative of a Weyl group element $u$. We introduce a class of rational Weyl group elements that give rise to such decompositions, and study their various properties.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of the Spread-Global Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by constructions from applied topology, there has been recent interest in the homological algebra of linear representations of posets, specifically in homological algebra relative to non-standard exact structures. A prominent example of such exact structure is the spread exact structure, which is an exact structure on the category of representations of a fixed poset whose indecomposable projectives are the spread representations (that is, the indicator representations of convex and connected subsets). The spread-global dimension is known to be finite on finite posets, and unbounded on the collection of Cartesian products between two arbitrary finite total orders. It is conjectured in [AENY23] that the spread-global dimension is bounded on the collection of Cartesian products between a fixed, finite total order and an arbitrary finite total order. We give a positive answer to this conjecture, and, more generally, we prove that the spread-global dimension is bounded on the collection of Cartesian products between any fixed, finite poset and an arbitrary finite total order. In doing this, we also establish the existence of finite spread-resolutions for finitely presented representations of arbitrary upper semilattices.</description>

      <title>Tiling symmetric groups by transpositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For two nonempty subsets $X$ and $Y$ of a group $G$, we say that $(X,Y)$ is a tiling of $G$ if every element of $G$ can be uniquely expressed as $xy$ for some $x\in X$ and $y\in Y$. In 1966, Rothaus and Thompson studied whether the symmetric group $S_n$ with $n\geq3$ admits a tiling $(T_n,Y)$, where $T_n$ consists of the identity and all the transpositions in $S_n$. They showed that no such tiling exists if $1+n(n-1)/2$ is divisible by a prime number at least $\sqrt{n}+2$. In this paper, we establish a new necessary condition for the existence of such a tiling: the subset $Y$ must be partition-transitive with respect to certain partitions of $n$. This generalizes the result of Rothaus and Thompson, as well as a result of Nomura in 1985. We also study whether $S_n$ can be tiled by the set $T_n^*$ of all transpositions, which finally leads us to conjecture that neither $T_n$ nor $T_n^*$ tiles $S_n$ for any $n\geq3$.</description>

Abstract: We study the (extended) orthogonal Yangians associated to the Lie algebras types $B$ and $D$ over a field of positive characteristic. We define the $p$-center for the Yangians and obtain an explicit description of the center in terms of Drinfeld generators, showing that the center is generated by its Harish-Chandra center together with a large $p$-center.</description>

      <title>What is a double star-product?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00699v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Double Poisson brackets, introduced by M. Van den Bergh in 2004, are noncommutative analogs of the usual Poisson brackets in the sense of the Kontsevich-Rosenberg principle: they induce Poisson structures on the space of $N$-dimensional representations $\operatorname{Rep}_N(A)$ of an associative algebra $A$ for any $N$. The problem of deformation quantization of double Poisson brackets was raised by D. Calaque in 2010, and had remained open since then.
  In this paper, we address this problem by answering the question in the title. We present a structure on $A$ that induces a star-product under the representation functor and, therefore, according to the Kontsevich-Rosenberg principle, can be viewed as an analog of star-products in noncommutative geometry. We also provide an explicit example for $A=\Bbbk\langle x_1,\ldots,x_d\rangle$ and prove a double formality theorem in this case. Along the way, we invert the Kontsevich-Rosenberg principle by introducing a notion of double algebra over an arbitrary operad.</description>

      <title>Rational and non-rational two-dimensional conformal field theories arising from lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a (finite-dimensional) real Hilbert space $\mathfrak h$ and an orthogonal projection $p$, we consider the associated Heisenberg Lie algebra and the two-dimensional Heisenberg conformal net. Given an even lattice $Q$ in $\mathfrak h$ with respect to the indefinite bilinear form on $\mathfrak h$ defined by $p$, we construct a two-dimensional conformal net ${\mathcal A}_Q$ extending the Heisenberg conformal net. Moreover, with a certain discreteness assumption on the spectrum of the extension, we show that any two-dimensional extension of the Heisenberg conformal net is of the form ${\mathcal A}_Q$ up to unitary equivalence.
  We consider explicit examples of even lattices where $\mathfrak h$ is two-dimensional and $p$ is one-dimensional, and we show that the extended net may have completely rational or non-completely rational chiral (i.e. one-dimensional lightray) components, depending on the choice of lattice. In the non-rational case, we exhibit the braided equivalence of a certain subcategory of the representation category of the chiral Heisenberg net corresponding to the two-dimensional lattice extension.
  Inspired by the charge and braiding structures of these nets, we construct two-dimensional conformal Wightman fields on the same Hilbert spaces. We show that, in some cases, these Wightman fields generate the corresponding extended nets.</description>

      <title>Projective and anomalous representations of categories and their linearizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We invesigate the relation between projective and anomalous representations of categories, and show how to any anomaly $J\colon \mathcal{C}\to 2\mathrm{Vect}$ one can associate an extension $\mathcal{C}^J$ of $\mathcal{C}$ and a subcategory $\mathcal{C}^J_{\mathrm{ST}}$ of $\mathcal{C}^J$ with the property that: (i) anomalous representations of $\mathcal{C}$ with anomaly $J$ are equivalent to $\mathrm{Vect}$-linear functors $E\colon \mathcal{C}^J\to \mathrm{Vect}$, and (ii) these are in turn equivalent to linear representations of $\mathcal{C}^J_{\mathrm{ST}}$ where "$J$ acts as scalars". This construction, inspired by and generalizing the technique used to linearize anomalous functorial field theories in the physics literature, can be seen as a multi-object version of the classical relation between projective representations of a group $G$, with given $2$-cocycle $\alpha$, and linear representations of the central extension $G^\alpha$ of $G$ associated with $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>Three approaches to the Howe duality between quantum general linear supergroups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Howe duality between quantum general linear supergroups was firstly established by Y. Zhang via quantum coordinate superalgebras. In this paper, we provide two other approaches to this Howe duality. One is constructed by quantum differential operators, while the other is based on the Beilinson-Lusztig-MacPherson realization of $U_q(\mathfrak{gl}_{m|n})$. Moreover, we show that these three approaches are equivalent by giving their action formulas explicitly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce more general notions of Clifford codes and stabilizer codes, the latter we call weak stabilizer codes. This is all formulated in the language of projective representation theory of finite groups and we give a novel description of the detectable errors for a Clifford code. We also give examples of infinite families of non-stabilizer Clifford codes as well as examples of non-Clifford weak stabilizer codes. The latter of these types of examples is a class of codes that have not been studied in the same systematic framework as Clifford codes and stabilizer codes.</description>

      <title>On tori periods of Weil representations of unitary groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine the restriction of Weil representations of unitary groups to maximal tori. In the local case, we show that the Weil representation contains a pair of compatible characters if and only if a root number condition holds. In the global case, we show that a torus period corresponding to a maximal anisotropic torus of the global theta lift of a character does not vanish if and only if the local condition is satisfied everywhere and a central value of an $L$-function does not vanish. Our proof makes use of the seesaw argument and of the well-known theta lifting results from $\operatorname{U}\left(1\right)$ to $\operatorname{U}\left(1\right)$. Our results are used in other papers to construct Arthur packets for $G_2$.</description>

      <title>On a Casselman-Shalika type formula for unramified Speh representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07774v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a Casselman-Shalika type formula for unramified Speh representations. Our formula computes values of the normalized spherical element of the $(k,c)$ model of a Speh representation at elements of the form $\operatorname{diag}\left(g, I_{(k-1)c}\right)$, where $g \in \mathrm{GL}_c\left(F\right)$ for a non-archimedean local field $F$. The formula expresses these values in terms of modified Hall--Littlewood polynomials evaluated at the Satake parameter attached to the representation. Our proof is combinatorial and very simple. It utilizes Macdonald's formula and the unramified computation of the Ginzburg--Kaplan integral. This addresses a question of Lapid-Mao.</description>

      <title>Whittaker-Shintani functions for Fourier-Jacobi models on unitary groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01991v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We state and prove a formula for the Whittaker-Shintani functions associated to Fourier-Jacobi models for p-adic unitary groups and general linear groups. These generalized spherical functions play a fundamental role in the proof of the Gan-Gross-Prasad conjecture for Fourier-Jacobi models. As an application we prove the unramified Ichino-Ikeda conjecture.</description>

      <title>Schubert cells and Whittaker functionals for $\text{GL}(n,\mathbb{R})$ part II: Existence via integration by parts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a new proof of the existence of Whittaker functionals for principal series representation of $\text{GL}(n,\mathbb{R})$, utilizing the analytic theory of distributions. We realize Whittaker functionals as equivariant distributions on $\text{GL}(n,\mathbb{R})$, whose restriction to the open Schubert cell is unique up to a constant. Using a birational map on the Schubert cells, we show that the unique distribution on the open Schubert cell extends to a distribution on the entire space $\text{GL}(n,\mathbb{R})$. This technique gives a proof of the analytic continuation of Jacquet integrals via integration by parts. We briefly discuss an application of the method to the Bessel functions on $\text{GL}(n,\mathbb{R})$.</description>

      <title>Intertwining operators for representations of covering groups of reductive $p$-adic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a covering group of a reductive $p$-adic group. We study intertwining operators between parabolically induced representations of $G$ and prove that they satisfy certain adjointness relations. The Harish-Chandra $\mu$-function is defined as a composition of such intertwining operators for opposite parabolic subgroups of $G$. It can be seen as a complex rational function and we give an explicit formula for it in terms of poles and zeros. The adjointness of the intertwining operators is an important ingredient to prove the formula for the $\mu$-function. To locate the poles of $\mu$, we construct a continuous family of Hermitian forms on a family of parabolically induced representations.</description>

      <title>Representations of $p$-adic groups and orbits with smooth closure in a variety of Langlands parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04163v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we prove the forward direction of the conjecture of Gross-Prasad that an L-packet $\Pi_\phi(G)$ contains a generic representation if and only if $L(s, \phi, \Ad)$ is regular at $s=1$, by assuming the local Langlands correspondence and the $p$-adic Kazhdan-Lusztig hypothesis. We then prove an analogous statement for ABV-packets, which together with Vogan's conjecture on ABV-packets implies that if Arthur's conjectures for $G$ are known, then one direction of Shahidi's enhanced genericity conjecture holds: If an Arthur packet $\Pi_\psi(G)$ contains a generic representation, then $\phi_\psi$ is tempered. In the case where the infinitesimal parameters in question are all unramified, we obtain converses to the above statements. We also offer some speculation about the relationship between Arthur type representations, and singularities in varieties of Langlands parameters defined by Vogan. Finally, we recover some facts about central characters using the results above.</description>

      <title>Endoscopic decompositions and the Hausel-Thaddeus conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.08520v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct natural operators connecting the cohomology of the moduli spaces of stable Higgs bundles with different ranks and genera which, after numerical specialization, recover the topological mirror symmetry conjecture of Hausel-Thaddeus concerning $\mathrm{SL}_n$- and $\mathrm{PGL}_n$-Higgs bundles. This provides a complete description of the cohomology of the moduli space of stable $\mathrm{SL}_n$-Higgs bundles in terms of the tautological classes, and gives a new proof of the Hausel-Thaddeus conjecture, proven recently by Gr\"ochenig-Wyss-Ziegler via p-adic integration.
  Our method is to relate the decomposition theorem for the Hitchin fibration, using vanishing cycle functors, to the decomposition theorem for the twisted Hitchin fibration whose supports are simpler.</description>

      <title>The classification of endotrivial complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04088v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group and $k$ a field of prime characteristic $p$. We give a complete classification of endotrivial complexes, i.e. determine the Picard group $\mathcal{E}_k(G)$ of the tensor-triangulated category $K^b({}_{kG}\mathbf{triv})$, the bounded homotopy category of $p$-permutation modules, which Balmer and Gallauer recently considered. For $p$-groups, we identify $\mathcal{E}_k(-)$ with the rational $p$-biset functor $CF_b(-)$ of Borel-Smith functions and recover a short exact sequence of rational $p$-biset functors constructed by Bouc and Yal\c{c}in. As a consequence, we prove that every $p$-permutation autoequivalence of a $p$-group arises from a splendid Rickard autoequivalence. Additionally, we give a positive answer to a question of Gelvin and Yal\c{c}in, showing the kernel of the Bouc homomorphism for an arbitrary finite group $G$ is described by superclass functions $f: s_p(G) \to \mathbb{Z}$ satisfying the oriented Artin-Borel-Smith conditions.</description>

      <title>An elementary proof of a criterion for subfunctors of Ext to be closed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01203v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{A}$ be an abelian category and let $F$ be a subbifunctor of the additive bifunctor $\text{Ext}_{\mathcal{A}}^{1}(-,-)\colon \mathcal{A}^{\text{op}}\times \mathcal{A}\to \mathsf{Ab}$. Buan proved in [4] that $F$ is closed if, and only if, $F$ has the $3\times 3$-lemma property, a certain diagrammatic property satisfied by the class of $F$-exact sequences. The proof of this result relies on the theory of exact categories and on the Freyd--Mitchell embedding theorem, a very well-known overpowered result. In this paper we provide a proof of Buan's result only by means of elementary methods in abelian categories. To achieve this we survey the required theory of subfunctors leading us to a self-contained exposition of this topic.</description>

      <title>Cohomology of symmetric stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct decompositions of:
  (1) the cohomology of smooth stacks,
  (2) the Borel--Moore homology of $0$-shifted symplectic stacks, and
  (3) the vanishing cycle cohomology of $(-1)$-shifted symplectic stacks,
  assuming a good moduli space exists and the tangent space has a pointwise orthogonal structure. These conditions are satisfied by many stacks of interest, including moduli stacks of semistable $G$-bundles and (twisted) $G$-Higgs bundles on curves, $G$-character stacks of oriented closed 2-manifolds and various 3-manifolds, and moduli stacks of semistable coherent sheaves on Calabi--Yau threefolds and K3 surfaces with generic polarization. As a special case, we prove a PBW-type theorem for cohomological Hall algebras of $3$-Calabi--Yau categories with commutative orientation data, a strong form of the cohomological integrality conjecture for such categories. We define the BPS cohomology as the primary summand of the decomposition. When the stack is smooth, the BPS cohomology coincides with the intersection cohomology of the good moduli space, generalizing a theorem of Meinhardt--Reineke. Using the BPS cohomology for singular spaces, we propose a formulation of the topological mirror symmetry conjecture for the stack of $G$-Higgs bundles generalizing the work of Hausel and Thaddeus for type A groups, and a version of Langlands duality for character stacks of compact oriented 3-manifolds, following Ben-Zvi--Gunningham--Jordan--Safronov.</description>

      <title>Generalized Symmetries of Non-SUSY and Discrete Torsion String Backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: String / M-theory backgrounds with degrees of freedom at a localized singularity provide a general template for generating strongly correlated systems decoupled from lower-dimensional gravity. There are by now several complementary procedures for extracting the associated generalized symmetry data from orbifolds of the form $\mathbb{R}^6 / \Gamma$, including methods based on the boundary topology of the asymptotic geometry, as well as the adjacency matrix for fermionic degrees of freedom in the quiver gauge theory of probe branes. In this paper we show that this match between the two methods also works in non-supersymmetric and discrete torsion backgrounds. In particular, a refinement of geometric boundary data based on Chen-Ruan cohomology matches the expected answer based on quiver data. Additionally, we also show that free (i.e., non-torsion) factors count the number of higher-dimensional branes which couple to the localized singularity. We use this to also extract quadratic pairing terms in the associated symmetry theory (SymTh) for these systems, and explain how these considerations generalize to a broader class of backgrounds.</description>
