      <title>Computation of attractor dimension and maximal sums of Lyapunov exponents using polynomial optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two approaches are presented for computing upper bounds on Lyapunov exponents and their sums, and on Lyapunov dimension, among all trajectories of a dynamical system governed by ordinary differential equations. The first approach expresses a sum of Lyapunov exponents as a time average in an augmented dynamical system and then applies methods for bounding time averages. This generalizes the work of Oeri &amp; Goluskin (Nonlinearity 36:5378-5400, 2023), who bounded the single leading Lyapunov exponent. The second approach considers a different augmented dynamical system, where bounds on sums of Lyapunov exponents are implied by stability of certain sets, and such stability is verified using Lyapunov function methods. Both of our approaches also can be adapted to directly compute bounds on Lyapunov dimension, which in turn implies bounds on the fractal dimension of a global attractor. For systems of ordinary differential equations with polynomial right-hand sides, all of our bounding formulations lead to polynomial optimization problems with sum-of-squares constraints. These sum-of-squares problems can be solved computationally for any particular system to yield numerical bounds, provided the number of variables and degree of polynomials is not prohibitive. Most of our upper bounds are proven to be sharp under relatively weak assumptions. In the case of the polynomial optimization problems, sharpness means that upper bounds converge to the exact values as polynomial degrees are raised. Computational examples demonstrate upper bounds that are sharp to several digits, including for a six-dimensional dynamical system where sums of Lyapunov exponents are maximized on periodic orbits.</description>

      <title>Ruelle-Pollicott Decay of Out-of-Time-Order Correlators in Many-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC) quantifies information scrambling in quantum systems and serves as a key diagnostic of quantum chaos. In one-body systems with a classical counterpart, the relaxation of the OTOC is governed by Ruelle-Pollicott resonances. For many-body systems lacking a semiclassical limit, recent studies have identified an analogous role played by the Liouvillian spectrum of weakly open extensions of the dynamics, where the slowest decay rate -- the Liouvillian gap -- encodes relaxation. Here we study the kicked Ising spin chain and show that the long-time exponential decay of the OTOC in the isolated system occurs at a rate equal to twice this intrinsic gap. This correspondence persists even in crossover regimes between integrability and chaos, demonstrating that the Liouvillian spectrum provides a unified framework for understanding relaxation and irreversibility in closed many-body quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Improving the prediction of spatio-temporal chaos by combining parallel reservoir computing with dimensionality reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reservoir computers can be used to predict time series generated by spatio-temporal chaotic systems. Using multiple reservoirs in parallel has shown improved performances for these predictions, by effectively reducing the input dimensionality of each reservoir. Similarly, one may further reduce the dimensionality of the input data by transforming to a lower-dimensional latent space. Combining both approaches, we show that using dimensionality-reduced latent space predictions for parallel reservoir computing not only reduces computational costs, but also leads to better prediction results for small to medium reservoir sizes. In the combined approach we further demonstrate that dimensionality reduction improves small-reservoir predictions regardless of noise contaminating the training data. The benefit of dimensionality-reduced parallel reservoir computing is illustrated and evaluated on the basis of the prediction of the one-dimensional Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation.</description>

      <title>Superuniversal Statistics with Topological Origins for non-Hermitian Scattering Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vortex singularities in speckle patterns formed from random superpositions of waves are an inevitable consequence of destructive interference and are consequently generic and ubiquitous. Singularities are topologically stable, meaning they persist under small perturbations and can only be removed via pairwise annihilation. They have applications including sensing, imaging and energy transfer in multiple fields such as optics, acoustics, and elastic or fluid waves. We generalize the concept of speckle patterns to arbitrary parameter spaces and any complex scalar function that describes wave phenomena involving complicated scattering. In scattering systems specifically, we are often concerned with singularities associated with complex zeros of various functions of the scattering matrix S, such as Coherent Perfect Absorption, Reflectionless Scattering Modes, Transmissionless Scattering Modes, and Exceptional Points. Experimentally, we find that all singularities share a universal statistical property: any quantity that diverges as a simple pole at a singularity has a probability distribution function with a -3 power law tail. The tail of the distribution provides an estimate for the likelihood of finding a given singularity in a generic system. We use these universal statistical results to determine that homogeneous system loss is the most important parameter determining singularity density in a given parameter space of an absorptive scattering system. Finally, we discuss events where distinct singularities coincide in parameter space, which result in higher order singularities that are not topologically protected, and we do not find universal statistical properties for them. We support our empirical results from microwave experiments with Random Matrix Theory simulations and conclude that the statistical results presented hold for all generic non-Hermitian scattering systems.</description>
