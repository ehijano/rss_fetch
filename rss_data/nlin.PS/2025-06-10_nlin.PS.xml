      <title>Subcritical Turing bifurcation and the morphogenesis of localised patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subcritical Turing bifurcations of reaction-diffusion systems in large domains lead to spontaneous onset of well-developed localised patterns via the homoclinic snaking mechanism. This phenomenon is shown to occur naturally when balancing source and loss effects are included in a typical reaction-diffusion system, leading to a super/subcritical transition. Implications are discussed for a range of physical problems, arguing that subcriticality leads to naturally robust phase transitions to localised patterns.</description>

      <title>Solitons in a one-dimensional rhombic waveguide array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two types of soliton solutions are analytically considered in a rhombic onedimensional lattice: transverse (discrete) solitons and longitudinal solitons. Based on the multi-scale method, longitudinal solitons are obtained as envelopes of wave packets outside the forbidden gap, on the gap and under the gap. A discrete soliton was obtained based on a wave packet from the center of the Brillouin zone. The numerical calculations are in good agreement with the analytical predictions.</description>

      <title>The Onset of Metastable Turbulence in Pipe Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The onset of turbulence in pipe flow has been a fundamental challenge in physics, applied mathematics, and engineering for over 140 years. To date, the precursor of this laminar-turbulent transition is recognized as transient turbulent spots or puffs, but their defining characteristics - longevity, abrupt relaminarization, and super-exponential lifetime scaling - have been lack of first-principles explanations. By combining extensive computer simulations, theory, and verifications with experimental data, we identify distinct puff relaminarizations separated by a critical Reynolds number, which are defined by a noisy saddle-node bifurcation derived from the Navier-Stokes equations. Below the critical number, the mean lifetime of puff follows a square-root scaling law, representing an intrinsically deterministic decay dominated by the critical slowing down. Above the critical value, the bifurcation's node branch creates a potential well stabilizing the turbulence, while the saddle branch mediates stochastic barrier-crossing events that drive memoryless decay - a hallmark of metastable states. Accordingly, the mean lifetimes are solved theoretically and can be fitted super-exponentially. By quantifying the deterministic and stochastic components in the kinetic energy equation, the lifetime statistics of puff are analyzed in a unified framework across low-to-moderate Reynolds number regimes, uncovering the mechanisms governing the transition to metastable turbulence in pipe flows.</description>

      <title>Resonances in Lifetimes of AdS Oscillon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Oscillons are classical oscillatory solutions with very long but finite lifetimes in real scalar field theories with appropriate potentials. An interesting feature is that resonances appear in the lifetimes of the oscillon for the initial size of the oscillon core $R_0$, which was discovered by Honda and Choptuik in the case of Minkowski space. In a previous work, oscillons in the global anti-de Sitter (AdS) space have been constructed, which we abbreviate as AdS oscillons. We present new resonance structures for the curvature radius $L$ and the core size $R_0$ in the lifetime of the AdS oscillon. We then compute exponents associated with the resonance peaks. Finally, we observe the bifurcation of the peaks due to the reflected waves.</description>
