      <title>Integer Traffic Assignment Problem: Algorithms and Insights on Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Path optimization is a fundamental concern across various real-world scenarios, ranging from traffic congestion issues to efficient data routing over the internet. The Traffic Assignment Problem (TAP) is a classic continuous optimization problem in this field. This study considers the Integer Traffic Assignment Problem (ITAP), a discrete variant of TAP. ITAP involves determining optimal routes for commuters in a city represented by a graph, aiming to minimize congestion while adhering to integer flow constraints on paths. This restriction makes ITAP an NP-hard problem. While conventional TAP prioritizes repulsive interactions to minimize congestion, this work also explores the case of attractive interactions, related to minimizing the number of occupied edges. We present and evaluate multiple algorithms to address ITAP, including a message passing algorithm, a greedy approach, simulated annealing, and relaxation of ITAP to TAP. Inspired by studies of random ensembles in the large-size limit in statistical physics, comparisons between these algorithms are conducted on large sparse random regular graphs with a random set of origin-destination pairs. Our results indicate that while the simplest greedy algorithm performs competitively in the repulsive scenario, in the attractive case the message-passing-based algorithm and simulated annealing demonstrate superiority. We then investigate the relationship between TAP and ITAP in the repulsive case. We find that, as the number of paths increases, the solution of TAP converges toward that of ITAP, and we investigate the speed of this convergence. Depending on the number of paths, our analysis leads us to identify two scaling regimes: in one the average flow per edge is of order one, and in another the number of paths scales quadratically with the size of the graph, in which case the continuous relaxation solves the integer problem closely.</description>

      <title>On Minimal Transversals of Maximal Cliques in Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10789</link>

Abstract: A hypergraph is conformal if it is the family of maximal cliques of a graph. In this paper we are interested in the problem of determining when is the family of minimal transversal of maximal cliques of a graph conformal. Such graphs are called clique dually conformal (CDC for short). As our main results, we completely characterize CDC graphs within the families of triangle-free graphs and split graphs. Both characterizations lead to polynomial-time recognition algorithms. We also show that the class of CDC graphs is closed under substitution, in the strong sense that substituting a graph $H$ for a vertex of a graph $G$ results in a CDC graph if and only if both $G$ and $H$ are CDC.</description>

      <title>Closeness and Residual Closeness of Harary Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11056v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analysis of a network in terms of vulnerability is one of the most significant problems. Graph theory serves as a valuable tool for solving complex network problems, and there exist numerous graph-theoretic parameters to analyze the system's stability. Among these parameters, the closeness parameter stands out as one of the most commonly used vulnerability metrics. Its definition has evolved to enhance the ease of formulation and applicability to disconnected structures. Furthermore, based on the closeness parameter, vertex residual closeness, which is a newer and more sensitive parameter compared to other existing parameters, has been introduced as a new graph vulnerability index by Dangalchev. In this study, the outcomes of the closeness and vertex residual closeness parameters in Harary Graphs have been examined. Harary Graphs are well-known constructs that are distinguished by having $n$ vertices that are $k$-connected with the least possible number of edges.</description>

      <title>Edge coloring of products of signed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2020, Behr defined the problem of edge coloring of signed graphs and showed that every signed graph $(G, \sigma)$ can be colored using exactly $\Delta(G)$ or $\Delta(G) + 1$ colors, where $\Delta(G)$ is the maximum degree in graph $G$.
  In this paper, we focus on products of signed graphs. We recall the definitions of the Cartesian, tensor, strong, and corona products of signed graphs and prove results for them. In particular, we show that $(1)$ the Cartesian product of $\Delta$-edge-colorable signed graphs is $\Delta$-edge-colorable, $(2)$ the tensor product of a $\Delta$-edge-colorable signed graph and a signed tree requires only $\Delta$ colors and $(3)$ the corona product of almost any two signed graphs is $\Delta$-edge-colorable. We also prove some results related to the coloring of products of signed paths and cycles.</description>

      <title>Efficient Construction of Long Orientable Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An orientable sequence of order $n$ is a cyclic binary sequence such that each length-$n$ substring appears at most once \emph{in either direction}. Maximal length orientable sequences are known only for $n\leq 7$, and a trivial upper bound on their length is $2^{n-1} - 2^{\lfloor(n-1)/2\rfloor}$. This paper presents the first efficient algorithm to construct orientable sequences with asymptotically optimal length; more specifically, our algorithm constructs orientable sequences via cycle-joining and a successor-rule approach requiring $O(n)$ time per symbol and $O(n)$ space. This answers a longstanding open question from Dai, Martin, Robshaw, Wild [Cryptography and Coding III (1993)]. Our sequences are applied to find new longest-known orientable sequences for $n\leq 20$.</description>
