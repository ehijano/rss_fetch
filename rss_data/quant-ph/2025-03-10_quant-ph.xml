      <title>Dynamical quantum phase transitions on random networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate two types of dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) in the transverse field Ising model on ensembles of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi networks of size $N$. These networks consist of vertices connected randomly with probability $p$ ($0&lt;p\leq 1$). Using analytical derivations and numerical techniques, we compare the characteristics of the transitions for $p&lt;1$ against the fully connected network ($p=1$). We analytically show that the overlap between the wave function after a quench and the wave function of the fully connected network after the same quench deviates by at most $\mathcal{O}(N^{-1/2})$. For a DQPT defined by an order parameter, the critical point remains unchanged for all $p$. For a DQPT defined by the rate function of the Loschmidt echo, we find that the rate function deviates from the $p=1$ limit near vanishing points of the overlap with the initial state, while the critical point remains independent for all $p$. Our analysis suggests that this divergence arises from persistent non-trivial global many-body correlations absent in the $p=1$ limit.</description>

      <title>Systematic benchmarking of quantum computers: status and recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Architectures for quantum computing can only be scaled up when they are accompanied by suitable benchmarking techniques. The document provides a comprehensive overview of the state and recommendations for systematic benchmarking of quantum computers. Benchmarking is crucial for assessing the performance of quantum computers, including the hardware, software, as well as algorithms and applications. The document highlights key aspects such as component-level, system-level, software-level, HPC-level, and application-level benchmarks. Component-level benchmarks focus on the performance of individual qubits and gates, while system-level benchmarks evaluate the entire quantum processor. Software-level benchmarks consider the compiler's efficiency and error mitigation techniques. HPC-level and cloud benchmarks address integration with classical systems and cloud platforms, respectively. Application-level benchmarks measure performance in real-world use cases. The document also discusses the importance of standardization to ensure reproducibility and comparability of benchmarks, and highlights ongoing efforts in the quantum computing community towards establishing these benchmarks. Recommendations for future steps emphasize the need for developing standardized evaluation routines and integrating benchmarks with broader quantum technology activities.</description>

      <title>Classical Simulation of Non-Classical Systems: A Large Deviation Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Any quasi-probability representation of a no-signaling system -- including quantum systems -- can be simulated via a purely classical scheme by allowing signed events and a cancellation procedure. This raises a fundamental question: What properties of the non-classical system does such a classical simulation fail to replicate? We answer by using large deviation theory to show that the probability of a large fluctuation under the classical simulation can be strictly greater than under the actual non-classical system. The key finding driving our result is that negativity in probability relaxes the data processing inequality of information theory. We propose this potential large deviation stability of quantum (and no-signaling) systems as a novel form of quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>The role of exchange interactions in superradiant phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dicke model is a central platform for exploring strong light-matter interaction and its superradiant properties, with implications for emerging quantum technologies. Recognizing that realistic qubits inherently experience direct interactions, we investigate the influence of both isotropic and anisotropic spin-spin couplings on the Dicke paradigm. In the strong coupling regime--where large photon populations challenge conventional numerical techniques--we developed a hybrid numerical method tailored for this problem, which demonstrates high accuracy and rapid convergence in reproducing established Dicke model results. Furthermore, our study reveals that distinct ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic regions exhibit different orders of phase transitions. Most notably, in the presence of anisotropic interactions, we identify a novel phase where spin order and superradiance coexist, marked by enhanced superradiance with a photon number significantly exceeding that of the conventional Dicke model.</description>

      <title>Optimized noise-resilient surface code teleportation interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Connecting two surface-code patches may require significantly higher noise at the interface. We show, via circuit-level simulations under a depolarizing noise model with idle errors, that surface codes remain fault tolerant despite substantially elevated interface error rates. Specifically, we compare three strategies -- direct noisy links, gate teleportation, and a CAT-state gadget -- for both rotated and unrotated surface codes, and demonstrate that careful design can mitigate hook errors in each case so that the full code distance is preserved for both $X$ and $Z$. Although these methods differ in space and time overhead and performance, each offers a viable route to modular surface-code architectures. Our results, obtained with Stim and PyMatching, confirm that high-noise interfaces can be integrated fault-tolerantly without compromising the code's essential properties, indicating that fault-tolerant scaling of error-corrected modular devices is within reach with current technology.</description>

      <title>Retrieving information in sloppy quantum phase estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The description of complex systems requires a progressively larger number of parameters. However, in practice it often happens that a small subset of parameters suffice to describe the dynamics of the system itself in terms of stiff combinations, while the remaining sloppy combinations provide no information on the system. While this effect can reduce model complexity, it can also limit the estimation precision when the stiff and sloppy combinations are unknown to the experimenter, and one is forced to estimate the potentially sloppy model parameters. We explored how such a sloppy behavior can be controlled and counteracted via quantum weak measurements in the estimation of two sequential phases. We showed that the introduction of a weak measurement of variable strength in-between the two phases allows to switch from a fully sloppy setup to a fully determined one where both phases can be estimated with quantum-limited precision. Our work provides an important insight of sloppiness detection in quantum systems, with promising applications in quantum metrology and imaging, as well as to quantum security and quantum monitoring.</description>

      <title>Secure Quantum Token Processing with Color Centers in Diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantum token scheme in which the token is a quantum state that ensures secure authentication or payment. In our approach, rooted in Wiesner's quantum money concept, a token is encoded in a multi-qubit state generated by a single-photon source and transmitted to a user who holds a quantum memory register. By leveraging state-dependent reflection from a highly efficient sawfish nanophotonic crystal cavity and implementing high-fidelity fractional quantum gates through a pulse train of optical $\pi$/8 pulses, our design achieves gate fidelities exceeding 99% under realistic operating conditions. We also analyze microwave control, which extends the viability to longer storage times, albeit at reduced operational rates. We rigorously examine the impact of finite photon bandwidth, cavity design parameters, spectral diffusion, and control imperfections on overall performance. Our comprehensive model indicates that, with near-term improvements in device efficiency and conversion rates, the token acceptance rate can approach the MHz regime for short-distance communication links while remaining robust against optimal cloning attacks. These findings pave the way for integrating unforgeable quantum tokens into larger-scale quantum networks, thereby significantly enhancing the security of future quantum network applications.</description>

      <title>Parallel Logical Measurements via Quantum Code Surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum code surgery is a flexible and low overhead technique for performing logical measurements on quantum error-correcting codes, which generalises lattice surgery. In this work, we present a code surgery scheme, applicable to any Calderbank-Shor-Steane quantum low-density parity check (LDPC) code, that fault-tolerantly measures many logical Pauli operators in parallel. For a collection of logically disjoint Pauli product measurements supported on $t$ logical qubits, our scheme uses $O\big(t \omega (\log t + \log^3\omega)\big)$ ancilla qubits, where $\omega \geq d$ is the maximum weight of the single logical Pauli representatives involved in the measurements, and $d$ is the code distance. This is all done in time $O(d)$ independent of $t$. Our proposed scheme preserves both the LDPC property and the fault-distance of the original code, without requiring ancillary logical codeblocks which may be costly to prepare. This addresses a shortcoming of several recently introduced surgery schemes which can only be applied to measure a limited number of logical operators in parallel if they overlap on data qubits.</description>

      <title>Seismic inversion using hybrid quantum neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing leverages qubits, exploiting superposition and entanglement to solve problems intractable for classical computers, offering significant computational advantages. Quantum machine learning (QML), which integrates quantum computing with machine learning, holds immense potential across various fields but remains largely unexplored in geosciences. However, its progress is hindered by the limitations of current NISQ hardware. To address these challenges, hybrid quantum neural networks (HQNNs) have emerged, combining quantum layers within classical neural networks to leverage the strengths of both paradigms. To the best of our knowledge, this study presents the first application of QML to subsurface imaging through the development of hybrid quantum physics-informed neural networks (HQ-PINNs) for seismic inversion. We apply the HQ-PINN framework to invert pre-stack and post-stack seismic datasets, estimating P- and S-impedances. The proposed HQ-PINN architecture follows an encoder-decoder structure, where the encoder (HQNN), processes seismic data to estimate elastic parameters, while the decoder utilizes these parameters to generate the corresponding seismic data based on geophysical relationships. The HQ-PINN model is trained by minimizing the misfit between the input and predicted seismic data generated by the decoder. We systematically evaluate various quantum layer configurations, differentiation methods, and quantum device simulators on the inversion performance, and demonstrate real-world applicability through the individual and simultaneous inversion cases of the Sleipner dataset. The HQ-PINN framework consistently and efficiently estimated accurate subsurface impedances across the synthetic and field case studies, establishing the feasibility of leveraging QML for seismic inversion, thereby paving the way for broader applications of quantum computing in geosciences.</description>

      <title>Mitigation of birefringence in cavity-based quantum networks using frequency-encoded photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atom-cavity systems offer unique advantages for building large-scale distributed quantum computers by providing strong atom-photon coupling while allowing for high-fidelity local operations of atomic qubits. However, in prevalent schemes where the photonic state is encoded in polarization, cavity birefringence introduces an energy splitting of the cavity eigenmodes and alters the polarization states, thus limiting the fidelity of remote entanglement generation. To address this challenge, we propose a scheme that encodes the photonic qubit in the frequency degree-of-freedom. The scheme relies on resonant coupling of multiple transverse cavity modes to different atomic transitions that are well-separated in frequency. We numerically investigate the temporal properties of the photonic wavepacket, two-photon interference visibility, and atom-atom entanglement fidelity under various cavity polarization-mode splittings and find that our scheme is less affected by cavity birefringence. Finally, we propose practical implementations in two trapped ion systems, using the fine structure splitting in the metastable D state of $\mathrm{^{40}Ca^{+}}$, and the hyperfine splitting in the ground state of $\mathrm{^{225}Ra^{+}}$. Our study presents an alternative approach for cavity-based quantum networks that is less sensitive to birefringent effects, and is applicable to a variety of atomic and solid-state emitter-cavity interfaces.</description>

      <title>Protecting spin squeezing from decoherence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a crucial resource in the field of quantum metrology, spin squeezing can facilitate highly precise measurements that surpass the limitations imposed by classical physics. However, the quantum advantages of spin squeezing can be significantly compromised by decoherence, thereby impeding its practical implementation. Here, by investigating the influence of local dissipative environment on spin squeezing beyond the conventional Born-Markov approximation, we find a mechanism to protect spin squeezing from decoherence and show that robust spin squeezing can be achieved in the steady state. We outline an experimental proposal to verify our prediction in a trapped-ion platform. Overcoming the challenges set by decoherence on spin squeezing, our work provides a guideline for realizing high-precision sensing in realistic environments.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Transitions in Noisy Quantum Circuits on Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decoherence is ubiquitous, and poses a significant impediment to the observation of quantum phenomena, such as the measurement-induced entanglement phase transition (MIPT). In this work, we study entanglement transitions in quantum circuits on trees, subject to both noise and measurements. We uncover a rich phase diagram that describes the ability of a tree quantum circuit to retain quantum or classical information in the presence of decoherence. By developing a mapping between the dynamics of information on the tree to a classical Markov process -- also defined on the tree -- we obtain exact solutions to the entanglement transitions displayed by the circuit under various noise and measurement strengths. Moreover, we find a host of phenomena, including the MIPT, which are \textit{robust} to decoherence. The analytical tractability facilitated by the method developed in this paper showcases the first example of an exactly solvable noise-robust MIPT, and holds promise for studies on broader, tree-like circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a semi-quantum conference key agreement (SQCKA) protocol that leverages on GHZ states. We provide a comprehensive security analysis for our protocol that does not rely on a trusted mediator party. We present information-theoretic security proof, addressing collective attacks within the asymptotic limit of infinitely many rounds. This assumption is practical, as participants can monitor and abort the protocol if deviations from expected noise patterns occur. This advancement enhances the feasibility of SQCKA protocols for real-world applications, ensuring strong security without complex network topologies or third-party trust.</description>

      <title>Data-Efficient Error Mitigation for Physical and Algorithmic Errors in a Hamiltonian Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum dynamics simulation via Hamilton simulation algorithms is one of the most crucial applications in the quantum computing field. While this task has been relatively considered the target in the fault-tolerance era, the experiment for demonstrating utility by an IBM team simulates the dynamics of an Ising-type quantum system with the Trotter-based Hamiltonian simulation algorithm with the help of quantum error mitigation. In this study, we propose the data-efficient 1D extrapolation method to mitigate not only physical errors but also algorithmic errors of Trotterized quantum circuits in both the near-term and early fault-tolerant eras. Our proposed extrapolation method uses expectation values obtained by Trotterized circuits, where the Trotter number is selected to minimize both physical and algorithmic errors according to the circuit's physical error rate. We also propose a method that combines the data-efficient 1D extrapolation with purification QEM methods, which improves accuracy more at the expense of multiple copies of quantum states or the depth of the quantum circuit. Using the 1D transverse-field Ising model, we numerically demonstrate our proposed methods and confirm that our proposed extrapolation method suppresses both statistical and systematic errors more than the previous extrapolation method.</description>

      <title>Programmable non-Hermitian photonic quantum walks via dichroic metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of a closed quantum system is described by a unitary operator generated by a Hermitian Hamiltonian. However, when certain degrees of freedom are coupled to an environment, the relevant dynamics can be captured by non-unitary evolution operators, arising from non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. Here we introduce a photonic platform that implements non-unitary quantum walks, commonly used to emulate open-system dynamics, in the synthetic space of light transverse momentum. These walks are realized by propagating light through a series of dichroic liquid-crystal metasurfaces, that impart polarization-dependent momentum shifts. The non-unitary behavior stems from dichroic dye molecules with polarization-dependent absorption, whose orientation is coupled to that of the liquid crystals. We demonstrate multiple walks up to five time steps, with adjustable levels of dichroism set by the metasurface voltage, which is controlled remotely. This discrete-time process maps onto two-band tight-binding models with reciprocal yet non-Hermitian nearest-neighbor couplings, corresponding to a less-studied class of non-Hermitian systems. Our platform broadens the range of optical simulators for controlled investigations of non-Hermitian quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Implementation for Untrusted-node-based Quantum Key Distribution Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) serves as a cornerstone of secure quantum communication, providing unconditional security grounded in quantum mechanics. While trusted-node networks have facilitated early QKD deployment, their vulnerability to node compromise underscores the need for untrusted-node architectures. Measurement-device-independent QKD (MDI-QKD) and twin-field QKD (TF-QKD) have emerged as leading candidates, addressing security vulnerabilities and extending transmission distances. Despite the wide adoptions in various fiber scaling, no integrated implementation of these two protocols has been demonstrated to date. Here, we present a hybrid system that seamlessly integrates TF-QKD and MDI-QKD into one untrusted-node-based architecture. Utilizing an efficient phase estimation method based on asymmetric interferometers, we convert twin-field global phase tracking to relative phase calibration, allowing near continuous running of both protocols. Experiments demonstrate secure finite-size key rates for sending-or-not-sending QKD and MDI-QKD over fiber distances of 150 to 431 km. The results align with theoretical simulations and show the ability to surpass the absolute repeaterless key capacity. Our work offers an unified framework for deploying multi-protocol QKD networks, laying the foundation for adaptable and scalable quantum infrastructures that can meet a wide range of security and performance needs.</description>

      <title>Direct Gradient Computation of Parameterized Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The barren plateau phenomenon, where the gradients of parametrized quantum circuits become vanishingly small, poses a significant challenge in quantum machine learning. While previous studies attempted to explain the barren plateau phenomenon using the Weingarten formula, the reliance on the Weingarten formula leads to inaccurate conclusions. In this study, we consider a unitary operator \(U\) consisting of rotation gates and perform an exact calculation of the expectation required for the gradient computation. Our approach allows us to obtain the gradient expectation and variance directly. Our analysis reveals that gradient expectations are not zero, as opposed to the results derived using the Weingarten formula, but depend on the number of qubits in the system. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the number of effective parameters, circuit depth, and gradient variance are interconnected in deep parameterized quantum circuits. Numerical simulations further confirm the validity of our theoretical results. Our approach provides a more accurate framework for analyzing quantum circuit optimization.</description>

      <title>Extended Controllability Tests for Quantum Decoherence-Free Subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we develop two axiomatic tests for the controllability of subsystem codes embedded in decoherence-free subspaces of open quantum systems. The tests expand on existing control theory by considering quantum subsystems where a decoherence-protected quantum state is permitted to exit the set of logically encoded states in order to perform a broader range of computations. The tests target the class of all Lindbladian models and require no specific structure, regularity, or symmetry in system Hamiltonians or noise operators, making them ideal for control design in models lacking these features. The usefulness of the tests is demonstrated using a complete worked example for a trapped ion system subject to a nonstandard collective dephasing noise.</description>

      <title>Nonviolation of the CHSH inequality under local spin-1 measurements on two spin qutrits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, based on the general analytical expression [arXiv:2412.03470] for the maximum of the CHSH expectation under local Alice and Bob spin-$s$ measurements in an arbitrary state of two spin qudits of dimension $d=2s+1$, we analyze for a variety of nonseparable two-qutrit states the maximal value of CHSH expectation under spin-$1$ measurements. We find analytically and also numerically for $1,000,000$ randomly generated nonseparable pure two-qutrit states, that, under local Alice and Bob spin-$1$ measurements in each of these states, including maximally entangled, the CHSH inequality is not violated. These results together with the spectral decomposition of a mixed state, lead us to the Conjecture that, under local Alice and Bob spin-$1$ measurements, an arbitrary two-qutrit state does not violate the CHSH inequality. For a variety of pure two-qutrit states, we further find the values of their concurrence and compare them with the values of their spin-$1$ CHSH parameter, which determines violation or nonviolation by a two-qutrit state of the CHSH inequality under spin-$1$ measurements. This comparison indicates that, in contrast to spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ measurements, where the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ CHSH parameter of a pure two-qubit state is increasing monotonically with a growth of its entanglement, for a pure two-qutrit state, the spin-$1$ CHSH parameter does not, in general, monotonically increase with a growth of its entanglement. In particular, for the two-qutrit GHZ state, which is maximally entangled, the spin-$1$ CHSH parameter is equal to $\sqrt{\frac{8}{9}}$, while, for some separable pure two-qutrit states, this parameter can be equal to unity. Moreover, for the mixed Horodecki two-qutrit state, the spin-$1$ CHSH parameter is equal to $4\sqrt{2}/21&lt;1$ regardless of the entanglement type of this mixed state.</description>

      <title>Nonstabilizerness of a Boundary Time Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boundary time crystals exhibit measurement-induced phase transitions in their steady-state entanglement, with critical behavior that depends on the particular unraveling of the Lindblad dynamics. In this work, we investigate another key measure of quantum complexity -- nonstabilizerness (or magic) -- and show that it follows a markedly different pattern. Importantly, in contrast to entanglement, for large system sizes, magic remains invariant under different unraveling schemes -- a property we attribute to the inherent permutational symmetry of the model. Although the steady-state stabilizer entropy does not display a genuine phase transition, it exhibits a singular derivative (a cusp) at the mean-field critical point. Furthermore, we demonstrate that finite-size simulations of the average Lindblad evolution fail to capture the asymptotic behavior of magic in the time-crystal phase, while quantum trajectory unravelings correctly reveal its extensive scaling with system size. These findings offer insights into how different quantum resources manifest in open systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Dual Extended Hamming Code Immune to Collective Coherent Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) is crucial for protecting quantum information from various error sources, including collective coherent errors and depolarizing noise. In this work, we propose a novel family of constant excitation (CE) stabilizer codes with parameters $[[2^{r+1}, 2^r-(r+1), 4]]$. These codes are constructed by concatenating an inner complemented dual-rail (CDR) code with a classical outer $[2^r, 2^r-(r+1), 4]$ extended Hamming code. Our smallest instance, the CE $[[8,1,4]]$ code, improves upon the previously known CE $[[8,1,3]]$ code by increasing the code distance from 3 to 4, thereby enhancing its error-correcting capability. The combination of the extended Hamming code with the CDR structure allows for robust differentiation between bit-flip ($X$) and phase-flip ($Z$) errors. Our results contribute to the ongoing development of high-rate, fault-tolerant QEC schemes suitable for practical quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring the noise spectrum impacting a qubit and extending its coherence duration are fundamental components of quantum technologies. In this study, we introduce parametric spectroscopy, a method that merges parametric modulation of a qubit's energy gap with dynamical decoupling sequences. The parametric modulation provides high sensitivity to extensive regions of the noise spectrum, while dynamical decoupling reduces the effect of driving noise. Our theoretical study shows that parametric spectroscopy enables access to the difficult high-frequency domain of the flux spectrum in transmons.</description>

      <title>Implementation and verification of coherent error suppression using randomized compiling for Grover's algorithm on a trapped-ion device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In near-term quantum computations that do not employ error correction, noise can proliferate rapidly, corrupting the quantum state and making results unreliable. These errors originate from both decoherence and control imprecision. The latter can manifest as coherent noise that is especially detrimental. Here, we study the impact of coherent errors and their mitigation under standard error-reduction techniques, both theoretically and experimentally on a trapped-ion quantum computer. As a representative case study, we implement a range of Grover's algorithm circuits containing up to 10 qubits and 26 two-qubit gates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of randomized compiling (RC) and algorithm error detection (ED), where the latter is realized via post-selection on ancillary qubits that ideally return to the ground state at the end of each circuit. Our results highlight a synergetic effect: combining RC and ED yields the largest reductions in errors, indicating that these methods can work together to extend the capabilities of near-term quantum devices for moderately deep circuits.</description>

      <title>Preparing Tetra-Digit Long-Range Entangled States via Unified Sequential Quantum Circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quest to systematically prepare long-range entangled phases has gained momentum with advances in quantum circuit design, particularly through sequential quantum circuits (SQCs) that constrain entanglement growth via locality and depth constraints. This work introduces a \textit{unified} SQC framework to prepare ground states of Tetra-Digit (TD) quantum spin models -- a class of long-range entangled stabilizer codes labeled by a four-digit index $[d_n,d_s,d_l,D]$ -- which encompass Toric Codes across dimensions and the X-cube fracton phase as special cases. Featuring a hierarchical structure of entanglement renormalization group, TD models host spatially extended excitations (e.g., loops, membranes, and exotic non-manifold objects) with constrained mobility and deformability, and exhibit system-size-dependent ground state degeneracies that scale exponentially with a polynomial in linear sizes. We demonstrate the unified SQC through low-dimension examples first, graphically and algebraically, and then extend to general cases, with a detailed proof for the effectiveness of general SQC given in the appendix. With experimental feasibility via synthetic dimensions in quantum simulators, this framework bridges a great variety of gapped long-range entangled states cross dimensions through quantum circuits and shows plentiful mathematical and physical structures in TD models. Through unifying previously disparate preparation strategies, it offers a pathway toward engineered topological phases and fault-tolerant technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent implementations of Maxwell demons and other devices exhibiting asymmetric response to particles incident from opposite directions have raised conceptual and practical interest. According to quantum-scattering-theory selection rules, demons necessitate, among other conditions, non-local and non-Hermitian potentials. These potentials arise as effective interactions for a single asymptotic channel within a multichannel (large, Hermitian) system. However we find that, regardless of the complexity of the large Hamiltonian, the demon behavior cannot be approached in this way. We discuss the consequences and possible resolutions of the ensuing paradox. We also introduce and examine a parameter to quantify the distance to demon behavior and propose a way to construct devices as close to a demonic behaviour as possible in a quantum-optical setup.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have seen great progress in quantum computing, providing opportunities to overcome computational bottlenecks in many scientific applications. In particular, the intersection of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and quantum computing has become an active area of research with exponential computational speedup as an ultimate goal. In this work, we propose a quantum algorithm for the time-dependent smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method. Our algorithm uses concepts from discrete-time quantum walks to solve the one-dimensional advection partial differential equation via an SPH formalism. Hence, we construct a quantum circuit to carry out the calculations for a two-particle system over one and two timesteps. We compare its outputs with results from the classical SPH algorithm and show there is excellent agreement after one timestep. There is greater disagreement for larger advection speeds after two timesteps, which we attribute to unwanted terms generated in the statevector after one timestep. The methodology and findings here are a key step towards developing a more general quantum SPH algorithm for solving practical engineering problems on gate-based quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Quantum decoherence of nitrogen-vacancy spin ensembles in a nitrogen spin bath in diamond under dynamical decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond has emerged as a leading qubit platform for quantum technology applications. One of the key challenges for NV-based quantum applications is building an accurate model to predict its decoherence properties and their quantum nature. In this study, we combine theory and experiment to investigate NV decoherence dynamics in the presence of nitrogen donor (P1 center) baths, which is one of the dominant decoherence sources in diamond. We employ a cluster-correlation expansion (CCE) method to compute the NV decoherence under the Hahn-echo (HE) and Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) pulse sequences at various P1 concentrations from 1ppm to 300 ppm. We show that the coherence time (T2) increases with the number of pi pulses applied, indicating that the NV spin is decoupled from the P1 bath. Notably, we find that T2 scales quadratically as a function of the pulse number, on a logarithmic scale, as opposed to the linear scaling predicted by widely accepted semi-classical theories in the literature. In our experiment, we measure the CPMG signal for two diamond samples with high P1 concentrations of 0.8ppm and 13ppm. We demonstrate that the T2 scaling is indeed quadratic, thus confirming our theoretical predictions. Our results show that the quantum bath model combined with the CCE method can accurately capture the quantum nature of the P1-driven NV decoherence. Our study opens a new avenue for developing a complete noise model that could be used to optimize the performance of NV-based quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Cooperative squeezing of internal and collective spins in an atomic ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Creating highly spin-squeezed states for quantum metrology surpassing the standard quantum limit is a topic of great interest. Spin squeezing has been achieved by either entangling different atoms in an ensemble, or by controlling the multi-level internal spin state of an atom. Here, we experimentally demonstrate combined, internal and collective spin squeezing, in a hot atomic ensemble with $\sim 10^{11}$ rubidium atoms. By synergistically combining these two types of squeezing and carefully aligning their squeezing quadratures, we have achieved a metrologically relevant spin squeezing of $-6.21\pm0.84$ dB, significantly outperforming the results obtained by utilizing either type of squeezing alone. Our approach provides a new perspective on fully harnessing the degrees of freedom inherent in quantum states of an atomic ensemble.</description>

      <title>De Novo Design of Protein-Binding Peptides by Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In silico de novo design can drastically cut the costs and time of drug development. In particular, a key advantage of bottom-up physics-based approaches is their independence from training datasets, unlike generative models. However, they require the simultaneous exploration of chemical and conformational space. In this study, we address this formidable challenge leveraging quantum annealers. Focusing on peptide de novo design, we introduce a multi-scale framework that integrates classical and quantum computing for atomically resolved predictions. We assess this scheme by designing binders for several protein targets. The D-Wave quantum annealer rapidly generates a chemically diverse set of binders with primary structures and binding poses that correlate well with experiments. These results demonstrate that, even in their current early stages, quantum technologies can already empower physics-based drug design.</description>

      <title>Compare Similarities Between DNA Sequences Using Permutation-Invariant Quantum Kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing the similarity between two DNA sequences is of vital importance in bioscience. However, traditional computational methods can be resource-intensive due to the enormous sequence length encountered in practice. Recently, applied quantum algorithms have been anticipated to provide potential advantages over classical approaches. In this paper, we propose a permutation-invariant variational quantum kernel method specifically designed for DNA comparison. To represent the four nucleotide bases in DNA sequences with quantum states, we introduce a novel, theoretically motivated encoding scheme: the four distinct bases are encoded using the states of symmetric, informationally complete, positive operator-valued measures (SIC-POVMs). This encoding ensures mutual equality: each pair of symbols is equidistant on the Bloch sphere. Also, since permutation invariance is inherent to common DNA similarity measures such as Levenshtein distance, we realize it by using a specially designed parameterized quantum layer. We show that our novel encoding method and parameterized layers used in the quantum kernel model can effectively capture the symmetric characteristics of the pairwise DNA sequence comparison task. We validate our model through numerical experiments, which yield promising results on length-$8$ DNA sequences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the quantum master equation predicting how the translational and rotational dynamics of a nanoparticle is affected by the emission of surface adsorbates. This is motivated by recent experiments which prepared the motion of internally hot silica particles in the deep quantum regime. In the limit of a well localized nanoparticle the ro-translational dynamics can be characterized by diffusion rates in quantitative agreement with classical expectations. The theory is also suited to describe the decoherence effect of outgassing and sublimation.</description>

      <title>Metrological symmetries in singular quantum multi-parameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theoretical foundation of quantum sensing is rooted in the Cram\'er-Rao formalism, which establishes quantitative precision bounds for a given quantum probe. In many practical scenarios, where more than one parameter is unknown, the multi-parameter Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) applies. Since this is a matrix inequality involving the inverse of the quantum Fisher information matrix (QFIM), the formalism breaks down when the QFIM is singular. In this paper, we examine the physical origins of such singularities, showing that they result from an over-parametrization on the metrological level. This is itself caused by emergent metrological symmetries, whereby the same set of measurement outcomes are obtained for different combinations of system parameters. Although the number of effective parameters is equal to the number of non-zero QFIM eigenvalues, the Cram\'er-Rao formalism typically does not provide information about the effective parameter encoding. Instead, we demonstrate through a series of concrete examples that Bayesian estimation can provide deep insights. In particular, the metrological symmetries appear in the Bayesian posterior distribution as lines of persistent likelihood running through the space of unknown parameters. These lines are contour lines of the effective parameters which, through suitable parameter transformations, can be estimated and follow their own effective CRBs.</description>

      <title>Complete Characterization of Statistical Constraints in Local Realism and Quantum Mechanics via a Unified Geometric Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a unified framework for characterizing statistical constraints in both local realism and quantum mechanics. Employing the Fourier transform of distributions provides a geometric perspective on the problem, while quasi-probability distributions enable a parallel treatment of quantum and local realistic cases. In the Clauser--Horne--Shimony--Holt setup, we derive a general inequality that establishes a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a quantum state satisfying given correlation constraints for an arbitrarily fixed set of observables. As part of the proof, we introduce a technique that utilizes symmetries to significantly simplify the problem while preserving its generality. This result strengthens previously known constraints, such as Tsirel'son's inequalities and the Tsirel'son--Landau inequality, by explicitly characterizing statistical constraints for each specified set of observables, and it can be directly applied to Bell's original setting.</description>

      <title>Improved Two-source Extractors against Quantum Side Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-source extractors aim to extract randomness from two independent sources of weak randomness. It has been shown that any two-source extractor which is secure against classical side information remains secure against quantum side information. Unfortunately, this generic reduction comes with a significant penalty to the performance of the extractor. In this paper, we show that the two-source extractor from Dodis et al. performs equally well against quantum side information as in the classical realm, surpassing previously known results about this extractor. Additionally, we derive a new quantum XOR-Lemma which allows us to re-derive the generic reduction but also allows for improvements for a large class of extractors.</description>

      <title>Exploring Tensor Network Algorithms as a Quantum-Inspired Method for Quantum Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) has emerged as a promising hybrid quantum machine learning (QML) method that leverages the complex dynamics of quantum systems and classical machine learning models. Motivated by the development of this new QML method, we explore how quantum-inspired techniques like tensor networks (TNs), specifically the Time Dependent Variational Principle (TDVP) with Matrix Product State (MPS), can be used for the QRC algorithm. To demonstrate the utility of our quantum-inspired method, we performed numerical experiments on the MNIST dataset and compared the performance of our quantum-inspired QRC with different classical machine learning (ML) methods. The results reveal that high-quality embeddings can be generated by performing the time-evolution of MPS system consisting of one-dimensional chain of Rydberg atoms. This quantum-inspired method is highly scalable, enabling the simulation of 100 qubits with a low classical computing overhead. Finally, this study also underscores the potential of tensor networks as quantum-inspired algorithms to enhance the capability of quantum machine learning algorithms to study datasets with large numbers of features.</description>

      <title>Generation of Frequency-Tunable Shaped Single Microwave Photons Using a Fixed-Frequency Superconducting Qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling up a superconducting quantum computer will likely require quantum communication between remote chips, which can be implemented using an itinerant microwave photon in a transmission line. To realize high-fidelity communication, it is essential to control the frequency and temporal shape of the microwave photon. In this work, we demonstrate the generation of frequency-tunable shaped microwave photons without resorting to any frequency-tunable circuit element. We develop a framework which treats a microwave resonator as a band-pass filter mediating the interaction between a superconducting qubit and the modes in the transmission line. This interpretation allows us to stimulate the photon emission by an off-resonant drive signal. We characterize how the frequency and temporal shape of the generated photon depends on the frequency and amplitude of the drive signal. By modulating the drive amplitude and frequency, we achieve a frequency tunability of 40 MHz while maintaining the photon mode shape time-symmetric.Through measurements of the quadrature amplitudes of the emitted photons, we demonstrate consistently high state and process fidelities around 95\% across the tunable frequency range. Our hardware-efficient approach eliminates the need for additional biasing lines typically required for frequency tuning, offering a simplified architecture for scalable quantum communication.</description>

      <title>On the similarity of bandwidth-tuned quantum kernels and classical kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum kernels (QK) are widely used in quantum machine learning applications; yet, their potential to surpass classical machine learning methods on classical datasets remains uncertain. This limitation can be attributed to the exponential concentration phenomenon, which can impair both trainability and generalization. A common strategy to alleviate this is bandwidth tuning, which involves rescaling data points in the quantum model to improve generalization. In this work, we numerically demonstrate that optimal bandwidth tuning results in QKs that closely resemble radial basis function (RBF) kernels, leading to a lack of quantum advantage over classical methods. Moreover, we reveal that the size of optimal bandwidth tuning parameters further simplifies QKs, causing them to behave like polynomial kernels, corresponding to a low-order Taylor approximation of a RBF kernel. We thoroughly investigate this for fidelity quantum kernels and projected quantum kernels using various data encoding circuits across several classification datasets. We provide numerical evidence and derive a simple analytical model that elucidates how bandwidth tuning influences key quantities in classification tasks. Overall, our findings shed light on the mechanisms that render QK methods classically simulatable.</description>

      <title>Less Quantum, More Advantage: An End-to-End Quantum Algorithm for the Jones Polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an end-to-end reconfigurable algorithmic pipeline for solving a famous problem in knot theory using a noisy digital quantum computer, namely computing the value of the Jones polynomial at the fifth root of unity within additive error for any input link, i.e. a closed braid. This problem is DQC1-complete for Markov-closed braids and BQP-complete for Plat-closed braids, and we accommodate both versions of the problem. Even though it is widely believed that DQC1 is strictly contained in BQP, and so is 'less quantum', the resource requirements of classical algorithms for the DQC1 version are at least as high as for the BQP version, and so we potentially gain 'more advantage' by focusing on Markov-closed braids in our exposition. We demonstrate our quantum algorithm on Quantinuum's H2-2 quantum computer and show the effect of problem-tailored error-mitigation techniques. Further, leveraging that the Jones polynomial is a link invariant, we construct an efficiently verifiable benchmark to characterise the effect of noise present in a given quantum processor. In parallel, we implement and benchmark the state-of-the-art tensor-network-based classical algorithms for computing the Jones polynomial. The practical tools provided in this work allow for precise resource estimation to identify near-term quantum advantage for a meaningful quantum-native problem in knot theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum phase estimation combined with Hamiltonian simulation is the most promising algorithmic framework to computing ground state energies on quantum computers. Its main computational overhead derives from the Hamiltonian simulation subroutine. In this paper we use randomization to speed up product formulas, one of the standard approaches to Hamiltonian simulation. We propose new partially randomized Hamiltonian simulation methods in which some terms are kept deterministically and others are randomly sampled. We perform a detailed resource estimate for single-ancilla phase estimation using partially randomized product formulas for benchmark systems in quantum chemistry and obtain orders-of-magnitude improvements compared to other simulations based on product formulas. When applied to the hydrogen chain, we have numerical evidence that our methods exhibit asymptotic scaling with the system size that is competitive with the best known qubitization approaches.</description>

      <title>Memory preservation in highly-connected quantum networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex quantum networks are powerful tools in the modeling of transport phenomena, particularly for biological systems, and enable the study of emergent entanglement structures or topology effects in of many-body quantum systems. Here, we study the transport properties of a quantum network described by the paradigmatic XXZ Hamiltonian, with non-trivial graph connectivity and topology, and long-range interaction. Adopting a combination of analytical and numerical methods to analyze the properties of increasingly complex architectures, we find that all-to-all connected regular network preserves over long times the memory of initially injected excitations, tracing it back to the system symmetries and the cooperative shielding. We then develop understanding of the conditions for this property to survive in quantum networks with either power-law node connectivity or complex, small-world type, architectures. Interestingly, we find that memory preserving effects occur also in sparse and more irregular graphs, though to a significantly lower degree. We discuss the implications of these properties in biology-related problems, such as an application to Weber's law in neuroscience, and their implementation in specific quantum technologies via biomimicry.</description>

      <title>Selective collective emission from a dense atomic ensemble coupled to a nanophotonic resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally and theoretically study collective emission of a dense atomic ensemble coupled to a whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) in a nanophotonic microring resonator. Due to many cold atoms localized in a small volume, these trapped atoms collectively couple not only to the WGM and but also to the non-guided modes in free space. Through tuning the atom-WGM coupling and by adjusting the number of trapped atoms, we demonstrate superradiant emission to the WGM. For photon emission via the non-guided modes, our study reveals signatures of subradiance and superradiance when the system is driven to the steady-state states and the timed-Dicke states, respectively. Our experimental platform thus presents the first atom-light interface with selective collective emission behavior into a guided mode and the environment, respectively. Our observation and methodology could shed light on future explorations of collective emission with densely packed quantum emitters coupled to nanophotonic light-matter interfaces.</description>

      <title>Local unambiguous unidentifiability, entanglement generation, and Hilbert space splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider collections of mixed states supported on mutually orthogonal subspaces whose rank add up to the total dimension of the underlying Hilbert space. We then ask whether it is possible to find such collections in which no state from the set can be unambiguously identified by local operations and classical communication (LOCC) with non-zero success probability. We show the necessary and sufficient condition for such a property to exist is that the states must be supported in entangled subspaces. In fact, the existence of such a set guarantees the existence of a type of entangling projective measurement other than rank one measurements and vice versa. This projective measurement can create entanglement from any product state picked from the same Hilbert space on which the measurement is applied. Here the form of the product state is not characterized. Ultimately, these sets or the measurements are associated with the splitting of a composite Hilbert space, i.e., the Hilbert space can be written as a direct sum of several entangled subspaces. We then characterize present sets (measurements) in terms of dimensional constraints, maximum-minimum cardinalities (outcomes), etc. The maximum cardinalities of the sets constitute a class of state discrimination tasks where several stronger classes of measurements (like separable measurements, etc.) do not provide any advantage over LOCC. Finally, we discuss genuine local unambiguous unidentifiability and generation of genuine entanglement from completely product states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum spin glasses form a good testbed for studying the performance of various quantum annealing and optimization algorithms. In this work we show how two- and three-dimensional tensor networks can accurately and efficiently simulate the quantum annealing dynamics of Ising spin glasses on a range of lattices. Such dynamics were recently simulated using D-Wave's Advantage$2$ system [arXiv:2403.00910] and, following extensive comparison to existing numerical methods, claimed to be beyond the reach of classical computation. Here we show that by evolving lattice-specific tensor networks with simple belief propagation to keep up with the entanglement generated during the time evolution and then extracting expectation values with more sophisticated variants of belief propagation, state-of-the-art accuracies can be reached with modest computational resources. The scalability of our simulations allows us to verify the universal physics present in the system and extract a value for the associated Kibble-Zurek exponent which agrees with recent values obtained in literature. Our results demonstrate that tensor networks are a viable approach for simulating large scale quantum dynamics in two and three dimensions on classical computers, and algorithmic advancements are expected to expand their applicability going forward.</description>

      <title>Quantum State Designs from Minimally Random Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random many-body states are both a useful tool to model certain physical systems and an important asset for quantum computation. Realising them, however, generally requires an exponential (in system size) amount of resources. Recent research has presented a way out by showing that one can generate random states, or more precisely a controlled approximation of them, by applying a quantum circuit built in terms of few-body unitary gates. Most of this research, however, has been focussed on the case of quantum circuits composed by completely random unitary gates. Here we consider what happens for circuits that, instead, involve a minimal degree of randomness. Specifically, we concentrate on two different settings: (a) brickwork quantum circuits with a single one-qudit random matrix at a boundary; (b) brickwork quantum circuits with fixed interactions but random one-qudit gates everywhere. We show that, for any given initial state, (a) and (b) produce a distribution of states approaching the Haar distribution in the limit of large circuit depth. More precisely, we show that the moments of the distribution produced by our circuits can approximate the ones of the Haar distribution in a depth proportional to the system size. Interestingly we find that in both Cases (a) and (b) the relaxation to the Haar distribution occurs in two steps - this is in contrast with what happens in fully random circuits. Moreover, we show that choosing appropriately the fixed interactions, for example taking the local gate to be a dual-unitary gate with high enough entangling power, minimally random circuits produce a Haar random distribution more rapidly than fully random circuits. In particular, dual-unitary circuits with maximal entangling power - i.e. perfect tensors - appear to provide the optimal quantum state design preparation for any design number.</description>

      <title>Fast and memory efficient strong simulation of noisy adaptive linear optical circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exactly computing the full output distribution of linear optical circuits remains a challenge, as existing methods are either time-efficient but memory-intensive or memory-efficient but slow. Moreover, any realistic simulation must account for noise, and any viable quantum computing scheme based on linear optics requires feedforward. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that models the output amplitudes as partial derivatives of a multivariate polynomial. The algorithm explores the lattice of all intermediate partial derivatives, where each derivative is used to compute more efficiently ones with higher degree. In terms of memory, storing one path from the root to the leaves is sufficient to iterate over all amplitudes and requires only $2^n$ elements, as opposed to $\binom{n+m-1}{n}$ for the fastest state of the art method. This approach effectively balances the time-memory trade-off while extending to both noisy and feedforward scenarios with negligible cost. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach in the literature to meet all these requirements. We demonstrate how this method enables the simulation of systems that were previously out of reach, while providing a concrete implementation and complexity analysis.</description>

      <title>Medusa 84 SiH -- A novel high Selectivity Electron Beam Resist for Diamond Quantum Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the novel electron beam resist Medusa 84 SiH by Allresist GmbH (Germany) for nanostructuring of single crystal diamond and its effects on the spin properties of nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in nanopillars as prototypes for photonic structures. We find contrast curves comparable to those of resists previously used for this task (Hydrogensilsequioxane FOx). We present a minimum selectivity for diamond etching of 6$\pm$1. Using an adhesion-promoting silicon interlayer enables fabrication yields of up to 98\%. We measure $T_2$ times of up to $\sim$25 $\mu$s before and after processing, demonstrating that the manufactured structures are usable for diamond-based quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Architecture for a Trustworthy Quantum Chatbot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based tools such as ChatGPT seem useful for classical programming assignments. The more specialized the field, the more likely they lack reliability because of the lack of data to train them. In the case of quantum computing, the quality of answers of generic chatbots is low.
  C4Q is a chatbot focused on quantum programs that addresses this challenge through a software architecture that integrates specialized LLMs to classify requests and specialized question answering modules with a deterministic logical engine to provide trustworthy quantum computing support. This article describes the latest version (2.0) of C4Q, which delivers several enhancements: ready-to-run Qiskit code for gate definitions and circuit operations, expanded features to solve software engineering tasks such as the travelling salesperson problem and the knapsack problem, and a feedback mechanism for iterative improvement.
  Extensive testing of the backend confirms the system's reliability, while empirical evaluations show that C4Q 2.0's classification LLM reaches near-perfect accuracy. The evaluation of the result consists in a comparative study with three existing chatbots highlighting C4Q 2.0's maintainability and correctness, reflecting on how software architecture decisions, such as separating deterministic logic from probabilistic text generation impact the quality of the results.</description>

      <title>Exceptional Topology on Nonorientable Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We classify gapped and gapless phases of non-Hermitian band structures on two-dimensional nonorientable parameter spaces. Such spaces arise in a wide range of physical systems in the presence of non-symmorphic parameter space symmetries. For gapped phases, we find that nonorientable spaces provide a natural setting for exploring fundamental structural problems in braid group theory, such as torsion and conjugacy. Gapless phases, which host exceptional points (EPs), explicitly violate the fermion doubling theorem, even in two-band models. We demonstrate that EPs traversing the nonorientable parameter space exhibit non-Abelian charge inversion. These braided phases and their transitions leave distinct signatures in the form of bulk Fermi arc degeneracies, offering a concrete route toward experimental realization and verification.</description>

      <title>Beyond-mean-field phases of rotating dipolar condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rotating dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates exhibit rich physics due to the interplay of long-range interactions and rotation, leading to unconventional vortex structures and strongly correlated phases. While most studies rely on mean-field approaches, these fail to capture quantum correlations that become significant at high rotation speeds and strong interactions. In this study, we go beyond the mean-field description by employing a numerically exact multiconfigurational approach to study finite-sized dipolar condensates. We reveal novel vortex structures, rotating cluster states, and strong fragmentation effects, demonstrating that beyond-mean-field correlations remain prominent even in larger systems. By quantifying deviations from mean-field theory, we provide a predictive framework for analyzing experiments and exploring emergent quantum phases, with implications for both the fundamental theory of ultracold gases and the quantum simulation of correlated superfluid systems like in neutron stars.</description>

      <title>The singlet-triplet and exchange-only flopping-mode spin qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semiconductor-based spin qubits embedded into a superconducting microwave cavity constitute a fast-progressing and promising platform for realizing fast and fault-tolerant qubit control with long-range two-qubit coupling. The flopping-mode spin qubit consists of a single electron in a double quantum dot; it combines a charge qubit with a spin qubit. With its strong and tunable cavity coupling, the flopping-mode qubit is proven to be well-suited for low-power qubit control and cavity-mediated long-range quantum gates. The singlet-triplet (ST) and exchange-only (EO) qubits are multi-electron realizations that go without broadband control and are protected from some types of noise, but are challenging to couple to each other and to microwave cavities. We combine the flopping-mode concept with the ST and EO qubits and propose two new flopping-mode qubits that consist of three (four) quantum dots, occupied by two (three) electrons near the (1,0,1) - (0,1,1) [(1,0,1,1) -- (0,1,1,1)] charge transition. The two-electron system augments the $ST_0$ spin qubit with a charge qubit that interacts transversally and longitudinally with a cavity. Both couplings are highly tunable, and the longitudinal coupling distinguishes the flopping-mode ST qubit from the regular flopping-mode qubit. The longitudinal coupling allows for non-dissipative universal control similar to superconducting transmon qubits. The EO flopping-mode qubit comprises four dots occupied by three electrons and opens a new possibility to perform two-qubit gates for EO qubits that are challenging to perform directly with the exchange coupling. We use input-output theory to provide means of extracting the coupling strengths from cavity transmission data.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibirum physics of density-difference dependent Hamiltonian: Quantum Scarring from Emergent Chiral Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars represent a form of weak ergodicity breaking that highlights the unusual physics of thermalization in quantum systems. Understanding scar formation promises insight into the connection between classical statistical mechanics and the quantum world. The existence of quantum many-body scars calls into question how the macroscopic world can arise from the Schrodinger equation. In this work, we demonstrate the existence of quantum many-body scars in the density-difference-dependent Hamiltonian. This Hamiltonian has a particular manifestation of chiral symmetry due to its interaction being neither attractive nor repulsive a prior, but depending on the configuration. As a result of this symmetry and peculiar interaction, we find that this system hosts two different classes of quantum scars; a charge density wave ordered scar and an edge-mode scar. We establish the existence of these scars by examining the entanglement entropy of the system as well as demonstrating robust thermalization breaking time dynamics. For each, we propose simple mechanisms that give rise to these scars which may be applicable to other systems.</description>

      <title>Calculation of low-energy scattering parameters using artificial oscillator trap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a recipe to estimate the low-energy scattering parameters of a quantum few-body system - scattering length, effective range, and shape parameter - by using only discrete state calculations. We place the system in an artificial oscillator trap of appropriate size and calculate the energies of the resulting discrete states close to the threshold of the system. The low-energy scattering parameters are then extracted - using a simple analytic formula - from the functional dependence of these energies upon the trap size. We first test the recipe against a simple model problem and then apply it to low-energy nucleon-nucleon scattering within the nuclear Model with Explicit Mesons in one sigma-meson approximation.</description>

Abstract: Here we discuss an influence of an external weak gravitational field on the gravitational self-decoherence effect with help of the stochastic extension of regularized Shr\"odinger-Newton equation in a curved background. We derive the master equation and demonstrate that it leads to the experimentally verifiable conclusions about applicability of the classical description of the weak gravitation field. Namely, a presence of oscillating terms in the otherwise purely exponential decay of the coherence would indicate classicality of gravity for the case.</description>

      <title>Step-by-step design guide of a cryogenic three-axis vector magnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A tunable magnetic field at low temperatures is essential for numerous applications, including spintronics, magnetic resonance imaging, and condensed matter physics. While commercial superconducting vector magnets are available, they are complex, expensive, and often not adaptable to specific experimental needs. As a result, simple in-house designs are often being used in research environments. However, no comprehensive step-by-step guide for their construction currently exists. In this work, we provide a detailed manual for designing and building a cryogenically compatible three-axis vector magnet. The system is tested at the mixing chamber of a dilution refrigerator at temperatures ranging from 15 mK to 4 K, with no significant increase in base temperature. Safety measures are implemented to mitigate heating from quenching. The coils are successfully driven with DC currents as high as 3 A, generating magnetic fields of up to 2.5 T. Magnetic field measurements using Hall sensors demonstrate good agreement with the predictions of the designed performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hubbard systems are paradigmatic realizations of strongly correlated many-body systems. Introducing additional species breaks the SU(2) symmetry of the Hubbard model and leads to a wide variety of novel exotic quantum phases. Three-component fermionic systems are at the heart of model systems for quantum chromodynamics where the three components reflect the three flavors. Here, we extend quantum gas microscopy to three-flavor Fermi lattice gases in the Hubbard regime. Relying on site- and flavor-resolved detection, we study the phase diagram of the three-flavor Hubbard model and find signatures of flavor-selective localization and selective pairing at temperatures down to the tunneling energy scale. Our measurements are compared with numerical linked-cluster expansion calculations. Further increase of phase space density may enable the observation of a novel pair Mott phase at half filling, and shows a path towards the study of color superfluidity and other aspects of quantum chromodynamics.</description>

Abstract: Quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) is a promising paradigm for near-term quantum devices. While existing QRL methods have shown success in discrete action spaces, extending these techniques to continuous domains is challenging due to the curse of dimensionality introduced by discretization. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a quantum Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm that efficiently addresses both classical and quantum sequential decision problems in continuous action spaces. Moreover, our approach facilitates single-shot quantum state generation: a one-time optimization produces a model that outputs the control sequence required to drive a fixed initial state to any desired target state. In contrast, conventional quantum control methods demand separate optimization for each target state. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through simulations and discuss its potential applications in quantum control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.07546v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the pinching operator, which extends the theory of squeezing operators to non-Gaussian operators, and use it to approximate $n$-photon entangled states using a pinched vacuum state and pinching tensor of rank $n$. A simple recursion relation is derived for generating the Bogoliubov transformed creation and annihilation operators, which may be used to express the pinched state as a statistically equivalent set of nonlinearly transformed complex Gaussian random variables. Using this representation, we compare low-order approximations of the pinched state to entangled multiphoton Fock states, such as Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) and W states. Using post-selection and a threshold detector model to represent non-Gaussian measurements, we find that this model is capable of producing states with a fidelity comparable to that of experimentally prepared multiphoton entangled states. Our results show that it is possible to classically simulate large multiphoton entangled states to high fidelity within the constraints of finite detection efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.13252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An exactly solvable Kitaev model in a two-dimensional square lattice exhibits a topological quantum phase transition which is different from the symmetry-breaking transition at zero temperature. When the ground state of a nonlinearly perturbed Kitaev model with different strengths of perturbation taken as the initial state is quenched to a pure Kitaev model, we demonstrate that various features of the dynamical state, such as the Loschmidt echo and time-averaged multipartite entanglement, can determine whether the initial state belongs to the topological phase or not. Moreover, the derivatives of the dynamical quantifiers can faithfully identify the topological quantum phase transition, which is present at equilibrium. When the individual qubits of the lattice interact with the local thermal bath repeatedly, we observe that block entanglement in dissipative dynamics can nevertheless distinguish the equilibrium phases from which the system starts evolution.</description>

      <title>Wavefunction branching: when you can't tell pure states from mixed states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04494v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a definition of wavefunction "branchings": quantum superpositions which can't be feasibly distinguished from the corresponding mixed state, even under time evolution. Our definition is largely independent of interpretations, requiring only that it takes many more local gates to swap branches than to distinguish them. We give several examples of states admitting such branch decompositions. Under our definition, we argue that attempts to get relative-phase information between branches will fail without frequent active error correction, that branches are effectively the opposite of good error-correcting codes, that branches effectively only grow further apart in time under natural evolution, that branches tend to absorb spatial entanglement, that branching is stronger in the presence of conserved quantities, and that branching implies effective irreversibility. Identifying these branch decompositions in many-body quantum states could shed light on the emergence of classicality, provide a metric for experimental tests at the quantum/ classical boundary, and allow for longer numerical time evolution simulations. We see this work as a generalization of the basic ideas of environmentally-induced decoherence to situations with no clear system/ environment split.</description>

Abstract: The potential synergy between quantum communications and future wireless communication systems is explored. By proposing a quantum-native or quantum-by-design philosophy, the survey examines technologies such as quantumdomain (QD) multi-input multi-output, QD non-orthogonal multiple access, quantum secure direct communication, QD resource allocation, QD routing, and QD artificial intelligence. The recent research advances in these areas are summarized. Given the behavior of photonic and particle-like Terahertz (THz) systems, a comprehensive system-oriented perspective is adopted to assess the feasibility of using quantum communications in future systems.

      <title>Dual-unitary shadow tomography</title>

Abstract: We introduce a classical shadow tomography protocol based on dual-unitary brick-wall circuits termed ``dual-unitary shadow tomography'' (DUST). To quantify the performance of DUST, we study operator spreading and Pauli weight dynamics in one-dimensional qubit systems, evolved by random two-local dual-unitary gates arranged in a brick-wall structure, ending with a final measurement layer. We do this by deriving general constraints on the Pauli weight transfer matrix and specializing to the case of dual-unitarity. Remarkably, we find that operator spreading in these circuits have a rich structure resembling that of relativistic quantum field theories, with massless chiral excitations that can decay or fuse into each other, which we call left- or right-movers. We develop a mean-field description of the Pauli weight in terms of $\rho(x,t)$, which represents the probability of having nontrivial support at site $x$ and depth $t$ starting from a fixed weight distribution. We develop an equation of state for $\rho(x,t)$ and simulate it numerically using Monte Carlo simulations. For the task of predicting operators with (nearly) full support, we show that DUST outperforms brick-wall Clifford shadows of equivalent depth. This advantage is further pronounced for small system sizes and more generally, our results are robust to finite-size effects.</description>

      <title>Correction Formulas for the M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen Gate Under Strong Driving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17478v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen gate is a widely used entangling gate for ion platforms with inherent robustness to trap heating. The gate performance is limited by coherent errors, arising from the Lamb-Dicke (LD) approximation and sideband errors. Here, we provide explicit analytical formulas for errors up to fourth order in the LD parameter, by using the Magnus expansion to match numerical precision, and overcome significant, orders-of-magnitude underestimation of errors by previous theory methods. We show that fourth order Magnus expansion terms are unavoidable, being in fact leading order in LD, and are therefore critical to include for typical experimental fidelity ranges. We show how these errors can be dramatically reduced compared to previous theory by using analytical renormalization of the drive strength, by calibration of the Lamb-Dicke parameter, and by the use of smooth pulse shaping.</description>

      <title>Fault-tolerant compiling of classically hard IQP circuits on hypercubes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Realizing computationally complex quantum circuits in the presence of noise and imperfections is a challenging task. While fault-tolerant quantum computing provides a route to reducing noise, it requires a large overhead for generic algorithms. Here, we develop and analyze a hardware-efficient, fault-tolerant approach to realizing complex sampling circuits. We co-design the circuits with the appropriate quantum error correcting codes for efficient implementation in a reconfigurable neutral atom array architecture, constituting what we call a fault-tolerant compilation of the sampling algorithm. Specifically, we consider a family of $[[2^D , D, 2]]$ quantum error detecting codes whose transversal and permutation gate set can realize arbitrary degree-$D$ instantaneous quantum polynomial (IQP) circuits. Using native operations of the code and the atom array hardware, we compile a fault-tolerant and fast-scrambling family of such IQP circuits in a hypercube geometry, realized recently in the experiments by Bluvstein et al. [Nature 626, 7997 (2024)]. We develop a theory of second-moment properties of degree-$D$ IQP circuits for analyzing hardness and verification of random sampling by mapping to a statistical mechanics model. We provide evidence that sampling from hypercube IQP circuits is classically hard to simulate and analyze the linear cross-entropy benchmark (XEB) in comparison to the average fidelity. To realize a fully scalable approach, we first show that Bell sampling from degree-$4$ IQP circuits is classically intractable and can be efficiently validated. We further devise new families of $[[O(d^D),D,d]]$ color codes of increasing distance $d$, permitting exponential error suppression for transversal IQP sampling. Our results highlight fault-tolerant compiling as a powerful tool in co-designing algorithms with specific error-correcting codes and realistic hardware.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Digital quantum computers promise exponential speedups in performing quantum time-evolution, providing an opportunity to simulate quantum dynamics of complex systems in physics and chemistry. However, the task of extracting desired quantum properties at intermediate time steps remains a computational bottleneck due to wavefunction collapse and no-fast-forwarding theorem. Despite significant progress towards building a Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computer (FTQC), there is still a need for resource-efficient quantum simulators. Here, we propose a hybrid simulator that enables classical computers to leverage FTQC devices and quantum time propagators to overcome this bottleneck, so as to efficiently simulate the quantum dynamics of large systems initialized in an unknown superposition of a few system eigenstates. It features no optimization subroutines and avoids barren plateau issues, while consuming fewer quantum resources compared to standard methods when many time steps are required.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the nonequilibrium steady state thermodynamics of a photodevice which can operate as a solar cell or a photoconductor, depending on the degree of asymmetry of the junction. The thermodynamic efficiency is captured by a single coefficient of performance. Using a minimal model based on a two-level system, we show that when the Coulomb interaction energy matches the transport gap of the junction, the photoconductor displays maximal response, performance, and signal-to-noise ratio, while the same regime is always detrimental for the solar cell. Nevertheless, we find that the Coulomb interaction is beneficial for the solar cell performance if it lies below the transport gap. Our work sheds important light on design principles for thermodynamically efficient photodevices in the presence of Coulomb interactions.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Causal Indefiniteness for Accessing Locally Inaccessible Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies suggest that physical theories can exhibit indefinite causal structures, where the causal order of events is fundamentally undefined yet logically consistent. Beyond its foundational appeal, causal indefiniteness has also emerged as a novel information-theoretic resource, offering advantages in various information processing tasks. Here, we investigate its utility in the classical Data Retrieval (DR) task. In its simplest version, a referee encodes classical messages into bipartite quantum states and distributes the local parts to two distant parties, ensuring that neither can independently extract any information about the encoded message. To retrieve their assigned data, parties must collaborate, and we show that those embedded in an indefinite causal structure generally outperform those operating within a definite causal framework. For the bipartite case, we establish a duality between the DR task and the well known Guess Your Neighbour's Input game and derive a criterion analogous to the Peres-Horodecki separability test to identify quantum processes that yield nontrivial success in the DR task. We also report an intriguing super-activation phenomenon, where two quantum processes, each individually inefficient for the DR task, become useful when combined. Extending the analysis to tripartite case, we show that classical causally inseparable processes can outperform quantum bi-causal processes in the DR task. Our study, thus, reveals several unexplored aspects of causal indefiniteness, inviting deeper investigation.</description>

      <title>Platonic dynamical decoupling sequences for interacting spin systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the NISQ era, where quantum information processing is hindered by the decoherence and dissipation of elementary quantum systems, developing new protocols to extend the lifetime of quantum states is of considerable practical and theoretical importance. A well-known technique, known as dynamical decoupling, uses a carefully designed sequence of pulses applied to a quantum system, such as a spin-$j$ (which represents a qudit with $d=2j+1$ levels), to suppress the coupling Hamiltonian between the system and its environment, thereby mitigating dissipation. While dynamical decoupling of qubit systems has been widely studied, the decoupling of qudit systems has been far less explored and often involves complex sequences and operations. In this work, we design efficient decoupling sequences composed solely of global $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ rotations and based on tetrahedral, octahedral, and icosahedral point groups, which we call Platonic sequences. We extend the Majorana representation for Hamiltonians to develop a simple framework that establishes the decoupling properties of each Platonic sequence and show its effectiveness on many examples. These sequences are universal in their ability to cancel any type of interaction with the environment for single spin-$j$ with spin quantum number $j\leqslant 5/2$, and they are capable of decoupling up to $5$-body interactions in an ensemble of interacting spin-$1/2$ with only global pulses, provided that the interaction Hamiltonian has no isotropic component, with the exception of the global identity. We also discuss their inherent robustness to finite pulse duration and a wide range of pulse errors, as well as their potential application as building blocks for dynamically corrected gates.</description>

Abstract: A recent article by Ivander, Lindoy and Lee [Nature Communications 15, 8087 (2024)] claims to discover the relationship between the generalized quantum master equation (GQME) and the path integral for a system coupled to a harmonic bath. However, this relationship was already established in 2020 by Makri in the context of the small matrix decomposition of the path integral (SMatPI) [J. Chem. Theory and Comput. 16, 4038 (2020)]. The procedure that this article uses in its Supplementary Information (SI) to obtain the various matrices follows the SMatPI decomposition steps for the alternative Trotter ordering. The absence of endpoint effects in the kernel matrices of the discretized GQME expression for the reduced density matrix (RDM) is the consequence of a crude GQME discretization and is not consistent with the SMatPI decomposition of an auxiliary matrix presented in the SI. This form is identical to the transfer tensor method (TTM) of Cerrillo and Cao [Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 110401 (2014)]. Further, the Dyck path section of this article follows precisely the diagrammatic analysis developed by Wang and Cai in a recent paper [Communications in Computational Physics 36, 389 (2024)]. We elaborate on these three critiques in this Comment.</description>

Abstract: Bell's theorem supposedly demonstrates an irreconcilable conflict between quantum mechanics and local, realistic hidden variable theories. Most proofs of Bell's theorem, are based on inequalities. In this paper we present an alternative proof which does not involve inequalities, but only a direct comparison between correlation functions calculated using quantum mechanics on the one hand, and those calculated according to local realistic hidden-variable theories on the other. Our proof is based on a physically motivated use of Fourier series for periodic functions, and confirms that local realistic hidden-variable theories are incompatible with quantum mechanics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We model and investigate the collective nonlinear optical response of an ensemble of two-level emitters that are weakly coupled to a single-mode waveguide. Our approach generalizes the insight that photon-photon correlations in the light scattered by a single two-level emitter result from two-photon interference to the case of many emitters. Using our model, we study different configurations for probing the nonlinear response of the ensemble, e.g., through the waveguide or via external illumination, and derive analytical expressions for the second-order quantum coherence function, $g^{(2)}(\tau)$, as well as for the squeezing spectrum of the output light in the waveguide, $S_\theta(\omega)$. For the transmission of resonant guided light, we recover the same predictions as previously made with far more involved theoretical models when analyzing experimental results regarding $g^{(2)}(\tau)$ (Prasad et al. [1]) and $S_\theta(\omega)$ (Hinney et al. [2]). We also study the transmission of light that is detuned from the transition of the two-level emitter, a situation that we recently studied experimentally (Cordier et al. [3]). Our model predictions show how the collectively enhanced nonlinear response of weakly coupled emitters can be harnessed to generate non-classical states of light using ensembles ranging from a few to many emitters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hybrid quantum systems are highly promising platforms for addressing important challenges of quantum information science and quantum sensing. Their implementation, however, is technologically non-trivial, since each component typically has unique experimental requirements. Here, we work towards a hybrid system consisting of a superconducting on-chip microwave circuit in a dilution refrigerator and optically trapped ultra-cold atoms. Specifically, we focus on the design optimization of a suitable superconducting chip and on the corresponding challenges and limitations. We unfold detailed microwave-cavity engineering strategies for maximized and tunable coupling rates to atomic Rydberg-Rydberg transitions in $\mathrm{^{87}Rb}$ atoms while respecting the boundary conditions due to the presence of a laser beam near the surface of the chip. Finally, we present an experimental implementation of the superconducting microwave chip and discuss the cavity characteristics as a function of temperature and applied dc voltage. Our results illuminate the required consideration aspects for a flexible, tunable superconductor-atom hybrid system, and lay the groundwork for realizing this exciting platform in a dilution refrigerator with vacuum Rabi frequencies approaching the strong-coupling regime.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of genuine tripartite non-Gaussian entanglement in a quantum gravitational system formed by a quantum harmonic oscillator coupled to a single frequency of a quantized gravitational wave. For this purpose, we introduce a new entanglement witness, well-suited for the graviton-matter interaction Hamiltonian analysed here. We show that the witness is non-zero for the three-mode states generated by the Hamiltonian when the system starts in the ground state, thus proving the generation of genuine multipartite quantum entanglement at the most fundamental level of theoretical graviton-matter interactions.</description>

Abstract: We propose a scheme for constructing versatile quantum simulators using ultracold Rydberg atoms in long-lived circular and elliptical states. By exciting different subspaces of internal atomic states, the atoms can be used to simulate two effective spin species with different spin-spin interactions. The strengths of transverse and longitudinal spin-spin interactions, both intra- and inter-species, can be controlled within a wide range of values. This setup can be used to simulate two-species spin models or lattice models with two sublattices. We show examples of specific models which can be realized.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum criticality of open many-body systems has attracted lots of interest for emergent phenomena and universality. Here we present the exact steady state of the quantum van der Pol oscillator using the complex $P$-representation. We show the threshold corresponds to a dissipative phase transition with abrupt changes of steady-state properties and enhanced metrology. The critical behaviors and finite-size effects are investigated through the analytical steady state. Moreover, we obtain divergent quantum Fisher information (QFI) in the thermodynamic limit both at the critical point and in the time crystal phase, but only the QFI at the critical point approaches the Heisenberg limit. We further prove that the steady-state photon number is the optimized estimated observable with the largest signal-to-noise ratio. We show that the Heisenberg-limited metrology originates from the larger enhancement of the susceptibility than the standard deviation of the photon number. Our work reveals the underlying relation between the time crystal, dissipative phase transition, and enhanced metrology.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic construction of SSA-compatible extreme rays of the subadditivity cone and the ${\sf N}=6$ solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the set of all extreme rays of the 6-party subadditivity cone that are compatible with strong subadditivity. In total, we identify 208 new (genuine 6-party) orbits, 52 of which violate at least one known holographic entropy inequality. For the remaining 156 orbits, which do not violate any such inequalities, we construct holographic graph models for 150 of them. For the final 6 orbits, it remains an open question whether they are holographic. Consistent with the strong form of the conjecture in arXiv:2204.00075, 148 of these graph models are trees. However, 2 of the graphs contain a "bulk cycle", leaving open the question of whether equivalent models with tree topology exist, or if these extreme rays are counterexamples to the conjecture. The paper includes a detailed description of the algorithm used for the computation, which is presented in a general framework and can be applied to any situation involving a polyhedral cone defined by a set of linear inequalities and a partial order among them to find extreme rays corresponding to down-sets in this poset.</description>

      <title>Blind calibration of a quantum computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum system calibration is limited by the ability to characterize a quantum state under unknown device errors. We develop an accurate calibration protocol that is blind to the precise preparation of a specific quantum state. It extracts device errors from simple tomographic data only, and does not require bespoke experiments for a priori specified error mechanisms. Using a trapped-ion quantum computer, we experimentally demonstrate the accuracy of the method by recovering intentional miscalibrations. We then use blind calibration to estimate the native calibration parameters of the experimental system. The recovered calibrations are close to directly measured values and perform similarly in predicting state properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce two new families of bosonic quantum error correction (QEC) codes to address collective coherent and amplitude-damping errors, building upon our previous multi-qubit QEC codes. These new bosonic codes enhance existing binomial codes for oscillators and permutation-invariant codes for qubits by reducing the required excitations per input qubit from linear to sub-linear growth. The mappings from multi-qubit stabilizer codes to bosonic codes establish a bridge between QEC code construction for qubits and oscillators, offering a unified approach to error correction across different quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Tailoring transport in quantum spin chains via disorder and collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15515v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We systematically investigate the interplay of disorder and space-time heterogeneous collisional noise in shaping the transport dynamics of an anisotropic XXZ spin chain. Using stochastic collision models to simulate interaction with the environment, we explore the localization-delocalization transitions across regimes with single and multiple excitations. We find that space homogeneous collisions occurring at low rates favor the shaping of regions where the localization degree sets in the form of subsequent plateaus at a rate and duration universally scaling with the collision rate. We also find that interactions among the excitations favor this process even for tiniest levels of disorder.
  Our findings can be applied to design stroboscopic protocols where sequences of transport and localization can be tailored. We establish relevant connections to noise-engineering of quantum devices in noisy intermediate-scale quantum simulators platforms, and to realistic biological systems where noise and disorder coexist.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Dynamic Majorana Hybridization for Universal Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Qubits built out of Majorana zero modes (MZMs) have long been theorized as a potential pathway toward fault-tolerant topological quantum computation. Almost unavoidable in these processes is Majorana wavefunction overlap, known as hybridization, which arise throughout the process when Majorana modes get close to each other. This breaks the ground state degeneracy, leading to qubit errors in the braiding process. This work presents a simple but precise method to predict qubit errors for dynamic hybridization which varies in space and time. This includes hybridization between four or more MZMs through topological or trivial regions, or both of them. As an illustration, we characterize qubit-errors for an X-gate. We demonstrate how to utilize the hybridization to implement not only arbitrary one-qubit rotations but also a two-qubit controlled variable phase gate, providing a demonstration of universal quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Partial yet definite emergence of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang class in isotropic spin chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07150v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrable spin chains with a continuous non-Abelian symmetry, such as the one-dimensional isotropic Heisenberg model, show superdiffusive transport with little theoretical understanding. Although recent studies reported a surprising connection to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class in that case, this view was most recently questioned by discrepancies in full counting statistics. Here, by combining extensive numerical simulations of classical and quantum integrable isotropic spin chains with a framework developed by exact studies of the KPZ class, we characterize various two-point quantities that remain hitherto unexplored in spin chains, and find full agreement with KPZ scaling laws without adjustable parameters. This establishes the partial emergence of the KPZ class in integrable isotropic spin chains. Moreover, we reveal that the KPZ scaling laws are intact in the presence of an energy current, under the appropriate Galilean boost required by the propagation of spacetime correlation.</description>

      <title>Dirac Equation Solution with Generalized tanh-Shaped Hyperbolic Potential: Application to Charmonium and Bottomonium Mass Spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15538v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present an analytical solution of the Dirac equation in a generalized tanh-shape hyperbolic potential, which allows us to unify various well-known quantum potentials under a single theoretical framework. This versatile potential model is used to compute the mass spectra for charmonium and bottomonium, with excellent agreement with experimental measurements and does better than some potential models in predicting the several orbital states. Our results not only validate the GTHP as a powerful tool for describing heavy quarkonium systems but also suggest its broader applicability in exploring quantum systems where similar potentials are effective. This work is a stepping stone for new research into fermionic systems with complex interactions, by jointly providing insights into foundational aspects of quantum mechanics as well as applications in particle physics.</description>

      <title>Operator K-complexity in DSSYK: Krylov complexity equals bulk length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the notion of complexity under time evolution in chaotic quantum systems with holographic duals. Continuing on from our previous work, we turn our attention to the issue of Krylov complexity upon the insertion of a class of single-particle operators in the double-scaled SYK model. Such an operator is described by a matter-chord insertion, which splits the theory into left/right sectors, allowing us, via chord-diagram technology, to compute two different notions of complexity associated to the operator insertion: first a Krylov operator complexity, and second the Krylov complexity of a state obtained by an operator acting on the thermofield double state. We will provide both an analytic proof and detailed numerical evidence, that both Krylov complexities arise from a recursively defined basis of states characterized by a constant total chord number. As a consequence, in all cases we are able to establish that Krylov complexity is given by the expectation value of a length operator acting on the Hilbert space of the theory, expressed in terms of basis states, organized by left and right chord number. We find analytic expressions for the semiclassical limit of K-complexity, and study how the size of the operator encodes the scrambling dynamics upon the matter insertion in Krylov language. We furthermore determine the effective Hamiltonian governing the evolution of K-complexity, showing that evolution on the Krylov chain can equivalently be understood as a particle moving in a Morse potential. A particular type of triple scaling limit allows to access the gravitational sector of the theory, in which the geometrical nature of K-complexity is assured by virtue of being a total chord length, in an analogous fashion to what was found in [1] for the K-complexity of the thermofield double state.</description>

      <title>Quantum Turbulence Across Dimensions: Crossover from two- to three-dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06133v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamic transition of quantum turbulence (QT) in a confined potential field as the system evolves from purely two-dimensional (2D) to quasi-two-dimensional, and ultimately to three-dimensional (3D), by fixing the lateral dimensions of the trapping box while varying its height. In the 2DQT, distinct Onsager vortex cluster formation and inverse energy cascade are observed, while 3DQT exhibits a direct energy cascade consistent with the Vinen turbulence decay rate, which display striking differences. By systematically altering the system height, we explore how dimensionality drives the differentiation of turbulence types and find that this transition is closely related to the excitation of Kelvin waves. Kelvin waves not only introduce additional dissipation mechanisms but also serve as mediators for direct energy transfer across scales. When the wavelength of the permitted Kelvin waves exceeds the critical size of vortex clusters, turbulence begins transitioning to 3D type, culminating in fully developed 3DQT at the characteristic scale. In the transitional region, we observe continuous variations in the decay rate and vortex cluster correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Melting of devil's staircases in the long-range Dicke-Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present quantum phase diagrams for the antiferromagnetic long-range Ising model with a linear coupling to a single bosonic mode on the square and triangular lattice. For zero coupling, the ground-state magnetization forms a devil's staircase structure of magnetization plateaux as a function of a longitudinal field. Apart from a paramagnetic superradiant phase with a finite photon density at strong light-matter couplings, the long-range interactions lead to a plethora of intermediate phases that break the translational symmetry and have a finite photon density at the same time. We apply an adaption of the unit-cell-based mean-field calculations, which captures all possible magnetic unit cells up to a chosen extent. Further, we exploit an exact mapping of the non-superradiant phases to an effective Dicke model to calculate upper bounds for phase transitions towards superradiant phases. Finally, to treat quantum fluctuations in a quantitative fashion, we employ a generalized wormhole quantum Monte Carlo algorithm. We discuss how these three methods are used in a cooperative fashion. In the calculated phase diagrams we see several features arising from the long-range interactions: The devil's staircases of distinct magnetically ordered normal phases and non-trivial magnetically ordered superradiant phases beyond the findings for nearest-neighbor interactions. Examples are a superradiant phase with a three-sublattice magnetic order on the square lattice and the superradiant Wigner crystal with four sites per unit cell on the triangular lattice. We find the transition between normal and superradiant phases with the same (different) magnetic order to be of second order with Dicke universality (first order). Further, between superradiant phases we find first-order phase transitions, besides specially highlighted regimes for which we find indications for second-order behavior.</description>

      <title>Minimizing sensor-sample distances in scanning nitrogen-vacancy magnetometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scanning magnetometry with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond has led to significant advances in the sensitive imaging of magnetic systems. The spatial resolution of the technique, however, remains limited to tens to hundreds of nanometers, even for probes where NV centers are engineered within 10 nm from the tip apex. Here, we present a correlated investigation of the crucial parameters that determine the spatial resolution: the mechanical and magnetic stand-off distances, as well as the sub-surface NV center depth in diamond. We study their contributions using mechanical approach curves, photoluminescence measurements, magnetometry scans, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of surface adsorbates. We first show that the stand-off distance is mainly limited by features on the surface of the diamond tip, hindering mechanical access. Next, we demonstrate that frequency-modulated atomic force microscopy (FM-AFM) feedback partially overcomes this issue, leading to closer and more consistent magnetic stand-off distances (26-87 nm) compared to the more common amplitude-modulated (AM-AFM) feedback (43-128 nm). FM operation thus permits improved magnetic imaging of sub-100-nm spin textures, shown for the spin cycloid in BFO and domain walls in a CoFeB synthetic antiferromagnet. Finally, by examining 1H and 19F NMR signals in soft contact with a polytetrafluoroethylene surface, we demonstrate a minimum NV-to-sample distance of 7.9+/-0.4 nm.</description>
