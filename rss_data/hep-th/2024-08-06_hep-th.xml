      <title>An Infrared On-Shell Action and its Implications for Soft Charge Fluctuations in Asymptotically Flat Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the infrared on-shell action of Einstein gravity in asymptotically flat spacetimes, obtaining an effective, gauge-invariant boundary action for memory and shockwave spacetimes. We show that the phase space is in both cases parameterized by the leading soft variables in asymptotically flat spacetimes, thereby extending the equivalence between shockwave and soft commutators to spacetimes with non-vanishing Bondi mass. We then demonstrate that our on-shell action is equal to three quantities studied separately in the literature: $(i)$ the soft supertranslation charge; $(ii)$ the shockwave effective action, or equivalently the modular Hamiltonian; and $(iii)$ the soft effective action. Finally, we compute the quantum fluctuations in the soft supertranslation charge and, assuming the supertranslation parameter may be promoted to an operator, we obtain an area law, consistent with earlier results showing that the modular Hamiltonian has such fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Defect Charges, Gapped Boundary Conditions, and the Symmetry TFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We offer a streamlined and computationally powerful characterization of higher representations (higher charges) for defect operators under generalized symmetries, employing the powerful framework of Symmetry TFT $\mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{C})$. For a defect $\mathscr{D}$ of codimension p, these representations (charges) are in one-to-one correspondence with gapped boundary conditions for the SymTFT $\mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{C})$ on a manifold $Y = \Sigma_{d-p+1} \times S^{p-1}$, and can be efficiently described through dimensional reduction. We explore numerous applications of our construction, including scenarios where an anomalous bulk theory can host a symmetric defect. This generalizes the connection between 't Hooft anomalies and the absence of symmetric boundary conditions to defects of any codimension. Finally we describe some properties of surface charges for (3 + 1)d duality symmetries, which should be relevant to the study of Gukov-Witten operators in gauge theories.</description>

      <title>3D $\mathcal{N}=1$ supergravity from Virasoro TQFT: Gravitational partition function and Out-of-time-order correlator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we compute the partition functions of $\mathcal{N}=1$ SUGRA for different boundary topologies, i.e. sphere and torus, using super-Virasoro TQFT. We use fusion and modular kernels of the super-Liouville theory to compute the necklace-channel conformal block and showcase formalism by proving that the inner product holds for superconformal blocks, defined as states in the Hilbert space. Finally, we compute the out-of-time-order correlator for the torus topology with superconformal primary insertions as matter using the tools of super-Virasoro TQFT and investigate its early-time behaviour.</description>

      <title>Fermionic back-reaction on kink and topological charge pumping in the $sl(2)$ affine Toda coupled to matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the Faddeev-Jackiw symplectic Hamiltonian reduction of the $sl(2)$ affine Toda model coupled to matter (ATM), which includes new parametrizations for a scalar field and a Grassmannian fermionic field. The structure of constraints and symplectic potentials primarily dictates the strong-weak dual coupling sectors of the theory, ensuring the equivalence of the Noether and topological currents. It is computed analytical fermion excited bound states localized on the kink, accounting for back-reaction. The total energy depends on the topological charge parameters for kink-fermion system satisfying first order differential equations and chiral current conservation equation. Our results demonstrate that the excited fermion bound states significantly alter the properties of the kink, and notably resulting in a pumping mechanism for the topological charge of the in-gap kink due to fermionic back-reaction, as well as the appearance of kink states in the continuum (KIC).</description>

      <title>Linearized fluctuating hydrodynamics via random polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that an ensemble of backgrounds best understands hydrodynamic dispersion relations in a medium with few degrees of freedom and is therefore subject to strong thermal fluctuations. In the linearized regime, dispersion relations become describeable by polynomials with random coefficients. We give a short review of this theory and perform a numerical study of the distribution of the roots of polynomials whose coefficients are of the order of a Knudsen series but fluctuate in accordance with canonical fluctuations of temperature. We find that, remarkably, the analytic structure of the poles of fluctuating dispersion relations is very different from deterministic ones, particularly regarding the distribution of imaginary parts with respect to real components. We argue that this provides evidence that hydrodynamic behavior persists, and is enhanced, by non-perturbative background fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Calculation of Some Integrals over Gaussian Measure with Nuclear Covariance Operator in Separable Hilbert Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main purpose of this paper is to construct convergent series for the approximate calculation of certain integrals over the Gaussian measure with a nuclear covariance operator, nonlocal propagator, in separable Hilbert space. Such series arise, for example, in the model with the interaction Lagrangian $\sinh^{2(p+1)}\varphi$, where $p \in \mathbb{N}$ and $\varphi$ is the scalar field, although the problem can be solved in general form for a fairly wide class of Lagrangians: an even, strictly convex, continuous, non-negative function with a single zero value for $\varphi=0$ and for $|\varphi|\rightarrow +\infty$ growing faster than $\varphi^{2}$. We strictly define the scattering matrix, $\mathcal{S}$-matrix, at the zero value of the classical field, argument of the $\mathcal{S}$-matrix, of such a theory in terms of the corresponding integral, find the iterated expansion for the integrand (the Gaussian measure doesn't expand) over two orthonormal bases of functions, prove the validity of summation and integration interchange and thus find the expansion of the $\mathcal{S}$-matrix at the zero value of the classical field into the iterated series in powers of the interaction action. The individual terms of the resulting series have the form of a canonical partition function (CPF), and the methods of statistical physics are applicable to them. In particular, we express them in terms of Bell polynomials. It is important to note that such iterated series cannot be reduced to the perturbation theory (PT) series, since in the proposed model the latter diverges as $e^{n^{2}}$, where $n \in \mathbb {N}$ is the PT order. Along the way, we provide detailed mathematical background, including Beppo Levi's monotone convergence theorem (MCT) and Henri Lebesgue's dominated convergence theorem (DCT), without which the presented calculation would be significantly more complex.</description>

      <title>{\AE}ther Coupling Effects on Casimir Energy for Self-Interacting Scalar Field within Extra Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents comprehensive calculations for thermal and first-order radiative corrections to the Casimir energy in systems involving self-interacting massive and massless scalar fields coupled with {\ae}ther in a fifth compact dimension. The method used to compute the radiative correction to the Casimir energy differs from conventional approaches by applying a unique renormalization scheme that is consistent with specific boundary conditions or backgrounds. Despite this divergence from conventional methodologies, our results demonstrate consistency within established physical limits. Furthermore, employing a toy model, we calculated the total Casimir energy density in the bulk, taking into account both thermal and radiative corrections. We also provide a thorough characterization of the total Casimir energy density in the compact dimension, detailing its magnitude and sign using graphical representations and quantitative data.</description>

      <title>UV stability of 1-loop radiative corrections in higher-derivative scalar field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the theory of a higher-derivative (HD) real scalar field $\phi$ coupled to a complex scalar $\sigma$, the coupling of the $\phi$ and $\sigma$ being given by two types, $\lambda_{\sigma\phi}\sigma^\dagger \sigma\phi^{2}$ and $\xi_{\sigma\phi}\sigma^\dagger \sigma\left(\partial_{\mu}\phi\right)^{2}$. We evaluate $\phi$ one-loop corrections $\delta V(\sigma)$ to the effective potential of $\sigma$, both the contribution from the positive norm part of $\phi$ and that from the {\it negative norm part} (ghost). We show that $\delta V(\sigma_{\rm cl})$ at $\sigma_{\rm cl}\to \infty$, where $\sigma_{\rm cl}$ is a classical value of $\sigma$, is positive, implying the stability of $\delta V(\sigma_{\rm cl})$ by the HD 1-loop radiative corrections at high energy.</description>

      <title>Quasi-elliptic cohomology of 4-spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-elliptic cohomology is conjectured by Sati and Schreiber as a particularly suitable approximation to equivariant 4-th Cohomotopy, which classifies the charges carried by M-branes in M-theory in a way that is analogous to the traditional idea that complex K-theory classifies the charges of D-branes in string theory. In this paper we compute quasi-elliptic cohomology of 4-spheres under the action by some finite subgroups that are the most interesting isotropy groups where the M5-branes may sit.</description>

      <title>Higher order constraints for the ($\beta$-deformed) Hermitian matrix models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the ($\beta$-deformed) higher order total derivative operators and analyze their remarkable properties. In terms of these operators, we derive the higher order constraints for the ($\beta$-deformed) Hermitian matrix models. We prove that these ($\beta$-deformed) higher order constraints are reducible to the Virasoro constraints. Meanwhile, the Itoyama-Matsuo conjecture for the constraints of the Hermitian matrix model is proved. We also find that through rescaling variable transformations, two sets of the constraint operators become the $W$-operators of $W$-representations for the ($\beta$-deformed) partition function hierarchies in the literature.</description>

      <title>Gravitational corrections to the two-loop beta function in a non-Abelian gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the coupling of massive fermions to gravity within the context of a non-Abelian gauge theory, utilizing the effective field theory framework for quantum gravity. Specifically, we calculate the two-loop beta function of the gauge coupling constant in a non-Abelian gauge theory, employing the one-graviton exchange approximation. Our findings reveal that gravitational corrections may lead to a non-trivial UV fixed point in the beta function of the gauge coupling constant, contingent upon the specific gauge group and the quantity of fermions involved.</description>

      <title>CFT Constraints on Parity-odd Interactions with Axions and Dilatons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We illustrate how the Conformal Ward Identities (CWIs) in momentum space completely determine the structure of a parity-odd 3-point correlator involving currents, energy momentum tensors and at least one scalar operator in $d=4$. Conformal invariance fixes almost all such possible correlators to vanish. The only exceptions are given by the $\langle JJO\rangle_{odd}$ and the $\langle TTO \rangle_{odd}$ which in momentum-space are protected by chiral and conformal anomalies. Specifically, one can obtain a non-vanishing solution by considering scalar operators such as $O=\nabla \cdot J_A$, $O=g_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu\nu}$ or their shadow transforms. We comment on the implications of these results that constrain the coupling of axions and dilatons in a conformal phase of the early universe.</description>

      <title>Celestial String Integrands &amp; their Expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We transform the one-loop four-point type $\mathrm{I}$ open superstring gluon amplitude to correlation functions on the celestial sphere including both the (non-)orientable planar and non-planar sector. This requires a Mellin transform with respect to the energies of the scattered strings, as well as to integrate over the open-string worldsheet moduli space. After accomplishing the former we obtain celestial string integrands with remaining worldsheet integrals $\Psi\left(\beta\right)$, where $\beta$ is related to the conformal scaling dimensions of the conformal primary operators under consideration. Employing an alternative approach of performing an $\alpha'$-expansion of the open superstring amplitude first and Mellin transforming afterwards, we obtain a fully integrated expression, capturing the pole structure in the $\beta$-plane. The same analysis is performed at tree-level yielding similar results. We conclude by solving $\Psi\left(\beta\right)$ for specific values of $\beta$, consistently reproducing the results of the $\alpha'$-expansion ansatz. In all approaches we find that the dependence on $\alpha'$ reduces to that of a simple overall factor of $\left(\alpha'\right)^{\beta-3}$ at loop and $\left(\alpha'\right)^{\beta}$ at tree level, consistent with previous literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we consider T-dualization of a $3D$ closed bosonic string that is propagating in space-time metric that has infinitesimal linear dependence on the coordinates $x^\mu$. Other fields, Kalb-Ramond and dilaton fields are set to zero. Action with this configuration of fields is not invariant to translations. In order to find T-dual theory we will employ generalization of the Buscher procedure that can be applied to such cases where we have coordinate dependent fields that do not possess translational isometry. Finally, using transformation laws that connect coordinates of starting and T-dual theories, we will be able to examine the geometric structure of T-dual theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new perturbative/non-perturbative (P/NP) relation that applies to a broader class of genus-1 potentials, including those that possess real and complex instantons parametrized by a deformation parameter, such as polynomial and elliptic potentials. Our findings significantly extend the scope of quantum mechanical systems for which perturbation theory suffices to calculate the contributions of non-perturbative effects to energy levels, with or without the need for a boundary condition, depending on the potential. We further provide evidence for our results by predicting the corrections to the large-order behavior of the perturbative expansion for the Jacobi SD elliptic potential using the early terms of the instanton fluctuations that satisfy the P/NP relation.</description>

      <title>The Kontsevich-Segal Criterion in the No-Boundary State Constrains Anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the Kontsevich-Segal-Witten (KSW) criterion applied to the no-boundary state constrains anisotropic deformations of de Sitter space. We consider squashed $S^3$ and $S^1 \times S^2$ boundaries and find that in both models, the KSW criterion excludes a significant range of homogeneous but anisotropic configurations. For squashed $S^3$ boundaries, the excluded range includes all surface geometries with negative scalar curvature, in line with dS/CFT reasoning. For $S^1 \times S^2$ boundaries, we find that KSW selects the low-temperature regime of configuration space where the $S^1$ is sufficiently large compared to the $S^2$. In both models, the KSW criterion renders the semiclassical wave function normalizable, up to one-loop effects.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Quantum Field Theory Approach to Wavepacket Tunneling: Lack of Superluminal Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate relativistic wavepacket dynamics for an electron tunneling through a potential barrier employing space-time resolved solutions to relativistic quantum field theory (QFT) equations. We prove by linking the QFT property of micro-causality to the wavepacket behavior that the tunneling dynamics is fully causal, precluding instantaneous or superluminal effects that have recently been reported in the literature. We illustrate these results by performing numerical computations for an electron tunneling through a potential barrier for standard tunneling as well for Klein tunneling. In all cases (Klein tunneling \ or regular tunneling across a standard or a supercritical potential) the transmitted wavepacket remains in the causal envelope of the propagator, even when its average position lies ahead of the average position of the corresponding freely propagated wavepacket.</description>

Particularly noteworthy is the fact that the matter-energy distribution attributed to this charged wormhole configuration adheres to the weak energy condition, thus presenting an instance of a five-dimensional wormhole supported by non-exotic matter. Furthermore, our analysis shows that scalar quantities related to space-time curvature and parameters associated with the matter-energy distribution remain finite at the wormhole throat. Moreover, they diminish as distance extends toward infinity, indicating the asymptotic flatness inherent in our model.</description>

      <title>Charged solution with equal metric ansatz in Gauss-Bonnet theory coupled to scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the course of this research, we employ the Gauss-Bonnet equation of motion alongside the scalar field and potential to acquire a fresh solution for a spherically symmetrical charged black hole. Specifically, we derive this black hole solution by employing a metric potential where the components are equal, that is, $g_{tt}=g_{rr}$. In our research, we achieve several accomplishments, including fixing the characteristics of the scalar field, and the Gauss-Bonnet term. We thoroughly examine the physical properties associated with such black hole and show that we have supplementary terms when compared to the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole solution. These additional terms are of the order $O(\frac{1}{r^6})$ and $O(\frac{1}{r^9})$. The presence of these supplementary terms can be attributed to the impact of the scalar function denoted as $\xi$. Such expressions play a crucial role in generating the multi-horizon black hole solution. The presence of these extra terms facilitates the derivation of a modified first law of thermodynamics and the corresponding Smarr relation.</description>

      <title>Linear stability of a time-dependent, spherically symmetric background in beyond Horndeski theory and the speed of gravity waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address a dynamical, spherically symmetric background in beyond Horndeski theory and formulate a set of linear stability conditions for high energy perturbation modes about an arbitrary solution. In this general setting we derive speeds of propagation in both radial and angular directions for gravity waves and compare them with the speed of light in the case of minimally coupled photon. In particular, we find that the class of beyond Horndeski theories, which satisfy the equality of gravity waves' speed to the speed of light, feature gravity waves propagating at superluminal speeds about a time-dependent inhomogeneous background.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose that physical time is based on counting the oscillations of wave functions. The discrete counting of the ticks of these clocks does not depend on the metric frame. It remains well defined for the beginning epochs of the universe. The photon clock counts the oscillations of electromagnetic plane waves in the cosmic reference frame. It can be gauged with clocks for other massless or massive particles. These equivalent clocks form a clock system which defines a common universal continuous physical time. For the photon clock this physical time coincides with conformal time. The universe is eternal towards the past for typical models of inflationary cosmology -- the photon clock ticks an infinite number of times. We compare the photon clock system to geodesic physical time, which is a frame invariant generalization of proper time.</description>

      <title>Discriminating among cosmological models by data-driven methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explores the Pantheon+SH0ES dataset to identify patterns that can discriminate between different cosmological models. We focus on determining whether the behaviour of dark energy is consistent with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model or suggests novel cosmological features. The central goal is to evaluate the robustness of the $\Lambda$CDM model compared with other dark energy models, and to investigate whether there are deviations that might indicate new cosmological insights. The study takes into account a data-driven approach, using both traditional statistical methods and machine learning techniques. Initially, we evaluate six different dark energy models using traditional statistical methods like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), Static and Dynamic Nested Sampling to infer the cosmological parameters. Subsequently, we adopt a machine learning approach, developing a regression model to compute the distance modulus of each supernova, expanding the feature set to 74 statistical features. Traditional statistical analysis confirms that the $\Lambda$CDM model is robust, yielding expected parameter values. Other models show deviations, with the Generalised and Modified Chaplygin Gas models performing poorly. In the machine learning analysis, feature selection techniques, particularly Boruta, significantly improve model performance. In particular, models initially considered weak (Generalised/Modified Chaplygin Gas) show significant improvement after feature selection. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of a data-driven approach to cosmological model evaluation. The $\Lambda$CDM model remains robust, while machine learning techniques, in particular feature selection, reveal potential improvements in alternative models which could be relevant for new observational campaigns like the recent DESI survey.</description>

      <title>Symmetric black-to-white hole solutions with a cosmological constan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a system with a Hamiltonian constraint, we demonstrate that its dynamics preserves invariant with respect to the choice of the lapse function, regardless of whether the Hamiltonian incorporates quantum corrections. Applying this observation to the interior of black-to-white holes, we analyze its dynamics with different choices of the lapse function. The results explicitly show that the leading-order expansion of both metrics in Refs. [1,2] and Refs. [3,4] exhibits identical behavior near the transition surface,therefore in this sense the black-to-white hole model proposed in Refs. [1,2] may be interpreted as a coarse-grained version of the solution within the framework of loop quantum gravity. The black-to-white hole solutions with exact symmetry between the black hole and white hole regions are constructed by appropriately fixing the quantum parameters in the effective theory of loop quantum gravity. This approach circumvents the issue of amplification of mass, which could arise from a mass difference between the black hole and white hole. Finally, the black-to-white hole solutions with a cosmological constant are constructed. The numerical solutions for the interior of black-to-white hole with a cosmological constant are obtained, and their symmetric behavior is also discussed.</description>

      <title>New edge modes and corner charges for first-order symmetries of 4D gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a set of noncommuting frame-translation symmetries in 4D gravity in tetrad-connection variables, which allow expressing diffeomorphisms as composite transformations. Working on the phase space level for finite regions, we pay close attention to the corner piece of the generators, discuss various possible charge brackets, relative definitions of the charges, coupling to spinors and relations to other charges. What emerges is a picture of the symmetries and edge modes of gravity that bears local resemblance to a Poincare group $SO(1,3)\ltimes \mathbb{R}^{1,3}$, but possesses structure functions. In particular, we argue that the symmetries and charges presented here are more amenable to discretisation, and sketch a strategy for this charge algebra, geared toward quantum gravity applications.</description>

Abstract: In this review, a pedagogical introduction to the concepts of slow-roll inflationary Universe and number of $e$-folds is provided. In particular, the differences between the basic notion of number of $e$-folds ($N_e$), total number of $e$-folds ($N_T$) and number of $e$-folds before the end of inflation ($N$), are outlined. The proper application of the number of $e$-folds before the end of inflation is discussed both as a time-like variable for the scalar field evolution and as a key parameter for computing inflationary predictions.</description>

      <title>Post-Newtonian observables for aligned-spin binaries to sixth order in spin from gravitational self-force and Compton amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of compact binaries is essential for gravitational-wave detection and parameter estimation, with spin being an important effect to include in waveform models. In this paper, we derive new post-Newtonian (PN) results for the conservative aligned-spin dynamics at next-to-next-to-leading order for the spin$^3$ and spin$^4$ contributions, in addition to the next-to-leading order (NLO) spin$^5$ and spin$^6$ contributions. One approach we follow is the Tutti Frutti method, which relates PN and gravitational self-force (GSF) results through the redshift and spin-precession invariants, by making use of the simple dependence of the scattering angle on the symmetric mass ratio. However, an ambiguity arises at the NLO spin$^5$ contribution, due to transcendental functions of the Kerr spin in the redshift; this is also the order at which Compton amplitudes calculations are affected by spurious poles. Therefore, we follow an additional approach to determine the NLO spin$^5$ and spin$^6$ dynamics: using on-shell Compton amplitudes obtained from black hole perturbation theory. The Compton amplitude used in this work is composed of the unambiguous tree-level far-zone part reported in [Phys. Rev. D 109, no.8, 084071 (2024)], as well as the full, non-interfering with the far-zone, $\ell=2$ partial wave contributions from the near zone, which are responsible for capturing Kerr finite-size effects. Other results in this paper include deriving the scattering angle of a spinning test body in a Kerr background from a parametrized worldline action, and computing the redshift and spin-precession invariants for eccentric orbits without an eccentricity expansion.</description>

      <title>Resonant excitation of eccentricity in spherical extreme-mass-ratio inspirals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational radiation reaction, has been one of the fundamental issues in general relativity. Over a span of decades, this process has been analyzed in the adiabatic limit, in order to comprehend how it drives extreme-mass-ratio binaries, that are prime targets for space-borne detectors. It has been shown that spherical orbits around Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes remain spherical (zero eccentricity) under the influence of gravitational radiation reaction. Here, we show that spherical orbits in non-Kerr black holes, that still preserve most of the good qualities and symmetries of Kerr spacetime, can access certain resonances in such a way that an initially spherical inspiral acquires non-zero eccentricity and becomes non-spherical. Therefore, the crossing of resonances under radiation reaction interrupts and even inverts, up to some small radius close to plunge, the process of circularization of orbits. The strength of resonant excitation of eccentricity depends on the initial position and inclination of the integrable extreme-mass-ratio system, as well as the integrability-breaking parameter introduced in the background spacetime that amplifies further the excitation. We find that the harmonics of gravitational waves emitted from these inspirals undergo a frequency modulation as the orbit `metamorphoses' from spherical to non-spherical, due to the effect of resonant eccentricity excitation. The gain that low-amplitude harmonics experience in these oligochromatic EMRIs, due to resonances, may be detectable with future spaceborne detectors and serves as an indicator of non-Kerrness of the background spacetime.</description>

      <title>Decoding the gaugino code, naturally, at high-lumi LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural supersymmetry with light higgsinos is most likely to emerge from the string landscape since the volume of scan parameter space shrinks to tiny volumes for electroweak unnatural models. Rather general arguments favor a landscape selection of soft SUSY breaking terms tilted to large values, but tempered by the atomic principle: that the derived value of the weak scale in each pocket universe lie not too far from its measured value in our universe. But that leaves (at least) three different paradigms for gaugino masses in natural SUSY models: unified (as in nonuniversal Higgs models), anomaly-mediation form (as in natural AMSB) and mirage mediation form (with comparable moduli- and anomaly-mediated contributions). We perform landscape scans for each of these, and show they populate different, but overlapping, positions in m(\ell\bar{\ell}) and m(wino) space. The first of these may be directly measurable at high-lumi LHC via the soft opposite-sign dilepton plus jets plus MET signature arising from higgsino pair production while the second of these could be extracted from direct wino pair production leading to same-sign diboson production.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article assesses Landauer's principle from information theory in the context of area quantization of the Schwarzschild black hole. Within a quantum-mechanical perspective where Hawking evaporation can be interpreted in terms of transitions between the discrete states of the area (or mass) spectrum, we justify that Landauer's principle holds consistently with the bound saturating when the number of microstates of the black hole goes as $2^n$, where $n$ is a large positive integer labeling the levels of the area/mass spectrum in the semiclassical regime. This is equivalent to the area spacing $\Delta A = \alpha n l_P^2$ (in natural units), where $\alpha = 4 \ln 2$ for which the entropy spacing between consecutive levels in Boltzmann units coincides exactly with one bit of information. We also comment on the situation for other values of $\alpha$ prevalent in the literature.</description>

      <title>Quasi-BPS categories for Higgs bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce quasi-BPS categories for twisted Higgs bundles, which are building blocks of the derived category of coherent sheaves on the moduli stack of semistable twisted Higgs bundles over a smooth projective curve. Under some condition (called BPS condition), the quasi-BPS categories are non-commutative analogues of Hitchin integrable systems.
  We begin the study of these quasi-BPS categories by focusing on a conjectural symmetry which swaps the Euler characteristic and the weight. Our conjecture is inspired by the Dolbeault Geometric Langlands equivalence of Donagi--Pantev, by the Hausel--Thaddeus mirror symmetry, and by the $\chi$-independence phenomenon for BPS invariants of curves on Calabi-Yau threefolds.
  We prove our conjecture in the case of rank two and genus zero. In higher genus, we prove a derived equivalence of rank two stable twisted Higgs moduli spaces as a special case of our conjecture.
  In a separate paper, we prove a version of our conjecture for the topological K-theory of quasi-BPS categories and we discuss the relation between quasi-BPS categories and BPS invariants of the corresponding local Calabi-Yau threefold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the cosmology and astrophysics of axion-like particles (ALPs) with CP-violating Yukawa couplings to nucleons. At finite nucleon density, the ALP's dynamics is governed by an effective potential which is the sum of the bare periodic potential and a linear potential whose strength depends on the nucleon density. We identify a critical nucleon density $\rho_c$ controlling the dynamics. At densities smaller than $\rho_c$ the effective potential is a tilted sinusoidal curve and the field is displaced from its zero-density minimum. At densities larger than $\rho_c$ the minima (and maxima) are absent, and the ALP is destabilized. Astrophysically, this implies that neutron stars can source a radial ALP field, providing a complementary probe to equivalence principle tests. Cosmologically, the ALP may have been destabilized in the early Universe and could have made large field excursions. We discuss model-building applications of our results for such early universe scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of adding an interaction in the $G_3$ term of Horndeski theory, where the propagation of gravitational waves are not modified. We derive the background and perturbation equations of motion from the action. We also derive the no-ghost and Laplacian instability conditions for tensor modes and scalar mode propagation. Then we study the evolution of the matter perturbation in the quasi-static approximation. We find that the gravitational couplings to the baryonic and cold dark matter over density are modified in this theory. We introduce a concrete model of the free function in the theory and study the background and linear perturbation dynamics. We then use the genetic algorithm to test the model. We compare the $H(z)$ function of the model and the $H(z)$ curve predicted by the genetic algorithm, using the $H(z)$ data. For the perturbation sector we compute the $f\sigma_{8}$ observable for the model and compare it with the predicted function from the genetic algorithm from the $f\sigma_{8}$ data.</description>

      <title>Generating variable $\hbar$ and $c$ via Fujii-Wetterich model in curved spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the Fujii-Wetterich model [Phys.Rev.D 26, 2580 (1982) and Nucl.Phys.B 302, 645 (1988)] which allows the Higgs doublet to couple with a "cosmon" scalar $\chi$ of the background spacetime as $\chi^2\,\Phi^2$. Upon the SSB of the $SU(2)$ gauge, the VEV of the Higgs doublet is proportional to the field $\chi$. Fujii and Wetterich employed this linkage to make particle masses dependent on $\chi$. We shall present an $\textit alternative$ mechanism: at a given point $x^*$, the prevailing Higgs VEV will be used to $\textit construct$ a quantum of action $\hbar_*$ and a speed of light $c_*$ in association with $\chi(x^*)$. Specifically, each open set vicinity of a given point $x^*$ on the manifold is equipped with a replica of the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam action operating with its own effective values of $\hbar_*$ and $c_*$, whereas particle masses induced via Higgs SSB remain independent of $\chi(x^*)$. Our mechanism unambiguously generates the dependencies $\hbar_*\propto\chi^{-1/2}(x^*)$ and $c_*\propto\chi^{1/2}(x^*)$, causing these "fundamental constants" to vary along with the dynamical field $\chi$ across the manifold. For late-time cosmology, a varying $c$ along the trajectory of light waves from distant supernovae towards Earth renders the classic Lema\^itre redshift formula $1+z=a^{-1}$ inapplicable. Using the dependency $c_*\propto\chi^{1/2}(x^*)$, we derive the new (variable-$c$) Lema\^itre redshift relation and apply it to analyze the Pantheon Catalog of SneIa $\textit without$ invoking the dark energy hypothesis. Key consequences are: (1) Accounting for the Pantheon Catalog with a fit exceeding the quality of the $\Lambda$CDM model; (2) Explaining the late-time cosmic acceleration based on variable $c$, eliminating the need for dark energy; (3) Revitalizing Blanchard-Douspis-Rowan-Robinson-Sarkar's CMB power spectrum analysis that bypassed dark energy [A&amp;A 412, 35 (2003)].</description>

Abstract: We use the theory of $x-y$ duality to propose a new definition / construction for the correlation differentials of topological recursion; we call it "generalized topological recursion". This new definition coincides with the original topological recursion of Chekhov-Eynard-Orantin in the regular case and allows, in particular, to get meaningful answers in a variety of irregular and degenerate situations.</description>

      <title>CoHA of Cyclic Quivers and an Integral Form of Affine Yangians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the deformed and non-deformed cohomological Hall algebra (CoHA) of the preprojective algebra for the case of cyclic quivers by studying the Kontsevich-Soibelman CoHA and using tools from cohomological Donaldson-Thomas theory. We show that for the cyclic quiver of length $K$, this algebra is the universal enveloping algebra of the positive half of a certain extension of matrix differential operators on $\mathbb{C}^{*}$, while its deformation gives a positive half of an explicit integral form of Guay's Affine Yangian $\ddot{\mathcal{Y}}_{\hbar_1,\hbar_2}(\mathfrak{gl}(K))$. By the main theorem of Botta-Davison (2023) and Schiffmann-Vasserot (2023), this also determines the positive half of the Maulik-Okounkov Yangian for the case of cyclic quivers. Furthermore, we provide evidence for the strong rationality conjecture, calculate the spherical subalgebra of the non-deformed CoHA for any quiver without loops, recover results about the CoHA of compactly supported semistable sheaves on the minimal resolution of the Kleinian singularity $\mathbb{C}^2/\mathbb{Z}_{K}$ and identify a commutative algebra inside the additive shuffle algebra associated to the cyclic quiver. We end by conjecturally relating the obtained integral form with the algebra defined by Gaiotto-Rap\v{c}\'ak-Zhou, in the context of twisted M-theory.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Dipole Moment in Braneworld Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational effects on the relativistic Dirac theory of a system such as a Hydrogen atom in the braneworld scenario. A gravitational dipole moment like contribution, arises in the nonrelativistic Hamiltonian of the system through an exact Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation. This term violates the equivalence principle for the weak interaction that is restored in the average over the spins. Furthermore, it feels the effects of the extra dimensions, so that in a Universe with two additional spatial dimensions its energy contribution is amplified by an order of $\sim 10^{16}\ \text{eV}$ concerning to the energy of this term for ordinary space. The compactification radius for a Universe with two extra dimensions is within the experimental limits, where deviations from the inverse square law are being tested. This suggests that the energy value for the gravitational dipole term in this scenario may lead us to search for traces of extra dimensions in atomic spectroscopy, as well as experimental constraints for these dimensions.</description>

Abstract: We describe the tropical curves in toric varieties and define the tropical Gromov-Witten invariants. We introduce amplitudes for the higher topological quantum mechanics (HTQM) on special trees and show that the amplitudes are equal to the tropical Gromov-Witten invariants. We show that the sum over the amplitudes in $A$-model HTQM equals the total amplitude in B-model HTQM, defined as a deformation of the $A$-model HTQM by the mirror superpotential. We derived the mirror superpotentials for the toric varieties and showed that they coincide with the superpotentials in the mirror Landau-Ginzburg theory. We construct the mirror dual states to the evaluation observables in the tropical Gromov-Witten theory.</description>

      <title>CFT Correlators and CP-Violating Trace Anomalies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03038v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the parity-odd correlators $\langle JJO\rangle_{odd}$, $\langle JJT\rangle_{odd}$, $\langle TTO\rangle_{odd}$ and $\langle TTT\rangle_{odd}$ in momentum space, constrained by conformal Ward identities, extending our former investigation of the parity-odd chiral anomaly vertex. We investigate how the presence of parity-odd trace anomalies affect such correlators. Motivations for this study come from holography, early universe cosmology and from a recent debate on the chiral trace anomaly of a Weyl fermion. In the current CFT analysis, $O$ can be either a scalar or a pseudoscalar operator and it can be identified with the trace of the stress energy tensor. We find that the $\langle JJO\rangle_{odd}$ and $\langle TTO\rangle_{odd}$ can be different from zero in a CFT. This occurs when the conformal dimension of the scalar operator is $\Delta_3=4$, as in the case of $O=T^\mu_\mu$. Moreover, if we assume the existence of parity-odd trace anomalies, the conformal $\langle JJT\rangle_{odd}$ and $\langle TTT\rangle_{odd}$ are nonzero. In particular, in the case of $\langle JJT\rangle_{odd}$ the transverse-traceless component is constrained to vanish, and the correlator is determined only by the trace part with the anomaly pole.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by bit threads, we introduce a new prescription for computing entropy vectors outside the holographic entropy cone. By utilizing cycle flows on directed graphs, we show that the maximum cycle flow associated to any subset of vertices, which corresponds to a subsystem, manifestly obeys purification symmetry. Furthermore, by restricting ourselves to a subclass of directed graphs, we prove that the maximum cycle flow obeys both subadditivity and strong subadditivity, thereby establishing it as a viable candidate for the entropy associated to the subsystem. Finally, we demonstrate how our model generalizes the entropy vectors obtainable via conventional flows in undirected graphs, as well as conjecture that our model similarly generalizes the entropy vectors arising from hypergraphs.</description>

Abstract: We compute the heat kernel coefficients that are needed for the regularization and renormalization of massive gravity. Starting from the Stueckelberg action for massive gravity, we determine the propagators of the different fields (massive tensor, vector and scalar) in a general linear covariant gauge depending on four free gauge parameters. We then compute the non-minimal heat kernel coefficients for all the components of the scalar, vector and tensor sector, and employ these coefficients to regularize the propagators of all the different fields of massive gravity. We also study the massless limit and discuss the appearance of the van Dam-Veltman-Zakharov discontinuity. In the course of the computation, we derive new identities relating the heat kernel coefficients of different field sectors, both massive and massless.</description>

      <title>Mass and Isospin Breaking Effects in the Skyrme Model and in Holographic QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss how the quark masses and their mass splitting affect the baryons in the Skyrme model as well as the Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto (WSS) model. In both cases baryons are described by solitonic objects, i.e. Skyrmions and instantons, respectively. After the quantization of their zeromodes the nucleons become quantum states of a rotor. We show how the quark mass affects the moment of inertia and we provide a semi-analytic approach valid in the small-mass limit. Additionally, we show how the two lightest quarks' mass splitting affects the moments of inertia of the Skyrmion and induces an isospin breaking effect. This effect turns out not to be enough to split the degeneracy in the neutron-proton multiplet, but it splits some of the states in the Delta multiplet. Unlike the basic Skyrme model, the WSS model already includes vector mesons and another mechanism to transfer isospin breaking from quark masses to the solitons is known. We compute the splitting of the moment of inertia in the small-mass limit in the WSS model and combine the two effects on the spectrum of baryons, in particular the Deltas.</description>

Abstract: We study energy-momentum and charge transport in strongly interacting holographic quantum field theories in an anisotropic thermal state by contrasting three different holographic methods to compute transport coefficients: standard holographic calculation of retarded Greens functions, a method based on the null-focusing equation near horizon and the novel method based on background variations. Employing these methods we compute anisotropic shear and bulk viscosities and conductivities with anisotropy induced externally, for example by an external magnetic field. We show that all three methods yield consistent results. The novel method allows us to read off the transport coefficients from the horizon data and express them in analytic form from which we derive universal relations among them. Furthermore we extend the method based on the null-focusing equation to Gauss-Bonnet theory to compute higher derivative corrections to the aforementioned transport coefficients.</description>

      <title>Wormholes and Factorization in Exact Effective Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the general framework of effective theories obtained via exact path integration of a complete theory over some sector of its degrees of freedom. Theories constructed this way contain multi-integrals which couple fields arbitrarily far apart, and in certain settings even on path-disconnected components of the space. These are not just entanglement, but genuine non-local interactions that we dub quantum wormholes.
  Any state the path integral of such an effective theory prepares is shown to be a partial trace of a state of the complete theory over the integrated-out sector. The resulting reduced density operator is generally mixed due to bra-ket wormholes. An infinite family of ensembles of pure states of the complete theory giving the same effective state is identified. These allow one to equivalently interpret any effective state as being prepared by an ensemble of theories. When computing entropic quantities, bra-ket wormholes give rise to replica wormholes. This causes replica path integrals for the effective theory to not factorize even when the underlying manifold does, as expected from mixing. In contrast, effective theories obtained by derivative expansions have no quantum wormholes and prepare pure states. There exist operators in the algebra of effective theories which can distinguish mixed from pure states, implying a breakdown of non-exact effective theories for sufficiently complex observables.
  This framework unifies and provides new insights into much of the phenomena observed in quantum gravity, including the interplay between wormholes and unitarity, the breakdown of bulk effective theory, the factorization puzzle, state ensembles, theory ensembles, quantum error correction, and baby universes. Some interesting lessons are drawn accounting also for characteristic aspects of gravity concerning IR/UV mixing and Kaluza-Klein reductions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, our focus is on exploring the gauge-invariant basis for bosonic couplings within the framework of heterotic string theories, specifically examining 3-, 5-, and 7-derivative terms. We thoroughly analyze the invariance of these couplings under T-duality transformations and make a notable observation: the T-duality constraint enforces the vanishing of these couplings. We speculate that this result likely holds true for all higher odd-derivative couplings as well. This is unlike the result in type I superstring theory, where, for example, the couplings of 5 Yang-Mills field strengths are non-zero. The vanishing of couplings is consistent with the $O(d,d+16)$ symmetry of the cosmological reduction of the effective action.</description>

Abstract: We construct an off-shell $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal cubic vertex for the hypermultiplet coupled to an arbitrary integer higher spin ${\bf s}$ gauge $\mathcal{N}=2$ supermultiplet % in flatfour-dimensional space. in a general $\mathcal{N}=2$ conformal supergravity background. We heavily use $\mathcal{N}=2, 4D$ harmonic superspace that provides an unconstrained superfield Lagrangian description. We start with $\mathcal{N}=2$ global superconformal symmetry transformations of the free hypermultiplet model and require invariance of the cubic vertices of general form under these transformations and their gauged version. As a result, we deduce $\mathcal{N}=2, 4D$ unconstrained analytic superconformal gauge potentials for an arbitrary integer ${\bf s}$. These are the basic ingredients of the approach under consideration. We describe the properties of the gauge potentials, derive the corresponding superconformal and gauge transformation laws, and inspect the off-shell contents of the thus obtained $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal higher-spin ${\bf s}$ multiplets in the Wess-Zumino gauges. The spin ${\bf s}$ multiplet involves $8(2{\bf s} -1)_B + 8(2{\bf s}-1)_F$ essential off-shell degrees of freedom. The cubic vertex has the generic structure higher spin gauge superfields $\times$ hypermultiplet supercurrents. We present the explicit form of the relevant supercurrents.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we study the duality symmetry group of Carrollian (nonlinear) electrodynamics and propose a family of Carrollian ModMax theories, which are invariant under Carrollian $\text{SO}(2)$ electromagnetic (EM) duality transformations and conformal transformation. We define the Carrollian $\text{SO}(2)$ EM transformations, with the help of Hodge duality in Carrollian geometry, then we rederive the Gaillard-Zumino consistency condition for EM duality of Carrollian nonlinear electrodynamics. Together with the traceless condition for the energy-momentum tensor, we are able to determine the Lagrangian of the Carrollian ModMax theories among pure electrodynamics. We furthermore study their behaviors under the $\sqrt{T\bar{T}}$ deformation flow, and show that these theories deform to each other and may reach two endpoints under the flow, with one of the endpoint being the Carrollian Maxwell theory. As a byproduct, we construct a family of two-dimensional Carrollian ModMax-like multiple scalar theories, which are closed under the $\sqrt{T\bar{T}}$ flow and may flow to a BMS free multi-scalar model.</description>

Additionally, we present multi-Yang-Baxter sigma models featuring two and three compatible Nijenhuis structures. Examples for each of these models are provided.</description>

Abstract: The gravitational path integral is usually implemented with a covariant action by analogy with other gauge field theories, but the gravitational case is different in important ways. A key difference is that the integrand has an essential singularity, which occurs at zero lapse where the spacetime metric degenerates. The lapse integration contour required to impose the local time reparametrization constraints must run from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$, yet must not pass through zero. This raises the question: what is the correct integration contour, and why? We study that question by starting with the reduced phase space path integral, which involves no essential singularity. We observe that if the momenta are to be integrated before the lapse, to obtain a configuration space path integral, the lapse contour should pass below the origin in the complex lapse plane. This contour is also consistent with the requirement that quantum field fluctuation amplitudes have the usual short distance vacuum form, and with obtaining the Bekenstein-Hawking horizon entropy from a Lorentzian path integral. We close with a discussion of related issues, including potential obstacles to deriving a nonperturbative covariant gravitational path integral.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11611v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define the notion of a marked moduli space as the parameter space of a physical theory together with all of its observables. In geometric examples, this coincides with the mathematical notion of Teichm\"uller space. We propose two new Swampland principles about the geometry of marked moduli spaces: We conjecture that a marked moduli space is always contractible, and moreover, that there is a unique shortest path connecting any pair of points in it with respect to its physical metric. We provide strong evidence for these conjectures for theories with 8 or more supercharges.</description>

      <title>Two-Loop Spacelike Splitting Amplitude for N=4 Super-Yang-Mills Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of collinear behavior for gauge theories in the spacelike region is of great phenomenological and theoretical importance. We analytically calculate the two-loop spacelike splitting amplitude for the full color N=4 Super-Yang-Mills theory. The result is derived by two complementary methods starting from the known amplitude: one is based on a discontinuity analysis, while the other one is based on analytic continuation. Our result explicitly shows terms that violate naive factorization. However we show that factorization is restored at the level of color-summed unpolarized squared amplitudes at next-to-next-to-next-to leading order. We conjecture that the two-loop tripole terms in the generalized splitting amplitudes in QCD are identical to what we obtain in N=4 super Yang-Mills theory.</description>

Abstract: One-dimensional quantum mechanical models obeying Smilga's weak supersymmetry are described in the matrix form.

      <title>Studying the 3d Ising surface CFTs on the fuzzy sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15914v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Boundaries not only are fundamental elements in nearly all realistic physical systems, but also greatly enrich the structure of quantum field theories. In this paper, we demonstrate that conformal field theory (CFT) with a boundary, known as surface CFT in three dimensions, can be studied with the setup of fuzzy sphere. We consider the example of surface criticality of the 3D Ising CFT. We propose two schemes by cutting a boundary in the orbital space or the real space to realise the ordinary and the normal surface CFTs on the fuzzy sphere. We obtain the operator spectra through state-operator correspondence. We observe integer spacing of the conformal multiplets, and thus provide direct evidence of conformal symmetry. We identify the ordinary surface primary $o$, the displacement operator $\mathrm{D}$ and their conformal descendants and extract their scaling dimensions. We also study the one-point and two-point correlation functions and extract the bulk-to-surface OPE coefficients, some of which are reported for the first time. In addition, using the overlap of the bulk CFT state and the polarised state, we calculate the boundary central charges of the 3D Ising surface CFTs non-perturbatively. Other conformal data obtained in this way also agrees with prior methods.</description>

      <title>Multiscalar Critical Models with Localised Cubic Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interface localised interactions are studied for multiscalar universality classes accessible with the perturbative $\varepsilon$ expansion in $4-\varepsilon$ dimensions. The associated beta functions at one loop and partially at two loops are derived, and a wide variety of interface conformal field theories (CFTs) is found, even in cases where the bulk universality class is free or as simple as the Wilson-Fisher description of the $O(N)$ model. For up to three scalar fields in the bulk, interface fixed points are classified for all bulk universality classes encountered in this case. Numerical results are obtained for interface CFTs that exist for larger numbers of multiscalar fields. Our analytic and numerical results indicate the existence of a vast space of interface CFTs, much larger than the space of defect CFTs found for line and surface defect deformations of multiscalar models in $4-\varepsilon$ dimensions. In this vast space, stable interfaces found for free and $O(N)$ bulks belong to the $F_4$ family, with global symmetries $SO(3), SU(3), Sp(6)$ and $F_4$, realised with $N=5,8,16,24$ scalar fields, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the differential geometry of the moduli space of instantons on S^3 x S^1. Extending previous results, we show that a sigma-model with this target space can be expected to possess a large N=4 superconformal symmetry, supporting speculations that this sigma-model may be dual to Type IIB superstring theory on AdS_3 x S^3 x S^3 x S^1. The sigma-model is parametrized by three integers -- the rank of the gauge group, the instanton number, and a "level" (the integer coefficient of a topologically nontrivial B-field, analogous to a WZW level). These integers are expected to correspond to two five-brane charges and a one-brane charge. The sigma-model is weakly coupled when the level, conjecturally corresponding to one of the five-brane changes, becomes very large, keeping the other parameters fixed. The central charges of the large N=4 algebra agree, at least semiclassically, with expectations from the duality.</description>

      <title>Non-extremal Island in de Sitter Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the challenges and resolutions in computing the entanglement entropy for the quantum field theory coupled to de Sitter (dS) gravity along a timelike boundary. The conventional island formula, originally designed to calculate the fine-grained entropy for a non-gravitational system coupled to anti-de Sitter (AdS) gravity, encounters difficulties in de Sitter gravitational spacetime, failing to provide a physically plausible extremal island. To overcome these problems, we introduce a doubly holographic model by embedding a dS$_2$ braneworld in an AdS$_3$ bulk spacetime. This approach facilitates the computation of entanglement entropy through holographic correlation functions, effectively circumventing the constraints of the island formula. We demonstrate that the correct recipe for calculating entanglement entropy with dS gravity involves the non-extremal island, whose boundary is instead defined at the edge of the dS gravitational region. Our findings indicate that, during the island phase, the entanglement wedge of the non-gravitational bath includes the entire dS gravitational space. Using the second variation formula, we further show that the existence of a locally minimal surface anchored on the gravitational brane is intrinsically linked to the extrinsic curvature of the brane.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study in detail various solutions, especially kink ones, in different nonlocal scalar field theories, whose kinetic term is described by an arbitrary non-polynomial analytic function of the d'Alembertian operator, and the potential is chosen either to be quadratic or to allow for the kink-like solution. Using the perturbative method, we find corrections of first and second orders in the nonlocality parameter around local solutions for several form factors and generate analytic expressions for the energy density up to the first order in this parameter. Additionally, we also address an inverse problem, that is, we reconstruct the potential corresponding to the given solution obtaining restrictions for the form factor.</description>

      <title>Generating enhanced primordial GWs during inflation with intermittent violation of NEC and diminishment of GW propagating speed</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.04552v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate both the null energy condition (NEC) violating scenario and the $c_T$-diminishing scenario for generating enhanced power spectrum of primordial gravitational waves (GWs) during inflation, where $c_T$ is the propagating speed of primordial GWs. Both of these two scenarios can be realized stably with theories beyond Horndeski, hence can be uniformly implemented within the framework of the effective field theory. We calculate the power spectrum of primordial GWs by assuming that the inflationary Universe undergoes three phases, where the violation of NEC or the diminishment of $c_T$ occurs in the intermediate phase. A template of the spectrum is given for the NEC-violating scenario. We also discuss the underlying relation and discrepancy between these two scenarios with a disformal transformation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.10443v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformal blocks, physical quantities of chiral 2d conformal field theory, are sheaves on the configuration spaces of the complex plane, which are mathematically formulated in terms of a vertex operator algebra, its modules and associated D-modules. We show that the operad of fundamental groupoids of the configuration spaces, the parenthesized braid operad, acts on the conformal blocks by the monodromy representation.
  More precisely, let $V$ be a vertex operator algebra with $V=\bigoplus_{n\geq 0} V_n$, $\dim V_n &lt;\infty$, $V_0=\mathbb{C}\bf{1}$ and $V\text{-mod}_{\mathrm{f.g}}$ the category of $V$-modules $M$ such that $M$ is $C_1$-cofinite and the dual module $M^\vee$ is a finitely generated $V$-module. We show that the parenthesized braid operad weakly 2-categorically acts on $V\text{-mod}_{\mathrm{f.g}}$, and consequently $V\text{-mod}_{\mathrm{f.g}}$ has a structure of the (unital) pseudo-braided category. Moreover, if $V$ is rational and $C_2$-cofinite, then $V\text{-mod}_{\mathrm{f.g}}$ is a balanced braided tensor category, which gives an alternative proof of a result of Huang and Lepowsky.</description>

      <title>Gauge-independent transition dividing the confinement phase in the lattice SU(2) gauge-adjoint scalar model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15953v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The lattice SU(2) gauge-scalar model with the scalar field in the adjoint representation of the gauge group has two completely separated confinement and Higgs phases according to the preceding studies based on numerical simulations which have been performed in the specific gauge fixing based on the conventional understanding of the Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism.
  In this paper, we re-examine this phase structure in the gauge-independent way based on the numerical simulations performed without any gauge fixing. This is motivated to confirm the recently proposed gauge-independent Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism for generating the mass of the gauge field without relying on any spontaneous symmetry breaking. For this purpose we investigate correlation functions between gauge-invariant operators obtained by combining the original adjoint scalar field and the new field called the color-direction field which is constructed from the gauge field based on the gauge-covariant decomposition of the gauge field due to Cho-Duan-Ge-Shabanov and Faddeev-Niemi.
  Consequently, we reproduce gauge-independently the transition line separating confinement phase and Higgs phase, and show surprisingly the existence of a new transition line that divides completely the confinement phase into two parts. Finally, we discuss the physical meaning of the new transition and implications to confinement mechanism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mixing between the chiral condensate and the density in hot and dense QCD matter is familiar. We show that the mixing relevant for the ground state is considerably more extensive, and in particular also involves gluonic degrees of freedom. As a result, the Hessian of the QCD effective action is non-Hermitian, but retains a symmetry under combined charge- and complex conjugation. This can lead to complex-conjugate pairs of eigenvalues of this Hessian, signaling regimes with spatially modulated correlations. Furthermore, based on the analytic structure of the quark determinant at a chiral critical point, we demonstrate that the corresponding massless critical mode is composed of the chiral condensate, the density and the Polyakov loops. Due to an avoided crossing, the critical mode turns out to be disconnected from the chiral condensate in vacuum. We present general arguments for all these features and illustrate them through explicit model calculations.</description>

The robustness of singularity resolutions due to the quantum effects is explicitly verified in the context of two quantization schemes typically used in the literature. We present an exploration of the effects of quantum geometry on the background dynamics, which is also illustrated through some explicit numerical examples and showing the absence of the singularity.</description>

      <title>Galaxy-galaxy lensing data: $f(T)$ gravity challenges General Relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17053v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use galaxy-galaxy lensing data to test General Relativity and $f(T)$ gravity at galaxies scales. We consider an exact spherically symmetric solution of $f(T)$ theory which is obtained from an approximate quadratic correction, and thus it is expected to hold for every realistic deviation from General Relativity. Quantifying the deviation by a single parameter $Q$, and following the post-Newtonian approximation, we obtain the corresponding deviation in the gravitational potential, shear component, and effective excess surface density profile. We used five stellar mass samples and divided them into blue and red to test the model dependence on galaxy color, and we modeled the excess surface density (ESD) profiles using the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profiles. Based on the group catalog from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS DR7) we finally extract $Q=-2.138^{+0.952}_{-0.516}\times 10^{-5}\,$Mpc$^{-2}$ at $1\sigma$ confidence. This result indicates that $f(T)$ corrections on top of General Relativity are favored. Finally, we apply information criteria, such as the AIC and BIC ones, and although the dependence of $f(T)$ gravity on the off-center effect implies that its optimality needs to be carefully studied, our analysis shows that $f(T)$ gravity is more efficient in fitting the data comparing to General Relativity and $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, and thus it offers a challenge to the latter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08811v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the stability of the Standard Model vacuum, and investigate its quantum effective potential using the highest available orders in perturbation theory and the most accurate determination of input parameters to date. We observe that the stability of the electroweak vacuum centrally depends on the values of the top mass and the strong coupling constant. We estimate that reducing their uncertainties by a factor of two to three is sufficient to establish or refute SM vacuum stability at the $5\sigma$ level. We further investigate vacuum stability for a variety of singlet scalar field extensions with and without flavor using the Higgs portal mechanism. We identify the BSM parameter spaces for stability and find sizable room for new physics. We further study the phenomenology of Planck-safe models at colliders, and determine the impact on the Higgs trilinear, the Higgs-to-electroweak-boson, and the Higgs quartic couplings, some of which can be significant. The former two can be probed at the HL-LHC, the latter requires a future collider with sufficient energy and precision such as the FCC-hh.</description>

      <title>Quantum loop corrections in the modified gravity model of Starobinsky inflation with primordial black hole production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02934v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A modified gravity model of Starobinsky inflation and primordial black hole production was proposed in good (within $1\sigma$) agreement with current measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation. The model is an extension of the singularity-free Appleby-Battye-Starobinsky model by the $R^4$-term with different values of the parameters whose fine-tuning leads to efficient production of primordial black holes on smaller scales with the asteroid-size masses between $10^{16}$ g and $10^{20}$ g. Those primordial black holes may be part (or the whole) of the current dark matter, while the proposed model can be confirmed or falsified by detection or absence of the induced gravitational waves with the frequencies about $10^{-2}$ Hz. The main purpose of this paper was to estimate the size of quantum (loop) corrections in the model. It was found their relative contribution to the power spectrum of scalar perturbations is about $10^{-3}$ or less, so that the model is not ruled out by the quantum corrections.</description>

      <title>Axion-like Quasiparticles and Topological States of Matter: Finite Density Corrections of the Chiral Anomaly Vertex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03151v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the general structure of the chiral anomaly $AVV/AAA$ and $(LLL, RRR)$ vertices, in the presence of chemical potentials in perturbation theory. The study finds application in anomalous transport, whenever chirally unbalanced matter is present, with propagating external currents that are classically conserved. Examples are topological materials and the chiral magnetic effect in the plasma state of matter of the early universe. We classify the minimal number of form factors of the $AVV$ parameterization, by a complete analysis of the Schouten identities in the presence of a heat bath. We show that the longitudinal (anomaly) sector in the axial-vector channel, for on-shell and off-shell photons, is protected against corrections coming from the insertion of a chemical potential in the fermion loop. When the photons are on-shell, we prove that also the transverse sector, in the same channel, is $\mu$-independent and vanishes. The related effective action is shown to be always described by the exchange of a massless anomaly pole, as in the case of vanishing chemical potentials. The pole is interpreted as an interpolating axion-like quasiparticle generated by the anomaly. In each axial-vector channel, it is predicted to be a correlated fermion/antifermion pseudoscalar (axion-like) quasiparticle appearing in the response function, once the material is subjected to an external chiral perturbation. The cancellation of the $\mu$ dependence extends to any chiral current within the Standard Model, including examples like $B$ (baryon), $L$ (lepton), and $B-L$. This holds true irrespective of whether these currents exhibit anomalies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been suggested that the effects of renormalization significantly reduce the amplitude of the inflationary spectra at scales measurable in the cosmic microwave background. Via a gauge-invariant analysis, we compute the renormalized scalar and tensor power spectra and follow their evolution in an inflating universe that undergoes a transition to an FRW phase with a growing horizon. For perturbations originating from Minkowski vacuum fluctuations, we show that the standard prediction for the spectra on superhorizon scales is a late-time attractor, while they are UV finite at all times. Our result is independent of the equation of state after inflation, showing that the standard prediction is fully robust.</description>

      <title>Hairy black holes in extended Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theories with magnetic charge and kinetic couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study black hole (BH) solutions in extended Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theories, which are classified in a subclass of the $U(1)$ gauge-invariant scalar-vector-tensor theories. The scalar field is coupled to the vector field, which has electric and magnetic charges. For the static and spherically symmetric spacetime, we investigate modifications to the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m solutions focusing on the three types of scalar-vector interactions, including derivative couplings. We solve the field equations analytically in two asymptotic regions which are the vicinity of the BH horizon and the spatial infinity, and clarify the condition for the existence of scalar hair. To understand the behaviors of solutions in intermediate scales, the field equations are integrated numerically for concrete models with different types of couplings. We find new hairy BH solutions with scalar hair in the presence of magnetic charge and kinetic coupling. The magnetic charge plays an important role in distinguishing hairy BH solutions originated from three types of different interactions at a large coupling limit.</description>

      <title>Greybody Factors Imprinted on Black Hole Ringdowns. II. Merging Binary Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spectral amplitude of the merger-ringdown gravitational wave (GW) emitted by a comparable mass-ratio black hole merger is modeled by the greybody factor of the remnant black hole. We also include the post-Newtonian correction to the greybody factor model. Our model includes only a few fitting parameters, which could evade the overfitting issue. We perform the mass-spin inference from the SXS data without tuning the data range of each SXS waveform. Also, we find that the exponential damping in the ringdown spectral amplitude can be modeled well with the exponential damping in the greybody factor at high frequencies. Our findings could be consistent with a conjecture that the light ring of the remnant black hole, which sources the ringdown, forms as early as during the merger stage. We discuss the formation of the light ring in the static binary solution as a first step towards the understanding of how the separation of merging black holes may affect the formation of the light ring.</description>

      <title>Galaxy groups in the presence of Cosmological Constant: Increasing the Masses of Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14944v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The boundaries of galaxy groups and clusters are defined by the interplay between the Newtonian attractive force and the decoupling from the local expansion of the Universe. This work extends the definition of a zero radial acceleration surface (ZRAS) and the turnaround surface (TS) for a general distribution of the masses in an expanding background, governed by the cosmological constant. We apply these definitions to different galaxy groups in the local Universe, mapping these groups up to ten megaparsec distances. We discuss the dipole and the quadrupole rate for the Local Group of Galaxies and the implementations on the Hubble diagram correction and galaxy groups virialization. With these definitions, we present the surfaces showing the interplay between the local expansion vs the local Newtonian attraction for galaxy groups in the local Universe. Further, we estimate the masses of different galaxy groups and show that the Cosmological Constant requires these masses to be higher. For the groups with enough tracers close to the TS, the contribution of the Cosmological Constant makes the masses to be even higher. The results show the importance of including the local cosmic expansion in analyzing the Cosmic Flow of the local Universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide general relativistic treatment of the single-component field described by Dirac's positive-energy wave equation of 1971. It is motivated by Bogomolny's proposal to regard that field as a possible candidate for dark matter. Our emphasis is on standard (flat) Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmology. The early universe is not considered, though there is a strong indication that the field may play a role in internally driven generation of cosmic anisotropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If we want to transform the quantum of state of a system to another using local processes, what is the probability of success? It turns out that this probability can be bounded by quantifying entanglement within both the states. In this paper, we construct a family of multipartite entanglement measures that are monotonic under local operations and classical communication on average. The measures are constructed out of local unitary invariant polynomials of the state and its conjugate, and hence are easy to compute for pure states. Using these measures we bound the success probability of transforming a given state into another state using local quantum operations and classical communication.</description>

      <title>Relativistic theory of the viscosity of fluids across the entire energy spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The shear viscosity is a fundamental transport property of matter. Here we derive a general theory of the viscosity of gases based on the relativistic Langevin equation (deduced from a relativistic Lagrangian) and nonaffine linear response theory. The proposed relativistic theory is able to recover the viscosity of non-relativistic classical gases, with all its key dependencies on mass, temperature, particle diameter and Boltzmann constant, in the limit of Lorentz factor $\gamma=1$. It also unveils the relativistic enhancement mechanism of viscosity. In the limit of ultrarelativistic fluids, the theory provides a new analytical formula which reproduces the cubic increase of viscosity with temperature in agreement with various estimates for hot dense matter and the QGP-type fluid.</description>

      <title>Relational dynamics and Page-Wootters formalism in group field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Group field theory posits that spacetime is emergent and is hence defined without any background notion of space or time; dynamical questions are formulated in relational terms, in particular using (scalar) matter degrees of freedom as time. Unlike in canonical quantisation of gravitational systems, there is no obvious notion of coordinate transformations or constraints, and established quantisation methods cannot be directly applied. As a result, different canonical formalisms for group field theory have been discussed in the literature. We address these issues using a parametrised version of group field theory, in which all (geometry and matter) degrees of freedom evolve in a fiducial parameter. There is a constraint associated to the freedom of reparametrisation and the Dirac quantisation programme can be implemented. Using the "trinity of relational dynamics", we show that the resulting "clock-neutral" theory is entirely equivalent to a deparametrised canonical group field theory, interpreted in terms of the Page-Wootters formalism. Our results not only show that the deparametrised quantisation is fully covariant and can be seen as encoding the dynamics of joint quantum matter and geometry degrees of freedom, they also appear to be the first application of the Page-Wootters formalism directly to non-perturbative quantum gravity. We show extensions to a setting in which many independent gauge symmetries are introduced, which connects to the "multi-fingered time" idea in quantum gravity and provides a somewhat novel extension of the Page-Wootters formalism.</description>

      <title>Tying knots in particle physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lord Kelvin's pioneering hypothesis that the identity of atoms is knots of vortices of the aether had a profound impact on the fields of mathematics and physics despite being subsequently refuted by experiments. While knot-like excitations emerge in various systems of condensed matter physics, the fundamental constituents of matter have been revealed to be elementary particles such as electrons and quarks, seemingly leaving no room for the appearance of knots in particle physics. Here, we show that knots indeed appear as meta-stable solitons in a realistic extension of the standard model of particle physics that provides the QCD axion and right-handed neutrinos. This result suggests that during the early Universe, a "knot dominated era" may have existed, where knots were a dominant component of the Universe, and this scenario can be tested through gravitational wave observations. Furthermore, we propose that the end of this era involves the collapse of the knots via quantum tunneling, leading to the generation of matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe. Our findings exhibit the significant role of knots in particle physics and represent a modern version of Kelvin's hypothesis.</description>

Abstract: Based on a recently proposed quantum field theory (QFT) for particles with or without structure, called "Structural Algebraic QFT (SAQFT)", we introduce a finite QFT. That is, a QFT for structureless elementary particles that does not require renormalization where loop integrals in the Feynman diagrams are finite. It is an algebraic theory utilizing orthogonal polynomials and based on the structureless sector of SAQFT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) represents a breakthrough in many-body physics since it allows to link thermalization of physical observables with the applicability of random matrix theory (RMT). Recent years were also extremely fruitful in exploring possible counterexamples to thermalization, ranging, among others, from integrability, single-particle chaos, many-body localization, many-body scars, to Hilbert-space fragmentation. In all these cases the conventional ETH is violated. However, it remains elusive how the conventional ETH breaks down when one approaches the boundaries of ergodicity, and whether the range of validity of the conventional ETH coincides with the validity of RMT-like spectral statistics. Here we bridge this gap and we introduce a scenario of the ETH breakdown in many-body quantum systems, dubbed fading ergodicity regime, which establishes a link between the conventional ETH and non-ergodic behavior. We conjecture this scenario to be relevant for the description of finite many-body systems at the boundaries of ergodicity, and we provide numerical and analytical arguments for its validity in the quantum sun model of ergodicity breaking phase transition. For the latter, we provide evidence that the breakdown of the conventional ETH is not associated with the breakdown of the RMT-like spectral statistics.</description>

Abstract: We calculate the third-order out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC) of a simple harmonic oscillator with an additional quartic interaction using the second quantization method. We obtain analytic relations for the spectrum, Fock space states, and matrix elements of the coordinate, which are then used to numerically calculate the OTOC. We observe that, after the scrambling, the OTOC saturates to a constant value at later times, which is associated with quantum chaotic behavior in systems that exhibit chaos. We analyze the early-time properties of OTOC and find that the exponential growth, which indicates chaos, is evident in the third-order perturbation.</description>

Abstract: Quantum cosmology aims at elucidating the beginning of our Universe. Back in early 80's, Vilenkin and Hartle-Hawking put forward the "tunneling from nothing" and "no boundary" proposals. Recently there has been renewed interest in this subject from the viewpoint of defining the oscillating path integral for Lorentzian quantum gravity using the Picard-Lefschetz theory. Aiming at going beyond the mini-superspace and saddle-point approximations, we perform Monte Carlo calculations using the generalized Lefschetz thimble method to overcome the sign problem. In particular, we confirm that either Vilenkin or Hartle-Hawking saddle point becomes relevant if one uses the Robin boundary condition depending on its parameter. We also clarify some fundamental issues in quantum cosmology, such as an issue related to the integration domain of the lapse function and an issue related to reading off the real geometry from the complex geometry obtained at the saddle point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Starobinsky model of cosmological inflation in four spacetime dimensions is reviewed with the emphasis on impact of quantum gravity corrections. As a specific example of the quantum corrections, the Grisaru-Zanon quartic curvature terms in the gravitational effective action of closed superstrings are chosen. Those quartic curvature terms are compared to the Bel-Robinson tensor squared in a flat Friedman universe, and the upper bound on the effective string coupling constant is found by demanding unitarity (causality) and the absence of ghosts. It is found that the quantum corrections to the observables (tilts) of the cosmic microwave background radiation in the Starobinsky inflation may be of the same order of magnitude as the next-to-next-to-next classical contributions in the Starobinsky model with respect to the inverse powers of the e-folding number at the horizon crossing.</description>

      <title>Dynamical System Analysis Of Chameleon Mechanism in Brans-Dicke Scalar-Tensor Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigated the stability of the chameleon screening mechanism in the Brans-Dicke scalar-tensor model. We define a constraint on the Brans-Dicke parameter $\omega_{BD}^*$ identifying two stability groups, $\omega_{BD}&gt;\omega_{BD}^*$ and $0&lt;\omega_{BD}&lt;\omega_{BD}^*$. The first group achieves stability with both appropriate eigenvalues and a density profile consistent with dark energy dominance. The second exhibits eigenvalue stability but contradicts conditions for a stable universe. We explore the impact of variations in the scalar field potential and matter coupling by analyzing different parameter sets. Each unique set of parameters results in a distinct $\omega_{BD}^*$. Dynamic analysis reveals that stability is achieved when the scalar field dominates, highlighting the importance of the kinetic and potential terms while minimizing the influence of matter density. In high matter density regions, the scalar field's negligible presence aligns with standard gravitational behavior, whereas in low matter density regions, the scalar field grows exponentially, driving dark energy and cosmic acceleration.</description>
