      <title>Few-grid-point simulations of Big Bang singularity in quantum cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of the current lack of compatibility of the classical and quantum approaches to gravity, exactly solvable elementary pseudo-Hermitian quantum models are analyzed supporting the acceptability of a point-like form of Big Bang. The purpose is served by a hypothetical (non-covariant) identification of the ``time of Big Bang'' with the Kato's exceptional-point parameter $t=0$. Consequences (including the ambiguity of the patterns of unfolding of the singularity after Big Bang) are studied in detail. In particular, singular values of the observables are shown useful in the analysis.</description>

      <title>Black holes in $f(R,T)$ gravity coupled with Euler-Heisenberg electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the scenario of black holes coupled with the Euler-Heisenberg nonlinear electromagnetic field in the framework of $f(R,T)$ gravity. The black hole solutions for electrically charged, magnetically charged and the dyonic case are separately analyzed, and we discuss the scalar curvature and the energy conditions of the black hole spacetime. In the magnetic charge solution, the $f(R,T)$ correction appears in the $1/r^6$ Euler-Heisenberg electromagnetic field correction term, while the electrically charged solution includes an $r^2$ term, with the curvature of the spacetime determined by the $f(R,T)$ coupling parameter. The dyonic solution is obtained through vacuum polarization quantum electrodynamics corrections, where electromagnetic duality is broken and the solution exists higher-order correction terms. The relationship between the event horizon and charge of dyonic extreme black holes is studied. Furthermore, we investigate the effective metric, photon trajectories, and innermost stable circular orbit under nonlinear electromagnetic effects, providing images of photon geodesic for varying electric and magnetic charge strengths and $f(R,T)$ coupling parameter.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from b-EMRIs: Doppler shift and beaming, resonant excitation, helicity oscillations and self-lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study gravitational waves from a stellar-mass binary orbiting a spinning supermassive black hole, a system referred to as a binary extreme mass ratio inspiral (b-EMRI). We use Dixon's formalism to describe the stellar-mass binary as a particle with internal structure, and keep terms up to quadrupole order to capture the generation of gravitational waves by the inner motion of the stellar-mass binary. The problem of emission and propagation of waves is treated from first principles using black hole perturbation theory. In the gravitational waveform at future null infinity, we identify for the first time Doppler shifts and beaming due to the motion of the center of mass, as well as helicity breaking gravitational lensing, and resonances with ringdown modes of the supermassive black hole. We establish that previously proposed phenomenological models inadequately capture these effects.</description>

      <title>Exact plane symmetric black bounce with a perfect-fluid exterior obeying a linear equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate an exact two-parameter family of plane symmetric solutions admitting a hypersurface-orthogonal Killing vector in general relativity with a perfect fluid obeying a linear equation of state $p=\chi\rho$ in $n(\ge 4)$ dimensions, obtained by Gamboa in 2012. The Gamboa solution is identical to the topological Schwarzschild-Tangherlini-(anti-)de~Sitter $\Lambda$-vacuum solution for $\chi=-1$ and admits a non-degenerate Killing horizon only for $\chi=-1$ and $\chi\in[-1/3,0)$. We identify all possible regular attachments of two Gamboa solutions for $\chi\in[-1/3,0)$ at the Killing horizon without a lightlike thin shell, where $\chi$ may have different values on each side of the horizon. We also present the maximal extension of the static and asymptotically topological Schwarzschild-Tangherlini Gamboa solution, realized only for $\chi\in(-(n-3)/(3n-5),0)$, under the assumption that the value of $\chi$ is unchanged in the extended dynamical region beyond the horizon. The maximally extended spacetime describes either (i) a globally regular black bounce whose Killing horizon coincides with a bounce null hypersurface, or (ii) a black hole with a spacelike curvature singularity inside the horizon. The matter field inside the horizon is not a perfect fluid but an anisotropic fluid that can be interpreted as a spacelike (tachyonic) perfect fluid. A fine-tuning of the parameters is unnecessary for the black bounce but the null energy condition is violated everywhere except on the horizon. In the black-bounce (black-hole) case, the metric in the regular coordinate system is $C^\infty$ only for $\chi=-1/(1+2N)$ with odd (even) $N$ satisfying $N&gt;(n-1)/(n-3)$, and if one of the parameters in the extended region is fine-tuned.</description>

      <title>Regular Vaidya solutions of effective gravitational theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate the study of the dynamics of spherically symmetric spacetimes beyond general relativity through exact solutions of the field equations of second-order effective gravitational theories defined solely in terms of the symmetries of the problem in 4 or more dimensions. We prove the existence of regular Vaidya solutions that represent the formation or change in mass of regular black holes (or black hole mimickers) due to the gravitational collapse or accretion of radiation, with the time-reverse of these processes being also included as solutions. Our treatment and results are remarkable in their simplicity and the possibilities they provide for novel theoretical applications and discoveries in the context of regular gravitational collapse. For instance, we illustrate how modifications of the gravitational dynamics can cure curvature singularities through what can be interpreted as an energy transfer between matter and gravitational degrees of freedom. As another application, we show how to incorporate spacetimes frequently used in the literature, designed geometrically to represent the formation and disappearance of regular black holes, as fully dynamical solutions within this formalism.</description>

      <title>The Cosmological Constant from a Quantum Gravitational $\theta$-Vacua and the Gravitational Hall Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a new perspective on the cosmological constant by exploring the background-independent Wheeler-DeWitt quantization of general relativity. The Chern-Simons-Kodama state of quantum gravity, a generalization of the Hartle-Hawking and Vilenkin states, has a striking structural similarity to the topological field theory of the quantum Hall effect. As a result, we study the gravitational topological $\theta$-sectors in analogy to Yang-Mills theory. We find that the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ is intimately linked to the $\theta$-parameter by $\theta=12\pi^2/(\Lambda \ell^2_{\rm Pl}) \mod 2\pi$ due to the fact that Chern-Simons-Kodama state must live in a particular $\theta$-sector. This result is shown in the canonical, non-perturbative formalism. Furthermore, we explain how the physics of the Hamiltonian constraint is analogous to the quantum Hall effect, with the cosmological constant playing the role of a quantum gravitational Hall resistivity. These relations suggest that $\Lambda$ is topologically protected against perturbative graviton loop corrections, analogous to the robustness of quantized Hall conductance against disorder in a metal.</description>

      <title>Spherically Symmetric Potentials in Quadratic $f(R)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the gravitational potential arising from static, spherically symmetric sources in a modified gravity theory described by a quadratic $f(R)$ model. The linearized field equations lead to a fourth-order differential equation, whose solution includes Newtonian and Yukawa-like terms. Imposing regularity at the origin and asymptotic flatness fixes all integration constants, making the potential fully determined by the mass distribution. We analyze classical profiles such as Plummer, Hernquist, and Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW), along with some new analytic models. For each case, we derive explicit expressions for the modified potential and analyze its dependence on the $f(R)$ parameter $\alpha$. The solutions demonstrate that while $f(R)$ corrections generically introduce $r^{-1}$ divergences at finite $\alpha$, these are cancelled in the GR limit, that is, when the scalar field mass becomes infinite. The new profiles offer alternatives for modeling astrophysical systems, particularly in regimes where deviations from Newtonian gravity may play a role. These results may serve as a theoretical groundwork for future studies of modified gravity in astrophysical contexts.</description>

      <title>Deriving Entangled Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entangled Relativity is a non-linear reformulation of Einstein's theory that cannot be defined in the absence of matter fields. It recovers General Relativity in the weak matter density limit or whenever $\mathcal{L}_m = T$ on-shell, and it is also more parsimonious in terms of fundamental constants and units. In this paper, we show that Entangled Relativity can be derived from a general $f(R,\mathcal{L}_m)$ theory by imposing a single requirement: the theory must admit all solutions of General Relativity whenever $\mathcal{L}_m = T  \ne 0$ on-shell, though not necessarily only those solutions. An important consequence is that all vacuum solutions of General Relativity are limits of solutions of Entangled Relativity when the matter fields tend to zero. In addition, we introduce a broader class of theories featuring an intrinsic decoupling, which, however, do not generally admit the solutions of General Relativity.</description>

      <title>The New Black Hole Solution with Anisotropic Fluid in f(R,Lm, T) Gravity: Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we derive a new class of analytic black hole solutions within the framework of f(R,Lm, T) gravity, where the black hole is surrounded by an anisotropic fluid acting as the matter source. We consider both linear and nonlinear forms of the function f(R,Lm, T), enabling a detailed exploration of how anisotropic pressures and different f(R,Lm, T) influence the spacetime structure. Furthermore, we derive the conditions on the coupling parameters (\b{eta}1, \b{eta}2, \b{eta}3) under which the energy conditions are satisfied. Utilising these constraints, we then investigate the thermodynamic behaviour of the resulting black hole solutions in the presence of various matter fields, namely, dust, radiation, and a quintessence field, each characterised by a distinct equation-of-state parameter. An important outcome of this study is that the results obtained deviate from those predicted by standard General Relativity. It is also observed that these deviations depend explicitly on the interaction between the matter Lagrangian Lm and the trace T of the energy-momentum tensor.</description>

      <title>Charged Scalar Field at Future Null Infinity via Nonlinear Hyperboloidal Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasinormal modes and power-law late-time decay tails of a charged scalar field in a charged black hole background have been studied, but never in the fully non-linear regime, as far as we know. In this paper, we study the dependence of these properties on the charges of scalar field and black hole. For the quasinormal modes, a fit of the spherical fundamental mode is shown for the purely uncharged case and compared to the charged one. We also see for the first time the transition from gravitational decay to pure electromagnetic decay, and show disagreement with the oscillation frequency between real and imaginary parts of the scalar field prescribed in the literature. Full non-linear evolutions of hyperboloidal slices in spherical symmetry were used to obtain our results, allowing for the extraction of signals at future null infinity.</description>

      <title>Estimating Hubble Constant with Gravitational Observations: A Concise Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hubble constant is of paramount importance in astrophysics and cosmology. A large number of methods have been developed with different electromagnetic probes to estimate its value. The most recent results show a tension between values obtained from Cosmic Microwave Background observations and supernovae. The simultaneous detection of gravitational waves and electromagnetic radiation from GW170817 provided a direct estimation of the Hubble constant that did not depend on the astronomical distance ladder. This concise review will present the methods to estimate the Hubble constant with the gravitational observations of compact binary mergers, discussing both bright and dark sirens and reporting the state of the art of the results.</description>

      <title>Emergence of cosmic structure from Planckian discreteness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the standard inflationary paradigm the inhomogeneities observed in the CMB arise from quantum fluctuations of an initially homogeneous and isotropic vacuum state. This picture suffers from two well-known weaknesses. First, it assumes that quantum field theory remains valid at trans-Planckian scales, without modifications from quantum gravity. Second, it necessitates a quantum-to-classical transition in which fluctuations of a homogeneous quantum state become the classical inhomogeneities seen in the CMB. Recently, an alternative paradigm has been proposed in which such inhomogeneities are present from the very beginning, emerging from the assumed discreteness of spacetime at the Planck scale predicted by certain approaches to quantum gravity. Within this framework, scale-invariant scalar perturbations are generated naturally, without relying on trans-Planckian assumptions or invoking a quantum-to-classical transition. Specifically, inhomogeneities in the quantum state at the Planck scale propagate into semiclassical inhomogeneities on CMB scales. Here, we extend the aforementioned proposal to the most realistic case of a quasi-de Sitter expansion; in particular, we compute the scalar perturbation spectrum as a function of the slow-roll parameters, systematically encoded through the Hubble flow functions.</description>

      <title>Periodic equatorial orbits in a black bounce scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study equatorial closed orbits in a popular black bounce model to see if the internal structure of these objects could lead to peculiar observable features. Paralleling the analysis of the Schwarzschild and Kerr metrics, we show that in the black bounce case each orbit can also be associated with a triplet of integers which can then be used to construct a rational number characterizing each periodic orbit. When the black bounce solution represents a traversable wormhole, we show that the previous classification scheme is still applicable with minor adaptations. We confirm in this way that this established framework enables a complete description of the equatorial dynamics across a spectrum of cases, from regular black holes to wormholes. Varying the black bounce parameter $r_{min}$, we compare the trajectories in the Simpson-Visser model with those in the Schwarzschild metric (and the rotating case with Kerr). We find that in some cases even small increments in $r_{min}$ can lead to significant changes in the orbits.</description>

      <title>Bayesian reconstruction of primordial perturbations from induced gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22534v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of primordial black holes or other dark matter relics from amplified density fluctuations in the early universe may also generate scalar-induced gravitational waves (GW), carrying vital information about the primordial power spectrum and the early expansion history of our universe. We present a Bayesian approach aimed at reconstructing both the shape of the scalar power spectrum and the universe's equation of state from GW observations, using interpolating splines to flexibly capture features in the GW data. The optimal number of spline nodes is chosen via Bayesian evidence, aiming at balancing complexity of the model and the fidelity of the reconstruction. We test our method using both representative mock data and recent Pulsar Timing Array measurements, demonstrating that it can accurately reconstruct the curvature power spectrum as well as the underlying equation of state, if different from radiation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The influence of a possible low gravity scale, concretely through the presence of extra dimensions or additional species, on radiation properties of micro black holes is investigated. In particular, the suppression of evaporation through the so-called memory-burden effect is shown to be stronger, occurs earlier and with sharper transition compared to the canonical Planck-scale regime. It is furthermore shown how this affects the possibility of light primordial black hole dark matter, constraints on which may weaken substantially and allow them to be as light as $10^{-5}\,M_{\rm P}$, thereby lying in the particle regime.</description>

Abstract: We investigate limitations of causality arguments from flat-spacetime amplitudes, based on the eikonal limit of gravitational scattering, to place constraints on modified gravity. We show that causality constraints are only valid in the weak-gravity regime even for transplanckian scattering, and that such constraints are much less stringent than astrophysical ones, obtained for example from gravitational waves emitted in black hole coalescence. Special attention is given to the weakness of causality constraints on dynamical Chern-Simons gravity, but our results apply to other modified gravity theories as well. In the context of that theory, we also discuss how to obtain a time-delay formula from black hole, neutron stars, and shockwave solutions. For scattering with compact objects, we explicitly show that time delays are greatly suppressed by the ratio of the object's mass to the impact parameter, so time advances only occur greatly outside the cut off of the theory. For the shockwave solution, we find that the time delay is always positive within the regime of validity of the solution. We also comment on the impact of graviton nonlinearities for time-delay calculations in the nonlinear, strong gravity regime. We conclude that amplitude-based causality constraints on modified gravity are typically not stringent relative to other experimental and observational bounds.</description>

      <title>Revealing Limitation in the Standard Cosmological Model: A Redshift-Dependent Hubble Constant from Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major issue in contemporary cosmology is the persistent discrepancy, known as the Hubble tension, between the Hubble constant ($H_0$) estimates from local measurements and those inferred from early-Universe observations under the standard $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) paradigm. Recent advances have identified fast radio bursts (FRBs), a class of extragalactic phenomena observable at considerable redshifts, as a promising observational tool for probing late-time cosmology. In this study, we incorporate two complementary methodologies, machine learning algorithms and Bayesian analysis, on a set of localized FRBs to rigorously test the consistency of the $\Lambda$CDM model at late cosmic epochs. Our results reveal a statistically significant redshift-dependent variation of $H_0$, which contradicts the core postulate of $\Lambda$CDM. We further validate that the redshift dependency of $H_0$ can be removed within the more flexible framework of $w_0w_a$CDM model. These findings highlight that the redshift evolution of $H_0$ is not merely an artifact of the standard model but an indication of a deeper inadequacy in the $\Lambda$CDM model, supporting the need for a more flexible cosmological framework.</description>

      <title>Extended datasamples under the lens of Brane World Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work revises the Brane World Theory known as Randall-Sundrum with the modification of an exponential, redshift-dependent brane tension. This model is studied in a scenario assuming no dark energy, with the aim of determining whether it can reproduce the universe's acceleration on its own, without the addition of a dark energy fluid. Bayesian statistical analysis is performed in order to constrain the free parameters of each scenario using SLS, SNIa, OHD, and BAO data samples, the last two considering newly added data points. Both Planck and Riess priors for h are used and compared. In both cases, we are able to reproduce the late-time accelerated expansion in agreement with observational data. Interesting consistencies at the transition redshift zt with LCDM are found, suggesting that this might be a suitable model for studying the evolution of the universe up to the present date. However, some pathologies are detected in this model, namely a "Big Rip" divergence of H(z) at z = 1, as well as a strong dependence between the functional form of the brane tension and the future evolution of the universe.</description>

      <title>Detectability of post-Newtonian classical and quantum gravity via quantum clock interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding physical phenomena at the intersection of quantum mechanics and general relativity remains a major challenge in modern physics. While various experimental approaches have been proposed to probe quantum systems in curved spacetime, most focus on the Newtonian regime, leaving post-Newtonian effects such as frame dragging largely unexplored. In this study, we propose and theoretically analyze an experimental scheme to investigate how post-Newtonian gravity affects quantum systems. We consider two setups: (i) a quantum clock interferometry configuration designed to detect the gravitational field of a rotating mass, and (ii) a scheme exploring whether such effects could mediate entanglement between quantum systems. Due to the symmetry of the configuration, the proposed setup is insensitive to Newtonian gravitational contributions but remains sensitive to the frame-dragging effect. Assuming the validity of the quantum equivalence principle, this approach may provide insights not only into the quantum nature of gravity but also into whether spacetime itself exhibits quantum properties. However, our analysis reveals that, within realistic experimental parameters, the expected effects are too small to be detected. We discuss possible interpretations of this undetectability, and its implications for tests of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Quantum-corrected black hole thermodynamics from the gravitational path integral</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploring quantum effects from black hole thermodynamics has always been a pivotal topic. In recent years, the free energy landscape and ensemble-averaged theory based on the Euclidean path integral approach have provided further understanding of the statistical aspects of the black hole system. We investigate the quantum-corrected thermodynamics of the Reissner-Nordstrom-AdS black hole by including off-shell geometries in the path integral. We obtain a one-loop effective action by considering the subleading-order terms in the ensemble-averaged theory, and verify that the effective thermodynamic quantities consistent with the effective action define a valid thermodynamics. Furthermore, the phase diagram was modified by the off-shell effects, resulting in a more abundant phase structure. We discover that the traditional black hole thermodynamics can be recovered in the semi-classical limit. The region of first-order phase transitions shrinks and zero-order phase transitions emerge when off-shell effects are included. The results provide new perspectives for understanding the quantum corrections in black hole thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Classical-quantum systems breaking conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whether gravity must be quantized remains one of the biggest open problems in fundamental physics. Classical-quantum hybrid theories have recently attracted attention as a possible framework in which gravity is treated classically yet interacts consistently with quantum matter. Schemes based on completely positive dynamics satisfy most formal consistency requirements and enable a systematic treatment of quantum backreaction, but they also give rise to features that challenge conventional physical intuition, such as the breakdown of conservation laws. To illustrate this issue, we consider a qubit interacting with a classical particle and demonstrate that the corresponding hybrid system violates angular momentum conservation despite the rotational symmetry of the underlying equations of motion.</description>

      <title>What new physics can we extract from inflation using the ACT DR6 and DESI DR2 Observations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of inflationary models in light of projected sensitivities from forthcoming CMB and gravitational wave experiments, incorporating data from recent ACT DR6, DESI DR2, CMB-S4, LiteBIRD, and SPHEREx. Focusing on precise predictions in the $(n_s, \alpha_s, \beta_s)$ parameter space, we evaluate a broad class of inflationary scenarios -- including canonical single-field models, non-minimally coupled theories, and string-inspired constructions such as Starobinsky, Higgs, Hilltop, $\alpha$-attractors, and D-brane models. Our results show that next-generation observations will sharply constrain the scale dependence of the scalar power spectrum, elevating $\alpha_s$ and $\beta_s$ as key discriminants between large-field and small-field dynamics. Strikingly, several widely studied models -- such as quartic Hilltop inflation and specific DBI variants -- are forecast to be excluded at high significance. We further demonstrate that the combined measurement of $\beta_s$ and the field excursion $\Delta\phi$ offers a novel diagnostic of kinetic structure and UV sensitivity. These findings underscore the power of upcoming precision cosmology to probe the microphysical origin of inflation and decisively test broad classes of theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Null infinity as an inverted extremal horizon: Matching an infinite set of conserved quantities for gravitational perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Every spacetime that is asymptotically flat near null infinity can be conformally mapped via a spatial inversion onto the geometry around an extremal, non-rotating and non-expanding horizon. We set up a dictionary for this geometric duality, connecting the geometry and physics near null infinity to those near the dual horizon. We then study its physical implications for conserved quantities for extremal black holes, extending previously known results to the case of gravitational perturbations. In particular, we derive a tower of near-horizon gravitational charges that are exactly conserved and show their one-to-one matching with Newman-Penrose conserved quantities associated with gravitational perturbations of the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole geometry. We furthermore demonstrate the physical relevance of spatial inversions for extremal Kerr-Newman black holes, even if the latter are notoriously not conformally isometric under such inversions.</description>

      <title>Searching for Kerr in string amplitudes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue the approach of [1] to attempt to reproduce the classical electromagnetic current of the $\sqrt{\mathrm{Kerr}}$ solution from the infinite-spin limit of a three-point amplitude with two higher-spin string states and a massless vector. We review the infinite-spin limit of three-point amplitudes along the leading Regge trajectory, which differ from $\sqrt{\mathrm{Kerr}}$, and we provide evidence that any sub-leading trajectory parallel to the leading one give the same result. We extend the above investigation to the simplest sub-leading trajectory not parallel to the leading one, containing physical states with the first two harmonics. We compute all three-point amplitudes involving two such states and a massless vector, using both covariant and DDF formalism, and we extract the associated classical infinite-spin limit. Inspired by the leading Regge case, where this limit reproduces the classical electromagnetic current sourced by a rigid rotating string, we derive new classical string solutions containing the first two harmonics and compare the currents they source to the infinite-spin amplitude of the two-harmonic state. We do not see a matching between the two approaches, and we find that the classical behaviour is instead reproduced by the amplitude involving coherent string states. We conclude this paper by discussing common patterns between the different amplitudes we considered, and we conjecture how they can be generalised to reproduce $\sqrt{\mathrm{Kerr}}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generalized Komar $(d-2)$-form charge can be modified by the addition of any other on-shell closed (conserved) $(d-2)$-form charge. We show that, with Kaluza--Klein boundary conditions, one has to add a charge related to the higher-form symmetry identified in Ref.~\cite{Gomez-Fayren:2024cpl} to the naive Komar charge of pure 5-dimensional gravity to obtain a conserved charge charge whose integral at spatial infinity gives the mass. The new term also contains the contribution of the Kaluza--Klein monopole charge leading to electric-magnetic duality invariance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.08052v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider general initial data for the Einstein scalar-field system on a closed $3$-manifold $(M,\gamma)$ which is close to data for a Friedman-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker solution with homogeneous scalar field matter and a negative Einstein metric $\gamma$ as spatial geometry. We prove that the maximal globally hyperbolic development of such initial data in the Einstein scalar-field system is past incomplete in the contracting direction and exhibits stable collapse into a Big Bang curvature singularity. Under an additional condition on the first positive eigenvalue of $-\Delta_\gamma$ satisfied, for example, by closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds of small diameter, we prove that the data evolves to a future complete spacetime in the expanding direction which asymptotes to a vacuum Friedman solution with $(M,\gamma)$ as the expansion normalized spatial geometry. In particular, the Strong Cosmic Censorship conjecture holds for this class of solutions in the $C^{2}$-sense.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Impact of Unequal Noises and Foreground Modeling on SGWB Reconstruction with LISA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the search for stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWB) of cosmological origin with LISA, it is crucial to account for realistic complications in the noise and astrophysical foreground modeling that may impact the signal reconstruction. To address these challenges, we updated the $\texttt{SGWBinner}$ code to incorporate both variable noise levels across LISA arms and more complex foreground spectral shapes. Our findings suggest that, while moderate variations of the noise amplitudes have a minimal impact, poor foreground modeling (i.e., templates requiring many free parameters) significantly degrades the reconstruction of cosmological signals. This underlines the importance of accurate modeling and subtraction of the astrophysical foregrounds to characterize possible cosmological components. To perform this more challenging analysis, we have integrated the $\texttt{JAX}$ framework, which significantly improves the computational efficiency of the code, in the $\texttt{SGWBinner}$ code, enabling faster Bayesian likelihood sampling and more effective exploration of complex SGWB signals.</description>

      <title>Formation of regular black hole from baryonic matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a family of exact, singularity-free solutions describing the collapse of baryonic matter characterized by a barotropic equation of state whose coefficient $\alpha(r,v)$ varies in both radius and time. By matching these interior solutions to the Husain exterior metric, we obtain a self-consistent, dynamical spacetime representing a regular black hole. Although the pressure profile of our models grows with radius and eventually violates the dominant energy condition beyond a critical surface-necessitating an external junction to ensure a globally well-defined spacetime-the interior solution remains non-singular throughout the collapse. We further analyze the optical properties of these regular black holes and find that both the photon sphere radius and the corresponding shadow radius increase monotonically as the local equation of state parameter $\alpha$ is raised. Moreover, the matching interface between the interior and exterior metrics naturally suggests a phase transition in the collapsing fluid, which can postpone the formation of an apparent horizon. Taken together, our results not only highlight novel physical features of horizon formation in regular collapse models but also identify characteristic shadow signatures that could be tested by future observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12419v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We deepen the analysis of the cosmological acceleration produced by quantum gravity dynamics in the formalism of group field theory condensate cosmology, treated at the coarse-grained level via a phenomenological model, in the language of hydrodynamics on minisuperspace. Specifically, we conduct a detailed analysis of the late-time evolution, which shows a phantom-like phase followed by an asymptotic De Sitter expansion. We argue that the model indicates a recent occurrence of the phantom crossing and we extract a more precise expression for the effective cosmological constant, linking its value to other parameters in the model and to the scale of the quantum bounce in the early universe evolution. Additionally, we show how the phantom phase produced by our quantum gravity dynamics increases the inferred value of the current Hubble parameter based on observed data, indicating a possible quantum gravity mechanism for alleviating the Hubble tension. Our results represent a concrete example of how quantum gravity can provide an explanation for large-scale cosmological puzzles, in an emergent spacetime scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present work, we theoretically investigate light deflection in the weak and strong field regimes for two regular spacetimes with corrections from loop quantum gravity. We treat analytically the expansions for both limits and use them as a basis for investigating gravitational lensing observables. We analyze and provide reasonable values for observables related to the second model that observational tools may be able to detect.</description>

      <title>Scalar Quasinormal Modes of Rotating Regular Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasinormal modes are characteristic signatures of compact objects. Here we consider rotating regular black holes, representing rotating generalizations of the Simpson and Visser metric. We present the spectrum of scalar quasinormal modes and compare it with the spectrum of Kerr black holes. The calculations are done using a spectral decomposition method. The scalar modes smoothly connect to the Kerr limit. Interestingly, for particularly low scaled Hawking temperatures, the dependence of the modes changes as rotation increases. A further investigation shows that the real part of the fundamental and first excited modes of the static and slowly rotating black holes (about $13\%$ of the extremal angular momentum) progresses in an opposite behavior in this low temperature region. Meanwhile the imaginary part of the modes crosses where the excited modes become longer lived than the fundamental modes. Rapid rotation however suppresses such tendency.</description>

      <title>Parametrized spin-precessing inspiral-merger-ringdown waveform model for tests of general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10130v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coalescence of binary black holes (BBHs) provides a unique arena to test general relativity (GR) in the dynamical, strong-field regime. To this end, we present pSEOBNRv5PHM, a parametrized, multipolar, spin-precessing waveform model for BBHs in quasicircular orbits, built within the effective-one-body formalism. Compared to its predecessor, pSEOBNRv4HM, our model introduces parametrized deviations from GR not only in the plunge-merger-ringdown stages, but also in the inspiral phase through modifications to the conservative dynamics. Additionally, it incorporates, for the first time, spin-precession effects. The free deviation parameters can be used to perform null tests of GR using current and future gravitational-wave observations. We validate pSEOBNRv5PHM through Bayesian parameter estimation, focusing on the quasinormal-mode frequency and damping time of the $(\ell,m,n) = (2,2,0)$ mode. Our analysis of synthetic signals from numerical-relativity (NR) simulations of highly precessing BH mergers shows that, while pSEOBNRv5PHM correctly recovers consistency with GR, neglecting spin precession can lead to false detections of deviations from GR even at current detector sensitivity. Conversely, when analyzing a synthetic signal from a NR simulation of a binary boson-star merger, the model successfully identifies a deviation from a GR BBH signal. Finally, we reanalyze 12 events from the third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog. Using a hierarchical combination of these events, we constrain fractional deviations in the frequency and damping time of the $(2,2,0)$ quasinormal-mode to $\delta f_{220}=0.00_{-0.06}^{+0.06}$ and $\delta \tau_{220}=0.15_{-0.24}^{+0.26}$ at 90% credibility. These results are consistent with those from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration, which did not account for spin-precession effects.</description>

      <title>Complete quasinormal modes of Type-D black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasinormal mode (QNM) spectra of black holes exhibit two open problems [Conf. Proc. C 0405132, 145 (2004); CQG 26, 163001 (2009)]: (i) the discontinuity in highly damped QNMs between Schwarzschild and Kerr solutions as $a \to 0$, and (ii) the unexplained spectral proximity between QNMs and algebraically special (AS) frequencies, particularly the anomalous multiplet splitting for Kerr $\ell=2$, $m \geq 0$ modes. We develop a novel method to compute complete QNM spectra for Type-D black holes, solving both problems and establishing a mathematical framework for boundary value problems of dissipative systems. Using analytic continuation of radial eigenvalue equations, our method eliminates the dependence on auxiliary parameters in the connection formulas for confluent Heun solutions. This breakthrough overcomes the long-standing challenge of calculating QNMs that cross or lie on the negative imaginary axis (NIA). For Schwarzschild and Kerr spacetimes ($0 \leq \hat{n} \leq 41$, $2 \leq \ell \leq 16$), we present complete spectra validated through scattering amplitudes with errors $&lt;10^{-10}$. The results provide definitive solutions to both open problems: (i) The inability of conventional methods to compute QNMs crossing or residing on the NIA leads to apparent discontinuities in Kerr spectra as $a \to 0$. (ii) When a QNM exactly coincides with the AS frequency, an additional QNM (unconventional mode) appears nearby. For the Kerr case with $\ell=2$, overtone sequences from both unconventional and AS modes exhibit precisely $2\ell+1$ branches, without multiplets or supersymmetry breaking at AS frequencies. Our method confirms Leung's conjecture of high-$\ell$ unconventional mode deviations from the NIA through the first $\ell=3$ calculation. Moreover, this paradigm surpasses the state-of-the-art Cook's continued fraction and isomonodromic methods in computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Regularizing the Pulsar Timing Array likelihood: A path towards Fourier Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11894v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent announcement of evidence for a stochastic background of gravitational waves (GWB) in pulsar timing array (PTA) data has piqued interest across the scientific community. A combined analysis of all currently available data holds the promise of confirming the announced evidence as a solid detection of a GWB. However, the complexity of individual pulsar noise models and the variety of modeling tools used for different types of pulsars present significant challenges for a truly unified analysis. In this work we propose a novel approach to the analysis of PTA data: first a posterior distribution over Fourier modes is produced for each pulsar individually. Then, in a global analysis of all pulsars these posterior distributions can be re-used for a GWB search, which retains all information regarding the signals of interest without the added complexity of the underlying noise models or implementation differences. This approach facilitates combining radio and gamma-ray pulsar data, while reducing the complexity of the model and of its implementations when carrying out a GWB search with PTA data.</description>

      <title>Chern-Simons "ground state" from the path integral</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a path integral representation
  of the time evolution $\exp(-\frac{i}{\hbar}tH)$ for Lagrangians of the variable $A$ which can be represented in the form (quadratic in $Q$) ${\cal L}(A)=\frac{1}{2}Q(A){\cal M}Q(A)+\partial_{\mu}L^{\mu}$. We show that
  $\exp(-\frac{i}{\hbar}tH)\exp(\frac{i}{\hbar}\int d{\bf x}L^{0}) =\exp(\frac{i}{\hbar}\int d{\bf x}L^{0})$ up to an $A$-independent factor. We discuss examples of the states $\exp(\frac{i}{\hbar}\int d{\bf x}L^{0})$ in quantum mechanics and in quantum field theory (the Chern-Simons states in Yang-Mills theory, Kodama states in quantum gravity). We show the relevance of these states for a determination of the dynamics in terms of stochastic perturbations of self-duality equations. The solution of the Schr\"odinger equation can be expressed by the solution of the self-duality equation in the leading order of $\hbar$ expansion. We discuss applications to gauge theory on a Lorentzian manifold and gauge theories of gravity.</description>

      <title>Axion dissipation in conductive media and neutron star superradiance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In axion electrodynamics, magnetic fields enable axion-photon mixing. Recent proposals suggest that rotating, conductive plasmas in neutron star magnetospheres could trigger axion superradiant instabilities -- an intriguing idea, given that such instabilities are typically associated with rotating black holes. In this work, we extend these investigations by properly incorporating plasma dynamics, particularly the plasma-induced photon effective mass, which suppresses the axion-photon mixing. Using two toy models for the conductive regions in the magnetosphere and accounting for fluid dynamics in both the frequency and time domain, we show that typical astrophysical plasma densities strongly inhibits the axionic instability. While our results assumes flat spacetime, the conclusions also apply to axion bound states in curved spacetimes, making neutron star superradiance less viable than previously thought. As a byproduct of our work, we provide a detailed description of axion electrodynamics in dissipative plasmas and uncover phenomena such as low-frequency axion "tails" and axion-induced electrostatic fields in dense plasmas.</description>

      <title>Postmerger: a new and dominant contribution to the gravitational-wave background from binary neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) generated by the inspiral and merger of binary neutron stars is traditionally modelled assuming that the inspiral is promptly followed by the collapse of the merger remnant to a rotating black hole. While this is reasonable for the most massive binaries, it is not what is expected in general, as the remnant may survive for up to hundreds of milliseconds and radiate an amount of energy that is significantly larger than that lost during the whole inspiral. To account for this additional contribution to the SGWB, we consider a waveform model that includes both the inspiral and the postmerger emission. We show for the first time that for a large set of parameterized equations of state (EOSs) compatible with observational constraints, there is considerable spectral power in the $1-2\,{\rm kHz}$ range, distinct from that associated with the inspiral and leading to a dimensionless GW energy density $\Omega_{\rm GW} \simeq 10^{-10}-10^{-9}$. We discuss the enhanced detectability of the SGWB by third-generation detectors such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, and show how it depends on the signal-to-noise ratio of foreground binaries and on the remnant lifetime. Interestingly, even a non-detection of the high-frequency part of the SGWB could provide valuable constraints on the remnant lifetime, offering novel insights into the postmerger dynamics and the EOS of nuclear matter.</description>

      <title>Bulk/boundary Modular Quintessence and DESI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The latest DESI DR2 results, when combined with other independent cosmological data on the Cosmic Microwave Background and supernovas, suggest a preference for dynamical dark energy.
  We propose a novel cosmological scenario, which features two distinct scalar fields. One governs the magnitude of the present-day dark energy density and is related to the size of extra-dimensions. Accounting for the observed smallness of this energy density requires the scalar to reside near the boundary of field space.
  The second field, responsible for the time evolution of dark energy and associated with the string coupling, must instead lie in the bulk to remain consistent with the non-observation of light string states. We show that a natural candidate for such dark energy dynamics is a quintessence modular-invariant potential, in which the second scalar field rolls down a negatively curved slope, starting from a self-dual critical point. We find that this scenario is in good agreement with the latest findings by DESI.</description>
