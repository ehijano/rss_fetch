      <title>Observation of the Exceptional Skin Effect on a Non-Hermitian Flat band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flat band and non-Hermitian are both significant conceptions in modern physics. In this study, we delve into the behaviours of flat bands in non-Hermitian systems, focusing on the interplay between the flat band and its dispersive counterparts, investigating the exceptional points (EPs) formed by them together, and the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) on the flat band correspondingly generated, which we name as the exceptional skin effect (ESE). Employing non-Hermitian flat band under chiral/sublattice symmetry, where energy remains highly degenerate, we explore their unique properties. Unlike traditional NHSE which requires the enclosing of a non-zero area in the Bloch complex energy spectrum, the ESE on flat band can be generated with a Bloch complex energy spectrum consisting of one single point, i.e. enclosing no area. By analytically tuning non-Hermitian parameters, changes in the complex energy spectrum and Riemann surfaces are observed, revealing the formation of EPs through the hybridization of flat and dispersive bands while maintaining the dimension of the Hilbert subspace. Additionally, the wave functions of flat band exhibit ESE in specific parameter regions, contrary to the existing frameworks. Experimental validation is conducted using an elastic wave system with actively modulated non-Hermitian parameters, showcasing the impact on flat-band states and confirming the formation of ESE due to flat band-dispersive bands hybridization and correspondingly formed EPs. These results offer novel insights into non-Hermitian physics and present potential directions for further researches and applications in this field.</description>

      <title>Pulse-induced memory-like effect in cyclotron motion?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how a charged particle moving in a uniform magnetic field along its standard circular path (cyclotron motion) reacts to a short-duration, homogeneous, uniform electric field pulse injected in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field. A `permanent' change in the radius of the initial circle and a shift of its centre is noted at later times, after the pulse is switched off. The magnitude of the velocity undergoes a change too, akin to a `velocity kick'. In summary, our results suggest a pulse-induced `electromagnetic memory-like effect', which is not quite a `wave memory', but, nevertheless, has similar features within a simple, non-relativistic context.</description>

      <title>The non-standad logic of physics: the case of the Boltzmann-Sinai hard-sphere system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most challenging and fascinating issues in mathematical and theoretical physics concerns identifying the common logic, if any, which underlies the physical world. More precisely, this involves the search of the possibly-unique axiomatic logical proposition calculus to apply simultaneously both to classical and quantum realms of physics and to be consistent with the corresponding mathematical and filosophysical setups. Based on the recent establishment of quantum logic, which has been shown to apply both to Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Gravity, the crucial remaining step involves the identification of the appropriate axiomatic logical proposition calculus to be associated with Classical Mechanics. In this paper the issue is posed for a fundamental example of Classical Mechanics, which is represented by the so-called Boltzmann-Sinai dynamical system. This is realized by the ensemble of classical smooth hard-spheres, which is set at the basis of Classical Statistical Mechanics and is also commonly regarded as a possible realization of Classical Newtonian Cosmology. Depending on the initial conditions which are prescribed for such a system, its classical state is shown to obey the propositional calculus of non-classical logic. In particular, the latter is expressed by the 3-way Principle of Non-Contradiction, namely the same logical principle that holds for quantum logic. The result therefore permits to question on a mathematical basis the principles of deterministic classical logic and the validity of their character within the domain of Classical Physics. Such a conclusion represents a potential notable innovation in the logical dicotomy true/false, a crucial topic which has crossed millennia through philosophy, logic, mathematics and physics.</description>
