      <title>Delaunay-like Triangulation of Smooth Orientable Submanifolds by L1-Norm Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.06008v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the shape reconstruction problem, when the shape we wish to reconstruct is an orientable smooth d-dimensional submanifold of the Euclidean space. Assuming we have as input a simplicial complex K that approximates the submanifold (such as the Cech complex or the Rips complex), we recast the problem of reconstucting the submanifold from K as a L1-norm minimization problem in which the optimization variable is a d-chain of K. Providing that K satisfies certain reasonable conditions, we prove that the considered minimization problem has a unique solution which triangulates the submanifold and coincides with the flat Delaunay complex introduced and studied in a companion paper. Since the objective is a weighted L1-norm and the constraints are linear, the triangulation process can thus be implemented by linear programming.</description>

      <title>Pattern Formation for Fat Robots with Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a set of $n\geq 1$ autonomous, anonymous, indistinguishable, silent, and possibly disoriented mobile unit disk (i.e., fat) robots operating following Look-Compute-Move cycles in the Euclidean plane, we consider the Pattern Formation problem: from arbitrary starting positions, the robots must reposition themselves to form a given target pattern. This problem arises under obstructed visibility, where a robot cannot see another robot if there is a third robot on the straight line segment between the two robots. We assume that a robot's movement cannot be interrupted by an adversary and that robots have a small $O(1)$-sized memory that they can use to store information, but that cannot be communicated to the other robots. To solve this problem, we present an algorithm that works in three steps. First it establishes mutual visibility, then it elects one robot to be the leader, and finally it forms the required pattern. The whole algorithm runs in $O(n) + O(q \log n)$ rounds with probability at least $1 - n^{-q}$. The algorithms are collision-free and do not require the knowledge of the number of robots.</description>

      <title>External Incremental Delaunay Triangulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a Delaunay triangulation algorithm based on the external incremental method. Unlike traditional random incremental methods, this approach uses convex hull and points as basic operational units instead of triangles. Since each newly added point is outside the convex hull, there is no need to search for which triangle contains the point, simplifying the algorithm implementation. The time complexity for point sorting is $O(n\log n)$, while the collective complexity for upper/lower tangent searches is proven to be $O(n)$. For uniformly distributed point sets, empirical results demonstrate linear time $O(n)$ for full triangulation construction. The overall time complexity remains $O(n\log n)$. This paper details the algorithm's data structures, implementation details, correctness proof, and comparison with other methods.</description>
