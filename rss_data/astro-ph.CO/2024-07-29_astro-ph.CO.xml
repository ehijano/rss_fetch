      <title>On the implications of the `cosmic calibration tension' beyond $H_0$ and the synergy between early- and late-time new physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The `cosmic calibration tension' is a $&gt; 5\sigma$ discrepancy between the cosmological distance ladder built from baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) calibrated by the Planck/$\Lambda$CDM sound horizon ($r_s$) and Type Ia supernovae (SN1a) calibrated instead with the S$H_0$ES absolute magnitude, assuming the distance-duality relationship (DDR) holds. In this work, we emphasize the consequences of this tension beyond the value of the Hubble constant $H_0$, and the implications for physics beyond $\Lambda$CDM. Of utmost importance, it implies a larger physical matter density $\omega_m\equiv \Omega_m h^2$, as both the fractional matter density $\Omega_m$ and $h\equiv H_0/100$ km/s/Mpc are well constrained from late-time data. New physics in the pre-recombination era must thus be able to decrease $r_s$ while either reducing the value of $\Omega_m$, or increasing the value of $\omega_m$. Assuming a $\Lambda$CDM-like primordial power spectrum, this necessarily results in an increase in the clustering amplitude $\sigma_8$. Deviations from $\Lambda$CDM in the late-time expansion history cannot resolve the calibrator tension but can help relax the required shifts to the matter density and $\sigma_8$: it is in that sense that a combination of early and late-time new physics may help alleviate the tension. More precisely, models that modify the pre-recombination expansion history can accommodate the increase in $\omega_m$ without the need for additional modifications. It is those models which only affect recombination that require additional deviations at late-times to be successful. Hence, the `cosmic calibration tension' points either to a targeted modification of the pre-recombination expansion history, or to a broader change affecting multiple cosmic epochs.</description>

      <title>The First Billion Years in Seconds: An Effective Model for the 21-cm Signal with Population III Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of the 21-cm signal are opening a window to the cosmic-dawn epoch, when the first stars formed. These observations are usually interpreted with semi-numerical or hydrodynamical simulations, which are often computationally intensive and inflexible to changes in cosmological or astrophysical effects. Here, we present an effective, fully analytic model for the impact of the first stars on the 21-cm signal, using the modular code Zeus21. Zeus21 employs an analytic prescription of the star formation rate density (SFRD) to recover the fully nonlinear and nonlocal correlations of radiative fields that determine the 21-cm signal. We introduce the earliest Population III (Pop III) stars residing in low-mass molecular-cooling galaxies in Zeus21, with distinct spectra from later Pop II stars. We also self-consistently model feedback in the form of $H_2$-dissociating Lyman-Werner (LW) radiation, as well as dark matter-baryon relative velocities, both of which suppress star formation in the lowest-mass halos. LW feedback produces a scale-dependence on the SFRD fluctuations, due to the long mean free path of LW photons. Relative velocities give rise to "wiggles" in the spatial distribution of the 21-cm signal; we present an improved calculation of the shape of these velocity-induced acoustic oscillations, showing they remain a standard ruler at cosmic dawn. Our improved version of Zeus21 predicts the 21-cm global signal and power spectra in agreement with simulations at the $\sim 10\%$ level, yet is at least three orders of magnitude faster. This public code represents a step towards efficient and flexible parameter inference at cosmic dawn, allowing us to predict the first billion years of the universe in mere seconds.</description>

      <title>Stirring the cosmic pot: how black hole feedback shapes the matter power spectrum in the Fable simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the impact of baryonic physics on cosmic structure formation is crucial for accurate cosmological predictions, especially as we usher in the era of large galaxy surveys with the Rubin Observatory as well as the Euclid and Roman Space Telescopes. A key process that can redistribute matter across a large range of scales is feedback from accreting supermassive black holes. How exactly these active galactic nuclei (AGN) operate from sub-parsec to Mega-parsec scales however remains largely unknown. To understand this, we investigate how different AGN feedback models in the Fable simulation suite affect the cosmic evolution of the matter power spectrum (MPS).
  Our analysis reveals that AGN feedback significantly suppresses clustering at scales $k \sim 10\,h\,cMpc^{-1}$, with the strongest effect at redshift $z = 0$ causing a reduction of $\sim 10\%$ with respect to the dark matter-only simulation. This is due to the efficient feedback in both radio (low Eddington ratio) and quasar (high Eddington ratio) modes in our fiducial Fable model. We find that variations of the quasar and radio mode feedback with respect to the fiducial Fable model have distinct effects on the MPS redshift evolution, with the radio mode being more effective on larger scales and later epochs. Furthermore, MPS suppression is dominated by AGN feedback effects inside haloes at $z = 0$, while for $z \gtrsim 1$ the matter distribution both inside and outside of haloes shapes the MPS suppression. Hence, future observations probing earlier cosmic times beyond $z \sim 1$ will be instrumental in constraining the nature of AGN feedback.</description>

      <title>Towards unveiling the large-scale nature of gravity with the wavelet scattering transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first application of the Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST) in order to constrain the nature of gravity using the three-dimensional (3D) large-scale structure of the universe. Utilizing the Quijote-MG N-body simulations, we can reliably model the 3D matter overdensity field for the f(R) Hu-Sawicki modified gravity (MG) model down to $k_{\rm max}=0.5$ h/Mpc. Combining these simulations with the Quijote $\nu$CDM collection, we then conduct a Fisher forecast of the marginalized constraints obtained on gravity using the WST coefficients and the matter power spectrum at redshift z=0. Our results demonstrate that the WST substantially improves upon the 1$\sigma$ error obtained on the parameter that captures deviations from standard General Relativity (GR), yielding a tenfold improvement compared to the corresponding matter power spectrum result. At the same time, the WST also enhances the precision on the $\Lambda$CDM parameters and the sum of neutrino masses, by factors of 1.2-3.4 compared to the matter power spectrum, respectively. Despite the overall reduction in the WST performance when we focus on larger scales, it still provides a relatively $4.5\times$ tighter 1$\sigma$ error for the MG parameter at $k_{\rm max}=0.2$ h/Mpc, highlighting its great sensitivity to the underlying gravity theory. This first proof-of-concept study reaffirms the constraining properties of the WST technique and paves the way for exciting future applications in order to perform precise large-scale tests of gravity with the new generation of cutting-edge cosmological data.</description>

      <title>Constraining modified gravity scenarios with the 6dFGS and SDSS galaxy peculiar velocity datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detailed nature of dark energy remains a mystery, leaving the possibility that its effects might be explained by changes to the laws of gravity on large scales. The peculiar velocities of galaxies directly trace the strength of gravity on cosmic scales and provide a means to further constrain such models. We generate constraints on different scenarios of gravitational physics by measuring peculiar velocity and galaxy clustering two-point correlations, using redshifts and distances from the 6-degree Field Galaxy Survey and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Peculiar Velocity samples, and fitting them against models characteristic of different cosmologies. Our best-fitting results are all found to be in statistical agreement with General Relativity, in which context we measure the low-redshift growth of structure to be $f\sigma_8 = 0.329^{+0.081}_{-0.083}$, consistent with the prediction of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. We also fit the modified gravity scenarios of Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (nDGP) and a Hu-Sawicki model of $f(R)$ gravity, finding the $2\sigma$ limit of their characteristic parameters to be $r_cH_0/c&gt;6.987$ and $-\log_{10}(|f_{R0}|)&gt;4.703$, respectively. These constraints are comparable to other literature values, though it should be noted that they are significantly affected by the prior adopted for their characteristic parameters. When applied to much larger upcoming peculiar velocity surveys such as DESI, this method will place rapidly-improving constraints on modified gravity models of cosmic expansion and growth.</description>

      <title>HII galaxies as standard candles: evolutionary corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade the relation between the Balmer-line luminosity of HII galaxies and the velocity width of the emission lines, the L - {\sigma} relation, has been painstakingly calibrated as a cosmological distance indicator with seemingly spectacular results: the Hubble constant and the energy-density of dark energy obtained using the L-{\sigma} indicator agree remarkably well with the values from canonical indicators. Since most of the luminosity of these young compact starburst galaxies is emitted by a few narrow emission-lines, they can be observed with good precision up redshifts z ~ 7 with JWST, making the L - {\sigma} indicator a potentially unique cosmological probe. However, the precision of the method remains too low to effectively constrain the relevant cosmological parameters, notably the equation of state of dark energy. The scatter of the L - {\sigma} relation is significantly larger than the random observational errors so we do not have a good handle on the systematics of the method. In a previous paper we posited that since the ionizing radiation of these young galaxies fades rapidly over time-scales of only a few million years, age differences could be the main underlying cause of the scatter. In this paper we explore several different ways to explain the scatter of the correlation, but without success. We show that the majority of HII galaxies are powered by multiple starbursts of slightly different ages, and therefore that the equivalent widths are not reliable chronometers to correct the luminosities for evolution. Thus, it is not likely that the accuracy of the L - {\sigma} distance indicator can be improved in the near future. Since we do not fully understand neither the systematics nor the underlying physics of the L - {\sigma} relation, using large samples of distant HII galaxies may or may not improve the accuracy of the method.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from a curvature-induced phase transition of a Higgs-portal dark matter sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of interactions between dark matter and the Higgs field opens an exciting connection between cosmology and particle physics, since such scenarios can impact the features of dark matter as well as interfering with the spontaneous breaking of the electroweak symmetry. Furthermore, such Higgs-portal models of dark matter should be suitably harmonised with the various epochs of the universe and the phenomenological constraints imposed by collider experiments. At the same time, the prospect of a stochastic gravitational wave background offers a promising new window into the primordial universe, which can complement the insights gained from accelerators. In this study, we examined whether gravitational waves can be generated from a curvature-induced phase transition of a non-minimally coupled dark scalar field with a portal coupling to the Higgs field. The main requirement is that the phase transition is of first order, which can be achieved through the introduction of a cubic term on the scalar potential and the sign change of the curvature scalar. This mechanism was investigated in the context of a dynamical spacetime during the transition from inflation to kination, while also considering the possibility for inducing electroweak symmetry breaking in this manner for a sufficiently low reheating temperature when the Higgs-portal coupling is extremely weak. We considered a large range of inflationary scales and both cases of positive and negative values for the non-minimal coupling, while taking into account the bound imposed by Big Bang Nucleosythesis. The resulting gravitational wave amplitudes are boosted by kination and thus constrain the parameter space of the couplings significantly. Even though the spectra lie at high frequencies for the standard high inflationary scales, there are combinations of parameter space where they could be probed with future experiments.</description>

      <title>Cosmological implications of the Gaia Milky Way declining rotation curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the existence of dark matter has been widely acknowledged in the cosmology community, it is as yet unknown in nature, despite decades of research, which questions its very existence. This never-ending search for dark matter leads to consider alternatives. Since increasing the enclosed mass is the only way to explain the flat appearance of galaxies rotation curves in a Newtonian framework, the MOND theory proposed to modify Newton's dynamics when the acceleration is around or below a threshold value, a_0. Observed rotation curves, generally flat at large distances, are then usually well reproduced by MOND with a_0 ~ 1.2 10^{-10} m/s^2. However, the recent Gaia evidence of a decline in the Milky Way rotation curve is a distinct behavior. Therefore, we examine whether LCDM and MOND can accommodate the Gaia declining rotation curve of the Milky Way. We first depict a standard model to describe the Milky Way's baryonic components. Secondly, we show that a NFW model is able to fit the decline, assuming a scale radius R_s of the order of 4 kpc. In a third step, we show that the usual MOND paradigm is not able to reproduce the declining part for a standard baryonic model. Finally, we examine whether the MOND theory can accommodate the declining part of the rotation curve when relaxing the characteristics of the baryonic components. To do so we use a MCMC method on the characteristics of the stellar and the HI disk, including their mass. We found that the stellar disk should be massive, of the order of 10^{11} M_\odot. The HI disk mass is capped at nearly 1.8 10^{11} M_\odot but could also be negligible. Finally, a_0 is consistent with 0, with an upper limit of 0.53 10^{-10} m/s^{2} (95\%), a value much lower than the above mentioned value usually advocated to explain standard flat rotation curves in MOND theory.</description>

      <title>A comparative analysis of dissipation coefficients in warm inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the warm inflation scenario, the early cosmic acceleration is driven by the inflaton coupled to thermal fields, decaying into radiation and leaving a hot universe populated by relativistic particles after the end of inflation. The interaction is usually modeled by a dissipation coefficient $\Upsilon$ that contains the microphysics of the model. In this work, we adopt a well-motivated potential $V(\phi)=\frac{\lambda}{4}\phi^4$ and constrain a variety of $\Upsilon$ parameterizations by using updated Cosmic Microwave Background data from the \textit{Planck} and \textit{BICEP/Keck Array} collaborations. We also use a Bayesian statistical criterion to compare the observational viability of these models. Our results show a significant improvement in the constraints over past results reported in the literature and also that some of these warm inflation models can be competitive compared to Starobinsky inflation.</description>

      <title>Hybrid summary statistics: neural weak lensing inference beyond the power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In inference problems, we often have domain knowledge which allows us to define summary statistics that capture most of the information content in a dataset. In this paper, we present a hybrid approach, where such physics-based summaries are augmented by a set of compressed neural summary statistics that are optimised to extract the extra information that is not captured by the predefined summaries. The resulting statistics are very powerful inputs to simulation-based or implicit inference of model parameters. We apply this generalisation of Information Maximising Neural Networks (IMNNs) to parameter constraints from tomographic weak gravitational lensing convergence maps to find summary statistics that are explicitly optimised to complement angular power spectrum estimates. We study several dark matter simulation resolutions in low- and high-noise regimes. We show that i) the information-update formalism extracts at least $3\times$ and up to $8\times$ as much information as the angular power spectrum in all noise regimes, ii) the network summaries are highly complementary to existing 2-point summaries, and iii) our formalism allows for networks with smaller, physically-informed architectures to match much larger regression networks with far fewer simulations needed to obtain asymptotically optimal inference.</description>

      <title>Do neutrinos bend? Consequences of an ultralight gauge field as dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An ultralight gauge boson could address the missing cosmic dark matter, with its transverse modes contributing to a relevant component of the galactic halo today. We show that, in the presence of a coupling between the gauge boson and neutrinos, these transverse modes affect the propagation of neutrinos in the galactic core. Neutrinos emitted from galactic or extra-galactic supernovae could be delayed by $\delta t = \left(10^{-8}\textrm{--}10^1\right)$\,s for the gauge boson masses $m_{A'} = \left(10^{-23}\textrm{--}10^{-19}\right)$\,eV and the coupling with the neutrino $g= 10^{-27}\textrm{--}10^{-20}$. While we do not focus on a specific formation mechanism for the gauge boson as the dark matter in the early Universe, we comment on some possible realizations. We discuss model-dependent current bounds on the gauge coupling from fifth-force experiments, as well as future explorations involving supernovae neutrinos.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we present new constraints on velocity-independent cross section of keV-scale mass annihilating Dark Matter particles obtained with SRG/ART-XC after 4 full-sky surveys. These constraints are derived from observations of the Milky Way Halo, 33 Local Group spheroidal dwarf (dSph) galaxies and separately for the dSph galaxy Ursa Major III/UNIONS 1. The constraints from the Milky Way Halo are the strongest among others and among all available in literature for this class of Dark Matter models with particle masses from 4 to 15 keV.</description>

      <title>Establishing HI mass v.s. stellar mass and halo mass scaling relations using an abundance matching method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We combined data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA Survey (ALFALFA) to establish the HI mass vs. stellar mass and halo mass scaling relations using an abundance matching method that is free of the Malmquist bias. To enable abundance matching, a cross-match between the SDSS DR7 galaxy group sample and the ALFALFA HI sources provides a catalog of 16,520 HI-galaxy pairs within 14,270 galaxy groups (halos). By applying the observational completeness reductions for both optical and HI observations, we used the remaining 8,180 ALFALFA matched sources to construct the model constraints. Taking into account the dependence of HI mass on both the galaxy and group properties, we establish two sets of scaling relations: one with a combination of stellar mass, $({g-r})$ color and halo mass, and the other with stellar mass, specific star-formation rate ($\rm sSFR$), and halo mass. We demonstrate that our models can reproduce the HI mass component as both a stellar and halo mass. Additional tests showed that the conditional HI mass distributions as a function of the cosmic web type and the satellite fractions were well recovered.</description>

      <title>Testing Lyman Alpha Emitters and Lyman-Break Galaxies as Tracers of Large-Scale Structures at High Redshifts</title>

Abstract: We test whether Lyman alpha emitters (LAEs) and Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) can be good tracers of high-z large-scale structures, using the Horizon Run 5 cosmological hydrodynamical simulation. We identify LAEs using the Ly{\alpha} emission line luminosity and its equivalent width, and LBGs using the broad-band magnitudes at z~2.4, 3.1, and 4.5. We first compare the spatial distributions of LAEs, LBGs, all galaxies, and dark matter around the filamentary structures defined by dark matter. The comparison shows that both LAEs and LBGs are more concentrated toward the dark matter filaments than dark matter. We also find an empirical fitting formula for the vertical density profile of filaments as a binomial power-law relation of the distance to the filaments. We then compare the spatial distributions of the samples around the filaments defined by themselves. LAEs and LBGs are again more concentrated toward their filaments than dark matter. We also find the overall consistency between filamentary structures defined by LAEs, LBGs, and dark matter, with the median spatial offsets that are smaller than the mean separation of the sample. These results support the idea that the LAEs and LBGs could be good tracers of large-scale structures of dark matter at high redshifts.</description>

      <title>Validating the clustering predictions of empirical models with the FLAMINGO simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Mock galaxy catalogues are essential for correctly interpreting current and future generations of galaxy surveys. Despite their significance in galaxy formation and cosmology, little to no work has been done to validate the predictions of these mocks for high-order clustering statistics.
  Aims. We compare the predicting power of the latest generation of empirical models used in the creation of mock galaxy catalogues: a 13-parameter Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) and an extension of the SubHalo Abundance Matching technique (SHAMe).
  Methods. We build GalaxyEmu-Planck, an emulator that makes precise predictions for the two-point correlation function, galaxy-galaxy lensing (restricted to distances greater than 1 $h^{-1} {\rm Mpc}$ to avoid baryonic effects), and other high-order statistics resulting from the evaluation of SHAMe and HOD models.
  Results. We evaluate the precision of GalaxyEmu-Planck using two galaxy samples extracted from the FLAMINGO hydrodynamical simulation that mimic the properties of DESI-BGS and BOSS galaxies, finding that the emulator reproduces all the predicted statistics precisely. The HOD showed comparable performance when fitting galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing. In contrast, the SHAMe model showed better predictions for higher-order statistics, especially regarding the galaxy assembly bias. We also tested the performance of the models after removing some of their extensions, finding that we can withdraw two of the HOD parameters without a loss of performance.
  Conclusions. The results of this paper validate the current generation of empirical models as a way to reproduce galaxy clustering, galaxy-galaxy lensing and other high-order statistics. The excellent performance of the SHAMe model with a small number of free parameters suggests that it is a valid method to extract cosmological constraints from galaxy clustering.</description>

      <title>Transition dynamics in the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model: Implications for bound cosmic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05908v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the predictions of $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM, a novel framework suggesting a rapid anti-de Sitter (AdS) to de Sitter (dS) vacua transition in the late Universe, on bound cosmic structures. In its simplest version, the cosmological constant, $\Lambda_{\rm s}$, abruptly switches sign from negative to positive, attaining its present-day value at a redshift of ${z_\dagger\sim 2}$. The $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model emerges as a promising solution to major cosmological tensions, particularly the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions, as well as other less definite tensions. A key aspect of our investigation is examining the impact of the abrupt $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model on the formation and evolution of bound cosmic structures. We identify three primary influences: (i) the negative cosmological constant (AdS) phase for $z &gt; z_\dagger$, (ii) the abrupt transition marked by a type II (sudden) singularity, leading to an abrupt increase in the universe's expansion rate at $z=z_\dagger$, and (iii) an increased expansion rate in the late universe under a positive cosmological constant for $z &lt; z_\dagger$, compared to $\Lambda$CDM. Utilizing the spherical collapse model, we investigate the non-linear evolution of bound cosmic structures within the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM framework. We find that the virialization process of cosmic structures, and consequently their matter overdensity, varies depending on whether the AdS-dS transition precedes or follows the turnaround. Specifically, structures virialize with either increased or reduced matter overdensity compared to the Planck-$\Lambda$CDM model, contingent on the timing of the transition. Additionally, our results demonstrate that the sudden singularity does not result in the dissociation of bound systems. Despite its profound nature, the singularity exerts only relatively weak effects on such systems, thereby reinforcing the model's viability in this context.</description>

      <title>Breaking the mass-sheet degeneracy in strong lensing mass modeling with weak lensing observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hubble constant ($H_0$), a crucial parameter in cosmology, quantifies the expansion rate of the universe so its precise measurement is important to understand the fundamental dynamics of our evolving universe. One of the major limitations of measuring $H_0$ using time-delay cosmography is the presence of the mass-sheet degeneracy (MSD) in the lens mass modeling. We propose and quantitatively assess the use of galaxy-galaxy shear measurements to break the MSD in the strong lensing mass modeling. We use stacked galaxy-galaxy lensing profiles and corresponding covariance matrices from Huang et al. (2022) to constrain the MSD in lens mass modeling with a highly flexible mass profile. Our analyses show that if ideally all galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements from the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey can be used to constrain the MSD, we can achieve $\sim 10\%$ precision on the MSD constraint. We forecast that galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements from LSST-like surveys can in general constrain the MSD with $\sim 1-3\%$ precision. Furthermore, if we push weak lensing measurements to a lower angular scale of $\sim 0.04$ $\rm Mpc$, a survey like LSST can provide $\sim 1\%$ precision on the MSD constraint, enabling a measurement of $H_0$ at the $1\%$ level. We demonstrate that galaxy-galaxy weak lensing can robustly constrain the MSD independent of stellar kinematics of the deflector, with wide-field survey data alone.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02801v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide evidence for a correspondence between the formation of black holes and the stability of circular null geodesics around the collapsing perturbation. We first show that the critical threshold of the compaction function to form a black hole in radiation is well approximated by the critical threshold for the appearance of the first unstable circular orbit in a spherically symmetric background. We also show that the critical exponent in the scaling law of the primordial black hole mass close to the threshold is set by the inverse of the Lyapunov coefficient of the unstable orbits when a self-similar stage is developed close to criticality.</description>

      <title>Characterization of contaminants in the Lyman-alpha forest auto-correlation with DESI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03003v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Baryon Acoustic Oscillations can be measured with sub-percent precision above redshift two with the Lyman-alpha forest auto-correlation and its cross-correlation with quasar positions. This is one of the key goals of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) which started its main survey in May 2021. We present in this paper a study of the contaminants to the lyman-alpha forest which are mainly caused by correlated signals introduced by the spectroscopic data processing pipeline as well as astrophysical contaminants due to foreground absorption in the intergalactic medium. Notably, an excess signal caused by the sky background subtraction noise is present in the lyman-alpha auto-correlation in the first line-of-sight separation bin. We use synthetic data to isolate this contribution, we also characterize the effect of spectro-photometric calibration noise, and propose a simple model to account for both effects in the analysis of the lyman-alpha forest. We then measure the auto-correlation of the quasar flux transmission fraction of low redshift quasars, where there is no lyman-alpha forest absorption but only its contaminants. We demonstrate that we can interpret the data with a two-component model: data processing noise and triply ionized Silicon and Carbon auto-correlations. This result can be used to improve the modeling of the lyman-alpha auto-correlation function measured with DESI.</description>

      <title>Constraints from Fermi observations of Long Gamma-Ray Bursts on cosmological parameters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14357v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we compile a \emph{Fermi} sample of the \emph{long} GRB observations from 15 years of GBM catalogue with identified redshift, in which the GOLD sample contains 123 long GRBs at $z\le5.6$ and the FULL sample contains 151 long GRBs with redshifts at $z\le8.2$. The Amati relation (the $E_{\rm p,i}$-$E_{\rm iso}$ correlation) are calibrated at $z&lt;1.4$ by a Gaussian Process from the latest observational Hubble data (OHD) with the cosmic chronometers method so that GRBs at high-redshift $z\ge1.4$ can be used to constrain cosmological models via the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. From the cosmology-independent GRBs with the GOLD sample at $z\ge1.4$ and the Pantheon+ sample of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) at $0.01&lt;z\leq2.3$, we obtain $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.354\pm0.018, H_0 = 73.05\pm0.2\,\rm{km/s/Mpc}$ for the flat $\Lambda$CDM model; $w_0 = -1.22^{+0.18}_{-0.15}$ for the flat $w$CDM model; and $w_{a} = -1.12^{+0.45}_{-0.83}$ for the flat Chevallier-Polarski-Linder model at the 1$\sigma$ confidence level. Our results with the GOLD and FULL sample are almost identical, which are more stringent than the previous results with GRBs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse theories that do not have a de Sitter vacuum and cannot lead to slow-roll quintessence, but which nevertheless support a transient era of accelerated cosmological expansion due to interactions between a scalar $\phi$ and either a hidden sector thermal bath, which evolves as Dark Radiation, or an extremely-light component of Dark Matter. We show that simple models can explain the present-day Dark Energy of the Universe consistently with current observations. This is possible both when $\phi$'s potential has a hilltop form and when it has a steep exponential run-away, as might naturally arise from string theory. We also discuss a related theory of multi-field quintessence, in which $\phi$ is coupled to a sector that sources a subdominant component of Dark Energy, which overcomes many of the challenges of slow-roll quintessence.</description>

      <title>Applying Simulation-Based Inference to Spectral and Spatial Information from the Galactic Center Gamma-Ray Excess</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The two most favored explanations of the Fermi Galactic Center gamma-ray excess (GCE) are millisecond pulsars and self annihilation of the smooth dark matter halo of the galaxy. In order to distinguish between these possibilities, we would like to optimally use all information in the available data, including photon direction and energy information. To date, analyses of the GCE have generally treated directional and energy information separately, or have ignored one or the other completely. Here, we develop a method for analyzing the GCE that relies on simulation-based inference with neural posterior models to jointly analyze photon directional and spectral information while correctly accounting for the spatial and energy resolution of the telescope, here assumed to be the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). Our results also have implications for analyses of the diffuse gamma-ray background, which we discuss.</description>

      <title>The SAGA Survey. III. A Census of 101 Satellite Systems around Milky Way-mass Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the third Data Release (DR3) of the Satellites Around Galactic Analogs (SAGA) Survey, a spectroscopic survey characterizing satellite galaxies around Milky Way (MW)-mass galaxies. The SAGA Survey DR3 includes 378 satellites identified across 101 MW-mass systems in the distance range 25-40.75 Mpc, and an accompanying redshift catalog of background galaxies (including about 46,000 taken by SAGA) in the SAGA footprint of 84.7 sq. deg. The number of confirmed satellites per system ranges from zero to 13, in the stellar mass range 10^6 to 10^10 solar masses. Based on a detailed completeness model, this sample accounts for 94% of the true satellite population down to a stellar mass of 10^7.5 solar masses. We find that the mass of the most massive satellite in SAGA systems is the strongest predictor of satellite abundance; one-third of the SAGA systems contain LMC-mass satellites, and they tend to have more satellites than the MW. The SAGA satellite radial distribution is less concentrated than the MW, and the SAGA quenched fraction below 10^8.5 solar masses is lower than the MW, but in both cases, the MW is within 1 sigma of SAGA system-to-system scatter. SAGA satellites do not exhibit a clear corotating signal as has been suggested in the MW/M31 satellite systems. Although the MW differs in many respects from the typical SAGA system, these differences can be reconciled if the MW is an older, slightly less massive host with a recently accreted LMC/SMC system.</description>

      <title>The SAGA Survey. IV. The Star Formation Properties of 101 Satellite Systems around Milky Way-mass Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the star-forming properties of 378 satellite galaxies around 101 Milky Way analogs in the Satellites Around Galactic Analogs (SAGA) Survey, focusing on the environmental processes that suppress or quench star formation. In the SAGA stellar mass range of 10^6 to 10^10 solar masses, we present quenched fractions, star-forming rates, gas-phase metallicities, and gas content. The fraction of SAGA satellites that are quenched increases with decreasing stellar mass and shows significant system-to-system scatter. SAGA satellite quenched fractions are highest in the central 100 kpc of their hosts and decline out to the virial radius. Splitting by specific star formation rate (sSFR), the least star-forming satellite quartile follows the radial trend of the quenched population. The median sSFR of star-forming satellites increases with decreasing stellar mass and is roughly constant with projected radius. Star-forming SAGA satellites are consistent with the star formation rate--stellar mass relationship determined in the Local Volume, while the median gas-phase metallicity is higher and median HI gas mass is lower at all stellar masses. We investigate the dependence of the satellite quenched fraction on host properties. Quenched fractions are higher in systems with larger host halo mass, but this trend is only seen in the inner 100 kpc; we do not see significant trends with host color or star formation rate. Our results suggest that lower mass satellites and satellites inside 100 kpc are more efficiently quenched in a Milky Way-like environment, with these processes acting sufficiently slowly to preserve a population of star-forming satellites at all stellar masses and projected radii.</description>

      <title>Gravothermal Catastrophe in Resonant Self-interacting Dark Matter Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) model featuring a velocity-dependent cross section with an order-of-magnitude resonant enhancement of the cross section at $\sim 16\,{\rm km}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$. To understand the implications for the structure of dark matter halos, we perform N-body simulations of isolated dark matter halos of mass $\sim 10^8\,{\rm M}_\odot$, a halo mass selected to have a maximum response to the resonance. We track the core formation and the gravothermal collapse phases of the dark matter halo in this model and compare the halo evolving with the resonant cross section with halos evolving with velocity-independent cross sections. We show that dark matter halo evolution with the resonant cross section exhibits a deviation from universality that characterizes halo evolution with velocity-independent cross sections. The halo evolving under the influence of the resonance reaches a lower minimum central density during core formation. It subsequently takes about $20\%$ longer to reach its initial central density during the collapse phase. These results motivate a more detailed exploration of halo evolution in models with pronounced resonances.</description>

Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTA) hunt for gravitational waves (GW) by searching for the correlations that GWs induce in the time-of-arrival residuals from different pulsars. If the GW sources are of astrophysical origin, then they are located at discrete points on the sky. However, PTA data are often modeled, and subsequently analyzed, via a "standard Gaussian ensemble". That ensemble is obtained in the limit of an infinite density of vanishingly weak, Poisson-distributed sources. In this paper, we move away from that ensemble, to study the effects of two types of "source anisotropy". The first (a), which is often called "shot noise", arises because there are $N$ discrete GW sources at specific sky locations. The second (b) arises because the GW source positions are not a Poisson process, for example, because galaxy locations are clustered. Here, we quantify the impact of (a) and (b) on the mean and variance of the pulsar-averaged Hellings and Downs correlation. For conventional PTA sources, we show that the effects of shot noise (a) are much larger than the effects of clustering (b).</description>

Abstract: One of the key predictions of the standard inflationary paradigm is the quantum mechanical generation of the transverse and traceless tensor fluctuations due to the rapid accelerated expansion of space, which later constitute a stochastic background of primordial gravitational waves (GWs). The amplitude of the (nearly) scale-invariant inflationary tensor power spectrum at large scales provides us with crucial information about the energy scale of inflation in the case of the minimal inflaton coupling to gravity. Furthermore, the spectral energy density, $\Omega_{_{\rm GW}}(f)$, of the GWs at sufficiently small scales (or, large frequencies $f$) serves as an important observational probe of post-inflationary primordial dynamics. In fact, the small-scale spectral tilt, $n_{_{\rm GW}} = \frac{{\rm d}\log{\Omega_{_{\rm GW}}}}{{\rm d}\log{f}}$, of the spectral energy density of GWs is sensitive to the (unknown) post-inflationary equation of state (EoS), $w$, of the universe; with a softer EoS ($w &lt; 1/3$) leading to a red tilt: $n_{_{\rm GW}} &lt; 0$, while a stiffer EoS ($w &gt; 1/3$) resulting in a blue tilt: $n_{_{\rm GW}} &gt; 0$. The post-inflationary dynamics, however, is generically expected to be quite complex, potentially involving a number of distinct phases. Hence, in this work, we discuss the possibility of multiple sharp transitions, namely $w_1 \to w_2 \to w_3 \to ... \to w_n$, in the EoS of the post-inflationary universe and compute the corresponding spectral energy density of the inflationary GWs. We explicitly determine the region of the parameter space $\lbrace{ w_1, \, w_2, \, w_3, ..., w_n\rbrace}$ which leads to a potentially detectable signal in the upcoming GW detectors, without violating the current constraints.</description>
