      <title>Holographic Krylov Complexity for Conformal Quiver Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate holographic Krylov complexity in fully top-down AdS$_3$ and AdS$_2$ supergravity backgrounds dual to two-dimensional linear-quiver SCFTs and one-dimensional conformal quantum mechanics. In these geometries, the warp factors, dilaton and other fields depend non-trivially on the 'quiver coordinate' (denoted by $\eta$ in this paper). This $\eta$-coordinate encodes the color and flavor data of the dual theories. As a consequence, a massive probe following a holographic geodesic necessarily moves simultaneously in the radial AdS direction and along the 'quiver direction'. This produces new contributions to the proper momentum and hence to the rate of Krylov complexity growth, which is absent in bottom-up AdS models. We show that the $\eta$-motion is generically damped, with a time-scale governed by the UV cutoff of the geodesic problem, and modifies the early-time evolution of complexity in a quiver-dependent way. At late times, the $\eta$-dynamics freezes and the growth becomes universal, matching pure Poincare AdS predictions. Studying Abelian and non-Abelian T-dual backgrounds of AdS$_3\times S^3\times T^4$, quivers with localized flavor groups, and quivers with smeared flavor groups, we quantify how quiver parameters shape the operator-spreading dynamics. Our results provide a systematic characterization of Krylov complexity in top-down AdS$_3$/AdS$_2$ duals and reveal a holographic mechanism through which complexity probes both ultraviolet quiver structure and emergent infrared universality.</description>

      <title>Calabi-Yau Threefolds from Vex Triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the birational geometry (i.e., K\"ahler moduli space) of Calabi--Yau (CY) threefold hypersurfaces in toric varieties arising from four-dimensional reflexive polytopes. In particular, it has been observed that the birational classes of these geometries are not exhausted by toric hypersurfaces arising from fine, regular, star triangulations (FRSTs). We begin by introducing a classification problem: enumeration of birational classes of toric varieties, which is equivalent to enumeration of certain triangulations/fans. We consider this problem from the complementary perspectives of triangulation theory and toric geometry, reviewing both theories in detail; this culminates in an explanation of how to generate all fine regular triangulations of a vector configuration (i.e., fine regular simplicial fans). We then apply this theory to the Kreuzer--Skarke (KS) database, where we encounter both FRSTs and vex triangulations. We study the non-weak-Fano toric varieties arising from vex triangulations, along with their CY hypersurfaces. In particular, we show that all fine regular triangulations of a fixed 4D reflexive polytope give rise to smooth birational CY hypersurfaces, extending Batyrev's result from FRSTs to vex triangulations. We exhaustively enumerate all $24,023,940$ fine regular triangulations in the KS database with $h^{1,1}\leq 7$, of which over $70\%$ are vex triangulations, and provide an upper bound of $10^{979}$ for fine regular triangulations in the entire KS database. We conclude that vex triangulations of four-dimensional reflexive polytopes give rise to a large number of smooth Calabi--Yau threefolds and importantly provide toric descriptions for novel regions in the K\"ahler moduli space.</description>

      <title>Flat Holography &amp; Holographic Renormalization: Scalar Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We adapt the Hamilton-Jacobi method of holographic renormalization to scalar field theories in Minkowski spacetime with scattering boundary conditions. The approach yields a flat-space holographic dictionary in which the expectation value of a dual operator is given by the renormalized canonical momentum. The source of the operator is imposed as a Dirichlet condition in a radial timelike foliation of the bulk theory and corresponds to the scattering data appearing in the Arefeva-Faddeev-Slavnov generating functional. We initiate a study of massive scalars and interacting fields within this formalism and we comment on extensions to different bulk theories and backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Odd-dimensional Extremal Rotating Black Holes with All Equal Angular Momenta and Small Electric Charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Einstein-Maxwell gravity in diverse dimensions and construct the small charge perturbation to the extremal rotating black holes with all equal angular momenta in odd $D=2n+1$ dimensions. Exact solutions exist at the next-to-leading order (NLO), and they are analytic, allowing us to obtain the charge corrections to thermodynamic quantities at this order. Irrational exponents in the near-horizon power-series expansion emerge at the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO). We show, by numerical computation, that these horizon geometries can indeed be integrated out to asymptotic Minkowski spacetime, thereby proving the existence of the unusual singular horizon behavior of the extremal charged rotating black holes.</description>

      <title>Holographic interpolations of defect CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new class of holographic dualities between certain, generically non supersymmetric, defect conformal field theories (dCFTs) and their gravity duals. Our construction interpolates between the 1/2-BPS D3-D3 system and its field theory dual at one end, and the holographic duality presented in arXiv: 2506.14505 at the other. On the gravity side, the defect is realised by a novel D5 probe brane embedded in the $AdS_5\times S^5$ geometry. The symmetry of the induced on the D5 brane metric is $AdS_3\times S^1\times S^2$. At a certain limit the D5 brane becomes singular and resembles the D3-D3 system. Consistency requires the presence of two D7 branes on which the D5 brane terminates. The existence of boundaries induces a gauge anomaly for the D5 brane which is cancelled through anomaly inflow from the D7 branes. The full system of the D5 and D7 branes is, thus, anomaly free. Also it does not have any tachyonic instabilities for a certain range of its parameters. On the field theory side, we determined the classical solution of the ${\cal N}=4$ SYM equations of motion which we conjecture to describe the defect dual to the D5-D7 system and comment on the identification of the parameters appearing at the two sides of the duality.</description>

      <title>Cluster algebras for cosmological correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the cluster algebras for symbol letters or singularities of cosmological correlators in a conformally coupled scalar field theory. We show that the symbol letters for tree-level n-site ladder cosmological correlators are governed by A_{2(n-1)} cluster algebras. Additionally, we demonstrate that the symbol letters for one-loop bubble cosmological correlator are an union of two A_3 cluster algebras. The algebras relations of letters will provide an important tool to bootstrap analytic cosmological correlators.</description>

      <title>Cosmology meets cluster algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we explore the mathematical properties of wavefunction coefficients in power-law FRW cosmologies, and establish their relation to cluster algebras. We focus on the particular contributions to the wavefunction coefficient coming from the path Feynman graphs, and show that the singularities of the wavefunction associated with a $n$-site path graph are related to the $\mathcal{X}$-coordinates of the cluster algebra $A_{2n-2}$. To establish this relation, we consider the symbol of the de Sitter wavefunction coefficients and show that the letters appearing there are the region variables associated to tubings on the path graph. These variables can be rewritten as simplicial coordinates of the moduli space $\mathcal{M}_{0,2n+1}$ and therefore identified with the $\mathcal{X}$-coordinates of type-$A_{2n-2}$ cluster algebras. We use this result to compute the wavefunction coefficients in terms of cluster functions.</description>

      <title>Quantizing non-projectable Ho\v{r}ava gravity with Lagrangian path integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate the quantum version of non-projectable Ho\v{r}ava gravity as a Lagrangian theory with a path integral in the configuration space with an ultra-local in time, but non-local in space, field-dependent measure. Using auxiliary fields, we cast the measure into a local form satisfying several bosonic and fermionic symmetries. We perform an explicit one-loop computation in the theory in $(2+1)$ dimensions, using for the case study the divergent part of the action on a background with non-trivial shift vector; the background spatial metric is taken to be flat and the background lapse function is set to 1. No truncations are assumed at the level of perturbations, for which we develop a diagrammatic technique and a version of the heat-kernel method. We isolate dangerous linear-in-frequency divergences in the two-point function of the shift, which can lead to spatial non-localities, and explicitly verify their cancellation. This leaves a fully local expression for the divergent part of the quadratic effective action, from which we extract the beta functions for the Newton constant and the essential coupling $\lambda$ in the kinetic term of the metric. We formulate the questions that need to be addressed to prove perturbative renormalizability of the non-projectable Ho\v{r}ava gravity.</description>

      <title>Exact formula for geometric quantum complexity of cosmological perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nielsen's geometric approach offers a powerful framework for quantifying the complexity of unitary transformations. In this formulation, complexity is defined as the length of the minimal geodesic in a suitably constructed geometric space associated with the Lie group of relevant operators. Despite its conceptual appeal, determining geodesic distances on Lie group manifolds is generally challenging, and existing treatments often rely on perturbative expansions in the structure constants. In this work, we circumvent these limitations by employing a finite-dimensional matrix representation of the generators, which enables an exact computation of the geodesic distance and hence a precise determination of the complexity. We focus on the $\mathfrak{su}(1,1)$ Lie algebra, relevant for quantum scalar fields evolving on homogeneous and isotropic cosmological backgrounds. The resulting expression for the complexity is applied to de Sitter spacetime as well as to asymptotically static cosmological models undergoing contraction or expansion.</description>

      <title>Pole-skipping without master variable and holographic superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pole-skipping is a universal property of Green's functions at strong coupling found by the AdS/CFT duality. There is a conventional formalism of the pole-skipping, but it relies on the existence of a "master variable." Namely, it is applicable to a system with a single field. We propose an alternative formalism that does not rely on a master variable. As an example, we study the pole-skipping of holographic superfluids. A "hydrodynamic" pole such as the diffusion pole is usually regarded as a pole-skipping point. But we point out that not all hydrodynamic poles are pole-skipping points.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A dispersion integral representation of the Heisenberg-Euler QED effective lagrangian is derived, with Faddeev's quantum dilogarithm as a generalized Borel kernel. The nonperturbative imaginary part of the effective lagrangian is expressed as the quantum dilogarithm, while the real part has the form of a dispersion integral involving both the quantum dilogarithm and its modular dual, a manifestation of electromagnetic duality. The Heisenberg-Euler effective lagrangian generates all one-loop QED scattering amplitudes in a constant external field, with the Lorentz invariants of the constant background electromagnetic field playing the role of the Mandelstam variables in conventional QED dispersion theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the analytic structure of thermal spectral function of holographic CFTs, synthesizing recent developments into a set of observations about its asymptotics. Specifically, for a class of scalar primaries with integral dimension, we demonstrate factorization of the exact spectral function into a polynomial piece, which captures the vacuum dynamics, and a non-perturbative piece, which controls its asymptotics. Using exact WKB techniques, we derive a transseries expression for the latter. We use this information to deduce the singular loci of a spatially averaged thermofield double correlator in the complex time plane. Such singularities have been argued to encode information regarding the black hole singularity in the dual spacetime. Our results give a refinement of these statements by capturing the momentum dependence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ Chern--Simons matter theories describing the R-twisted $S^1$-reduction of Argyres--Douglas theories of $(A_{M-1},A_{N-1})$ type with $\text{gcd}(M,N)=1$, via a recently-proposed 4d/3d correspondence. In particular, for the $(A_2,A_{N-1})$ and $(A_3,A_{N-1})$ theories, we identify a series of Chern--Simons matter theories with monopole superpotentials consistent with an $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetry enhancement in the infrared. As a by-product, we also find a novel Nahm sum formula for the vacuum character of $(3,8)$ $W_3$ minimal model, from which we find another Chern--Simons matter theory describing the R-twisted $S^1$-reduction of the $(A_2,A_4)$ theory.</description>

      <title>Confinement by Monopole Loops in Inhomogeneous Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a generalized Polyakov mechanism can lead to confinement at weak coupling in $3+1$ dimensions when the theory is placed in a non-trivial, spatially varying magnetic field background. Depending on the magnitude of the field and the length scale of its spatial variation, the "dual" Schwinger mechanism for monopole-antimonopole pair creation may or may not be operative. At the threshold, monopole loops in the Euclidean description develop an almost flat direction. In this regime, confinement arises in a way similar to the $2+1$ dimensional Polyakov mechanism and the monopoles and antimonopoles are effectively replaced by deconfined "bits" of a monopole loop.</description>

      <title>A Unique Bosonic Symmetry in a 4D Field-Theoretic System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the combined field-theoretic system of the four (3 + 1)-dimensional (4D) Abelian 3-form and 1-form gauge theories, we show the existence of a unique bosonic symmetry transformation that is constructed from the four infinitesimal, continuous and off-shell nilpotent symmetry transformations which exist for the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) quantized versions of the coupled (but equivalent) Lagrangian densities (that describe the present 4D field-theoretic system). The above off-shell nilpotent symmetry transformations are nothing but the BRST, co-BRST, anti-BRST and anti-co-BRST, under which, the Lagrangian densities transform to the total spacetime derivatives. The proof of the uniqueness of the above bosonic symmetry transformation operator crucially depends on the validity of all the four Curci-Ferrari (CF) type restrictions that exist on our theory. We highlight the importance of these CF-type restrictions, at various levels of our theoretical discussions, in the context of the unique bosonic transformation. We compare this observation against the backdrop of the three CF-type restrictions that appear in the requirements of the absolute anticommutativity of the specific set of nilpotent symmetries.</description>

      <title>Integrable models from 4d holomorphic BF theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how to construct 2d field theories with holomorphic integrability from defect setups in 4d holomorphic BF. In a simple example setup, we explicitly construct the 2d theory and perform an initial classical analysis. Making use of the symmetries, we are able to write down an infinite family of solutions to the equations of motion. Comparing with more typical integrable systems, we explain how 2d holomorphic integrability sits between the standard notions of integrability in one and two dimensions. These 2d theories are designed as toy models for integrable theories in three and four dimensions, many of which can be understood as partially or totally holomorphic. We comment on the implications for higher-dimensional integrability and aspects of quantization in the concluding remarks.</description>

      <title>Scalar, vector and tensor fields on $dS_3$ with arbitrary sources: harmonic analysis and antipodal maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scalar, vector and tensor spherical harmonics on three-dimensional de Sitter spacetime are defined and analyzed. Each harmonic defines two sets of asymptotic data on the two sphere in the asymptotic expansion close to both the past and the future of de Sitter spacetime. For each case, we explicit the antipodal relationship of both sets of asymptotic data between past and future infinity, which can be non-local. A procedure is defined to extract these asymptotic data in the presence of sources. This provides for each class of propagating field on de Sitter the relationship between two independent sets of data defined on the sphere in the asymptotic future with the corresponding data defined in the asymptotic past. We also provide several theorems on the decomposition of vector and tensors on de Sitter such as one proving that a large class of tensors obeying an inhomogeneous wave equation can be expressed locally in terms of a symmetric transverse traceless tensor. These results are instrumental in the description of interacting four-dimensional asymptotically flat fields at spatial infinity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the numerical solution of the mirror TBA equations for pure--Ramond-Ramond strings on $AdS_3\times S^3\times T^4$ in the tensionless limit. Our analysis uses the recently-proposed modification of the dressing factors which account for non-trivial exchange relations of the massless modes. At leading order in the tension, the dynamics is driven by the massless excitations associated to $T^4$ modes and their superpartners, but it is non-relativistic and interacting unlike what happens in the symmetric-product orbifold CFT of $T^4$.</description>

      <title>Probing the dynamics of stringy flux tubes with large $R$-charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the generalized cusp anomalous dimension, or quark-antiquark potential on the three-sphere, in the presence of a large $R$-charge $L$ and at strong coupling. Considering the insertion of a local scalar operator of charge $L$ on a cusped Wilson loop, we investigate the general solution of the dual string configuration for any value of cusp angles, paying particular attention to the different ranges of the physical parameters and obtaining a unified description that simultaneously captures the near BPS, the antiparallel lines and the large-$L$ regimes. We observe, in the limit of small separation between the lines, a non-analytic change in the behavior of the cusp anomaly at a critical value of $L$: one crosses from a region dominated by the familiar Coulomb-like singularity to a ``deconfined" situation describing the leading L\"uscher corrections at large $L$ of the generalized cusp anomalous dimension. We derive the equations for small fluctuations around the classical string solution, generalizing previous analysis of the uncharged case, and we study the behavior of the spectrum near the transition region. Finally, we speculate on the field theory origin of the transition and on its implications for the fusion of Wilson lines.</description>

      <title>Maximum mass limit of strange stars in quadratic curvature-matter coupled gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10524v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the maximum mass limit of strange stars in quadratic curvature gravity with the non-minimal matter coupling. The characteristic parameters of the quadratic curvature coupling and the non-minimal matter coupling imply the contributions from higher-order curvature terms and the coupling between matter and geometry, respectively. We explicitly demonstrate that the conservation of the energy-momentum tensor can be modified, and that in the vanishing limit of the non-minimal matter coupling, the formalism of general relativity is recovered. By deriving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations from the gravitational field equations and applying the MIT bag model equation of state, we obtain the corresponding mass-radius relationships for strange stars. Furthermore, we show that the maximum mass limit of strange stars can exceed the general relativistic counterpart. Specifically, we find that a maximum mass up to 3.11 solar mass is achievable, suggesting that the lighter companion of GW190814 could plausibly be a strange star.</description>

      <title>Electron-positron pair creation induced by multi-pulse train of electric fields: effect of randomness in time-delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the creation of electron-positron pairs (EPPs) in a sequence of alternating-sign, time-dependent electric field pulse trains by solving the quantum Vlasov equations. Specifically, we focus on Sauter-like pulse trains with random time delays between successive pulses, drawn from a Gaussian distribution wherein the extent of fluctuations is controlled by the standard deviation $\sigma_T$ of the distribution. We find that increasing $\sigma_T$ leads to a dramatic transformation in the longitudinal momentum spectrum. The well-known fringe pattern, akin to that in the multi-slit interference, gets significantly modified. The averaged spectra exhibit a robust Gaussian-like envelope with residual oscillations, which are much more prominent in the central momentum region. Notably, we find that in certain cases, stochastic time delays lead to a pronounced enhancement in the central peak of the distribution function for pulse train containing $N$ pulses. For example, for $N=20$ pulses, $\sigma_T \approx 31$ $[m^{-1}]$(about $17\%$ of the mean time delay) yields nearly a tenfold increase in the central peak, which for $\sigma_T \approx 50$ $[m^{-1}]$ (about $27\%$ of the mean time delay), scales up to $10^3.$ This may open up new possibilities for optimizing multi-pulse field configurations and guide future experimental designs aimed at maximizing EPPs creation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metastable decay exhibits a familiar exponential regime bracketed by early-time deviations and late-time power-law tails. We adopt the real-time, flux-based definition of the decay rate in the spirit of Andreassen et al.\ direct method and present a complete analysis of one-dimensional quantum-mechanical resonance models. We show that the kernel admits a universal pole--plus--branch decomposition and use it to define two computable time scales: a dawn time, when a single resonant contribution starts dominating and exponential decay sets in, and a twilight time, when the branch-cut tail overtakes exponential decay. The latter can be expressed in closed form via the Lambert $W$ function, making its parametric dependence manifest without fitting. For square, modified square, and P\"oschl--Teller barriers we obtain simple thick-barrier formulas, clarify the relation $\Gamma T = T_{\text{trans}}$ between the decay rate $\Gamma$, oscillation period $T$, and transmission probability $T_{\text{trans}}$, and indicate how our spectral picture can be naturally extended to quantum field theoretic vacuum decay.</description>

      <title>The fermion sign problem in Gauss law sectors of quantum link models with dynamical matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fermion sign problem poses a formidable challenge to the use of Monte Carlo methods for lattice gauge theories with dynamical fermionic matter fields. A meron cluster algorithm recently formulated for gauge fields represented as spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ quantum links coupled to a single flavour of staggered fermions samples only two of the exponentially many Gauss law (GL) sectors at low temperatures, making it possible to simulate either of those two GL sectors at zero temperature in polynomial time. In this article, we analytically identify GL sectors which can be simulated without encountering the fermion sign problem in arbitrary spatial dimensions. Using large-scale exact diagonalization and cluster Monte Carlo methods, we further explore the nature of phases in the GL sectors dominating at zero temperature. The vacuum states lie in sectors which satisfy a staggered Gauss law, in contrast to the zero GL sector familiar in particle physics. Moreover, we prove that while the ground state GL sectors do not suffer from the fermion sign problem, the usual zero-charge GL sector (often considered the physical sector) does. We outline the role of the magnetic energy in causing transitions between GL sectors. We expect our results to be valid for truncated Kogut-Susskind gauge theories, beyond quantum link models.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of U(1) Gauge Boson Kinetic Mixing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum field theories containing fields with the same quantum numbers allow for mixed kinetic terms in the Lagrangian, leading to off-diagonal elements in the tree-level two-point function. After removing the mixing by a field rotation, the off-diagonal UV divergences cannot be subtracted by a counterterm, still one can show that the theory is renormalizable. We study kinetic mixing of $U(1)$ gauge bosons in an extension of QED with a massive "dark" photon at one-loop order. In general covariant $R_\xi$-gauge, the gauge-fixing function naively obstructs the removal of tree-level mixing but we show that these off-diagonal gauge-dependent contributions cancel. We compare two renormalization schemes: one with and one without kinetic mixing, and relate them via a scale-dependent field transformation, showing that the schemes are equivalent.</description>

      <title>Axions, Black Holes and the Detection of Gravitons: from Astrophysics to Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review a novel scenario for the emergence of spin-polarisation entangled squeezed graviton states from superradiant axionic clouds in the neighborhood of astrophysical rotating black holes (BHs). The entangled squeezed graviton states are produced by both, conventional General-Relativity (GR) type axion-gravity interactions, and gravitational Chern-Simons (gCS) anomalous terms coupled to axions, which are non-trivial in the presence of rotating BHs. The two kinds of terms have different-symmetry contributions to the entangled squeezed states. The squeezing parameter is estimated in a weak-quantum-gravity framework. Some phenomenology with respect to current and future interferometric detection devices is discussed. Importantly, current data from LIGO/Virgo Experiments can impose upper-bound constraints on the value of the squeezing parameter and, thus, on the lifetime of the axionic clouds. In addition to the above rather direct-detection possibility of squeezed gravitons, there is also the possibility of indirect detection of quantum gravitons in Cosmology, given that chiral quantum gravitational-wave (GW) perturbations in the primordial Universe may imply condensation of gCS terms. This, in turn, leads to inflation of running vacuum type, with in principle observable patterns in the profile of the GW produced during the post-inflationary early radiation era, as well as the potential of alleviating cosmic tensions in the current era.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noncommutative gravity, based on a twist-deformation of the differential geometry of spacetime and a first-order formulation of the dynamics, requires additional gravitational degrees of freedom as well as an enlargement of the gauge group of Lorentz transformations of the tetrad frame. As such, it offers a theoretical playground to build fundamentally motivated extension to general relativity. The dynamical degrees of freedom include a ${\rm GL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ gauge connection and two independent tetrads. The theory allows for interaction terms between the two tetrads, whose structure displays some similarities with ghost-free bigravity. The extra gravitational degrees of freedom survive in the commutative limit. We show the effective action obtained in this limit, discuss its symmetries, and compare it with other bigravity theories. The dynamics of homogeneous and isotropic cosmological solutions split into two branches. One is characterized by a constant and purely spatial curvature two-form. The other displays a richer gauge freedom, and the Hamiltonian analysis of the dynamics reveals three extra first-class constraints in addition to the generator of time reparametrizations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entanglement of Anyonic Charges and Emergent Spacetime Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intrinsically topologically ordered phases can host anyons. Here, we take the view that entanglement between anyons can give rise to an emergent geometry resembling Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. We analyze the entanglement structure of fractionalized anyons using mutual information and interpret the results within this emergent geometric framework. As a concrete example, we consider pairs of $e/2$-charged semions that arise from instanton configurations in a disordered zigzag graphene nanoribbon. These fractional charges, located on opposite zigzag edges, show long-range quantum entanglement despite being spatially separated. We analyze the scale dependence of their entanglement and embed the ribbon into an AdS-like bulk geometry. In this setup, the entanglement structure defines minimal surfaces in the bulk, providing a geometric view of the edge correlations. This gives a holographic picture of fractionalized degrees of freedom in quasi-one-dimensional systems and shows how quantum entanglement can generate emergent geometry even without conformal symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We incorporate non-local gravitational self-energy, motivated by string-inspired T-duality, into the Schr\"odinger-Newton equation. In this framework spacetime has an intrinsic non-locality, rendering the standard linear superposition principle only an approximation valid in the absence of gravitational effects. We then invert the logic by assuming the validity of linear superposition and demonstrate that such superpositions inevitably become unstable once gravity is included. The resulting wave-function collapse arises from a fundamental tension between the equivalence principle and the quantum superposition principle in a semiclassical spacetime background. We further show that wave functions computed in inertial and freely falling frames differ by a gravitationally induced phase shift containing linear and cubic time contributions along with a constant global term. These corrections produce a global phase change and lead to a spontaneous, model-independent collapse time inversely proportional to the mass of the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermal Casimir effect for a massless scalar field in the curved spacetime of a neutron star within the Thermo Field Dynamics (TFD) formalism. Starting from the renormalized energy-momentum tensor, we generalize the Stefan-Boltzmann law to include gravitational redshift and curvature corrections governed by the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) metric. Finite temperature and spatial compactification are introduced simultaneously, allowing a unified and consistent treatment of both vacuum and thermal contributions inside and outside the star. Analytical expressions are derived for the high- and low-temperature limits, showing explicitly how curvature and redshift modify the characteristic $T^4$ dependence of thermal radiation. The results reveal that strong gravity significantly alters the local energy density and pressure, demonstrating the nontrivial interplay between quantum vacuum fluctuations and compact astrophysical geometries. A polytropic model is considered to perform numerical analyses, highlighting the influence of the spacetime background on vacuum fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Note on bulk viscosity as an alternative to dark energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bulk viscosity, which characterizes the irreversible dissipative resistance of a fluid to volume changes, has been proposed as a potential mechanism for explaining both early- and late-time accelerated expansion of the Universe. In this work, we investigate two distinct physical scenarios for the origin of bulk viscosity: (1) nonminimal interactions between two fluids, and (2) elastic collisions in an ideal gas. In both cases, we demonstrate that while the associated energy-momentum exchange can significantly influence fluid dynamics, overall energy-momentum conservation precludes such exchange from having any direct gravitational effect in the context of General Relativity. In case (1), we show that the standard bulk viscous energy-momentum tensor can be obtained for the two-fluid system only at the cost of the violation of all classical energy conditions: null, weak, dominant, and strong. In case (2), we consider a single fluid composed of point particles undergoing instantaneous, energy- and momentum-conserving collisions, and find that the proper pressure remains strictly non-negative, with the equation-of-state parameter confined to the interval $[0,1/3]$. In both scenarios, achieving a sufficiently negative effective pressure to drive cosmic acceleration requires assumptions that compromise the physical viability of the model. Our results highlight some of the key physical challenges involved in modeling dark energy through bulk viscous effects.</description>

      <title>An Extra-Dimensional Axion in a 5D Warped Orbifold GUT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the QCD axion arising from the 5th component of a bulk $U(1)$ gauge field in a five-dimensional warped grand unified theory, and determine the viable range of the axion decay constant $f_a$. Unlike flat extra dimensions, where gauge couplings run quickly above the Kaluza--Klein (KK) scale, the logarithmic running in warped geometries permits substantially smaller $f_a$ while preserving perturbative gauge coupling unification. However, bulk tree-level contributions to the gauge coupling -- interpreted holographically as CFT renormalization -- place a lower bound on $f_a$. We find that the conventional QCD axion window $10^{9}\,\mathrm{GeV} \lesssim f_a \lesssim 10^{12}\,\mathrm{GeV}$ is readily compatible without losing perturbativity, provided the AdS curvature is near the Planck scale. Thus, the 5D warped orbifold GUT naturally accommodates a high-quality QCD axion in a grand unified theory that provides an effective description of string-theoretic warped flux compactifications, admitting complementary geometric and holographic descriptions of the axion.</description>

      <title>Physical Effects of Gravitational Waves at Second Order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is currently no rigorous definition of gravitational wave strain at second order in cosmological perturbation theory. The usual association of gravitational waves with transverse and traceless fluctuations of the metric on spatial hypersurfaces becomes ambiguous at second order, as it inherently depends on the spacetime slicing. While this poses no practical issues in linearized gravity, it presents a fundamental problem for secondary gravitational waves, especially notorious for gravitational waves induced by primordial fluctuations. We compute, for the first time, the physical effects of gravitational waves at second order, as measured by geodesic observers that emit and receive electromagnetic signals, thereby settling the debate on gauge ambiguities. We find that the measured gravitational wave strain coincides with the transverse-traceless components in the Newton gauge.</description>

Abstract: Quantum photon effects in vacuum provide an interesting setting to test quantum electrodynamics, serving as a source for predictions about physics beyond the Standard Model. In this paper, we investigate these effects by calculating the one-loop Euler-Heisenberg-like effective action within a Lorentz-violating scalar quantum electrodynamics framework. In both CPT-even and CPT-odd scenarios, we obtain the exact result in all orders of the stress tensor $F_{\mu\nu}$ and evaluate explicitly the lower orders of this effective action. We identify the quantum effects coming from Lorentz violation in an explicitly gauge invariant way. Nonlinear Lorentz-violating contributions that may affect photon-photon scattering are explicitly evaluated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a commensurable and non-degenerate double sine-Gordon model, in which a partial breaking of vacuum degeneracy provides a mechanism for the emergence of static multi-kinks. These multi-kinks $K_n$ are stable field configurations with internal structure, consisting of $n$ localized energy packets with well-defined separations. The properties of the multi-kinks are thoroughly analyzed, including the novel phenomenology that arises during their collisions. In particular, we observe the emergence of long-lived composite oscillons that reflect the original structure of the multi-kinks. The sub-kink's positions and their vibration modes provide collective coordinates that are used to construct a phenomenological model, which offers a good qualitative explanation of the observed oscillon properties. Radiation effects are consistently incorporated, revealing that they play an important role in the observed synchronization of the oscillon's vibrational components.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13956v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Holographic superconductors are holographic duals of superconductors. Macroscopically, a superconductor should be described by the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory. There is ample evidence that the holographic superconductors are described by the standard GL theory, but the exact form of the dual GL theory is little known. We identify the dual GL theory for a class of bulk 5-dimensional holographic superconductors, where numerical coefficients are obtained exactly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24011v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a free scalar field in a specific (1+1)-dimensional curved spacetime. By introducing an algebraic state that is locally Hadamard, we derive the renormalized Wightman function and explicitly calculate the covariantly conserved quantum energy-momentum tensor up to a relevant order. From this result, we show that the Hadamard renormalization scheme, which has been effective in traditional quantum field theory in curved spacetime, is also applicable in the quantum inhomogeneous field theory. As applications of this framework, we show the existence of an Unruh-like effect for an observer slightly out of the right asymptotic region, as well as the vanishing of quantum frictional effect in the leading order ($e^{- bx}$) on the bubble wall expansion during the electroweak phase transition in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of BPS black holes in $AdS_3 \times S^3 \times S^3 \times S^1$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We uncover novel features in the spectrum of BPS and near-BPS states in asymptotically $AdS_3 \times S^3 \times S^3 \times S^1$ spacetimes. This follows from a careful analysis of semiclassical and quantum black holes in this theory, which have peculiarities due to the nonlinear large $\mathcal{N}=4$ superconformal symmetry. Notably, we find that the $S^3 \times S^3$ angular momentum spectrum of BPS states in the Ramond sector exhibits discrete jumps as a function of the ratio between the radii of the two three-spheres. This phenomenon is a quantum gravity effect for which no microscopic derivation is currently known. In addition, we construct a family of non-extremal supersymmetric black holes that contribute to a supersymmetric index yet possess a temperature-dependent free energy. Analogous results apply to six-dimensional black holes with $AdS_2 \times S^2 \times S^2$ near-horizon geometries constructed in M-theory compactifications.</description>

Abstract: We present twistor BV actions that encompasses many classically consistent bosonic holomorphic twistorial higher-spin theories with vanishing cosmological constant. Upon quantization, these actions are shown to be quantum consistent, i.e. no gauge anomaly, for some subclasses of twistorial higher-spin theories. Anomaly-free twistorial theories can be identified through an index theorem, which is a higher-spin extension of the Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch index theorem. We also discuss the anomaly cancellation mechanisms on twistor space to render anomalous theories quantum consistent at one loop.</description>

      <title>Wigner negativity, random matrices and gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a choice of an ordered, orthonormal basis for a $D$-dimensional Hilbert space, one can define a discrete version of the Wigner function -- a quasi-probability distribution which represents any quantum state as a real, normalized function on a discrete phase space. The Wigner function, in general, takes on negative values, and the amount of negativity in the Wigner function gives an operationally meaningful measure of the complexity of simulating the quantum state on a classical computer. Further, Wigner negativity also gives a lower bound on an entropic measure of spread complexity. In this paper, we study the growth of Wigner negativity for a generic initial state under time evolution with chaotic Hamiltonians. In arXiv:2402.13694, a perturbative argument was given to show that the Krylov basis minimizes the early time growth of Wigner negativity in the large-$D$ limit. Using tools from random matrix theory, here we show that for a generic choice of basis, the Wigner negativity for a classical initial state becomes exponentially large in an $O(1)$ amount of time evolution. On the other hand, we show that in the Krylov basis the negativity grows at most as a power law, and becomes exponentially large only at exponential times. We take this as evidence that the Krylov basis is ideally suited for a dual, semi-classical effective description of chaotic quantum dynamics for large-$D$ at sub-exponential times. For the Gaussian unitary ensemble, this effective description is the $q\to 0$ limit of $q$-deformed JT gravity.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a three-dimensional quantum field theory with an infinite-dimensional symmetry, realized explicitly through a centrally extended affine graded Lie algebra. This symmetry is a direct three-dimensional generalization of the chiral symmetry in the Wess-Zumino-Witten model. Upon performing radial quantization, we construct the Fock space of the theory and, via a three-dimensional analogue of the state-operator correspondence, we demonstrate that the algebra of local operators is endowed with the structure of a raviolo vertex algebra. Accordingly, this setup provides a framework for extending the methods of two-dimensional conformal field theory to three dimensions, and we expect it to lay the groundwork for exact methods in three-dimensional quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Charged Dirac fermions with anomalous magnetic moment in the presence of the chiral magnetic effect and of a noncommutative phase space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the relativistic energy spectrum (or relativistic Landau levels) for charged Dirac fermions with anomalous magnetic moment (AMM) in the presence of the chiral magnetic effect (CME) and of a noncommutative (NC) phase space, where we work with the $(3+1)$-dimensional Dirac equation in cylindrical coordinates. Using a similarity transformation, we obtain four coupled first-order differential equations. Subsequently, obtain four non-homogeneous second-order differential equations. To solve these equations exactly and analytically, we use a change of variable, the asymptotic behavior, and the Frobenius method. Consequently, we obtain the relativistic spectrum for the electron/positron, where we note that this spectrum is quantized in terms of the radial quantum number $n$ and the angular quantum number $m_j$, and explicitly depends on the position and momentum NC parameters $\theta$ and $\eta$ (describes the NC phase space), cyclotron frequency $\omega_c$ (an angular frequency that depends on the electric charge $e$, mass $m$, and external magnetic field $B$, i.e., $\omega_c=eB/m$), anomalous magnetic energy $E_m$ (an energy generated through the interaction of the AMM with the external magnetic field), $z$-momentum $k_z$ (linear momentum along the $z$-axis), and on the fermion and chiral chemical potential $\mu$ and $\mu_5$ (describes the CME). However, through $\theta$, $\eta$, and $m$, we define two types of ''NC angular frequencies'', given by $\omega_\theta=4/m\theta$ and $\omega_\eta=\eta/m$ (our spectrum depends on three angular frequencies). Comparing our spectrum with other papers, we verified that it generalizes several particular cases found in the literature. Besides, we also graphically analyze the behavior of the spectrum as a function of $B$, $\mu$, $\mu_5$, $k_z$, $\theta$, and $\eta$ for three different values of $n$ and $m_j$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore algebraic relations on Vassiliev knot invariants related with correlators in the 3-dimensional Chern--Simons theory. Vassiliev invariants form infinite-dimensional algebra. We focus on $k$-parametric knot families with Vassiliev invariants being polynomials in family parameters. We conjecture that such 1-parametric algebra of Vassiliev invariants is always finitely generated, while in the case of more parameters, we provide example of the knot family with infinite number of generators. Inside a knot family, there appear extra algebraic relations on Vassiliev invariants. We show that there are $\leq k$ algebraically independent Vassiliev invariants for $k$-parametric knot family. However, in all our examples, the number of algebraically independent Vassiliev invariants is exactly $k$, and it is open question if there exists a $k$-parametric knot family with a fewer number of algebraically independent Vassiliev invariants. We also demonstrate that a complete knot invariant of some $k$-parametric knot families consists of $k$ Vassiliev invariants.</description>

      <title>Sigma model renormalisation group flows, singularities and some remarks on cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of the renormalisation group (RG) flow of two-dimensional sigma models with a generic metric coupling by utilising known results for the Ricci flow. We point out that on many occasions the RG flow develops singularities, due to strong coupling behaviour, before it reaches a UV or an IR fixed point. We illustrate our analysis with several examples. We give particular emphasis to type I singularities, where the length of the curvature of the sigma model target space grows at most as $|t-T|^{-1}$ as the flow parameter $t$ approaches the singularity at $T$. For these, the geometry near the singularity is described in terms of a shrinking Ricci soliton that exhibits a cosmological constant even though the original RG flow does not.
  Assuming that the spacetime satisfies an RG flow equation, we use the Ricci solitons to introduce a cosmological constant in a string theory setting. This can allow for different cosmological constants at different regions of spacetime. In particular, we point out how the de-Sitter space is a solution of the theory. We also raise the question on whether the techniques used to prove the geometrisation conjecture can be applied to prove the homogeneity and isotropy of the universe at large scales.</description>

      <title>Collective dynamics in holographic fractonic solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fractonic phases of matter, a class of states in which collective excitations with constrained mobility exist, were originally discovered in the study of quantum error-correcting codes in solvable lattice spin models such as Haah's code and the X-cube model. Recently, they have also drawn the attention of the high-energy physics community due to the UV/IR mixing that arises when coarse-graining these lattice models. In this work, we consider a (3+1)-dimensional holographic model of fractonic solids and investigate the low-energy collective dynamics systematically. By computing the quasinormal modes of black holes, we obtain all the hydrodynamic excitations on the boundary, including two acoustic phonons, a longitudinal diffusive mode, and a subdiffusive collective mode with the dispersion $\omega \sim-ik^4$. In addition, it is found that the latter remains gapless when translational symmetry is explicitly broken. These results suggest that the subdiffusive mode is inherently protected by the crystal-dipole symmetry in solids and is qualitatively unaffected by broken spacetime symmetries.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we analyze a generalized "single-trace $T\bar T$" deformation, defined by a TsT transformation, of the fibered $I$-brane solution from \cite{Nunez2023}. We use the Penrose limit to understand it, and we consider both the TsT followed by the Penrose limit, as well as the Penrose limit followed by TsT. We describe the spin chains obtained in field theory. In the first case we find that, indeed, the TsT transformation preserves solvability in a simple way, as in the standard $T\bar T$ case. In the second case, we have several options, but none is simple enough to be conclusive, however, one case gives us an asymptotically free and IR nontrivial field theory sector, and another a new parallelizable pp wave.</description>

      <title>Black hole interiors of homogeneous holographic solids under shear strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00877v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the interior of AdS black holes under finite shear strain in a class of holographic axion models, which are widely used to describe strongly-coupled systems with broken translations. We demonstrate that the shear anisotropy necessarily eliminates the inner Cauchy horizon, such that the deformed black hole approaches a spacelike singularity. The anisotropic effect induced by the axion fields triggers a collapse of the Einstein-Rosen bridge at the would-be Cauchy horizon, accompanied by a rapid change in the anisotropy of the spatial geometry. In addition, for a power-law axion potential, sufficiently large shear deformations give rise to a domain wall solution that includes a Lifshitz like scaling geometry near the boundary as well as a near horizon Kasner epoch with the Kasner exponents determined by the powers of the potential. Finally, we find that the interior dynamics of black holes generally enter an era described by an anisotropic Kasner universe at later interior time. Depending on the form of the potential, they either tend to stable Kasner universes, or exhibit an endless alternation of different Kasner epochs toward the singularity.</description>

      <title>Elliptic modular graph forms, equivariant iterated integrals and single-valued elliptic polylogarithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The low-energy expansion of genus-one string amplitudes produces infinite families of non-holomorphic modular forms after each step of integrating over a point on the torus worldsheet which are known as elliptic modular graph forms (eMGFs). We solve the differential equations of eMGFs depending on a single point $z$ and the modular parameter $\tau$ via iterated integrals over holomorphic modular forms which individually transform inhomogeneously under ${\rm SL}_2(\mathbb Z)$. Suitable generating series of these iterated integrals over $\tau$, their complex conjugates and single-valued multiple zeta values (svMZVs) are combined to attain equivariant transformations under ${\rm SL}_2(\mathbb Z)$ such that their components are modular forms.
  Our generating series of equivariant iterated integrals for eMGFs is related to elliptic multiple polylogarithms (eMPLs) through a gauge transform of the flat Calaque-Enriquez-Etingof connection. By converting iterated $\tau$-integrals to iterated integrals over points on a torus, we arrive at an explicit construction of single-valued eMPLs where all the monodromies in the points cancel. Each single-valued eMPL depending on a single point $z$ is found to be a finite combination of meromorphic eMPLs, their complex conjugates, svMZVs and equivariant iterated Eisenstein integrals. Our generating series determines the latter two admixtures via so-called zeta generators and Tsunogai derivations which act on the two generators $x$, $y$ of a free Lie algebra and where the coefficients of words in $x,y$ define the single-valued eMPLs.</description>

Abstract: We propose and calculate a holographic Krylov complexity in ${\cal N}=4$ SYM via the proper momentum for motion in $AdS_5$ sliced by $AdS_3$. The motion in an $AdS_3$ subgroup corresponds to the Krylov complexity of the $Sl(2)$ subsector. The general motion corresponds to the Krylov complexity of the ${\cal N}=4$ SYM.</description>

      <title>The emergence of inherently 9-dimensional one-loop effective action from T-duality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies suggest that applying the Buscher rules to the dimensional reduction of ten-dimensional, one-loop effective actions generate "purely stringy" couplings in nine dimensions that cannot be lifted to a local, covariant form in ten dimensions. We investigate this phenomenon at order $\alpha'^3$ in type IIA string theory. By computing the circular reduction of the one-loop Chern-Simons term and pure-gravity couplings in type IIA theory and applying the T-duality transformation to the resulting couplings, we derive their counterparts in the type IIB effective action. We demonstrate that the resulting nine-dimensional type IIB couplings are invariant under S-duality without requiring contributions from the tree-level effective action or non-perturbative effects. As a consistency check, we show that the nine-dimensional type IIB couplings, when reduced on a K3 surface, reproduce the known heterotic string couplings on \( T^5 \) at order \( \alpha' \), via the duality between the two theories.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Energy and Topological Mass in Interacting Elko and Scalar Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08750v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a four-dimensional system composed of a mass-dimension-one fermionic field, also known as Elko, interacting with a real scalar field. Our main objective is to analyze the Casimir effects associated with this system, assuming that both the Elko and scalar fields satisfy Dirichlet boundary conditions on two large parallel plates separated by a distance $L$. In this scenario, we calculate the vacuum energy density and its first-order correction in the coupling constants of the theory. Additionally, we consider the mass correction for each field separately, namely the topological mass that arises from the boundary conditions imposed on the fields and which also depends on the coupling constants. To develop this analysis, we use the mathematical formalism known as the effective potential, expressed as a path integral in quantum field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that Feynman diagrams in AdS$_2$ space can be decomposed into infinite series of matrix elements of Wilson line network operators. The case of the 3-point scalar Feynman diagram with endpoints in the bulk is studied in detail. The resulting decomposition is similar to the conformal block decomposition of Witten diagrams, i.e. it comprises a single-trace term and infinite sums of double-trace terms. We derive a number of AdS propagator identities which relate the standard bulk-to-bulk propagators with the modified bulk-to-bulk propagators of two different types responsible for extracting single-trace and double-trace terms.</description>

      <title>A Compact Formula for Conserved Three-Point Tensor Structures in 4D CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a compact analytic formula for a complete basis of conformally invariant tensor structures for three-point functions of conserved operators in arbitrary 4D Lorentz representations. The construction follows directly from a novel constraint equivalent to applying conservation conditions at each point: the leading terms in all OPE limits appear as symmetric traceless tensors. We derive this by lifting to a unified $\mathrm{SU}(m,m|2n)$ analytic superspace framework, where the conservation conditions are automatically solved and then reducing back to 4D CFT. The same method is also used for cases involving one non-conserved operator. This formalism further reveals a map of the counting of CFT tensor structures to that of finite-dimensional $\mathrm{SU}(2n)$ representations, solved by Littlewood-Richardson coefficients. All results can be directly re-interpreted as three-point $\mathcal{N}=2$ and $\mathcal{N}=4$ superconformal tensor structures via the unified analytic superspace.</description>

      <title>Nonsingular black holes and spherically symmetric objects in nonlinear electrodynamics with a scalar field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04754v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In general relativity with vector and scalar fields given by the Lagrangian ${\cal L}(F,\phi,X)$, where $F$ is a Maxwell term and $X$ is a kinetic term of the scalar field $\phi$, we study the linear stability of static and spherically symmetric objects without curvature singularities at their centers. We show that the background solutions are generally described by either purely electrically or magnetically charged objects with a nontrivial scalar-field profile. In theories with the Lagrangian $\tilde{{\cal L}}(F)+K(\phi, X)$, which correspond to nonlinear electrodynamics with a k-essence scalar field, angular Laplacian instabilities induced by vector-field perturbations exclude all the regular spherically symmetric solutions including nonsingular black holes. In theories described by the Lagrangian ${\cal L}=X+\mu(\phi)F^n$, where $\mu$ is a function of $\phi$ and $n$ is a constant, the absence of angular Laplacian instabilities of spherically symmetric objects requires that $n&gt;1/2$, under which nonsingular black holes with apparent horizons are not present. However, for some particular ranges of $n$, there are horizonless compact objects with neither ghosts nor Laplacian instabilities in the small-scale limit. In theories given by ${\cal L}=X \kappa (F)$, where $\kappa$ is a function of $F$, regular spherically symmetric objects are prone to Laplacian instabilities either around the center or at spatial infinity. Thus, in our theoretical framework, we do not find any example of linearly stable nonsingular black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00091v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Direct searches for sub-GeV dark matter are limited by the intrinsic quantum properties of the target material. In this proof-of-concept study, we argue that this problem is particularly well suited for machine learning. We demonstrate that a simple neural architecture consisting of a variational autoencoder and a multi-layer perceptron can efficiently generate unique molecules with desired properties. In specific, the energy threshold and signal (quantum) efficiency determine the minimum mass and cross section to which a detector can be sensitive. Organic molecules present a particularly interesting class of materials with intrinsically anisotropic electronic responses and $\mathcal{O}$(few) eV excitation energies. However, the space of possible organic compounds is intractably large, which makes traditional database screening challenging. We adopt excitation energies and proxy transition matrix elements as target properties learned by our network. Our model is able to generate molecules that are not in even the most expansive quantum chemistry databases and predict their relevant properties for high-throughput and efficient screening. Following a massive generation of novel molecules, we use clustering analysis to identify some of the most promising molecular structures that optimise the desired molecular properties for dark matter detection.</description>

      <title>Detecting Ultralight Dark Matter with Matter Effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultralight particles, with a mass below the electronvolt scale, exhibit wave-like behavior and have arisen as a compelling dark matter candidate. A particularly intriguing subclass is scalar dark matter, which induces variations in fundamental physical constants. However, detecting such particles becomes highly challenging in the mass range above $10^{-6}\,\text{eV}$, as traditional experiments face severe limitations in response time. In contrast, the matter effect becomes significant in a vast and unexplored parameter space. These effects include (i) a force arising from scattering between ordinary matter and the dark matter wind and (ii) a fifth force between ordinary matter induced by the dark matter background. Using the repulsive quadratic scalar-photon interaction as a case study, we develop a unified framework based on quantum mechanical scattering theory to systematically investigate these phenomena across both perturbative and non-perturbative regimes. Our approach not only reproduces prior results obtained through other methodologies but also covers novel regimes with nontrivial features, such as decoherence effects, screening effects, and their combinations. In particular, we highlight one finding related to both scattering and background-induced forces: the descreening effect observed in the non-perturbative region with large incident momentum, which alleviates the decoherence suppression. Furthermore, we discuss current and proposed experiments, including inverse-square-law tests, equivalence principle tests, and deep-space acceleration measurements. Notably, we go beyond the spherical approximation and revisit the MICROSCOPE constraint on the background-induced force in the large-momentum regime, where the decoherence and screening effects interplay. The ultraviolet models realizing the quadratic scalar-photon interaction are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Universal Equilibration Condition for Heavy Quarks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21139v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kinetic equilibration at late times is physically required for heavy particles in a finite temperature medium. In Fokker-Planck dynamics, it is ensured by the Einstein relation between the drag and longitudinal momentum diffusion coefficients. However, in certain gauge field theories, this relation is violated at any nonzero heavy quark velocity. Recent work in strongly coupled $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM gauge theory shows that the Kolmogorov equation for the heavy quark phase space distribution (that reduces to Fokker-Planck form upon truncating the momentum transfer probability distribution to second moments) does equilibrate even though the Fokker-Planck equation does not. Going beyond these (to date theory-specific) insights, we derive a universal equilibration condition for the kernel of the Kolmogorov equation and, consequently, for the momentum transfer probability distribution that holds in any quantum field theory with any coupling strength. This condition, which is the generalization of the Einstein relation to quantum field theories which feature non-Gaussian fluctuations, reveals that the asymmetry between energy loss and energy gain in the momentum transfer probability distribution takes a simple, theory-independent, form.</description>

      <title>Cosmological effect of coherent oscillation of ultralight scalar fields in a multicomponent universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The idea that coherent oscillations of a scalar field, oscillating over a time period that is much shorter than the cosmological timescale, can exhibit cold dark matter (CDM) like behavior was previously established. In our work we first show that this equivalence between the oscillating scalar field model and the CDM sector is exact only in a flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime in the absence of cosmological constant and any other possible matter components in the universe when the mass of the scalar field is very large compared to the Hubble parameter. Then we show how to generalize the equivalence between the coherently oscillating scalar field model and the CDM sector in a spatially curved universe with multiple matter components. Using our general method, we will show how a coherently oscillating scalar field model can represent the CDM sector in the presence of non-minimal coupling of the CDM sector with radiation. Our method is powerful enough to work out the dynamics of gravitational collapse in a closed FLRW spacetime where the coherently oscillating scalar field model represents the CDM sector. We have, for the first time, presented a consistent method which specifies how a coherently oscillating scalar field model, where the scalar field is ultralight, acts like the CDM sector in a multicomponent universe.</description>

      <title>Quantum entanglement of Hawking-Partner modes in expanding cavities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article investigates quantum entanglement generated within a one-dimensional cavity where one boundary undergoes prescribed acceleration, a setup designed to mimic aspects of Hawking radiation. We quantify quantum correlations using logarithmic negativity for bipartitions where subsystem $A$ is a given mode and subsystem $B$ is the rest of the system. For initial pure states, we also consider a given mode and reconstruct its partner using the Hotta-Sch\"utzhold-Unruh formula, obtaining identical results. Interestingly, this last method offers notable computational efficiency. However, partner modes do not commute, due to the nontrivial multimode entanglement structure. Hence, a pairwise description will not be suitable for describing the full system. Besides, our findings reveal that the expanding cavity effectively acts as a squeezing device, with Hawking-partner pairs largely behaving as two-mode squeezed states. We checked that, in our setting, purification of Hawking modes is predominantly a low-energy process, with high-energetic particles contributing negligibly to the partner modes. Indeed, in both small and large acceleration regimes of the boundaries, quantum entanglement decreases toward the ultraviolet modes, indicating that higher-energy particles are more challenging to entangle and hence less probable to contribute in the purification process. Besides the initial vacuum state, we also consider one-mode squeezed and two-mode squeezed states, in order to confirm if quantum entanglement can be stimulated. Moreover, we analyze its robustness against initial thermal noise. Our analysis is based on numerical simulations and does not assume any approximation beyond the validity of our numerical algorithms. We conclude with a discussion about the possible implementation and observation of our results in the laboratory.</description>

      <title>Nambu-Goldstone boson phenomenology in Domain-Wall Standard Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Domain-Wall Standard Model (DWSM), a five-dimensional framework in which all Standard Model (SM) particles are localized on a domain wall embedded in a non-compact extra spatial dimension. A distinctive feature of this setup is the emergence of a Nambu-Goldstone (NG) boson, arising from the spontaneous breaking of translational invariance in the extra dimension due to the localization of SM chiral fermions. This NG boson couples via Yukawa interactions to SM fermions and their Kaluza-Klein (KK) excitations. We study the phenomenology of this NG boson and derive constraints from astrophysical processes (supernova cooling), Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), and collider searches for KK-mode fermions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The strongest limits arise from LHC data: we reinterpret existing mass bounds on squarks and sleptons in simplified supersymmetric models (assuming a massless lightest neutralino), as well as limits on exotic hadrons containing long-lived squarks or long-lived charged sleptons in the regime of extremely small Yukawa couplings. From this analysis, we obtain a conservative lower bound of 1 TeV on the masses of KK-mode quarks and charged leptons. Finally, we discuss the prospects for producing KK-mode fermions at future high-energy lepton colliders and outline strategies to distinguish their signatures from those of sfermions.</description>

      <title>Charged black holes in Weyl conformal gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a parametric study of the spacetime structures obtainable in Weyl conformal gravity's dyonic Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m solution. We derive expressions for photon sphere radii and horizons for this metric in terms of the conformal gravity parameters, from which we then determine analytic formulae for extremal limits and Hawking temperatures. Due to the surprising lack of the inverse quadratic $1/r^2$ term in this fourth-order metric, there is no guarantee for the innermost horizon of a black hole spacetime to be a Cauchy horizon, which is in direct contrast to the corresponding metric in general relativity. For example, for certain parameter values, a ``nested black hole'' is seen to exist; in such a spacetime, we find a Cauchy horizon trapped between two event horizons, which is not a structure known to be obtainable in standard general relativity. In addition to such exotic spacetimes, we also find a critical value for the electric and magnetic charges, at which the stable and unstable photon spheres of the metric merge, and we obtain extremal limits where three horizons collide.</description>

      <title>Divergences in the hadronic light-by-light amplitude of the holographic soft-wall model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the WKB approximation to uncover divergences and instances of non-commuting limits in a large class of holographic soft-wall models. We show that the infinite sum over single resonance contributions for a variety of observables involving the Chern-Simons term, such as the VVA correlator or the hadronic light-by-light tensor, does not converge. These divergences can in some cases (such as the VVA correlator) be traced back to non-commuting limits and avoided by working directly in the 5-dimensional setup with bulk-to-boundary propagators. However, the hadronic light-by-light scattering tensor also diverges in the 5-dimensional formulation with corresponding Green functions, preventing a correct implementation of the Melnikov-Vainshtein short-distance constraint and even leading to an infinite contribution to the muon $g-2$. We also discuss modifications of the standard soft-wall model that are able to resolve this issue.</description>

      <title>Neutral Magnetic Monopole in the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The standard model has the electroweak monopole which has the magnetic charge $4\pi/e$, as a hybrid between the Dirac and 'tHooft-Polyakov monopoles. We argue that it may have new type of monopoles, in particular the neutral monopole (``the Z monopole") which is electromagnetically neutral but has the neutral magnetic charge $4\pi/\be$, where $\be$ is the neutral charge. The mass of the new monopole could be less than the Cho-Maison monopole, around 3.28 TeV. We show how to construct the neutral monopole and clarify the origin of the topology of the new monopole. We discuss the implications of the new monopoles in physics.</description>

      <title>Finite-rank conformal quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the simplest example of the landscape of conformal field theories: one-dimensional CFTs with finite-dimensional state space. Following the definition of quantum field theory given by G. Segal, we formulate the condition under which a one-dimensional QFT (quantum mechanics) possesses conformal symmetry, and we give a complete classification of conformal Hamiltonians with finite rank. It turns out that correlation functions in such theories are polynomial functions of the underlying geometric data. Moreover, the one-dimensional conformal Ward identities determine their scaling behavior, so that the correlators of the conformal observables are, in fact, homogeneous polynomials.</description>

      <title>Single-field D-type inflation in the minimal supergravity in light of Planck-ACT-SPT data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The minimal supergravity framework is applied to a construction of new D-type single-field models of inflation in agreement with precision measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation by Planck Collaboration, BICEP/Keck Collaboration, Atacama Cosmology Telescope and South Pole Telescope. The inflaton potential, the power spectrum of scalar perturbations, the cosmological observables and the reconstruction procedure can be very simple when using the e-folds as the running variable.</description>
