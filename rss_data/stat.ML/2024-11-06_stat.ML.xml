      <title>A Directional Rockafellar-Uryasev Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most ost Big Data datasets suffer from selection bias. For example, X (Twitter) training observations differ largely from the testing offline observations as individuals on Twitter are generally more educated, democratic or left-leaning. Therefore, one major obstacle to reliable estimation is the differences between training and testing data. How can researchers make use of such data even in the presence of non-ignorable selection mechanisms? A number of methods have been developed for this issue, such as distributionally robust optimization (DRO) or learning fairness. A possible avenue to reducing the effect of bias is meta-information. Researchers, being field exerts, might have prior information on the form and extent of selection bias affecting their dataset, and in which direction the selection might cause the estimate to change, e.g. over or under estimation. At the same time, there is no direct way to leverage these types of information in learning. I propose a loss function which takes into account two types of meta data information given by the researcher: quantity and direction (under or over sampling) of bias in the training set. Estimation with the proposed loss function is then implemented through a neural network, the directional Rockafellar-Uryasev (dRU) regression model. I test the dRU model on a biased training dataset, a Big Data online drawn electoral poll. I apply the proposed model using meta data information coherent with the political and sampling information obtained from previous studies. The results show that including meta information improves the electoral results predictions compared to a model that does not include them.</description>

      <title>Classifier Chain Networks for Multi-Label Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classifier chain is a widely used method for analyzing multi-labeled data sets. In this study, we introduce a generalization of the classifier chain: the classifier chain network. The classifier chain network enables joint estimation of model parameters, and allows to account for the influence of earlier label predictions on subsequent classifiers in the chain. Through simulations, we evaluate the classifier chain network's performance against multiple benchmark methods, demonstrating competitive results even in scenarios that deviate from its modeling assumptions. Furthermore, we propose a new measure for detecting conditional dependencies between labels and illustrate the classifier chain network's effectiveness using an empirical data set.</description>

      <title>Point processes with event time uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point processes are widely used statistical models for uncovering the temporal patterns in dependent event data. In many applications, the event time cannot be observed exactly, calling for the incorporation of time uncertainty into the modeling of point process data. In this work, we introduce a framework to model time-uncertain point processes possibly on a network. We start by deriving the formulation in the continuous-time setting under a few assumptions motivated by application scenarios. After imposing a time grid, we obtain a discrete-time model that facilitates inference and can be computed by first-order optimization methods such as Gradient Descent or Variation inequality (VI) using batch-based Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). The parameter recovery guarantee is proved for VI inference at an $O(1/k)$ convergence rate using $k$ SGD steps. Our framework handles non-stationary processes by modeling the inference kernel as a matrix (or tensor on a network) and it covers the stationary process, such as the classical Hawkes process, as a special case. We experimentally show that the proposed approach outperforms previous General Linear model (GLM) baselines on simulated and real data and reveals meaningful causal relations on a Sepsis-associated Derangements dataset.</description>

      <title>Elliptical Wishart distributions: information geometry, maximum likelihood estimator, performance analysis and statistical learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with Elliptical Wishart distributions - which generalize the Wishart distribution - in the context of signal processing and machine learning. Two algorithms to compute the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) are proposed: a fixed point algorithm and a Riemannian optimization method based on the derived information geometry of Elliptical Wishart distributions. The existence and uniqueness of the MLE are characterized as well as the convergence of both estimation algorithms. Statistical properties of the MLE are also investigated such as consistency, asymptotic normality and an intrinsic version of Fisher efficiency. On the statistical learning side, novel classification and clustering methods are designed. For the $t$-Wishart distribution, the performance of the MLE and statistical learning algorithms are evaluated on both simulated and real EEG and hyperspectral data, showcasing the interest of our proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Generalization and Risk Bounds for Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have achieved great success in the prediction of sequential data. However, their theoretical studies are still lagging behind because of their complex interconnected structures. In this paper, we establish a new generalization error bound for vanilla RNNs, and provide a unified framework to calculate the Rademacher complexity that can be applied to a variety of loss functions. When the ramp loss is used, we show that our bound is tighter than the existing bounds based on the same assumptions on the Frobenius and spectral norms of the weight matrices and a few mild conditions. Our numerical results show that our new generalization bound is the tightest among all existing bounds in three public datasets. Our bound improves the second tightest one by an average percentage of 13.80% and 3.01% when the $\tanh$ and ReLU activation functions are used, respectively. Moreover, we derive a sharp estimation error bound for RNN-based estimators obtained through empirical risk minimization (ERM) in multi-class classification problems when the loss function satisfies a Bernstein condition.</description>

      <title>Gradient Descent Finds Over-Parameterized Neural Networks with Sharp Generalization for Nonparametric Regression: A Distribution-Free Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study nonparametric regression by an over-parameterized two-layer neural network trained by gradient descent (GD) in this paper. We show that, if the neural network is trained by GD with early stopping, then the trained network renders a sharp rate of the nonparametric regression risk of $\cO(\eps_n^2)$, which is the same rate as that for the classical kernel regression trained by GD with early stopping, where $\eps_n$ is the critical population rate of the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) associated with the network and $n$ is the size of the training data. It is remarked that our result does not require distributional assumptions on the training data, in a strong contrast with many existing results which rely on specific distributions such as the spherical uniform data distribution or distributions satisfying certain restrictive conditions. The rate $\cO(\eps_n^2)$ is known to be minimax optimal for specific cases, such as the case that the NTK has a polynomial eigenvalue decay rate which happens under certain distributional assumptions. Our result formally fills the gap between training a classical kernel regression model and training an over-parameterized but finite-width neural network by GD for nonparametric regression without distributional assumptions. We also provide confirmative answers to certain open questions or address particular concerns in the literature of training over-parameterized neural networks by GD with early stopping for nonparametric regression, including the characterization of the stopping time, the lower bound for the network width, and the constant learning rate used in GD.</description>

      <title>Correlating Variational Autoencoders Natively For Multi-View Imputation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-view data from the same source often exhibit correlation. This is mirrored in correlation between the latent spaces of separate variational autoencoders (VAEs) trained on each data-view. A multi-view VAE approach is proposed that incorporates a joint prior with a non-zero correlation structure between the latent spaces of the VAEs. By enforcing such correlation structure, more strongly correlated latent spaces are uncovered. Using conditional distributions to move between these latent spaces, missing views can be imputed and used for downstream analysis. Learning this correlation structure involves maintaining validity of the prior distribution, as well as a successful parameterization that allows end-to-end learning.</description>

      <title>Online Data Collection for Efficient Semiparametric Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While many works have studied statistical data fusion, they typically assume that the various datasets are given in advance. However, in practice, estimation requires difficult data collection decisions like determining the available data sources, their costs, and how many samples to collect from each source. Moreover, this process is often sequential because the data collected at a given time can improve collection decisions in the future. In our setup, given access to multiple data sources and budget constraints, the agent must sequentially decide which data source to query to efficiently estimate a target parameter. We formalize this task using Online Moment Selection, a semiparametric framework that applies to any parameter identified by a set of moment conditions. Interestingly, the optimal budget allocation depends on the (unknown) true parameters. We present two online data collection policies, Explore-then-Commit and Explore-then-Greedy, that use the parameter estimates at a given time to optimally allocate the remaining budget in the future steps. We prove that both policies achieve zero regret (assessed by asymptotic MSE) relative to an oracle policy. We empirically validate our methods on both synthetic and real-world causal effect estimation tasks, demonstrating that the online data collection policies outperform their fixed counterparts.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Forgetting in LLM Supervised Fine-Tuning and Preference Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15483v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Post-training of pre-trained LLMs, which typically consists of the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage and the preference learning (RLHF or DPO) stage, is crucial to effective and safe LLM applications. The widely adopted approach in post-training popular open-source LLMs is to sequentially perform SFT and RLHF/DPO. However, sequential training is sub-optimal in terms of SFT and RLHF/DPO trade-off: the LLM gradually forgets about the first stage's training when undergoing the second stage's training. We theoretically prove the sub-optimality of sequential post-training. Furthermore, we propose a practical joint post-training framework with theoretical convergence guarantees and empirically outperforms sequential post-training framework, while having similar computational cost.

      <title>SLED: Self Logits Evolution Decoding for Improving Factuality in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but their outputs can sometimes be unreliable or factually incorrect. To address this, we introduce Self Logits Evolution Decoding (SLED), a novel decoding framework that enhances the truthfulness of LLMs without relying on external knowledge bases or requiring further fine-tuning. From an optimization perspective, our SLED framework leverages the latent knowledge embedded within the LLM by contrasting the output logits from the final layer with those from early layers. It then utilizes an approximate gradient approach to enable latent knowledge to guide the self-refinement of outputs, thereby effectively improving factual accuracy. Extensive experiments have been conducted on established benchmarks across a diverse range of model families (LLaMA 2, LLaMA 3, Gemma) and scales (from 2B to 70B), including more advanced architectural configurations such as the mixture of experts (MoE). Our evaluation spans a wide variety of tasks, including multi-choice, open-generation, and adaptations to chain-of-thought reasoning tasks. The results demonstrate that SLED consistently improves factual accuracy by up to 20\% compared to existing decoding methods while maintaining natural language fluency and negligible latency overhead. Furthermore, it can be flexibly combined with other decoding methods to further enhance their performance.</description>

      <title>MADOD: Generalizing OOD Detection to Unseen Domains via G-Invariance Meta-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world machine learning applications often face simultaneous covariate and semantic shifts, challenging traditional domain generalization and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods. We introduce Meta-learned Across Domain Out-of-distribution Detection (MADOD), a novel framework designed to address both shifts concurrently. MADOD leverages meta-learning and G-invariance to enhance model generalizability and OOD detection in unseen domains. Our key innovation lies in task construction: we randomly designate in-distribution classes as pseudo-OODs within each meta-learning task, simulating OOD scenarios using existing data. This approach, combined with energy-based regularization, enables the learning of robust, domain-invariant features while calibrating decision boundaries for effective OOD detection. Operating in a test domain-agnostic setting, MADOD eliminates the need for adaptation during inference, making it suitable for scenarios where test data is unavailable. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate MADOD's superior performance in semantic OOD detection across unseen domains, achieving an AUPR improvement of 8.48% to 20.81%, while maintaining competitive in-distribution classification accuracy, representing a significant advancement in handling both covariate and semantic shifts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research proposes a novel drift detection methodology for machine learning (ML) models based on the concept of ''deformation'' in the vector space representation of data. Recognizing that new data can act as forces stretching, compressing, or twisting the geometric relationships learned by a model, we explore various mathematical frameworks to quantify this deformation. We investigate measures such as eigenvalue analysis of covariance matrices to capture global shape changes, local density estimation using kernel density estimation (KDE), and Kullback-Leibler divergence to identify subtle shifts in data concentration. Additionally, we draw inspiration from continuum mechanics by proposing a ''strain tensor'' analogy to capture multi-faceted deformations across different data types. This requires careful estimation of the displacement field, and we delve into strategies ranging from density-based approaches to manifold learning and neural network methods. By continuously monitoring these deformation metrics and correlating them with model performance, we aim to provide a sensitive, interpretable, and adaptable drift detection system capable of distinguishing benign data evolution from true drift, enabling timely interventions and ensuring the reliability of machine learning systems in dynamic environments. Addressing the computational challenges of this methodology, we discuss mitigation strategies like dimensionality reduction, approximate algorithms, and parallelization for real-time and large-scale applications. The method's effectiveness is demonstrated through experiments on real-world text data, focusing on detecting context shifts in Generative AI. Our results, supported by publicly available code, highlight the benefits of this deformation-based approach in capturing subtle drifts that traditional statistical methods often miss. Furthermore, we present a detailed application example within the healthcare domain, showcasing the methodology's potential in diverse fields. Future work will focus on further improving computational efficiency and exploring additional applications across different ML domains.</description>

      <title>See it, Think it, Sorted: Large Multimodal Models are Few-shot Time Series Anomaly Analyzers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is becoming increasingly vital due to the rapid growth of time series data across various sectors. Anomalies in web service data, for example, can signal critical incidents such as system failures or server malfunctions, necessitating timely detection and response. However, most existing TSAD methodologies rely heavily on manual feature engineering or require extensive labeled training data, while also offering limited interpretability. To address these challenges, we introduce a pioneering framework called the Time Series Anomaly Multimodal Analyzer (TAMA), which leverages the power of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to enhance both the detection and interpretation of anomalies in time series data. By converting time series into visual formats that LMMs can efficiently process, TAMA leverages few-shot in-context learning capabilities to reduce dependence on extensive labeled datasets. Our methodology is validated through rigorous experimentation on multiple real-world datasets, where TAMA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in TSAD tasks. Additionally, TAMA provides rich, natural language-based semantic analysis, offering deeper insights into the nature of detected anomalies. Furthermore, we contribute one of the first open-source datasets that includes anomaly detection labels, anomaly type labels, and contextual description, facilitating broader exploration and advancement within this critical field. Ultimately, TAMA not only excels in anomaly detection but also provides a comprehensive approach for understanding the underlying causes of anomalies, pushing TSAD forward through innovative methodologies and insights.</description>

      <title>Towards Harmless Rawlsian Fairness Regardless of Demographic Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to privacy and security concerns, recent advancements in group fairness advocate for model training regardless of demographic information. However, most methods still require prior knowledge of demographics. In this study, we explore the potential for achieving fairness without compromising its utility when no prior demographics are provided to the training set, namely \emph{harmless Rawlsian fairness}. We ascertain that such a fairness requirement with no prior demographic information essential promotes training losses to exhibit a Dirac delta distribution. To this end, we propose a simple but effective method named VFair to minimize the variance of training losses inside the optimal set of empirical losses. This problem is then optimized by a tailored dynamic update approach that operates in both loss and gradient dimensions, directing the model towards relatively fairer solutions while preserving its intact utility. Our experimental findings indicate that regression tasks, which are relatively unexplored from literature, can achieve significant fairness improvement through VFair regardless of any prior, whereas classification tasks usually do not because of their quantized utility measurements. The implementation of our method is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/wxqpxw/VFair}.</description>

      <title>Pretrained transformer efficiently learns low-dimensional target functions in-context</title>

Abstract: Transformers can efficiently learn in-context from example demonstrations. Most existing theoretical analyses studied the in-context learning (ICL) ability of transformers for linear function classes, where it is typically shown that the minimizer of the pretraining loss implements one gradient descent step on the least squares objective. However, this simplified linear setting arguably does not demonstrate the statistical efficiency of ICL, since the pretrained transformer does not outperform directly solving linear regression on the test prompt. In this paper, we study ICL of a nonlinear function class via transformer with nonlinear MLP layer: given a class of \textit{single-index} target functions $f_*(\boldsymbol{x}) = \sigma_*(\langle\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{\beta}\rangle)$, where the index features $\boldsymbol{\beta}\in\mathbb{R}^d$ are drawn from a $r$-dimensional subspace, we show that a nonlinear transformer optimized by gradient descent (with a pretraining sample complexity that depends on the \textit{information exponent} of the link functions $\sigma_*$) learns $f_*$ in-context with a prompt length that only depends on the dimension of the distribution of target functions $r$; in contrast, any algorithm that directly learns $f_*$ on test prompt yields a statistical complexity that scales with the ambient dimension $d$. Our result highlights the adaptivity of the pretrained transformer to low-dimensional structures of the function class, which enables sample-efficient ICL that outperforms estimators that only have access to the in-context data.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Optimization</title>

Abstract: Distributionally robust optimization (DRO) studies decision problems under uncertainty where the probability distribution governing the uncertain problem parameters is itself uncertain. A key component of any DRO model is its ambiguity set, that is, a family of probability distributions consistent with any available structural or statistical information. DRO seeks decisions that perform best under the worst distribution in the ambiguity set. This worst case criterion is supported by findings in psychology and neuroscience, which indicate that many decision-makers have a low tolerance for distributional ambiguity. DRO is rooted in statistics, operations research and control theory, and recent research has uncovered its deep connections to regularization techniques and adversarial training in machine learning. This survey presents the key findings of the field in a unified and self-contained manner.</description>

      <title>FactTest: Factuality Testing in Large Language Models with Statistical Guarantees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The propensity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate hallucinations and non-factual content undermines their reliability in high-stakes domains, where rigorous control over Type I errors (the conditional probability of incorrectly classifying hallucinations as truthful content) is essential. Despite its importance, formal verification of LLM factuality with such guarantees remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce FactTest, a novel framework that statistically assesses whether an LLM can confidently provide correct answers to given questions with high-probability correctness guarantees. We formulate factuality testing as hypothesis testing problem to enforce an upper bound of Type I errors at user-specified significance levels. Notably, we prove that our framework also ensures strong Type II error control under mild conditions and can be extended to maintain its effectiveness when covariate shifts exist. %These analyses are amenable to the principled NP framework. Our approach is distribution-free and works for any number of human-annotated samples. It is model-agnostic and applies to any black-box or white-box LM. Extensive experiments on question-answering (QA) and multiple-choice benchmarks demonstrate that \approach effectively detects hallucinations and improves the model's ability to abstain from answering unknown questions, leading to an over 40% accuracy improvement.</description>

      <title>Explanations that reveal all through the definition of encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feature attributions attempt to highlight what inputs drive predictive power. Good attributions or explanations are thus those that produce inputs that retain this predictive power; accordingly, evaluations of explanations score their quality of prediction. However, evaluations produce scores better than what appears possible from the values in the explanation for a class of explanations, called encoding explanations. Probing for encoding remains a challenge because there is no general characterization of what gives the extra predictive power. We develop a definition of encoding that identifies this extra predictive power via conditional dependence and show that the definition fits existing examples of encoding. This definition implies, in contrast to encoding explanations, that non-encoding explanations contain all the informative inputs used to produce the explanation, giving them a "what you see is what you get" property, which makes them transparent and simple to use. Next, we prove that existing scores (ROAR, FRESH, EVAL-X) do not rank non-encoding explanations above encoding ones, and develop STRIPE-X which ranks them correctly. After empirically demonstrating the theoretical insights, we use STRIPE-X to uncover encoding in LLM-generated explanations for predicting the sentiment in movie reviews.</description>

      <title>Carbon price fluctuation prediction using blockchain information A new hybrid machine learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, the novel hybrid machine learning approach is proposed in carbon price fluctuation prediction. Specifically, a research framework integrating DILATED Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network algorithm is proposed. The advantage of the combined framework is that it can make feature extraction more efficient. Then, based on the DILATED CNN-LSTM framework, the L1 and L2 parameter norm penalty as regularization method is adopted to predict. Referring to the characteristics of high correlation between energy indicator price and blockchain information in previous literature, and we primarily includes indicators related to blockchain information through regularization process. Based on the above methods, this paper uses a dataset containing an amount of data to carry out the carbon price prediction. The experimental results show that the DILATED CNN-LSTM framework is superior to the traditional CNN-LSTM architecture. Blockchain information can effectively predict the price. Since parameter norm penalty as regularization, Ridge Regression (RR) as L2 regularization is better than Smoothly Clipped Absolute Deviation Penalty (SCAD) as L1 regularization in price forecasting. Thus, the proposed RR-DILATED CNN-LSTM approach can effectively and accurately predict the fluctuation trend of the carbon price. Therefore, the new forecasting methods and theoretical ecology proposed in this study provide a new basis for trend prediction and evaluating digital assets policy represented by the carbon price for both the academia and practitioners.</description>

      <title>Differentiability and Approximation of Probability Functions under Gaussian Mixture Models: A Bayesian Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study probability functions associated with Gaussian mixture models. Our primary focus is on extending the use of spherical radial decomposition for multivariate Gaussian random vectors to the context of Gaussian mixture models, which are not inherently spherical but only conditionally so. Specifically, the conditional probability distribution, given a random parameter of the random vector, follows a Gaussian distribution, allowing us to apply Bayesian analysis tools to the probability function. This assumption, together with spherical radial decomposition for Gaussian random vectors, enables us to represent the probability function as an integral over the Euclidean sphere. Using this representation, we establish sufficient conditions to ensure the differentiability of the probability function and provide and integral representation of its gradient. Furthermore, leveraging the Bayesian decomposition, we approximate the probability function using random sampling over the parameter space and the Euclidean sphere. Finally, we present numerical examples that illustrate the advantages of this approach over classical approximations based on random vector sampling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a fast, spectral procedure for implementing approximate-message passing (AMP) algorithms robustly. For any quadratic optimization problem over symmetric matrices $X$ with independent subgaussian entries, and any separable AMP algorithm $\mathcal A$, our algorithm performs a spectral pre-processing step and then mildly modifies the iterates of $\mathcal A$. If given the perturbed input $X + E \in \mathbb R^{n \times n}$ for any $E$ supported on a $\varepsilon n \times \varepsilon n$ principal minor, our algorithm outputs a solution $\hat v$ which is guaranteed to be close to the output of $\mathcal A$ on the uncorrupted $X$, with $\|\mathcal A(X) - \hat v\|_2 \le f(\varepsilon) \|\mathcal A(X)\|_2$ where $f(\varepsilon) \to 0$ as $\varepsilon \to 0$ depending only on $\varepsilon$.</description>

      <title>A Convex Relaxation Approach to Generalization Analysis for Parallel Positively Homogeneous Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a general framework for deriving generalization bounds for parallel positively homogeneous neural networks--a class of neural networks whose input-output map decomposes as the sum of positively homogeneous maps. Examples of such networks include matrix factorization and sensing, single-layer multi-head attention mechanisms, tensor factorization, deep linear and ReLU networks, and more. Our general framework is based on linking the non-convex empirical risk minimization (ERM) problem to a closely related convex optimization problem over prediction functions, which provides a global, achievable lower-bound to the ERM problem. We exploit this convex lower-bound to perform generalization analysis in the convex space while controlling the discrepancy between the convex model and its non-convex counterpart. We apply our general framework to a wide variety of models ranging from low-rank matrix sensing, to structured matrix sensing, two-layer linear networks, two-layer ReLU networks, and single-layer multi-head attention mechanisms, achieving generalization bounds with a sample complexity that scales almost linearly with the network width.</description>

      <title>New random projections for isotropic kernels using stable spectral distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rahimi and Recht [31] introduced the idea of decomposing shift-invariant kernels by randomly sampling from their spectral distribution. This famous technique, known as Random Fourier Features (RFF), is in principle applicable to any shift-invariant kernel whose spectral distribution can be identified and simulated. In practice, however, it is usually applied to the Gaussian kernel because of its simplicity, since its spectral distribution is also Gaussian. Clearly, simple spectral sampling formulas would be desirable for broader classes of kernel functions. In this paper, we propose to decompose spectral kernel distributions as a scale mixture of $\alpha$-stable random vectors. This provides a simple and ready-to-use spectral sampling formula for a very large class of multivariate shift-invariant kernels, including exponential power kernels, generalized Mat\'ern kernels, generalized Cauchy kernels, as well as newly introduced kernels such as the Beta, Kummer, and Tricomi kernels. In particular, we show that the spectral densities of all these kernels are scale mixtures of the multivariate Gaussian distribution. This provides a very simple way to modify existing Random Fourier Features software based on Gaussian kernels to cover a much richer class of multivariate kernels. This result has broad applications for support vector machines, kernel ridge regression, Gaussian processes, and other kernel-based machine learning techniques for which the random Fourier features technique is applicable.</description>

      <title>Automatic doubly robust inference for linear functionals via calibrated debiased machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In causal inference, many estimands of interest can be expressed as a linear functional of the outcome regression function; this includes, for example, average causal effects of static, dynamic and stochastic interventions. For learning such estimands, in this work, we propose novel debiased machine learning estimators that are doubly robust asymptotically linear, thus providing not only doubly robust consistency but also facilitating doubly robust inference (e.g., confidence intervals and hypothesis tests). To do so, we first establish a key link between calibration, a machine learning technique typically used in prediction and classification tasks, and the conditions needed to achieve doubly robust asymptotic linearity. We then introduce calibrated debiased machine learning (C-DML), a unified framework for doubly robust inference, and propose a specific C-DML estimator that integrates cross-fitting, isotonic calibration, and debiased machine learning estimation. A C-DML estimator maintains asymptotic linearity when either the outcome regression or the Riesz representer of the linear functional is estimated sufficiently well, allowing the other to be estimated at arbitrarily slow rates or even inconsistently. We propose a simple bootstrap-assisted approach for constructing doubly robust confidence intervals. Our theoretical and empirical results support the use of C-DML to mitigate bias arising from the inconsistent or slow estimation of nuisance functions.</description>

      <title>Language Models and Cycle Consistency for Self-Reflective Machine Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for machine translation (MT). We start with one conjecture: an ideal translation should contain complete and accurate information for a strong enough LLM to recover the original sentence. We generate multiple translation candidates from a source language A to a target language B, and subsequently translate these candidates back to the original language A. By evaluating the cycle consistency between the original and back-translated sentences using metrics such as token-level precision and accuracy, we implicitly estimate the translation quality in language B, without knowing its ground-truth. This also helps to evaluate the LLM translation capability, only with monolingual corpora. For each source sentence, we identify the translation candidate with optimal cycle consistency with the original sentence as the final answer. Our experiments demonstrate that larger LLMs, or the same LLM with more forward passes during inference, exhibit increased cycle consistency, aligning with the LLM model size scaling law and test-time computation scaling law. This work provide methods for, 1) to implicitly evaluate translation quality of a sentence in the target language, 2), to evaluate capability of LLM for any-to-any-language translation, and 3), how to generate a better translation for a specific LLM.</description>

      <title>Community detection with the Bethe-Hessian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Bethe-Hessian matrix, introduced by Saade, Krzakala, and Zdeborov\'a (2014), is a Hermitian matrix designed for applying spectral clustering algorithms to sparse networks. Rather than employing a non-symmetric and high-dimensional non-backtracking operator, a spectral method based on the Bethe-Hessian matrix is conjectured to also reach the Kesten-Stigum detection threshold in the sparse stochastic block model (SBM). We provide the first rigorous analysis of the Bethe-Hessian spectral method in the SBM under both the bounded expected degree and the growing degree regimes. Specifically, we demonstrate that: (i) When the expected degree $d\geq 2$, the number of negative outliers of the Bethe-Hessian matrix can consistently estimate the number of blocks above the Kesten-Stigum threshold, thus confirming a conjecture from Saade, Krzakala, and Zdeborov\'a (2014) for $d\geq 2$. (ii) For sufficiently large $d$, its eigenvectors can be used to achieve weak recovery. (iii) As $d\to\infty$, we establish the concentration of the locations of its negative outlier eigenvalues, and weak consistency can be achieved via a spectral method based on the Bethe-Hessian matrix.</description>

      <title>ADOPT: Modified Adam Can Converge with Any $\beta_2$ with the Optimal Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adam is one of the most popular optimization algorithms in deep learning. However, it is known that Adam does not converge in theory unless choosing a hyperparameter, i.e., $\beta_2$, in a problem-dependent manner. There have been many attempts to fix the non-convergence (e.g., AMSGrad), but they require an impractical assumption that the gradient noise is uniformly bounded. In this paper, we propose a new adaptive gradient method named ADOPT, which achieves the optimal convergence rate of $\mathcal{O} ( 1 / \sqrt{T} )$ with any choice of $\beta_2$ without depending on the bounded noise assumption. ADOPT addresses the non-convergence issue of Adam by removing the current gradient from the second moment estimate and changing the order of the momentum update and the normalization by the second moment estimate. We also conduct intensive numerical experiments, and verify that our ADOPT achieves superior results compared to Adam and its variants across a wide range of tasks, including image classification, generative modeling, natural language processing, and deep reinforcement learning. The implementation is available at https://github.com/iShohei220/adopt.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose reinterpreting copula density estimation as a discriminative task. Under this novel estimation scheme, we train a classifier to distinguish samples from the joint density from those of the product of independent marginals, recovering the copula density in the process. We derive equivalences between well-known copula classes and classification problems naturally arising in our interpretation. Furthermore, we show our estimator achieves theoretical guarantees akin to maximum likelihood estimation. By identifying a connection with density ratio estimation, we benefit from the rich literature and models available for such problems. Empirically, we demonstrate the applicability of our approach by estimating copulas of real and high-dimensional datasets, outperforming competing copula estimators in density evaluation as well as sampling.</description>

      <title>Testing Generalizability in Causal Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring robust model performance across diverse real-world scenarios requires addressing both transportability across domains with covariate shifts and extrapolation beyond observed data ranges. However, there is no formal procedure for statistically evaluating generalizability in machine learning algorithms, particularly in causal inference. Existing methods often rely on arbitrary metrics like AUC or MSE and focus predominantly on toy datasets, providing limited insights into real-world applicability. To address this gap, we propose a systematic and quantitative framework for evaluating model generalizability under covariate distribution shifts, specifically within causal inference settings. Our approach leverages the frugal parameterization, allowing for flexible simulations from fully and semi-synthetic benchmarks, offering comprehensive evaluations for both mean and distributional regression methods. By basing simulations on real data, our method ensures more realistic evaluations, which is often missing in current work relying on simplified datasets. Furthermore, using simulations and statistical testing, our framework is robust and avoids over-reliance on conventional metrics. Grounded in real-world data, it provides realistic insights into model performance, bridging the gap between synthetic evaluations and practical applications.</description>

      <title>Graph Agnostic Causal Bayesian Optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of globally optimising a target variable of an unknown causal graph on which a sequence of soft or hard interventions can be performed. The problem of optimising the target variable associated with a causal graph is formalised as Causal Bayesian Optimisation (CBO). We study the CBO problem under the cumulative regret objective with unknown causal graphs for two settings, namely structural causal models with hard interventions and function networks with soft interventions. We propose Graph Agnostic Causal Bayesian Optimisation (GACBO), an algorithm that actively discovers the causal structure that contributes to achieving optimal rewards. GACBO seeks to balance exploiting the actions that give the best rewards against exploring the causal structures and functions. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to study causal Bayesian optimization with cumulative regret objectives in scenarios where the graph is unknown or partially known. We show our proposed algorithm outperforms baselines in simulated experiments and real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Benign landscape for Burer-Monteiro factorizations of MaxCut-type semidefinite programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider MaxCut-type semidefinite programs (SDP) which admit a low rank solution. To numerically leverage the low rank hypothesis, a standard algorithmic approach is the Burer-Monteiro factorization, which allows to significantly reduce the dimensionality of the problem at the cost of its convexity. We give a sharp condition on the conditioning of the Laplacian matrix associated with the SDP under which any second-order critical point of the non-convex problem is a global minimizer. By applying our theorem, we improve on recent results about the correctness of the Burer-Monteiro approach on $\mathbb{Z}_2$-synchronization problems.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal Dynamic Regret for Adversarial Linear Mixture MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study episodic linear mixture MDPs with the unknown transition and adversarial rewards under full-information feedback, employing dynamic regret as the performance measure. We start with in-depth analyses of the strengths and limitations of the two most popular methods: occupancy-measure-based and policy-based methods. We observe that while the occupancy-measure-based method is effective in addressing non-stationary environments, it encounters difficulties with the unknown transition. In contrast, the policy-based method can deal with the unknown transition effectively but faces challenges in handling non-stationary environments. Building on this, we propose a novel algorithm that combines the benefits of both methods. Specifically, it employs (i) an occupancy-measure-based global optimization with a two-layer structure to handle non-stationary environments; and (ii) a policy-based variance-aware value-targeted regression to tackle the unknown transition. We bridge these two parts by a novel conversion. Our algorithm enjoys an $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d \sqrt{H^3 K} + \sqrt{HK(H + \bar{P}_K)})$ dynamic regret, where $d$ is the feature dimension, $H$ is the episode length, $K$ is the number of episodes, $\bar{P}_K$ is the non-stationarity measure. We show it is minimax optimal up to logarithmic factors by establishing a matching lower bound. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that achieves near-optimal dynamic regret for adversarial linear mixture MDPs with the unknown transition without prior knowledge of the non-stationarity measure.</description>

      <title>Proxy-informed Bayesian transfer learning with unknown sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalization outside the scope of one's training data requires leveraging prior knowledge about the effects that transfer, and the effects that don't, between different data sources. Bayesian transfer learning is a principled paradigm for specifying this knowledge, and refining it on the basis of data from the source (training) and target (prediction) tasks. We address the challenging transfer learning setting where the learner (i) cannot fine-tune in the target task, and (ii) does not know which source data points correspond to the same task (i.e., the data sources are unknown). We propose a proxy-informed robust method for probabilistic transfer learning (PROMPT), which provides a posterior predictive estimate tailored to the structure of the target task, without requiring the learner have access to any outcome information from the target task. Instead, PROMPT relies on the availability of proxy information. PROMPT uses the same proxy information for two purposes: (i) estimation of effects specific to the target task, and (ii) construction of a robust reweighting of the source data for estimation of effects that transfer between tasks. We provide theoretical results on the effect of this reweighting on the risk of negative transfer, and demonstrate application of PROMPT in two synthetic settings.</description>

      <title>A Nonparametric Approach with Marginals for Modeling Consumer Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.06115v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given data on the choices made by consumers for different offer sets, a key challenge is to develop parsimonious models that describe and predict consumer choice behavior while being amenable to prescriptive tasks such as pricing and assortment optimization. The marginal distribution model (MDM) is one such model, which requires only the specification of marginal distributions of the random utilities. This paper aims to establish necessary and sufficient conditions for given choice data to be consistent with the MDM hypothesis, inspired by the usefulness of similar characterizations for the random utility model (RUM). This endeavor leads to an exact characterization of the set of choice probabilities that the MDM can represent. Verifying the consistency of choice data with this characterization is equivalent to solving a polynomial-sized linear program. Since the analogous verification task for RUM is computationally intractable and neither of these models subsumes the other, MDM is helpful in striking a balance between tractability and representational power. The characterization is then used with robust optimization for making data-driven sales and revenue predictions for new unseen assortments. When the choice data lacks consistency with the MDM hypothesis, finding the best-fitting MDM choice probabilities reduces to solving a mixed integer convex program. Numerical results using real world data and synthetic data demonstrate that MDM exhibits competitive representational power and prediction performance compared to RUM and parametric models while being significantly faster in computation than RUM.</description>

Abstract: We seek to extract a small number of representative scenarios from large panel data that are consistent with sample moments. Among two novel algorithms, the first identifies scenarios that have not been observed before, and comes with a scenario-based representation of covariance matrices. The second proposal selects important data points from states of the world that have already realized, and are consistent with higher-order sample moment information. Both algorithms are efficient to compute and lend themselves to consistent scenario-based modeling and multi-dimensional numerical integration that can be used for interpretable decision-making under uncertainty. Extensive numerical benchmarking studies and an application in portfolio optimization favor the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Active Feature Acquisition Methods for Time-varying Feature Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01530v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning methods often assume that input features are available at no cost. However, in domains like healthcare, where acquiring features could be expensive or harmful, it is necessary to balance a feature's acquisition cost against its predictive value. The task of training an AI agent to decide which features to acquire is called active feature acquisition (AFA). By deploying an AFA agent, we effectively alter the acquisition strategy and trigger a distribution shift. To safely deploy AFA agents under this distribution shift, we present the problem of active feature acquisition performance evaluation (AFAPE). We examine AFAPE under i) a no direct effect (NDE) assumption, stating that acquisitions do not affect the underlying feature values; and ii) a no unobserved confounding (NUC) assumption, stating that retrospective feature acquisition decisions were only based on observed features. We show that one can apply missing data methods under the NDE assumption and offline reinforcement learning under the NUC assumption. When NUC and NDE hold, we propose a novel semi-offline reinforcement learning framework. This framework requires a weaker positivity assumption and introduces three new estimators: A direct method (DM), an inverse probability weighting (IPW), and a double reinforcement learning (DRL) estimator.</description>

      <title>Conformal Alignment: Knowing When to Trust Foundation Models with Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10301v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Before deploying outputs from foundation models in high-stakes tasks, it is imperative to ensure that they align with human values. For instance, in radiology report generation, reports generated by a vision-language model must align with human evaluations before their use in medical decision-making. This paper presents Conformal Alignment, a general framework for identifying units whose outputs meet a user-specified alignment criterion. It is guaranteed that on average, a prescribed fraction of selected units indeed meet the alignment criterion, regardless of the foundation model or the data distribution. Given any pre-trained model and new units with model-generated outputs, Conformal Alignment leverages a set of reference data with ground-truth alignment status to train an alignment predictor. It then selects new units whose predicted alignment scores surpass a data-dependent threshold, certifying their corresponding outputs as trustworthy. Through applications to question answering and radiology report generation, we demonstrate that our method is able to accurately identify units with trustworthy outputs via lightweight training over a moderate amount of reference data. En route, we investigate the informativeness of various features in alignment prediction and combine them with standard models to construct the alignment predictor.</description>

      <title>Dimension-free deterministic equivalents and scaling laws for random feature regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15699v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the generalization performance of random feature ridge regression (RFRR). Our main contribution is a general deterministic equivalent for the test error of RFRR. Specifically, under a certain concentration property, we show that the test error is well approximated by a closed-form expression that only depends on the feature map eigenvalues. Notably, our approximation guarantee is non-asymptotic, multiplicative, and independent of the feature map dimension -- allowing for infinite-dimensional features. We expect this deterministic equivalent to hold broadly beyond our theoretical analysis, and we empirically validate its predictions on various real and synthetic datasets. As an application, we derive sharp excess error rates under standard power-law assumptions of the spectrum and target decay. In particular, we provide a tight result for the smallest number of features achieving optimal minimax error rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel class of generative models based on piecewise deterministic Markov processes (PDMPs), a family of non-diffusive stochastic processes consisting of deterministic motion and random jumps at random times. Similarly to diffusions, such Markov processes admit time reversals that turn out to be PDMPs as well. We apply this observation to three PDMPs considered in the literature: the Zig-Zag process, Bouncy Particle Sampler, and Randomised Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. For these three particular instances, we show that the jump rates and kernels of the corresponding time reversals admit explicit expressions depending on some conditional densities of the PDMP under consideration before and after a jump. Based on these results, we propose efficient training procedures to learn these characteristics and consider methods to approximately simulate the reverse process. Finally, we provide bounds in the total variation distance between the data distribution and the resulting distribution of our model in the case where the base distribution is the standard $d$-dimensional Gaussian distribution. Promising numerical simulations support further investigations into this class of models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper establishes statistical properties of deep neural network (DNN) estimators under dependent data. Two general results for nonparametric sieve estimators directly applicable to DNN estimators are given. The first establishes rates for convergence in probability under nonstationary data. The second provides non-asymptotic probability bounds on $\mathcal{L}^{2}$-errors under stationary $\beta$-mixing data. I apply these results to DNN estimators in both regression and classification contexts imposing only a standard H\"older smoothness assumption. The DNN architectures considered are common in applications, featuring fully connected feedforward networks with any continuous piecewise linear activation function, unbounded weights, and a width and depth that grows with sample size. The framework provided also offers potential for research into other DNN architectures and time-series applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Statistical learning in high-dimensional spaces is challenging without a strong underlying data structure. Recent advances with foundational models suggest that text and image data contain such hidden structures, which help mitigate the curse of dimensionality. Inspired by results from nonparametric statistics, we hypothesize that this phenomenon can be partially explained in terms of decomposition of complex tasks into simpler subtasks. In this paper, we present a controlled experimental framework to test whether neural networks can indeed exploit such ``hidden factorial structures.'' We find that they do leverage these latent patterns to learn discrete distributions more efficiently, and derive scaling laws linking model sizes, hidden factorizations, and accuracy. We also study the interplay between our structural assumptions and the models' capacity for generalization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.13512v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mixup is a data augmentation technique that relies on training using random convex combinations of data points and their labels. In recent years, Mixup has become a standard primitive used in the training of state-of-the-art image classification models due to its demonstrated benefits over empirical risk minimization with regards to generalization and robustness. In this work, we try to explain some of this success from a feature learning perspective. We focus our attention on classification problems in which each class may have multiple associated features (or views) that can be used to predict the class correctly. Our main theoretical results demonstrate that, for a non-trivial class of data distributions with two features per class, training a 2-layer convolutional network using empirical risk minimization can lead to learning only one feature for almost all classes while training with a specific instantiation of Mixup succeeds in learning both features for every class. We also show empirically that these theoretical insights extend to the practical settings of image benchmarks modified to have multiple features.</description>

      <title>On the Global Convergence of Risk-Averse Policy Gradient Methods with Expected Conditional Risk Measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.10932v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Risk-sensitive reinforcement learning (RL) has become a popular tool for controlling the risk of uncertain outcomes and ensuring reliable performance in highly stochastic sequential decision-making problems. While Policy Gradient (PG) methods have been developed for risk-sensitive RL, it remains unclear if these methods enjoy the same global convergence guarantees as in the risk-neutral case \citep{mei2020global,agarwal2021theory,cen2022fast,bhandari2024global}. In this paper, we consider a class of dynamic time-consistent risk measures, named Expected Conditional Risk Measures (ECRMs), and derive PG and Natural Policy Gradient (NPG) updates for ECRMs-based RL problems. We provide global optimality {and iteration complexities} of the proposed algorithms under the following four settings: (i) PG with constrained direct parameterization, (ii) PG with softmax parameterization and log barrier regularization, (iii) NPG with softmax parameterization and entropy regularization, and (iv) approximate NPG with inexact policy evaluation. Furthermore, we test a risk-averse REINFORCE algorithm \citep{williams1992simple} and a risk-averse NPG algorithm \citep{kakade2001natural} on a stochastic Cliffwalk environment to demonstrate the efficacy of our methods and the importance of risk control.</description>

      <title>Robustly overfitting latents for flexible neural image compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17789v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural image compression has made a great deal of progress. State-of-the-art models are based on variational autoencoders and are outperforming classical models. Neural compression models learn to encode an image into a quantized latent representation that can be efficiently sent to the decoder, which decodes the quantized latent into a reconstructed image. While these models have proven successful in practice, they lead to sub-optimal results due to imperfect optimization and limitations in the encoder and decoder capacity. Recent work shows how to use stochastic Gumbel annealing (SGA) to refine the latents of pre-trained neural image compression models. We extend this idea by introducing SGA+, which contains three different methods that build upon SGA. We show how our method improves the overall compression performance in terms of the R-D trade-off, compared to its predecessors. Additionally, we show how refinement of the latents with our best-performing method improves the compression performance on both the Tecnick and CLIC dataset. Our method is deployed for a pre-trained hyperprior and for a more flexible model. Further, we give a detailed analysis of our proposed methods and show that they are less sensitive to hyperparameter choices. Finally, we show how each method can be extended to three- instead of two-class rounding.</description>

      <title>Shaving Weights with Occam's Razor: Bayesian Sparsification for Neural Networks Using the Marginal Likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural network sparsification is a promising avenue to save computational time and memory costs, especially in an age where many successful AI models are becoming too large to na\"ively deploy on consumer hardware. While much work has focused on different weight pruning criteria, the overall sparsifiability of the network, i.e., its capacity to be pruned without quality loss, has often been overlooked. We present Sparsifiability via the Marginal likelihood (SpaM), a pruning framework that highlights the effectiveness of using the Bayesian marginal likelihood in conjunction with sparsity-inducing priors for making neural networks more sparsifiable. Our approach implements an automatic Occam's razor that selects the most sparsifiable model that still explains the data well, both for structured and unstructured sparsification. In addition, we demonstrate that the pre-computed posterior Hessian approximation used in the Laplace approximation can be re-used to define a cheap pruning criterion, which outperforms many existing (more expensive) approaches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, especially at high sparsity levels, across a range of different neural network architectures and datasets.</description>

      <title>When Your AIs Deceive You: Challenges of Partial Observability in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17747v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Past analyses of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) assume that the human evaluators fully observe the environment. What happens when human feedback is based only on partial observations? We formally define two failure cases: deceptive inflation and overjustification. Modeling the human as Boltzmann-rational w.r.t. a belief over trajectories, we prove conditions under which RLHF is guaranteed to result in policies that deceptively inflate their performance, overjustify their behavior to make an impression, or both. Under the new assumption that the human's partial observability is known and accounted for, we then analyze how much information the feedback process provides about the return function. We show that sometimes, the human's feedback determines the return function uniquely up to an additive constant, but in other realistic cases, there is irreducible ambiguity. We propose exploratory research directions to help tackle these challenges, experimentally validate both the theoretical concerns and potential mitigations, and caution against blindly applying RLHF in partially observable settings.</description>

      <title>Predictive Analytics of Varieties of Potatoes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03701v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the application of machine learning algorithms specifically to enhance the selection process of Russet potato clones in breeding trials by predicting their suitability for advancement. This study addresses the challenge of efficiently identifying high-yield, disease-resistant, and climate-resilient potato varieties that meet processing industry standards. Leveraging data from manually collected trials in the state of Oregon, we investigate the potential of a wide variety of state-of-the-art binary classification models. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the dataset that includes preprocessing, feature engineering, and imputation to address missing values. We focus on several key metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) for model evaluation. The top-performing models, namely a feedforward neural network classifier (Neural Net), histogram-based gradient boosting classifier (HGBC), and a support vector machine classifier (SVC), demonstrate consistent and significant results. To further validate our findings, we conducted a simulation study using the aims, data-generating mechanisms, estimands, methods, and performance measures (ADEMP) framework, simulating different data-generating scenarios to assess model robustness and performance through true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative distributions area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) and MCC. The simulation results highlight that non-linear models like SVC and HGBC consistently show higher ROC and MCC than logistic regression, thus outperforming the traditional linear model across various distributions, and emphasizing the importance of model selection and tuning in agricultural trials.</description>

      <title>Recursive PAC-Bayes: A Frequentist Approach to Sequential Prior Updates with No Information Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: PAC-Bayesian analysis is a frequentist framework for incorporating prior knowledge into learning. It was inspired by Bayesian learning, which allows sequential data processing and naturally turns posteriors from one processing step into priors for the next. However, despite two and a half decades of research, the ability to update priors sequentially without losing confidence information along the way remained elusive for PAC-Bayes. While PAC-Bayes allows construction of data-informed priors, the final confidence intervals depend only on the number of points that were not used for the construction of the prior, whereas confidence information in the prior, which is related to the number of points used to construct the prior, is lost. This limits the possibility and benefit of sequential prior updates, because the final bounds depend only on the size of the final batch.
  We present a novel and, in retrospect, surprisingly simple and powerful PAC-Bayesian procedure that allows sequential prior updates with no information loss. The procedure is based on a novel decomposition of the expected loss of randomized classifiers. The decomposition rewrites the loss of the posterior as an excess loss relative to a downscaled loss of the prior plus the downscaled loss of the prior, which is bounded recursively. As a side result, we also present a generalization of the split-kl and PAC-Bayes-split-kl inequalities to discrete random variables, which we use for bounding the excess losses, and which can be of independent interest. In empirical evaluation the new procedure significantly outperforms state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Bridge Implicit Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15885v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Denoising diffusion bridge models (DDBMs) are a powerful variant of diffusion models for interpolating between two arbitrary paired distributions given as endpoints. Despite their promising performance in tasks like image translation, DDBMs require a computationally intensive sampling process that involves the simulation of a (stochastic) differential equation through hundreds of network evaluations. In this work, we take the first step in fast sampling of DDBMs without extra training, motivated by the well-established recipes in diffusion models. We generalize DDBMs via a class of non-Markovian diffusion bridges defined on the discretized timesteps concerning sampling, which share the same marginal distributions and training objectives, give rise to generative processes ranging from stochastic to deterministic, and result in diffusion bridge implicit models (DBIMs). DBIMs are not only up to 25$\times$ faster than the vanilla sampler of DDBMs but also induce a novel, simple, and insightful form of ordinary differential equation (ODE) which inspires high-order numerical solvers. Moreover, DBIMs maintain the generation diversity in a distinguished way, by using a booting noise in the initial sampling step, which enables faithful encoding, reconstruction, and semantic interpolation in image translation tasks.

      <description>arXiv:2406.01320v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically analyze the original version of the denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) presented in Ho, J., Jain, A., and Abbeel, P., Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 33 (2020), pp. 6840-6851. Our main theorem states that the sequence constructed by the original DDPM sampling algorithm weakly converges to a given data distribution as the number of time steps goes to infinity, under some asymptotic conditions on the parameters for the variance schedule, the $L^2$-based score estimation error, and the noise estimating function with respect to the number of time steps. In proving the theorem, we reveal that the sampling sequence can be seen as an exponential integrator type approximation of a reverse time stochastic differential equation over a finite time interval.</description>

      <title>How Does Gradient Descent Learn Features -- A Local Analysis for Regularized Two-Layer Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability of learning useful features is one of the major advantages of neural networks. Although recent works show that neural network can operate in a neural tangent kernel (NTK) regime that does not allow feature learning, many works also demonstrate the potential for neural networks to go beyond NTK regime and perform feature learning. Recently, a line of work highlighted the feature learning capabilities of the early stages of gradient-based training. In this paper we consider another mechanism for feature learning via gradient descent through a local convergence analysis. We show that once the loss is below a certain threshold, gradient descent with a carefully regularized objective will capture ground-truth directions. We further strengthen this local convergence analysis by incorporating early-stage feature learning analysis. Our results demonstrate that feature learning not only happens at the initial gradient steps, but can also occur towards the end of training.</description>

      <title>Aligning Model Properties via Conformal Risk Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI model alignment is crucial due to inadvertent biases in training data and the underspecified machine learning pipeline, where models with excellent test metrics may not meet end-user requirements. While post-training alignment via human feedback shows promise, these methods are often limited to generative AI settings where humans can interpret and provide feedback on model outputs. In traditional non-generative settings with numerical or categorical outputs, detecting misalignment through single-sample outputs remains challenging, and enforcing alignment during training requires repeating costly training processes. In this paper we consider an alternative strategy. We propose interpreting model alignment through property testing, defining an aligned model $f$ as one belonging to a subset $\mathcal{P}$ of functions that exhibit specific desired behaviors. We focus on post-processing a pre-trained model $f$ to better align with $\mathcal{P}$ using conformal risk control. Specifically, we develop a general procedure for converting queries for testing a given property $\mathcal{P}$ to a collection of loss functions suitable for use in a conformal risk control algorithm. We prove a probabilistic guarantee that the resulting conformal interval around $f$ contains a function approximately satisfying $\mathcal{P}$. We exhibit applications of our methodology on a collection of supervised learning datasets for (shape-constrained) properties such as monotonicity and concavity. The general procedure is flexible and can be applied to a wide range of desired properties. Finally, we prove that pre-trained models will always require alignment techniques even as model sizes or training data increase, as long as the training data contains even small biases.</description>

      <title>Privacy of the last iterate in cyclically-sampled DP-SGD on nonconvex composite losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differentially-private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) is a family of iterative machine learning training algorithms that privatize gradients to generate a sequence of differentially-private (DP) model parameters. It is also the standard tool used to train DP models in practice, even though most users are only interested in protecting the privacy of the final model. Tight DP accounting for the last iterate would minimize the amount of noise required while maintaining the same privacy guarantee and potentially increasing model utility. However, last-iterate accounting is challenging, and existing works require strong assumptions not satisfied by most implementations. These include assuming (i) the global sensitivity constant is known - to avoid gradient clipping; (ii) the loss function is Lipschitz or convex; and (iii) input batches are sampled randomly.
  In this work, we forego any unrealistic assumptions and provide privacy bounds for the most commonly used variant of DP-SGD, in which data is traversed cyclically, gradients are clipped, and only the last model is released. More specifically, we establish new Renyi differential privacy (RDP) upper bounds for the last iterate under realistic assumptions of small stepsize and Lipschitz smoothness of the loss function. Our general bounds also recover the special-case convex bounds when the weak-convexity parameter of the objective function approaches zero and no clipping is performed. The approach itself leverages optimal transport techniques for last iterate bounds, which is a nontrivial task when the data is traversed cyclically and the loss function is nonconvex.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Kernel Density Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a refined differentially private (DP) data structure for kernel density estimation (KDE), offering not only improved privacy-utility tradeoff but also better efficiency over prior results. Specifically, we study the mathematical problem: given a similarity function $f$ (or DP KDE) and a private dataset $X \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, our goal is to preprocess $X$ so that for any query $y\in\mathbb{R}^d$, we approximate $\sum_{x \in X} f(x, y)$ in a differentially private fashion. The best previous algorithm for $f(x,y) =\| x - y \|_1$ is the node-contaminated balanced binary tree by [Backurs, Lin, Mahabadi, Silwal, and Tarnawski, ICLR 2024]. Their algorithm requires $O(nd)$ space and time for preprocessing with $n=|X|$. For any query point, the query time is $d \log n$, with an error guarantee of $(1+\alpha)$-approximation and $\epsilon^{-1} \alpha^{-0.5} d^{1.5} R \log^{1.5} n$.
  In this paper, we improve the best previous result [Backurs, Lin, Mahabadi, Silwal, and Tarnawski, ICLR 2024] in three aspects:
  - We reduce query time by a factor of $\alpha^{-1} \log n$.
  - We improve the approximation ratio from $\alpha$ to 1.
  - We reduce the error dependence by a factor of $\alpha^{-0.5}$.
  From a technical perspective, our method of constructing the search tree differs from previous work [Backurs, Lin, Mahabadi, Silwal, and Tarnawski, ICLR 2024]. In prior work, for each query, the answer is split into $\alpha^{-1} \log n$ numbers, each derived from the summation of $\log n$ values in interval tree countings. In contrast, we construct the tree differently, splitting the answer into $\log n$ numbers, where each is a smart combination of two distance values, two counting values, and $y$ itself. We believe our tree structure may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Theory-inspired Label Shift Adaptation via Aligned Distribution Mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a prominent challenge in addressing real-world issues within a dynamic environment, label shift, which refers to the learning setting where the source (training) and target (testing) label distributions do not match, has recently received increasing attention. Existing label shift methods solely use unlabeled target samples to estimate the target label distribution, and do not involve them during the classifier training, resulting in suboptimal utilization of available information. One common solution is to directly blend the source and target distributions during the training of the target classifier. However, we illustrate the theoretical deviation and limitations of the direct distribution mixture in the label shift setting. To tackle this crucial yet unexplored issue, we introduce the concept of aligned distribution mixture, showcasing its theoretical optimality and generalization error bounds. By incorporating insights from generalization theory, we propose an innovative label shift framework named as Aligned Distribution Mixture (ADM). Within this framework, we enhance four typical label shift methods by introducing modifications to the classifier training process. Furthermore, we also propose a one-step approach that incorporates a pioneering coupling weight estimation strategy. Considering the distinctiveness of the proposed one-step approach, we develop an efficient bi-level optimization strategy. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches, together with their effectiveness in COVID-19 diagnosis applications.</description>
