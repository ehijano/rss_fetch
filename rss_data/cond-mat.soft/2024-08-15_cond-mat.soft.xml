      <title>Competing addition processes give distinct growth regimes in the assembly of 1D filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07257v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a model to describe the concentration-dependent growth of protein filaments. Our model contains two states, a low entropy/high affinity ordered state and a high entropy/low affinity disordered state. Consistent with experiments, our model shows a diffusion-limited linear growth regime at low concentration, followed by a concentration independent plateau at intermediate concentrations, and rapid disordered precipitation at the highest concentrations. We show that growth in the linear and plateau regions is the result of two processes that compete amid the rapid binding and unbinding of non-specific states. The first process is the addition of ordered molecules during the periods where the end of the filament is free of incorrectly bound molecules. The second process is the capture of defects, which occurs when consecutive ordered additions occur on top of incorrectly bound molecules. We show that a key molecular property is the probability that a diffusive collision results in a correctly bound state. Small values of this probability suppress the defect capture growth mode, resulting in a plateau in the growth rate when incorrectly bound molecules become common enough to poison ordered growth. We show that conditions that non-specifically suppress or enhance intermolecular interactions, such as the addition of depletants or osmolytes, have opposite effects on the growth rate in the linear and plateau regimes. In the linear regime stronger interactions promote growth by reducing dissolution events, but in the plateau regime stronger interactions inhibit growth by stabilizing incorrectly bound molecules.</description>

      <title>Enabling microrobotic chemotaxis via reset-free hierarchical reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microorganisms have evolved diverse strategies to propel in viscous fluids, navigate complex environments, and exhibit taxis in response to stimuli. This has inspired the development of synthetic microrobots, where machine learning (ML) is playing an increasingly important role. Can ML endow these robots with intelligence resembling that developed by their natural counterparts over evolutionary timelines? Here, we demonstrate chemotactic navigation of a multi-link articulated microrobot using two-level hierarchical reinforcement learning (RL). The lower-level RL allows the robot -- featuring either a chain or ring topology -- to acquire topology-specific swimming gaits: wave propagation characteristic of flagella or body oscillation akin to an ameboid. Such flagellar and ameboid microswimmers, further enabled by the higher-level RL, accomplish chemotactic navigation in prototypical biologically-relevant scenarios that feature conflicting chemoattractants, pursuing a swimming bacterial mimic, steering in vortical flows, and squeezing through tight constrictions. Additionally, we achieve reset-free, partially observable RL, where the robot observes only its joint angles and local scalar quantities. This advancement illuminates solutions for overcoming the persistent challenges of manual resets and partial observability in real-world microrobotic RL.</description>

      <title>Nematic and smectic phases with proper ferroelectric order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A material showing a sequence of three ferroelectric liquid crystalline phases below the paraelectric nematic phase has been synthesized and studied. The polar order of molecules appearing due to the dipole-dipole interactions in the NF phase is preserved also in the smectic phases: orthogonal SmAF and tilted SmCF. The ferroelectric ground state of both smectic phases was confirmed by their second harmonic generation activity and polarization switching. In SmCF phase polarization becomes oriented to electric field by decreasing the tilt angle to zero. Although both smectic phases are ferroelectric in nature, their dielectric response was found to be very different.</description>

      <title>Displacement correlations in a two-dimensional colloidal liquid and their relationship with shear strain correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correlations of the displacement field in a two-dimensional model colloidal liquid is studied numerically and analytically. By calculating the displacement correlations and the shear strain correlations from the numerical data of particle simulations, the displacement field is shown to have nontrivial correlations, even in liquids that are only slightly glassy with the area fraction as low as 0.5. It is suggested analytically and demonstrated numerically that the displacement correlations are more informative than the shear correlations: the former behaves logarithmically with regard to the spatial distance at shorter scales, while the corresponding information is missing from the shear correlations. The logarithmic behavior of the displacement correlations is interpreted as manifesting a long-lived aspect of the cage effect.</description>

      <title>Predictions of the interfacial free energy along the coexistence line from single-state calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The calculation of the interfacial free energy between two thermodynamic phases is crucial across different fields including materials science, chemistry, and condensed matter physics. This study delves into a thermodynamic approach to predict interfacial free energy along a coexistence line. For that purpose, we utilize Gibbs-Cahn integration method to accurately determine the interfacial free energy along various coexistence conditions, relying solely on data obtained from a single-state interfacial free energy calculation at given conditions of pressure and temperature. Unlike traditional methods that require individual measurements at each thermodynamic state, this approach significantly reduces computational demand and enhances efficiency. The integration scheme requires the computation of the excess interfacial energy (by means of unbiased NVT computer simulations in which the two phases involved coexist) at different points along the coexistence line, for later use this information as an input in our calculations. We apply this method for the Lennard-Jones and mW water model for the case of the liquid-solid interface, as well as Lennard-Jones and TIP4P/2005 models for liquid-vapor interfaces. Our results highlight the accuracy and effectiveness of this thermodynamic integration route for estimating the interfacial free energy along a coexistence line.</description>

      <title>Soliton radiation and role of the energy dissipation in soliton dynamics in an oscillating magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamics of the Davydov's soliton in an external oscillating in time magnetic field is studied analytically. It is shown that in a field perpendicular to the molecular chain axis, soliton wavefunction is a product of the electron plane wave in the plane perpendicular to the molecular chain, and longitudinal component of the wavefunction which satisfies the modified nonlinear Schroedinger equation with an extra term determined by the field. It is shown that soliton width and amplitude are constant, while its velocity and phase are oscillating functions of time with the frequency of the main harmonic equal to the magnetic field frequency. It is shown that soliton dynamics has two different regimes at low and high frequencies of the magnetic field as comparing with the characteristic soliton frequency. Due to time-depending velocity and nonzero acceleration, soliton radiates linear waves in both directions from its center of mass. In the presence of energy dissipation, soliton velocity is bound from above due to the balance of the energy gain from the magnetic field, and its loss because of the dissipation and radiation of linear sound waves. This balance occurs at the resonant frequency of the magnetic field. It is concluded that such significant impact of time-depending magnetic field on charge transport, provided by solitons, can affect functioning of the devices based on low-dimensional moolecular systems. These results suggest the physical mechanism of therapeutic effects of oscillating magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Work and Activation in a Nematic Polymer Network Ribbon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study spontaneous deformations of a ribbon made of nematic polymer networks and activated under the action of a mechanical load. We show that when such ribbons are activated appropriately, the deformations produced can pull back and perform work against the externally applied load. We perform two numerical experiments to demonstrate this effect: (1) the \emph{pulling} experiment, where the ribbon is pulled longitudinally by a point force, and (2) the \emph{bending} experiment, where the ribbon is bent out of plane by a terminally applied point force. We quantify the capacity of the ribbon to work against external loads, and compute its dependence on both the ribbon thickness and the imprinted nematic texture (that is, the distribution of the nematic directors across the ribbon's length). Finally, we compute the efficiency of the activation process. Building on the outcomes of our numerical explorations, we formulate two educated conjectures on how the activation efficiency can in general be improved by acting on both the applied load and the imprinted nematic texture.</description>

      <title>Graph polyhedral divisions in growing cell aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the recently proposed Graph Vertex Model (GVM), cellular rearrangements are implemented as local graph transformations of the cell aggregate, represented by a knowledge graph [1]. This study extends GVM to incorporate cell division, a critical biological process involved in morphogenesis, homeostasis, and disease progression. Like cellular rearrangements, cell division in GVM begins by identifying a subgraph of nodes and links, involved in the division, by matching suitable graph patterns or templates within the full knowledge graph. The matched subgraph is then transformed to incorporate topological changes within the knowledge graph, caused by the division event. Importantly, when this transformation is applied to a polygon in a 2D tiling, it performs the transformation, required to divide a polygon, indicating that the 3D graph transformation is general and applicable also to 2D vertex models. Our extension of GVM enables the study of the dynamics of growing cell aggregates in 3D to offer new insights into developmental processes and cancer growth.</description>

      <title>Polymeric Properties of Higher-Order G-Quadruplex Telomeric Structures: Effects of Chemically Inert Crowders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: G-quadruplexes are non-canonical DNA structures rather ubiquitous in human genome, which are thought to play a crucial role in the development of 85-90 % of cancers. Here, we present a novel coarse-grained approach in modeling G-quadruplexes which accounts for their structural flexibility. We apply it to study the polymeric properties of G-quadruplex multimers, with and without crowder particles, to mimic in-vivo conditions. We find that, contrary to some suggestions found in the literature, long G-quadruplex multimers are rather flexible polymeric macromolecules, with a local persistence length comparable to monomer size, exhibiting chain stiffness variation profile consistent with a real polymer in good solvent. Moreover, in a crowded environment (up to 10% volume fraction), we report that G-quadruplex multimers exhibit an increased propensity for coiling, with a corresponding decrease in the measured chain stiffness. Accurately accounting for the polymeric properties of G4 multimers is crucial for understanding their interactions with anticancer G4-targeting drugs, thereby significantly enhancing the design and effectiveness of these drugs.</description>

      <title>The Onset of Intermittency in Active Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent results suggest that highly active, chaotic, non-equilibrium states of living fluids might share much in common with high Reynolds number, inertial turbulence. We now show, by using a hydrodynamical model, the onset of intermittency and the consequent multiscaling of Eulerian and Lagrangian structure functions as a function of the bacterial activity. Our results bridge the worlds of low and high Reynolds number flows as well as open up intriguing possibilities of what makes flows intermittent.</description>
