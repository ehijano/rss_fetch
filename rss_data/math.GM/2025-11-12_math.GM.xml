      <title>Convergence of Sz\'asz-Mirakyan-Durrmeyer operators having Laguerre-type weight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new family of Szasz-Mirakyan-Durrmeyer operators defined on the half-line [0,\infty), constructed using Laguerre-type kernels. We discuss in detail the algebraic structure and analytical properties of these operators. thoroughly investigated. Explicit closed-form expressions for the moments are derived, along with a differential recurrence relation connecting successive moments. Quantitative estimates on compact intervals are obtained, and Weighted approximation results are provided for unbounded functions. Furthermore, the asymptotic behavior of the central moment is analyzed. We establish both local and global $L_p$-convergence results and identify the eigenfunctions associated with these operators. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed generalized operators in extending classical approximation results to the unbounded domain.</description>

      <title>Inequalities involving a Ramanujan Integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, various properties of the Ramanujan integral $I_R(x)$, defined as \begin{align*}
  I_R(x) = \int_0^\infty e^{-xt} \dfrac{dt}{t(\pi^2 + \log^2 t)}, \quad x&gt;0, \end{align*} are investigated, including its monotonicity, subadditivity, as well as convexity. Furthermore, it is shown that the Ramanujan integral admits an antiderivative that belongs to the class of Bernstein functions. Subsequently, we examine a Turan-type function involving the Ramanujan integral given by \begin{align*}
  H_n(x;\alpha) = \left(I_R^{(n)}(x)\right)^2 - \alpha I_R^{(n-1)}(x) I_R^{(n+1)}(x), \quad x&gt;0, \end{align*}
  and establish its complete monotonicity under certain conditions on $\alpha$. Graphical evidences are given for the results where few ranges are yet to be established, providing scope for future research.</description>

      <title>Complete Monotonicity of the function involving derivatives of Barnes G-function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we present the complete monotonicity of functions defined in terms of the poly-double gamma function \begin{align*}
  \psi_2^{(n)}(x) = (-1)^{n+1} n! \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \dfrac{(1+k)}{(x+k)^{n+1}}, \quad x &gt; 0, \ n\geq 2. \end{align*} Consequently, we derive bounds for the ratio involving $\psi_2^{(n)}(x)$ and apply these bounds to establish the convexity, subadditivity and superadditivity of $\psi_2^{(n)}(x)$. In the process, various fundamental properties of $\psi_2^{(n)}(x)$ are established, including recurrence relations, integral representations, asymptotic expansions, complete monotonicity, and related inequalities. Graphical illustrations are provided to support the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>A space-fractional reaction-diffusion system with cylindrical symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion within porous media, such as biological tissues, exhibits departures from conventional Fick's laws, which could result in space-fractional diffusion. The paper considers a reaction-diffusion system with two spatial compartments -- a proximal one of finite radius having a source, and an outer one extending to infinity where the source is not present but first-order decay of the diffusing species takes place. The system models the foreign body reaction around an implanted electrode. Microscopic heterogeneity inside the tissue was modeled by a space-fractional Riesz Laplacian acting on the concentration. This allows for a flexible approach when estimating transport parameters from experimental data. The steady-state of the system is solved in terms of Hankel and Mellin transforms, resulting in a Fox H-function. In the integer-order case, the analytical solution reduces to a superposition of modified Bessel functions of the first and second kinds. Solutions are exhibited by numerical quadrature of the involved Bessel function integrals.</description>

      <title>Real and complex spherical designs and their Gramian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If a (weighted) spherical design is defined as an integration (cubature) rule for a unitarily invariant space P of polynomials (on the sphere), then any unitary image of it is also such a spherical design. It therefore follows that such spherical designs are determined by their Gramian (Gram matrix). We outline a general method to obtain such a characterisation as the minima of a function of the Gramian, which we call a potential. This characterisation can be used for the numerical and analytic construction of spherical designs. When the space P of polynomials is not irreducible under the action of the unitary group, then the potential is not unique. In several cases of interest, e.g., spherical t-designs and half-designs, we use this flexibility to provide potentials with a very simple form. We then use our results to develop certain aspects of the theory of real and complex spherical designs for unitarily invariant polynomial spaces.</description>

      <title>From Bernoulli Numbers to Selector Kernels: Fredholm Determinants, {\zeta}-Regularization, and the Bridge Between Discrete and Continuous Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a unified analytic framework connecting Bernoulli numbers, zeta-regularization, and Fredholm determinants associated with trigonometric selector kernels. Starting from the Bernoulli-Stirling algebra, Euler-Maclaurin corrections are reinterpreted as spectral traces of compact operators. This bridge transforms discrete combinatorial data into continuous spectral quantities, showing that their determinants interpolate between finite-rank projectors and the sine-kernel of random-matrix theory. In the continuum limit the Fredholm determinant becomes a Painleve-V~tau-function, revealing a hierarchy in which Bernoulli coefficients and zeta-constants jointly describe the local-global asymptotics of analytic regularization.</description>

      <title>The Bailey-Zeta Transform and its Classical Limit to the Riemann Zeta Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a unified analytic and algebraic framework connecting the theory of Bailey pairs with $q$-deformations of the Riemann zeta function. First, an algebraic theorem (Bailey-Zeta transform) extends the classical Bailey lemma to sequences weighted by a zeta-type factor $q^{sr}$. Next, we establish rigorously that the generating function arising from the pair $\alpha_r\equiv1$ converges, under the scaling $(1-q)^s$, to $\zeta(s)$ as $q\to1^-$. A $q$-analogue of the Euler--Mascheroni constant naturally emerges from this framework, and its limit is shown to recover $\gamma$. The approach highlights a deep correspondence between combinatorial $q$-series identities and analytic number theory.</description>
