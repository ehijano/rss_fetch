      <title>Semi-covariety of numerical semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main aim of this work is to introduce and justify the study of semi-covarities. A {\it semi-covariety} is a non-empty family $\mathcal{F}$ of numerical semigroups such that it is closed under finite intersections, has a minimum, $\min(\mathcal{F}),$ and if $S\in \mathcal{F}$ being $S\neq \min(\mathcal{F})$, then there is $x\in S$ such that $S\backslash \{x\}\in \mathcal{F}$. As examples, we will study the semi-covariety formed by all the numerical semigroups containing a fixed numerical semigroup, and the semi-covariety composed by all the numerical semigroups of coated odd elements and fixed Frobenius number.</description>

      <title>Bizonotopal Graphical Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zonotopal algebras (external, central, and internal) of an undirected graph G introduced by Postnikov-Shapiro and Holtz-Ron, are finite-dimensional commutative graded algebras whose Hilbert series contain a wealth of combinatorial information about G. In this paper, we associate to G a new family of algebras, which we call bizonotopal, because their definition involves doubling the set of edges of G. These algebras are monomial and have intricate properties related, among other things, to the combinatorics of graphical parking functions and their polytopes.
  Unlike the case of usual zonotopal algebras, the Hilbert series of bizonotopal algebras are not specializations of the Tutte polynomial of G. Still, we show that in the external and central cases these Hilbert series satisfy a modified deletion-contraction relation. In addition, we prove that the external bizonotopal algebra is a complete graph invariant.</description>

      <title>The Rees algebra and analytic spread of a divisorial filtration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate some properties of Rees algebras of divisorial filtrations and their analytic spread. A classical theorem of McAdam shows that the analytic spread of an ideal $I$ in a formally equidimensional local ring is equal to the dimension of the ring if and only if the maximal ideal is an associated prime of $R/\overline{I^n}$ for some $n$. We show in Theorem 1.6 that McAdam's theorem holds for $\mathbb Q$-divisorial filtrations in an equidimensional local ring which is essentially of finite type over a field. This generalizes an earlier result for $\mathbb Q$-divisorial filtrations in an equicharacteristic zero excellent local domain by the author. This theorem does not hold for more general filtrations.
  We consider the question of the asymptotic behavior of the function $n\mapsto \lambda_R(R/I_n)$ for a $\mathbb Q$-divisorial filtration $\mathcal I=\{I_n\}$ of $m_R$-primary ideals on a $d$-dimensional normal excellent local ring. It is known from earlier work of the author that the multiplicity $$ e(\mathcal I)=d! \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{\lambda_R(R/I_n)}{n^d} $$ can be irrational. We show in Lemma 4.1 that the limsup of the first difference function $$ \limsup_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{\lambda_R(I_n/I_{n+1})}{n^{d-1}} $$ is always finite for a $\mathbb Q$-divisorial filtration. We then give an example in Section 4 showing that this limsup may not exist as a limit.
  In the final section, we give an example of a symbolic filtration $\{P^{(n)}\}$ of a prime ideal $P$ in a normal two dimensional excellent local ring which has the property that the set of Rees valuations of all the symbolic powers $P^{(n)}$ of $P$ is infinite.</description>

      <title>Auslander-Reiten annihilators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Auslander-Reiten Conjecture for commutative Noetherian rings predicts that a finitely generated module is projective when certain Ext-modules vanish. But what if those Ext-modules do not vanish? We study the annihilators of these Ext-modules and formulate a generalisation of the Auslander-Reiten Conjecture. We prove this general version for high syzygies of modules over several classes of rings including analytically unramified Arf rings, 2-dimensional local normal domains with rational singularities, Gorenstein isolated singularities of Krull dimension at least 2 and more. We also prove results for the special case of the canonical module of a Cohen-Macaulay local ring. These results both generalise and also provide evidence for a version of Tachikawa Conjecture that was considered by Dao-Kobayashi-Takahashi.</description>

      <title>Lyubeznik tables of $S_r$ and $CM_r$ rings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the shape of the Lyubeznik table of either rings in positive characteristic or Stanley-Reisner rings in any characteristic when they satisfy Serre's condition $S_r$ or they are Cohen-Macaulay in a given codimension, condition denoted by $CM_r$. Moreover we show that these results are sharp.</description>

      <title>On rigidity of Pham-Brieskorn surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well known that, over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic zero, for any three integers $a,b,c\geq 2$, any Pham-Brieskorn surface $B_{(a,b,c)}:= k[X,Y,Z]/(X^a + Y^b + Z^c)$ is rigid when at most one of $a,b,c$ is 2 and stably rigid when $\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c}\leq 1$. In this paper we consider Pham-Brieskorn domains over an arbitrary field $k$ of characteristic $p\geq 0$ and give sufficient conditions on $(a,b,c)$ for which any Pham-Brieskorn domain $B_{(a,b,c)}$ is rigid. This gives an alternative approach to showing that there does not exist any non-trivial exponential map on $k[X,Y,Z,T]/(X^mY+T^{p^rq} + Z^{p^e})= k[x,y,z,t]$, for $m,q&gt;1$, $p\nmid mq$ and $e&gt;r\geq 1$, fixing $y$, a crucial result used in the paper "On the cancellation problem for the affine space $\mathbb{A}^3$ in characteristic $p$" by first author, to show that the Zariski Cancellation Problem (ZCP) does not hold for the affine $3$-space.
  We also provide a sufficient condition for $B_{(a,b,c)}$ to be stably rigid. Along the way we prove that for integers $a,b,c\geq 2$ with $gcd(a,b,c) = 1$ and for $F(Y)\in k[Y]$, the ring $k[X,Y,Z]/(X^aY^b + Z^c+ F(Y))$ is a rigid domain.</description>

      <title>Generic derivations on algebraically bounded structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20511v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let K be an algebraically bounded structure and T be its theory. If T is model complete, then the theory of K endowed with a derivation, denoted by $T^{\delta}$, has a model completion. Additionally, we prove that if the theory T is stable/NIP then the model completion of $T^{\delta}$ is also stable/NIP. Similar results hold for the theory with several derivations, either commuting or non-commuting.</description>
