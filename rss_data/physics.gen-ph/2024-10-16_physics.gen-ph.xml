      <title>The Role of Singular Solutions in the Study of Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The necessity and benefit of singular solutions in the study of physical systems is shown. By singular solutions we mean solutions that are not contained in the general solution of the system of equations that describes the dynamic system under study. In addition, at the points of singular solutions the conditions of the uniqueness theorem are violated. It is shown that the presence of singular solutions, first of all, leads to the emergence of chaotic regimes. The dynamics of the system under study in the presence of singular solutions can differ radically from the dynamics in which singular solutions are not considered. It is shown that in many cases, in the presence of singular solutions, the system under study may turn out to be anomalously sensitive to small perturbations. Typically, singular solutions are not considered at analysing the dynamics of physical systems. It is shown that taking such solutions into account even in well-studied physical problems (for example, in the Kepler problem) can lead to unusual chaotic regimes. Examples of physical systems in which considering singular solutions turned out to be useful are given. It is shown that the use of an invariant measure provides a simple criterion for the appearance of singular solutions. It is shown that any regular function can be represented as a set of random functions.</description>

      <title>Resolving inconsistencies in Relativistic Thermodynamics with four-entropy and four-heat current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address long-standing inconsistencies in relativistic thermodynamics, particularly the ambiguities in temperature transformations and entropy evolution in moving or accelerating frames. Traditional approaches often lead to spurious entropy dissipation or generation in accelerating frames, contradicting the second law of thermodynamics. By introducing four-entropy and four-heat current, we resolve the problematic terms related to Lorentz factor dependence, eliminating unphysical entropy production. We also show that transformations like $T^{\prime}=\frac{T}{\gamma}$ and $T^{\prime}=T \gamma$ introduce an additional unphysical source of entropy dissipation or generation without real heat flow, driven by temperature gradients from relative motion. By adopting the covariant transformation $T^{\prime}=T$ and treating heat and entropy as four-vectors, we resolve these inconsistencies and offer a coherent framework for relativistic thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>On the Main Factor That Causes the Instabilities of the Earth Rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03244v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Earth rotation is one of astronomical phenomena without which it is impossible to think of human life. That is why the investigation on the Earth rotation is very important and it has a long history of study. Invention of quartz clocks in the 1930s and atomic time 1950s and introduction of modern technology into astronomic observation in recent years resulted in rapid development of the study in Earth's rotation. The theory of the Earth rotation, however, has not been up to the high level of astronomic observation due to limitation of the time such as impossibility of quantitative calculation of moment of external force for Euler's dynamical equation based on Newtoniam mechanics. As a typical example, we can take the problems that cover the instabilities of the Earth's rotation proved completely by the astronomic observations as well as polar motion, the precession and nutation of the Earth rotation axis which have not been described in a single equation in a quantitative way from the unique law of the Earth rotation. In particular, at present the problem of what the main factor causing the instabilities of the Earth rotation is has not been solved clearly in quantitative ways yet. Therefore, this paper addresses a quantitative proof that the main factor which causes the instabilities of the Earth rotation is the moment of external force rather than variations in the relative atmospheric angular momentum and in moment of inertia of the Earth's body due to the time limitation and under some assumptions. Then the future direction of research is proposed.</description>
