      <title>Application of Machine Learning Models for Carbon Monoxide and Nitrogen Oxides Emission Prediction in Gas Turbines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the environmental impacts linked to hazardous emissions from gas turbines, with a specific focus on employing various machine learning (ML) models to predict the emissions of Carbon Monoxide (CO) and Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) as part of a Predictive Emission Monitoring System (PEMS). We employ a comprehensive approach using multiple predictive models to offer insights on enhancing regulatory compliance and optimizing operational parameters to reduce environmental effects effectively. Our investigation explores a range of machine learning models including linear models, ensemble methods, and neural networks. The models we assess include Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, XGBoost, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). This analysis provides a comparative overview of the performance of these ML models in estimating CO and NOx emissions from gas turbines, aiming to highlight the most effective techniques for this critical task. Accurate ML models for predicting gas turbine emissions help reduce environmental impact by enabling real-time adjustments and supporting effective emission control strategies, thus promoting sustainability.</description>

      <title>Advancing Brainwave-Based Biometrics: A Large-Scale, Multi-Session Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of brainwave-based biometrics has gained attention for its potential to revolutionize user authentication through hands-free interaction, resistance to shoulder surfing, continuous authentication, and revocability. However, current research often relies on single-session or limited-session datasets with fewer than 55 subjects, raising concerns about generalizability and robustness. To address this gap, we conducted a large-scale study using a public brainwave dataset of 345 subjects and over 6,000 sessions (averaging 17 per subject) recorded over five years with three headsets. Our results reveal that deep learning approaches outperform classic feature extraction methods by 16.4\% in Equal Error Rates (EER) and comparing features using a simple cosine distance metric outperforms binary classifiers, which require extra negative samples for training. We also observe EER degrades over time (e.g., 7.7\% after 1 day to 19.69\% after a year). Therefore, it is necessary to reinforce the enrollment set after successful login attempts. Moreover, we demonstrate that fewer brainwave measurement sensors can be used, with an acceptable increase in EER, which is necessary for transitioning from medical-grade to affordable consumer-grade devices. Finally, we compared our findings with prior work on brainwave authentication and industrial biometric standards. While our performance is comparable or superior to prior work through the use of Supervised Contrastive Learning, standards remain unmet. However, we project that achieving industrial standards will be possible by training the feature extractor with at least 1,500 subjects. Moreover, we open-sourced our analysis code to promote further research.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Near-field and Far-field Localization with Holographic MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to its ability to precisely control wireless beams, holographic multiple-input multiple-output (HMIMO) is expected to be a promising solution to achieve high-accuracy localization. However, as the scale of HMIMO increases to improve beam control capability, the corresponding near-field (NF) region expands, indicating that users may exist in both NF and far-field (FF) regions with different electromagnetic transmission characteristics. As a result, existing methods for pure NF or FF localization are no longer applicable. We consider a hybrid NF and FF localization scenario in this paper, where a base station (BS) locates multiple users in both NF and FF regions with the aid of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), which is a low-cost implementation of HMIMO. In such a scenario, it is difficult to locate the users and optimize the RIS phase shifts because whether the location of the user is in the NF or FF region is unknown, and the channels of different users are coupled. To tackle this challenge, we propose a RIS-enabled localization method that searches the users in both NF and FF regions and tackles the coupling issue by jointly estimating all user locations. We derive the localization error bound by considering the channel coupling and propose an RIS phase shift optimization algorithm that minimizes the derived bound. Simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed method and demonstrate the performance gain compared to pure NF and FF techniques.</description>

      <title>On the challenges of detecting MCI using EEG in the wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown promising results in the detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) using easily accessible Electroencephalogram (EEG) data which would help administer early and effective treatment for dementia patients. However, the reliability and practicality of such systems remains unclear. In this work, we investigate the potential limitations and challenges in developing a robust MCI detection method using two contrasting datasets: 1) CAUEEG, collected and annotated by expert neurologists in controlled settings and 2) GENEEG, a new dataset collected and annotated in general practice clinics, a setting where routine MCI diagnoses are typically made. We find that training on small datasets, as is done by most previous works, tends to produce high variance models that make overconfident predictions, and are unreliable in practice. Additionally, distribution shifts between datasets make cross-domain generalization challenging. Finally, we show that MCI detection using EEG may suffer from fundamental limitations because of the overlapping nature of feature distributions with control groups. We call for more effort in high-quality data collection in actionable settings (like general practice clinics) to make progress towards this salient goal of non-invasive MCI detection.</description>

      <title>SOLAS: Superpositioning an Optical Lens in Automotive Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automotive Simulation is a potentially cost-effective strategy to identify and test corner case scenarios in automotive perception. Recent work has shown a significant shift in creating realistic synthetic data for road traffic scenarios using a video graphics engine. However, a gap exists in modeling realistic optical aberrations associated with cameras in automotive simulation. This paper builds on the concept from existing literature to model optical degradations in simulated environments using the Python-based ray-tracing library KrakenOS. As a novel pipeline, we degrade automotive fisheye simulation using an optical doublet with +/-2 deg Field of View (FOV), introducing realistic optical artifacts into two simulation images from SynWoodscape and Parallel Domain Woodscape. We evaluate KrakenOS by calculating the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), which averaged around 0.023 across the RGB light spectrum compared to Ansys Zemax OpticStudio, an industrial benchmark for optical design and simulation. Lastly, we measure the image sharpness of the degraded simulation using the ISO12233:2023 Slanted Edge Method and show how both qualitative and measured results indicate the extent of the spatial variation in image sharpness from the periphery to the center of the degradations.</description>

      <title>Split-Aperture Phased Array Radar Resource Management for Tracking Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next generation of radar systems will include advanced digital front-end technology in the apertures allowing for spatially subdividing radar tasks over the array, the so-called split-aperture phased array (SAPA) concept. The goal of this paper is to introduce radar resource management for the SAPA concept and to demonstrate the added benefit of the SAPA concept for active tracking tasks. To do so, the radar resource management problem is formulated and solved by employing the quality of service based resource allocation model (Q-RAM) framework. As active tracking tasks may be scheduled simultaneously, the resource allocation of tasks becomes dependent on the other tasks. The solution to the resource allocation problem is obtained by introducing the adaptive fast traversal algorithm combined with a three dimensional strip packing algorithm to handle task dependencies. It will be demonstrated by a simulation example that the SAPA concept can significantly increase the number of active tracks of a multifunction radar system compared to scheduling tasks sequentially.</description>

      <title>Multi-Task Over-the-Air Federated Learning in Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless devices are expected to provide a wide range of AI services in 6G networks. The increasing computing capabilities of wireless devices and the surge of wireless data motivate the use of privacy-preserving federated learning (FL). In contrast to centralized learning that requires sending large amounts of raw data during uplink transmission, only local model parameters are uploaded in FL. Meanwhile, over-the-air (OtA) computation is considered as a communication-efficient solution for fast FL model aggregation by exploiting the superposition properties of wireless multi-access channels. The required communication resources in OtA FL do not scale with the number of FL devices. However, OtA FL is significantly affected by the uneven signal attenuation experienced by different FL devices. Moreover, the coexistence of multiple FL groups with different FL tasks brings about inter-group interference. These challenges cannot be well addressed by conventional cellular network architectures. Recently, Cell-free Massive MIMO (mMIMO) has emerged as a promising technology to provide uniform coverage and high rates via joint coherent transmission. In this paper, we investigate multi-task OtA FL in Cell-free mMIMO systems. We propose optimal designs of transmit coefficients and receive combining at different levels of cooperation among the access points, aiming to minimize the sum of OtA model aggregation errors across all FL groups. Numerical results demonstrate that Cell-free mMIMO significantly outperforms conventional Cellular mMIMO in term of the FL convergence performance by operating at appropriate cooperation levels.</description>

      <title>A framework for IoT-Enabled Smart Agriculture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unpredictable weather patterns and a lack of timely, accurate information significantly challenge farmers in Uganda, leading to poor crop management, reduced yields, and heightened vulnerability to environmental stress. This research presents a framework for IoT-enabled smart agriculture, leveraging Raspberry Pi-based technology to provide real-time monitoring of weather and environmental conditions. The framework integrates sensors for temperature, rainfall, soil moisture, and pressure, connected via an MCP3208 analog-to-digital converter. Data is displayed on an LCD for immediate feedback and transmitted to the ThingSpeak platform for centralized storage, analysis, and remote access through a mobile app or web interface. Farmers can leverage this framework to optimize irrigation schedules and improve crop productivity through actionable insights derived from real-time and forecasted data on rainfall, temperature, pressure and soil moisture. Additionally, the system incorporates predictive weather forecasting to dynamically control sensor activity, reducing energy consumption and extending sensor lifespan. Simulated using Proteus, the proposed framework demonstrates significant potential to mitigate the impacts of unpredictable weather by reducing water consumption, improving forecasting accuracy, and boosting productivity.</description>

      <title>SCDM: Score-Based Channel Denoising Model for Digital Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Score-based diffusion models represent a significant variant within the diffusion model family and have seen extensive application in the increasingly popular domain of generative tasks. Recent investigations have explored the denoising potential of diffusion models in semantic communications. However, in previous paradigms, noise distortion in the diffusion process does not match precisely with digital channel noise characteristics. In this work, we introduce the Score-Based Channel Denoising Model (SCDM) for Digital Semantic Communications (DSC). SCDM views the distortion of constellation symbol sequences in digital transmission as a score-based forward diffusion process. We design a tailored forward noise corruption to align digital channel noise properties in the training phase. During the inference stage, the well-trained SCDM can effectively denoise received semantic symbols under various SNR conditions, reducing the difficulty for the semantic decoder in extracting semantic information from the received noisy symbols and thereby enhancing the robustness of the reconstructed semantic information. Experimental results show that SCDM outperforms the baseline model in PSNR, SSIM, and MSE metrics, particularly at low SNR levels. Moreover, SCDM reduces storage requirements by a factor of 7.8. This efficiency in storage, combined with its robust denoising capability, makes SCDM a practical solution for DSC across diverse channel conditions.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of NR Sidelink and Wi-Fi Coexistence Networks in Unlicensed Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of various internet of things (IoT) applications, including industrial IoT (IIoT) and visual IoT (VIoT), the demand for direct device-to-device communication to support high data rates continues to grow. To address this demand, 5G-Advanced has introduced sidelink communication over the unlicensed spectrum (SL-U) as a method to increase data rates. However, the primary challenge of SL-U in the unlicensed spectrum is ensuring fair coexistence with other incumbent systems, such as Wi-Fi. In this paper, we address the challenge by designing channel access mechanisms and power control strategies to mitigate interference and ensure fair coexistence. First, we propose a novel collaborative channel access (CCHA) mechanism that integrates channel access with resource allocation through collaborative interactions between base stations (BS) and SL-U users. This mechanism ensures fair coexistence with incumbent systems while improving resource utilization. Second, we mathematically model the joint channel access and power control problems, analyzing the trade-off between fairness and transmission rate to minimize interference and optimize performance in the coexistence system. Finally, we develop a collaborative subgoal-based hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (C-GHDRL) framework. This framework enables SL-U users to make globally optimal decisions by leveraging collaborative operations between the BS and SL-U users, effectively overcoming the limitations of traditional optimization methods in solving joint optimization problems with nonlinear constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly enhances the coexistence system's performance while ensuring fair coexistence between SL-U and Wi-Fi users.</description>

      <title>Assessment of the January 2025 Los Angeles County wildfires: A multi-modal analysis of impact, response, and population exposure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive analysis of four significant California wildfires: Palisades, Eaton, Kenneth, and Hurst, examining their impacts through multiple dimensions, including land cover change, jurisdictional management, structural damage, and demographic vulnerability. Using the Chebyshev-Kolmogorov-Arnold network model applied to Sentinel-2 imagery, the extent of burned areas was mapped, ranging from 315.36 to 10,960.98 hectares. Our analysis revealed that shrubland ecosystems were consistently the most affected, comprising 57.4-75.8% of burned areas across all events. The jurisdictional assessment demonstrated varying management complexities, from singular authority (98.7% in the Palisades Fire) to distributed management across multiple agencies. A structural impact analysis revealed significant disparities between urban interface fires (Eaton: 9,869 structures; Palisades: 8,436 structures) and rural events (Kenneth: 24 structures; Hurst: 17 structures). The demographic analysis showed consistent gender distributions, with 50.9% of the population identified as female and 49.1% as male. Working-age populations made up the majority of the affected populations, ranging from 53.7% to 54.1%, with notable temporal shifts in post-fire periods. The study identified strong correlations between urban interface proximity, structural damage, and population exposure. The Palisades and Eaton fires affected over 20,000 people each, compared to fewer than 500 in rural events. These findings offer valuable insights for the development of targeted wildfire management strategies, particularly in wildland urban interface zones, and emphasize the need for age- and gender-conscious approaches in emergency response planning.</description>

      <title>RayLoc: Wireless Indoor Localization via Fully Differentiable Ray-tracing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless indoor localization has been a pivotal area of research over the last two decades, becoming a cornerstone for numerous sensing applications. However, conventional wireless localization methods rely on channel state information to perform blind modelling and estimation of a limited set of localization parameters. This oversimplification neglects many sensing scene details, resulting in suboptimal localization accuracy. To address this limitation, this paper presents a novel approach to wireless indoor localization by reformulating it as an inverse problem of wireless ray-tracing, inferring scene parameters that generates the measured CSI. At the core of our solution is a fully differentiable ray-tracing simulator that enables backpropagation to comprehensive parameters of the sensing scene, allowing for precise localization. To establish a robust localization context, RayLoc constructs a high-fidelity sensing scene by refining coarse-grained background model. Furthermore, RayLoc overcomes the challenges of sparse gradient and local minima by convolving the signal generation process with a Gaussian kernel. Extensive experiments showcase that RayLoc outperforms traditional localization baselines and is able to generalize to different sensing environments.</description>

      <title>Explainable and Robust Millimeter Wave Beam Alignment for AI-Native 6G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated artificial intelligence (AI) and communication has been recognized as a key pillar of 6G and beyond networks. In line with AI-native 6G vision, explainability and robustness in AI-driven systems are critical for establishing trust and ensuring reliable performance in diverse and evolving environments. This paper addresses these challenges by developing a robust and explainable deep learning (DL)-based beam alignment engine (BAE) for millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The proposed convolutional neural network (CNN)-based BAE utilizes received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurements over a set of wide beams to accurately predict the best narrow beam for each UE, significantly reducing the overhead associated with exhaustive codebook-based narrow beam sweeping for initial access (IA) and data transmission. To ensure transparency and resilience, the Deep k-Nearest Neighbors (DkNN) algorithm is employed to assess the internal representations of the network via nearest neighbor approach, providing human-interpretable explanations and confidence metrics for detecting out-of-distribution inputs. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DL-based BAE exhibits robustness to measurement noise, reduces beam training overhead by 75% compared to the exhaustive search while maintaining near-optimal performance in terms of spectral efficiency. Moreover, the proposed framework improves outlier detection robustness by up to 5x and offers clearer insights into beam prediction decisions compared to traditional softmax-based classifiers.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, achieving full autonomy in driving has emerged as a paramount objective for both the industry and academia. Among various perception technologies, Lidar (Light detection and ranging) stands out for its high-precision and high-resolution capabilities based on the principle of light propagation and coupling ranging module and imaging module. Lidar is a sophisticated system that integrates multiple technologies such as optics, mechanics, circuits, and algorithms. Therefore, there are various feasible Lidar schemes to meet the needs of autonomous driving in different scenarios. The ranging performance of Lidar is a key factor that determines the overall performance of autonomous driving systems. As such, it is necessary to conduct a systematic analysis of the ranging performance of different Lidar schemes. In this paper, we present the ranging performance analysis methods corresponding to different optical designs, device selec-tions and measurement mechanisms. By using these methods, we compare the ranging perfor-mance of several typical commercial Lidars. Our findings provide a reference framework for de-signing Lidars with various trade-offs between cost and performance, and offer insights into the advancement towards improving Lidar schemes.</description>

      <title>L-Sort: On-chip Spike Sorting with Efficient Median-of-Median Detection and Localization-based Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spike sorting is a critical process for decoding large-scale neural activity from extracellular recordings. The advancement of neural probes facilitates the recording of a high number of neurons with an increase in channel counts, arising a higher data volume and challenging the current on-chip spike sorters. This paper introduces L-Sort, a novel on-chip spike sorting solution featuring median-of-median spike detection and localization-based clustering. By combining the median-of-median approximation and the proposed incremental median calculation scheme, our detection module achieves a reduction in memory consumption. Moreover, the localization-based clustering utilizes geometric features instead of morphological features, thus eliminating the memory-consuming buffer for containing the spike waveform during feature extraction. Evaluation using Neuropixels datasets demonstrates that L-Sort achieves competitive sorting accuracy with reduced hardware resource consumption. Implementations on FPGA and ASIC (180 nm technology) demonstrate significant improvements in area and power efficiency compared to state-of-the-art designs while maintaining comparable accuracy. If normalized to 22 nm technology, our design can achieve roughly $\times 10$ area and power efficiency with similar accuracy, compared with the state-of-the-art design evaluated with the same dataset. Therefore, L-Sort is a promising solution for real-time, high-channel-count neural processing in implantable devices.</description>

      <title>A machine-learning optimized vertical-axis wind turbine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vertical-axis wind turbines (VAWTs) have garnered increasing attention in the field of renewable energy due to their unique advantages over traditional horizontal-axis wind turbines (HAWTs). However, traditional VAWTs including Darrieus and Savonius types suffer from significant drawbacks -- negative torque regions exist during rotation. In this work, we propose a new design of VAWT, which combines design principles from both Darrieus and Savonius but addresses their inherent defects. The performance of the proposed VAWT is evaluated through numerical simulations and validated by experimental testing. The results demonstrate that its power output is approximately three times greater than that of traditional Savonius VAWTs of comparable size. The performance of the proposed VAWT is further optimized using machine learning techniques, including Gaussian process regression and neural networks, based on extensive supercomputer simulations. This optimization leads to a 30% increase in power output.</description>

      <title>RadioLLM: Introducing Large Language Model into Cognitive Radio via Hybrid Prompt and Token Reprogrammings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing scarcity of spectrum resources and the rapid growth of wireless device have made efficient management of radio networks a critical challenge. Cognitive Radio Technology (CRT), when integrated with deep learning (DL), offers promising solutions for tasks such as radio signal classification (RSC), signal denoising, and spectrum allocation. However, existing DL-based CRT frameworks are often task-specific and lack scalability to diverse real-world scenarios. Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional generalization capabilities across multiple domains, making them a potential candidate for advancing CRT technologies. In this paper, we introduce RadioLLM, a novel framework that incorporates Hybrid Prompt and Token Reprogramming (HPTR) and a Frequency Attuned Fusion (FAF) module to enhance LLMs for CRT tasks. HPTR enables the integration of radio signal features with expert knowledge, while FAF improves the modeling of high-frequency features critical for precise signal processing. These innovations allow RadioLLM to handle diverse CRT tasks, bridging the gap between LLMs and traditional signal processing methods. Extensive empirical studies on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed RadioLLM achieves superior performance over current baselines.</description>

      <title>Statistical Tools for Frequency Response Functions from Posture Control Experiments: Estimation of Probability of a Sample and Comparison Between Groups of Unpaired Samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The frequency response function (FRF) is an established way to describe the outcome of experiments in posture control literature. The FRF is an empirical transfer function between an input stimulus and the induced body segment sway profile, represented as a vector of complex values associated with a vector of frequencies. Having obtained an FRF from a trial with a subject, it can be useful to quantify the likelihood it belongs to a certain population, e.g., to diagnose a condition or to evaluate the human likeliness of a humanoid robot or a wearable device. In this work, a recently proposed method for FRF statistics based on confidence bands computed with bootstrap will be summarized, and, on its basis, possible ways to quantify the likelihood of FRFs belonging to a given set will be proposed. Furthermore, a statistical test to compare groups of unpaired samples is presented.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Wavefront Curvature and Spatial Correlation in Noncoherent MIMO Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noncoherent communication systems have regained interest due to the growing demand for high-mobility and low-latency applications. Most existing studies using large antenna arrays rely on the far-field approximation, which assumes locally plane wavefronts. This assumption becomes inaccurate at higher frequencies and shorter ranges, where wavefront curvature plays a significant role and antenna arrays may operate in the radiative near field. In this letter, we adopt a model for the channel spatial correlation matrix that remains valid in both near and far field scenarios. Using this model, we demonstrate that noncoherent systems can leverage the benefits of wavefront spherical curvature, even beyond the Fraunhofer distance, revealing that the classical far-field approximation may significantly underestimate system performance. Moreover, we show that large antenna arrays enable the multiplexing of various users and facilitate near-optimal noncoherent detection with low computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Estimating Multi-chirp Parameters using Curvature-guided Langevin Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of estimating chirp parameters from a noisy mixture of chirps. While a rich body of work exists in this area, challenges remain when extending these techniques to chirps of higher order polynomials. We formulate this as a non-convex optimization problem and propose a modified Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) sampler that exploits the average curvature of the objective function to reliably find the minimizer. Results show that our Curvature-guided LMC (CG-LMC) algorithm is robust and succeeds even in low SNR regimes, making it viable for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Signaling Design for Noncoherent Distributed Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ultimate goal of enabling sensing through the cellular network is to obtain coordinated sensing of an unprecedented scale, through distributed integrated sensing and communication (D-ISAC). This, however, introduces challenges related to synchronization and demands new transmission methodologies. In this paper, we propose a transmit signal design framework for D-ISAC systems, where multiple ISAC nodes cooperatively perform sensing and communication without requiring phase-level synchronization. The proposed framework employing orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) jointly designs downlink coordinated multi-point (CoMP) communication signals and multi-input multi-output (MIMO) radar signals, leveraging both collocated and distributed MIMO radars to estimate angle-of-arrival (AOA) and time-of-flight (TOF) from all possible multi-static measurements for target localization. To design the optimal D-ISAC transmit signal, we use the target localization Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) as the sensing performance metric and the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) as the communication performance metric. Then, an optimization problem is formulated to minimize the localization CRB while maintaining a minimum SINR requirement for each communication user. Moreover, we present three distinct transmit signal design approaches, including optimal, orthogonal, and beamforming designs, which reveal trade-offs between ISAC performance and computational complexity. Unlike single-node ISAC systems, the proposed D-ISAC designs involve per-subcarrier sensing signal optimization to enable accurate TOF estimation, which contributes to the target localization performance. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed designs in achieving flexible ISAC trade-offs and efficient D-ISAC signal transmission.</description>

      <title>Time Frequency Localized Pulse for Delay Doppler Domain Data Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) is a strong candidate waveform for sixth generation wireless communication networks (6G), which can effectively handle time varying wireless channels. In this paper, we analyze the effect of fractional delay in delay Doppler (DD) domain multiplexing techniques. We develop a vector-matrix input-output relationship for the DD domain data transmission system by incorporating the effective pulse shaping filter between the transmitter and receiver along with the channel. Using this input-output relationship, we analyze the effect of the pulse shaping filter on the channel estimation and BER performance in the presence of fractional delay and uncompensated fractional timing offset (TO). For the first time, we propose the use of time-frequency localized (TFL) pulse shaping for the OTFS waveform to overcome the interference due to fractional delays. We show that our proposed TFL-OTFS outperforms the widely used raised cosine pulse-shaped OTFS (RC-OTFS) in the presence of fractional delays. Additionally, TFL-OTFS also shows very high robustness against uncompensated fractional TO, compared to RC-OTFS.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Dynamic Subarray Architecture for Efficient DOA Estimation in THz Ultra-Massive Hybrid MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) communication combined with ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (UM-MIMO) technology is promising for 6G wireless systems, where fast and precise direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation is crucial for effective beamforming. However, finding DOAs in THz UM-MIMO systems faces significant challenges: while reducing hardware complexity, the hybrid analog-digital (HAD) architecture introduces inherent difficulties in spatial information acquisition the large-scale antenna array causes significant deviations in eigenvalue decomposition results; and conventional two-dimensional DOA estimation methods incur prohibitively high computational overhead, hindering fast and accurate realization. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid dynamic subarray (HDS) architecture that strategically divides antenna elements into subarrays, ensuring phase differences between subarrays correlate exclusively with single-dimensional DOAs. Leveraging this architectural innovation, we develop two efficient algorithms for DOA estimation: a reduced-dimension MUSIC (RD-MUSIC) algorithm that enables fast processing by correcting large-scale array estimation bias, and an improved version that further accelerates estimation by exploiting THz channel sparsity to obtain initial closed-form solutions through specialized two-RF-chain configuration. Furthermore, we develop a theoretical framework through Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bound analysis, providing fundamental insights for different HDS configurations. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our solution achieves both superior estimation accuracy and computational efficiency, making it particularly suitable for practical THz UM-MIMO systems.</description>

      <title>Rydberg Atomic Quantum Receivers for the Multi-User MIMO Uplink</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg atomic quantum receivers exhibit great potential in assisting classical wireless communications due to their outstanding advantages in detecting radio frequency signals. To realize this potential, we integrate a Rydberg atomic quantum receiver into a classical multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) scheme to form a multi-user Rydberg atomic quantum MIMO (RAQ-MIMO) system for the uplink. To study this system, we first construct an equivalent baseband signal model, which facilitates convenient system design, signal processing and optimizations. We then study the ergodic achievable rates under both the maximum ratio combining (MRC) and zero-forcing (ZF) schemes by deriving their tight lower bounds. We next compare the ergodic achievable rates of the RAQ-MIMO and the conventional massive MIMO schemes by offering a closed-form expression for the difference of their ergodic achievable rates, which allows us to directly compare the two systems. Our results show that RAQ-MIMO allows the average transmit power of users to be $\sim 20$ dBm lower than that of the conventional massive MIMO. Viewed from a different perspective, an extra $\sim 7$ bits/s/Hz/user rate becomes achievable by ZF RAQ-MIMO, when equipping $50 \sim 500$ receive elements for receiving $1 \sim 100$ user signals at an enough transmit power (e.g., $\ge 20$ dBm).</description>

      <title>Pinching Antenna Systems (PASS): Architecture Designs, Opportunities, and Outlook</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article proposes a novel design for the Pinching Antenna Systems (PASS) and advocates simple yet efficient wireless communications over the `last meter'. First, the potential benefits of PASS are discussed by reviewing an existing prototype. Then, the fundamentals of PASS are introduced, including physical principles, signal models, and communication designs. In contrast to existing multi-antenna systems, PASS brings a novel concept termed \emph{Pinching Beamforming}, which is achieved by dynamically adjusting the positions of PAs. Based on this concept, a couple of practical transmission architectures are proposed for employing PASS, namely non-multiplexing and multiplexing architectures. More particularly, 1) The non-multiplexing architecture is featured by simple baseband signal processing and relies only on the pinching beamforming; while 2) the multiplexing architecture provides enhanced signal manipulation capabilities with joint baseband and pinching beamforming, which is further divided into sub-connected, fully-connected, and phase-shifter-based fully-connected schemes. Furthermore, several emerging scenarios are put forward for integrating PASS into future wireless networks. As a further advance, by demonstrating a few numerical case studies, the significant performance gain of PASS is revealed compared to conventional multi-antenna systems. Finally, several research opportunities and open problems of PASS are highlighted.</description>

      <title>Task and Perception-aware Distributed Source Coding for Correlated Speech under Bandwidth-constrained Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emerging wireless AR/VR applications require real-time transmission of correlated high-fidelity speech from multiple resource-constrained devices over unreliable, bandwidth-limited channels. Existing autoencoder-based speech source coding methods fail to address the combination of the following - (1) dynamic bitrate adaptation without retraining the model, (2) leveraging correlations among multiple speech sources, and (3) balancing downstream task loss with realism of reconstructed speech. We propose a neural distributed principal component analysis (NDPCA)-aided distributed source coding algorithm for correlated speech sources transmitting to a central receiver. Our method includes a perception-aware downstream task loss function that balances perceptual realism with task-specific performance. Experiments show significant PSNR improvements under bandwidth constraints over naive autoencoder methods in task-agnostic (19%) and task-aware settings (52%). It also approaches the theoretical upper bound, where all correlated sources are sent to a single encoder, especially in low-bandwidth scenarios. Additionally, we present a rate-distortion-perception trade-off curve, enabling adaptive decisions based on application-specific realism needs.</description>

Abstract: Understanding internal joint loading is critical for diagnosing gait-related diseases such as knee osteoarthritis; however, current methods of measuring joint risk factors are time-consuming, expensive, and restricted to lab settings. In this paper, we enable the large-scale, cost-effective biomechanical analysis of joint loading via three key contributions: the development and deployment of novel instrumented insoles, the creation of a large multimodal biomechanics dataset (VidSole), and a baseline deep learning pipeline to predict internal joint loading factors. Our novel instrumented insole measures the tri-axial forces and moments across five high-pressure points under the foot. VidSole consists of the forces and moments measured by these insoles along with corresponding RGB video from two viewpoints, 3D body motion capture, and force plate data for over 2,600 trials of 52 diverse participants performing four fundamental activities of daily living (sit-to-stand, stand-to-sit, walking, and running). We feed the insole data and kinematic parameters extractable from video (i.e., pose, knee angle) into a deep learning pipeline consisting of an ensemble Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) activity classifier followed by activity-specific Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) regression networks to estimate knee adduction moment (KAM), a biomechanical risk factor for knee osteoarthritis. The successful classification of activities at an accuracy of 99.02 percent and KAM estimation with mean absolute error (MAE) less than 0.5 percent*body weight*height, the current threshold for accurately detecting knee osteoarthritis with KAM, illustrates the usefulness of our dataset for future research and clinical settings.</description>

      <title>Power-Efficient Over-the-Air Aggregation with Receive Beamforming for Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies power-efficient uplink transmission design for federated learning (FL) that employs over-the-air analog aggregation and multi-antenna beamforming at the server. We jointly optimize device transmit weights and receive beamforming at each FL communication round to minimize the total device transmit power while ensuring convergence in FL training. Through our convergence analysis, we establish sufficient conditions on the aggregation error to guarantee FL training convergence. Utilizing these conditions, we reformulate the power minimization problem into a unique bi-convex structure that contains a transmit beamforming optimization subproblem and a receive beamforming feasibility subproblem. Despite this unconventional structure, we propose a novel alternating optimization approach that guarantees monotonic decrease of the objective value, to allow convergence to a partial optimum. We further consider imperfect channel state information (CSI), which requires accounting for the channel estimation errors in the power minimization problem and FL convergence analysis. We propose a CSI-error-aware joint beamforming algorithm, which can substantially outperform one that does not account for channel estimation errors. Simulation with canonical classification datasets demonstrates that our proposed methods achieve significant power reduction compared to existing benchmarks across a wide range of parameter settings, while attaining the same target accuracy under the same convergence rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Battery health monitoring is critical for the efficient and reliable operation of electric vehicles (EVs). This study introduces a transformer-based framework for estimating the State of Health (SoH) and predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of lithium titanate (LTO) battery cells by utilizing both cycle-based and instantaneous discharge data. Testing on eight LTO cells under various cycling conditions over 500 cycles, we demonstrate the impact of charge durations on energy storage trends and apply Differential Voltage Analysis (DVA) to monitor capacity changes (dQ/dV) across voltage ranges. Our LLM model achieves superior performance, with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as low as 0.87\% and varied latency metrics that support efficient processing, demonstrating its strong potential for real-time integration into EVs. The framework effectively identifies early signs of degradation through anomaly detection in high-resolution data, facilitating predictive maintenance to prevent sudden battery failures and enhance energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>Advancing Personalized Federated Learning: Integrative Approaches with AI for Enhanced Privacy and Customization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the age of data-driven decision making, preserving privacy while providing personalized experiences has become paramount. Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) offers a promising framework by decentralizing the learning process, thus ensuring data privacy and reducing reliance on centralized data repositories. However, the integration of advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques within PFL remains underexplored. This paper proposes a novel approach that enhances PFL with cutting-edge AI methodologies including adaptive optimization, transfer learning, and differential privacy. We present a model that not only boosts the performance of individual client models but also ensures robust privacy-preserving mechanisms and efficient resource utilization across heterogeneous networks. Empirical results demonstrate significant improvements in model accuracy and personalization, along with stringent privacy adherence, as compared to conventional federated learning models. This work paves the way for a new era of truly personalized and privacy-conscious AI systems, offering significant implications for industries requiring compliance with stringent data protection regulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the very first attempt to evaluate machine learning fairness for depression detection using electroencephalogram (EEG) data. We conduct experiments using different deep learning architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks across three EEG datasets: Mumtaz, MODMA and Rest. We employ five different bias mitigation strategies at the pre-, in- and post-processing stages and evaluate their effectiveness. Our experimental results show that bias exists in existing EEG datasets and algorithms for depression detection, and different bias mitigation methods address bias at different levels across different fairness measures.</description>

Abstract: We propose a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted wiretap channel, where the RIS is strategically deployed to provide a spatial separation to the transmitter, and orthogonal combiners are employed at the legitimate receiver to extract the data streams from the direct and RIS-assisted links. Then we derive the achievable secrecy rate under semantic security for the RIS-assisted channel and design an algorithm for the secrecy rate optimization problem. The simulation results show the effects of total transmit power, the location and number of eavesdroppers on the security performance.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Model Fine-Tuning For Extreme MIMO CSI Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient channel state information (CSI) compression is crucial in frequency division duplexing (FDD) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems due to excessive feedback overhead. Recently, deep learning-based compression techniques have demonstrated superior performance across various data types, including CSI. However, these approaches often experience performance degradation when the data distribution changes due to their limited generalization capabilities. To address this challenge, we propose a model fine-tuning approach for CSI feedback in massive MIMO systems. The idea is to fine-tune the encoder/decoder network models in a dynamic fashion using the recent CSI samples. First, we explore encoder-only fine-tuning, where only the encoder parameters are updated, leaving the decoder and latent parameters unchanged. Next, we consider full-model fine-tuning, where the encoder and decoder models are jointly updated. Unlike encoder-only fine-tuning, full-model fine-tuning requires the updated decoder and latent parameters to be transmitted to the decoder side. To efficiently handle this, we propose different prior distributions for model updates, such as uniform and truncated Gaussian to entropy code them together with the compressed CSI and account for additional feedback overhead imposed by conveying the model updates. Moreover, we incorporate quantized model updates during fine-tuning to reflect the impact of quantization in the deployment phase. Our results demonstrate that full-model fine-tuning significantly enhances the rate-distortion (RD) performance of neural CSI compression. Furthermore, we analyze how often the full-model fine-tuning should be applied in a new wireless environment and identify an optimal period interval for achieving the best RD trade-off.</description>

      <title>Leveraging LLM Agents for Automated Optimization Modeling for SASP Problems: A Graph-RAG based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated optimization modeling (AOM) has evoked considerable interest with the rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs). Existing approaches predominantly rely on prompt engineering, utilizing meticulously designed expert response chains or structured guidance. However, prompt-based techniques have failed to perform well in the sensor array signal processing (SASP) area due the lack of specific domain knowledge. To address this issue, we propose an automated modeling approach based on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique, which consists of two principal components: a multi-agent (MA) structure and a graph-based RAG (Graph-RAG) process. The MA structure is tailored for the architectural AOM process, with each agent being designed based on principles of human modeling procedure. The Graph-RAG process serves to match user query with specific SASP modeling knowledge, thereby enhancing the modeling result. Results on ten classical signal processing problems demonstrate that the proposed approach (termed as MAG-RAG) outperforms several AOM benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Multilayered Intelligent Reflecting Surface for Long-Range Underwater Acoustic Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article introduces a multilayered acoustic reconfigurable intelligent surface (ML-ARIS) architecture designed for the next generation of underwater communications. ML-ARIS incorporates multiple layers of piezoelectric material in each acoustic reflector, with the load impedance of each layer independently adjustable via a control circuit. This design increases the flexibility in generating reflected signals with desired amplitudes and orthogonal phases, enabling passive in-phase and quadrature (IQ) modulation using a single acoustic reflector. Such a feature enables precise beam steering, enhancing sound levels in targeted directions while minimizing interference in surrounding environments. Extensive simulations and tank experiments were conducted to verify the feasibility of ML-ARIS. The experimental results indicate that implementing IQ modulation with a multilayer structure is indeed practical in real-world scenarios, making it possible to use a single reflection unit to generate reflected waves with high-resolution amplitudes and phases.</description>

      <title>Resampling Filter Design for Multirate Neural Audio Effect Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks have become ubiquitous in audio effects modelling, especially for guitar amplifiers and distortion pedals. One limitation of such models is that the sample rate of the training data is implicitly encoded in the model weights and therefore not readily adjustable at inference. Recent work explored modifications to recurrent neural network architecture to approximate a sample rate independent system, enabling audio processing at a rate that differs from the original training rate. This method works well for integer oversampling and can reduce aliasing caused by nonlinear activation functions. For small fractional changes in sample rate, fractional delay filters can be used to approximate sample rate independence, but in some cases this method fails entirely. Here, we explore the use of signal resampling at the input and output of the neural network as an alternative solution. We investigate several resampling filter designs and show that a two-stage design consisting of a half-band IIR filter cascaded with a Kaiser window FIR filter can give similar or better results to the previously proposed model adjustment method with many fewer operations per sample and less than one millisecond of latency at typical audio rates. Furthermore, we investigate interpolation and decimation filters for the task of integer oversampling and show that cascaded half-band IIR and FIR designs can be used in conjunction with the model adjustment method to reduce aliasing in a range of distortion effect models.</description>

      <title>An RRAM-Based Implementation of a Template Matching Circuit for Low-Power Analogue Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.02651v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning and neuro-inspired systems enabled the increased interest in efficient pattern recognition at the edge. A wide variety of applications, such as near-sensor classification, require fast and low-power approaches for pattern matching through the use of associative memories and their more well-known implementation, Content Addressable Memories (CAMs). Towards addressing the need for low-power classification, this work showcases an RRAM-based analogue CAM (ACAM) intended for template matching applications, providing a low-power reconfigurable classification engine for the extreme edge. The circuit uses a low component count at 6T2R2M, comparable with the most compact existing cells of this type. In this work, we demonstrate a hardware prototype, built with commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components for the MOSFET-based circuits, that implements rows of 6T2R2M employing TiOx-based RRAM devices developed in-house, showcasing competitive matching window configurability and definition. Furthermore, through simulations, we validate the performance of the proposed circuit by using a commercially available 180nm technology and in-house RRAM data-driven model to assess the energy dissipation, exhibiting 60 pJ per classification event.</description>

      <title>Beyond Near-Field: Far-Field Location Division Multiple Access in Downlink MIMO Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12596v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exploring channel dimensions has been the driving force behind breakthroughs in successive generations of mobile communication systems. In 5G, space division multiple access (SDMA) leveraging massive MIMO has been crucial in enhancing system capacity through spatial differentiation of users. However, SDMA can only finely distinguish users at adjacent angles in ultra-dense networks by extremely large-scale antenna arrays. For a long time, most research has focused on the angle domain of the space, overlooking the potential of the distance domain. Near-field location division multiple access (LDMA) was proposed based on the beam-focusing effect yielded by near-field spherical propagation model, partitioning channel resources by both angle and distance. To achieve a similar idea in the far-field region, this paper introduces a far-field LDMA scheme for wideband systems based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). Benefiting from frequency diverse arrays (FDA), it becomes possible to manipulate beams in the distance domain. Combined with OFDM, the inherent cyclic prefix ensures a complete OFDM symbol can be received without losing distance information, while the matched filter of OFDM helps eliminate the time-variance of FDA steering vectors. Theoretical and simulation results show that LDMA can fully exploit the additional degrees of freedom in the distance domain to significantly improve spectral efficiency, especially in narrow sector multiple access (MA) scenarios. Moreover, LDMA can maintain independence between array elements even in single-path channels, making it stand out in MA schemes at millimeter-wave and higher frequency bands.</description>

Abstract: Integrating hyperscale AI into national defense M&amp;S(Modeling and Simulation), under the expanding IoMDT(Internet of Military Defense Things) framework, is crucial for boosting strategic and operational readiness. We examine how IoMDT-driven hyperscale AI can provide high accuracy, speed, and the ability to simulate complex, interconnected battlefield scenarios in defense M&amp;S. Countries like the United States and China are leading the adoption of these technologies, with varying levels of success. However, realizing the full potential of hyperscale AI requires overcoming challenges such as closed networks, sparse or long-tail data, complex decision-making processes, and a shortage of experts. Future directions highlight the need to adopt domestic foundation models, expand GPU/NPU investments, leverage large tech services, and employ open source solutions. These efforts will enhance national security, maintain a competitive edge, and spur broader technological and economic growth. With this blueprint, the Republic of Korea can strengthen its defense posture and stay ahead of emerging threats in modern warfare.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Trade-offs in Quantized Hybrid Radar Fusion: A CRB-Rate Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While recent advancements have highlighted the role of low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, the specific impact of ADC resolution on hybrid radar fusion (HRF), where we fuse monostatic and bistatic sensing systems remains relatively unexplored. The uplink (UL) paths in HRF, comprising both direct and reflected signals within the same frequency band, pose unique challenges, particularly given that the reflected signal is often significantly weaker than the direct path, making HRF systems susceptible to ADC resolution. To investigate the influence of quantization and ADC resolution on HRF, we employ the quantized Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) as a metric for sensing accuracy. This work derives the quantized CRB specifically for HRF systems and the quantized communication rate. We extend our analysis to obtain lower bounds on the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) and UL communication rate, which we use to characterize quantized HRF systems. Using these derived bounds, we analyze the quantized HRF system through the lens of CRB-rate boundaries. We obtain the CRB-rate boundary through two optimization problems, where each solution point represents a trade-off boundary between the sensing accuracy and the communication rate. Extensive simulations illustrate the influence of ADC resolution, dynamic range (DR), and various system parameters on the CRB-rate boundary of HRF systems. These results offer critical insights into the design of efficient and high-performance HRF systems.</description>

      <title>Kalman filter/deep-learning hybrid automatic boundary tracking of optical coherence tomography data for deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) is a highly challenging partial thickness cornea transplant surgery that replaces the anterior cornea above Descemet's membrane (DM) with a donor cornea. In our previous work, we proposed the design of an optical coherence tomography (OCT) sensor integrated needle to acquire real-time M-mode images to provide depth feedback during OCT-guided needle insertion during Big Bubble DALK procedures. Machine learning and deep learning techniques were applied to M-mode images to automatically identify the DM in OCT M-scan data. However, such segmentation methods often produce inconsistent or jagged segmentation of the DM which reduces the model accuracy. Here we present a Kalman filter based OCT M-scan boundary tracking algorithm in addition to AI-based precise needle guidance to improve automatic DM segmentation for OCT-guided DALK procedures. By using the Kalman filter, the proposed method generates a smoother layer segmentation result from OCT M-mode images for more accurate tracking of the DM layer and epithelium. Initial ex vivo testing demonstrates that the proposed approach significantly increases the segmentation accuracy compared to conventional methods without the Kalman filter. Our proposed model can provide more consistent and precise depth sensing results, which has great potential to improve surgical safety and ultimately contributes to better patient outcomes.</description>

Abstract: Extremely large-scale arrays (XL-arrays) have emerged as a promising technology for enabling near-field communications in future wireless systems. However, the huge number of antennas deployed pose demanding challenges on the hardware cost and power consumption, especially when the antennas employ high-resolution phase shifters (PSs). To address this issue, in this paper, we consider low-resolution discrete PSs at the XL-array which are practically more energy efficient, and investigate the impact of PS resolution on the near-field beam-focusing effect. To this end, we propose a new Fourier series expansion method to efficiently tackle the difficulty in characterizing the beam pattern properties under phase quantization. Interestingly, we analytically show, for the first time, that 1) discrete PSs introduce additional grating lobes; 2) the main lobe still exhibits the beam-focusing property with its beam power increasing with PS resolution; and 3) there are two types of grating lobes, featured by the beam-focusing and beam-steering properties, respectively. In addition, we provide intuitive understanding for the appearance of grating lobes under discrete PSs from an array-of-subarrays perspective. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that the grating lobes generally degrade communication rate performance. However, a low-resolution of 3-bit PSs can achieve similar beam pattern and rate performance with the continuous PS counterpart, while it attains much higher energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>Interpolation Filter Design for Sample Rate Independent Audio Effect RNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15884</link>

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are effective at emulating the non-linear, stateful behavior of analog guitar amplifiers and distortion effects. Unlike the case of direct circuit simulation, RNNs have a fixed sample rate encoded in their model weights, making the sample rate non-adjustable during inference. Recent work has proposed increasing the sample rate of RNNs at inference (oversampling) by increasing the feedback delay length in samples, using a fractional delay filter for non-integer conversions. Here, we investigate the task of lowering the sample rate at inference (undersampling), and propose using an extrapolation filter to approximate the required fractional signal advance. We consider two filter design methods and analyse the impact of filter order on audio quality. Our results show that the correct choice of filter can give high quality results for both oversampling and undersampling; however, in some cases the sample rate adjustment leads to unwanted artefacts in the output signal. We analyse these failure cases through linearised stability analysis, showing that they result from instability around a fixed point. This approach enables an informed prediction of suitable interpolation filters for a given RNN model before runtime.</description>

      <title>Fitting Multiple Machine Learning Models with Performance Based Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional machine learning approaches assume that data comes from a single generating mechanism, which may not hold for most real life data. In these cases, the single mechanism assumption can result in suboptimal performance. We introduce a clustering framework that eliminates this assumption by grouping the data according to the relations between the features and the target values and we obtain multiple separate models to learn different parts of the data. We further extend our framework to applications having streaming data where we produce outcomes using an ensemble of models. For this, the ensemble weights are updated based on the incoming data batches. We demonstrate the performance of our approach over the widely-studied real life datasets, showing significant improvements over the traditional single-model approaches.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Learning in Echo State Networks for Input Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional echo state networks (ESNs) require supervised learning to train the readout layer, using the desired outputs as training data. In this study, we focus on input reconstruction (IR), which refers to training the readout layer to reproduce the input time series in its output. We reformulate the learning algorithm of the ESN readout layer to perform IR using unsupervised learning (UL). By conducting theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, we demonstrate that IR in ESNs can be effectively implemented under realistic conditions without explicitly using the desired outputs as training data; in this way, UL is enabled. Furthermore, we demonstrate that applications relying on IR, such as dynamical system replication and noise filtering, can be reformulated within the UL framework. Our findings establish a theoretically sound and universally applicable IR formulation, along with its related tasks in ESNs. This work paves the way for novel predictions and highlights unresolved theoretical challenges in ESNs, particularly in the context of time-series processing methods and computational models of the brain.</description>
