      <title>Quasiparticle solutions for the nonlocal NLSE with an anti-Hermitian term in semiclassical approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We deal with the $n$-dimensional nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation (NLSE) with a cubic nonlocal nonlinearity and an anti-Hermitian term, which is widely used model for the study of open quantum system. We construct asymptotic solutions to the Cauchy problem for such equation within the formalism of semiclassical approximation based on the Maslov complex germ method. Our solutions are localized in a neighbourhood of few points for every given time, i.e. form some spatial pattern. The localization points move over trajectories that are associated with the dynamics of semiclassical quasiparticles. The Cauchy problem for the original NLSE is reduced to the system of ODEs and auxiliary linear equations. The semiclassical nonlinear evolution operator is derived for the NLSE. The general formalism is applied to the specific one-dimensional NLSE with a periodic trap potential, dipole-dipole interaction, and phenomenological damping. It is shown that the long-range interactions in such model, which are considered through the interaction of quasiparticles in our approach, can lead to drastic changes in the behaviour of our asymptotic solutions.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Integrability and Exactly Solvable Dynamics in an Infinite-Range Many-Body Floquet Spin System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15797v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent work Sharma and Bhosale [Phys. Rev. B, 109, 014412 (2024)], $N$-spin Floquet model having infinite range Ising interaction was introduced. In this paper, we generalized the strength of interaction to $J$, such that $J=1$ case reduces to the aforementioned work. We show that for $J=1/2$ the model still exhibits integrability for an even number of qubits only. We analytically solve the cases of $6$, $8$, $10$, and $12$ qubits, finding its eigensystem, dynamics of entanglement for various initial states, and the unitary evolution operator. These quantities exhibit the signature of quantum integrability (QI). For the general case of even-$N &gt; 12$ qubits, we conjuncture the presence of QI using the numerical evidences such as spectrum degeneracy, and the exact periodic nature of both the entanglement dynamics and the time-evolved unitary operator. We numerically show the absence of QI for odd $N$ by observing a violation of the signatures of QI. We analytically and numerically find that the maximum value of time-evolved concurrence ($C_{\mbox{max}}$) decreases with $N$, indicating the multipartite nature of entanglement. Possible experiments to verify our results are discussed.</description>

      <title>A holographic uniqueness theorem for the two-dimensional Helmholtz equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a plane wave, a radiation solution, and the sum of these solutions (total solution) for the Helmholtz equation in an exterior region in $\mathbb R^2$. We consider a straight line in this region, such that the direction of propagation of the plane wave is not parallel to this line. We show that the radiation solution in the exterior region is uniquely determined by the intensity of the total solution on an interval of this line. In particular, this result solves one of the old mathematical questions of holography in its two-dimensional setting. Our proofs also contribute to the theory of the Karp expansion of radiation solutions in two dimensions.</description>

      <title>Triple critical point and emerging temperature scales in $SU(N)$ ferromagnetism at large $N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-Abelian ferromagnet recently introduced by the authors, consisting of atoms in the fundamental representation of $SU(N)$, is studied in the limit where $N$ becomes large and scales as the square root of the number of atoms $n$. This model exhibits additional phases, as well as two different temperature scales related by a factor $N\!/\!\ln N$. The paramagnetic phase splits into a "dense" and a "dilute" phase, separated by a third-order transition and leading to a triple critical point in the scale parameter $n/N^2$ and the temperature, while the ferromagnetic phase exhibits additional structure, and a new paramagnetic-ferromagnetic metastable phase appears at the larger temperature scale. These phases can coexist, becoming stable or metastable as temperature varies. A generalized model in which the number of $SU(N)$-equivalent states enters the partition function with a nontrivial weight, relevant, e.g., when there is gauge invariance in the system, is also studied and shown to manifest similar phases, with the dense-dilute phase transition becoming second-order in the fully gauge invariant case.</description>

      <title>SLOCC and LU classification of black holes with eight electric and magnetic charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In \cite{Linde}, Kallosh and Linde discussed the SLOCC classification of black holes. However, the criteria for the SLOCC classification of black holes have not been given. In addition, the LU classification of black holes has not been studied in the past. In this paper we will consider both SLOCC and LU classification of the STU black holes with four integer electric charges $q_{i} $ and four integer magnetic charges $p^{i}$, $i=0,1,2,3$. Two STU black holes with eight charges are considered SLOCC (LU) equivalent if and only if their corresponding states of three qubits are SLOCC (LU) equivalent. Under this definition, we give criteria for the classification of the eight-charge STU black holes under SLOCC and under LU, respectively. We will study the classification of the black holes via the classification of SLOCC and LU entanglement of three qubits. We then identify a set of black holes corresponding to the state W of three qubits, which is of interest since it has the maximal average von Neumann entropy of entanglement. Via von Neumann entanglement entropy, we partition the STU black holes corresponding to pure states of GHZ SLOCC class into five families under LU.</description>

Abstract: In (J. Stat. Phys. 132, 275-290, 2008) Borodin and P\'ech\'e introduced a generalization of the extended Airy kernel based on two infinite sets of parameters. For an arbitrary choice of parameters we construct determinantal point processes on $\mathbb{R}^2$ for these generalized kernels. In addition, for a subset of the parameter space we show that the point processes can be lifted to line ensembles on $\mathbb{R}$, which satisfy the Brownian Gibbs property. Our ensembles generalize the wanderer line ensembles introduced by Corwin and Hammond in (Invent. Math. 195, 441-508, 2014).</description>

      <title>A geometrical Green-Naghdi type system for dispersive-like waves in prismatic channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a one dimensional fully nonlinear model for surface waves in channels accounting for dispersive effects strictly related to multi-dimensional hydrostatic processes related to geometrical variations, namely to the bathymetry.
  Our model generalizes and improves those proposed by Chassagne et al. 2018 and 2019, as well as Quezada de Luna et al JFM 2021.
  The new model is obtained as an approximation of the hyperbolic shallow water equations under some hypotheses on the anisotropy of the propagation. For historical reasons the new model is referred to as geometrical Green-Naghdi type (gGN) system. The gGN system is fully nonlinear and weakly dispersive. It is endowed with an exact energy conservation law, and admits several types of exact travelling wave solutions. We analyze the propagation properties compare them to those of Chassagne et al. JFM 2019, including a characterization of undular bores via the analogy by Lemoine. Finally the system is recast in two useful forms appropriate for its numerical approximations, whose properties are discussed. Our results allow to further confirm the existence of these dispersive processes (highlighted in Chassagne et al JFM 2019) having a fully hydrostatic nature and modelled by the 2D hyperbolic nonlinear shallow water simulations. Finally, the numerical fully validate the new gGN model proposed.</description>

      <title>Local quantum channels giving rise to quasi-local Gibbs states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the steady-state properties of quantum channels with local Kraus operators. We consider a large family that consists of general ergodic 1-local (non-interacting) terms and general 2-local (interacting) terms. Physically, a repeated application of these channels can be seen as a simple model for the thermalization process of a many-body system. We study its steady state perturbatively by interpolating between the 1-local and 2-local channels with a perturbation parameter $\epsilon$. We prove that under very general conditions, these states are Gibbs states of a quasi-local Hamiltonian. Expanding this Hamiltonian as a series in $\epsilon$, we show that the $k$'th order term corresponds to a $(k+1)$-local interaction term in the Hamiltonian, which follows the same interaction graph as the Kraus channel. We also prove a complementary result suggesting the existence of an interaction strength threshold, under which the total weight of the high-order terms in the Hamiltonian decays exponentially fast. This result also implies a quasi-polynomial classical algorithm for computing the expectation value of local observables in such steady states. Finally, we also present numerical simulations of various channels that support our theoretical claims.</description>

      <title>A hidden symmetry of complex spacetime and the emergence of the standard model algebraic structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When spacetime is considered as a subspace of a wider complex spacetime manifold, there is a mismatch of the elementary linear representations of their symmetry groups, the real and complex Poincar\'{e} groups. In particular, no spinors are allowed for the complex case. When a spin$^{h}$ structure is implemented on principal bundles in complex spacetime, one is naturally led to an algebraic structure analogous to the one of the standard model.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the propagation of kinetic energy through billiard balls fixed in place along a one-dimensional segment. The number of billiard balls is assumed to be large but finite and we assume kinetic energy propagates following the usual collision laws of physics. Assuming an underlying stochastic mean-field for the expectation and the variance of the kinetic energy, we derive a coupled system of nonlinear partial differential equations assuming a stochastic energy re-distribution procedure. The system of PDEs has a number of interesting dynamical properties some of which are numerically simulated.</description>

      <title>A Riemann-Hilbert Approach to Skew-Orthogonal Polynomials of Symplectic Type</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.14107v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a representation of skew-orthogonal polynomials of symplectic type ($\beta=4$) in terms of a matrix Riemann-Hilbert problem, for weights of the form ${\rm e}^{-V(z)}$ where $V$ is a polynomial of even degree and positive leading coefficient. This is done by representing skew-orthogonality as a kind of multiple-orthogonality. From this, we derive a $\beta=4$ analogue of the Christoffel-Darboux formula. Finally, our Riemann-Hilbert representation allows us to derive a Lax pair whose compatibility condition may be viewed as a $\beta=4$ analogue of the Toda lattice.</description>

Abstract: The recently proposed exact quantum solution for two $\delta$-function-interacting particles with a mass-ratio $3\!:\!1$ in a hard-wall box [Y. Liu, F. Qi, Y. Zhang and S. Chen, iScience 22, 181 (2019)] violates the conventional necessary condition for a Bethe Ansatz integrability, the condition being that the system must be reducible to a superposition of semi-transparent mirrors that is invariant under all the reflections it generates. In this article, we found a way to relax this condition: some of the semi-transparent mirrors of a known self-invariant mirror superposition can be replaced by the perfectly reflecting ones, thus breaking the self-invariance. The proposed name for the method is \emph{Asymmetric Bethe Ansatz} (Asymmetric BA). As a worked example, we study in detail the bound states of the nominally non-integrable system comprised of a bosonic dimer in a $\delta$-well. Finally, we show that the exact solution of the Liu-Qi-Zhang-Chen problem is a particular instance of the the Asymmetric BA.</description>

      <title>Integrals of Products of Bessel Functions: An Insight from the Physics of Bloch Electrons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrals of products of Bessel functions exhibit an intriguing feature: under certain conditions on the parameters specifying the integrand, they vanish identically. We provide a physical interpretation of this feature in the context of both single-particle and many-body properties of electrons on a lattice ("Bloch electrons"), namely, in terms of their density of states and umklapp scattering rate. (In an umklapp event, the change in the momentum of two colliding electrons is equal to a reciprocal lattice vector, which gives rise to a finite resistivity due to electron-electron interaction.) In this context, the vanishing of an integral follows simply from the condition that either the density of states vanishes due to the electron energy lying outside the band in which free propagation of electron waves is allowed, or that an umklapp process is kinematically forbidden due to the Fermi surface being smaller than a critical value.</description>

      <title>Large deviation principles for stochastic nonlinear Schrodinger equations driven by Levy noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.05234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we establish a Freidlin-Wentzell type large deviation principle for stochastic nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation, with either focusing or defocusing nonlinearity, driven by nonlinear multiplicative L\'evy noise in the Marcus canonical form. This task is challenging in the current setting due to the presence of the power-type nonlinear term, the lack of regularization effect of the Schr\"odinger operator and the absence of compactness of embeddings. To overcome these difficulties, we employ a regularization procedure based on Yosida approximations and implement techniques such as time discretization, cut-off arguments, and relative entropy estimates of sequences of probability measures. Our innovative approach circumvents the need for compactness conditions, distinguishing our work from previous studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15008v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new avenue in which percolation, which has been much associated with critical phase transitions, can also dictate the asymptotic dynamics of non-Hermitian systems by breaking PT symmetry. Central to it is our newly-designed mechanism of topologically guided gain, where chiral edge wavepackets in a topological system experience non-Hermitian gain or loss based on how they are topologically steered. For sufficiently wide topological islands, this leads to irreversible growth due to positive feedback from interlayer tunneling. As such, a percolation transition that merges small topological islands into larger ones also drives the edge spectrum across a real to complex transition. Our discovery showcases intriguing dynamical consequences from the triple interplay of chiral topology, directed gain and interlayer tunneling, and suggests new routes for the topology to be harnessed in the control of feedback systems.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Signalling: Connections between Causal Inference and Space-time Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Causality is pivotal to our understanding of the world, presenting itself in different forms: information-theoretic and relativistic, the former linked to the flow of information, the latter to the structure of space-time. Leveraging a framework introduced in PRA, 106, 032204 (2022), which formally connects these two notions in general physical theories, we study their interplay. Here, information-theoretic causality is defined through a causal modelling approach. First, we improve the characterization of information-theoretic signalling as defined through so-called affects relations. Specifically, we provide conditions for identifying redundancies in different parts of such a relation, introducing techniques for causal inference in unfaithful causal models (where the observable data does not "faithfully" reflect the causal dependences). In particular, this demonstrates the possibility of causal inference using the absence of signalling between certain nodes. Second, we define an order-theoretic property called conicality, showing that it is satisfied for light cones in Minkowski space-times with $d&gt;1$ spatial dimensions but violated for $d=1$. Finally, we study the embedding of information-theoretic causal models in space-time without violating relativistic principles such as no superluminal signalling (NSS). In general, we observe that constraints imposed by NSS in a space-time and those imposed by purely information-theoretic causal inference behave differently. We then prove a correspondence between conical space-times and faithful causal models: in both cases, there emerges a parallel between these two types of constraints. This indicates a connection between informational and geometric notions of causality, and offers new insights for studying the relations between the principles of NSS and no causal loops in different space-time geometries and theories of information processing.</description>

      <title>Braiding Fibonacci anyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01778v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fibonacci anyons provide the simplest possible model of non-Abelian fusion rules: [1] x [1] = [0] + [1]. We propose a conformal field theory construction of topological quantum registers based on Fibonacci anyons realized as quasiparticle excitations in the Z_3 parafermion fractional quantum Hall state. To this end, the results of Ardonne and Schoutens for the correlation function of n = 4 Fibonacci fields are extended to the case of arbitrary n (and 3 r electrons). Special attention is paid to the braiding properties of the obtained correlators. We explain in details the construction of a monodromy representation of the Artin braid group acting on n-point conformal blocks of Fibonacci anyons. For low n (up to n = 8), the matrices of braid group generators are displayed explicitly. A simple recursion formula makes it possible to extend without efforts the construction to any n. Finally, we construct N qubit computational spaces in terms of conformal blocks of 2N + 2 Fibonacci anyons.</description>

      <title>Computable conditions for order-2 $CP$ symmetry in NHDM potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02004v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for order-2 $CP$ ($CP2$) symmetry in $N$-Higgs-doublet potentials for $N&gt;2$. The conditions, which are formulated as relations between vectors that transform under the adjoint representation of $\mathsf{SU}(N)$ under a change of doublet basis, are representation theoretical in nature. Making use of Lie algebra and representation theory we devise an efficient, computable algorithm which may be applied to decide whether or not a given numerical potential is $CP2$ invariant.</description>

      <title>Spin-spin Interactions in General Relativity versus Linearized Massive Gravity: $N$-body Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We simulated spin-spin interactions of $N$-bodies in linearized General Relativity (GR) and linearized Massive Gravity of the Fierz-Pauli type (mGR). It was noted earlier that there is a discrete difference between the spin-spin interaction potential in GR and mGR for a $2$-body system, akin to the van Dam-Veltman-Zakharov discontinuity in the static Newton's potential. Specifically, at large distances, GR favors anti-parallel spin orientation with total spin pointing along the interaction axis, while mGR favors parallel spin orientation with total spin perpendicular to the axis between the sources. For an $N$-body system, a simulation in mGR hitherto has not been done and one would like to know the total spin of the system in both theories. Here we remedy this. In the simulations of GR, we observed that the total spin tends to decrease from a random initial configuration, while for mGR with a large distance, the total spin increases.</description>

      <title>On "Consistent Quantization of Nearly Singular Superconducting Circuits"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05174v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The analysis conducted by Rymarz and DiVincenzo (Phys. Rev. X 13, 021017 (2023)) regarding quantization of superconducting circuits is insufficient to justify their general conclusions, most importantly the need to discard Kirchhoff's laws to effect variable reductions. Amongst a variety of reasons, one source of several disagreements with experimental and theoretical results is the long-standing dispute between extended vs compact variables in the presence of Josephson junctions.</description>

      <title>String condensation and topological holography for 2+1D gapless SPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of anyon condensation is the foundation of the bulk-boundary relation and topological holography in 2+1D/1+1D. It is believed string condensation should replace anyon condensation in the 3+1D/2+1D topological holography theory. In this work we study string condensations in 3+1D topological orders and their relations to 2+1D phases. We find that a class of non-Lagrangian condensable algebras in 3+1D are exactly dual to a class of 2+1D symmetry enriched gapless phases known as gapless SPTs(gSPT). We show how topological properties of a gSPT can be fully extracted from the dual string condensation. We give an algebraic classification of this class of condensable algebras in 3+1D $G$-gauge theories that we call magnetic and simple. Through the topological holography dictionary, this maps to the classification of 2+1D $G$-symmetric phases with no topological order, including gapped and gapless SPTs. Utilizing the classification, we identify three classes of gSPTs and study their properties and gauging. Along the way, we reveal physical structures of string condensations.</description>
