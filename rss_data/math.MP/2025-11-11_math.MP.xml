      <title>On square-zero elements in the IIB supersymmetry algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the variety of square-zero elements in the (2,0) super Poincar\'e algebra in ten dimensions, together with its orbit stratification induced by the action of the spin group and R-symmetry. This provides a classification of all possible twisting supercharges of type IIB supergravity in a flat background. Compared to other varieties of square-zero elements in super Poincar\'e algebras, we find that the orbit structure is more involved and exhibits several novel features. Among other things, we show that there are two distinct orbits of holomorphic twisting supercharges and a number of mixed topological-holomorphic twists.</description>

      <title>Quantum vortices in entanglement: a novel idea for large vortex filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a new approach to describing certain macroscopic objects
  that can arise in a quantum fluid. These objects are formed by means of quantum entanglement from the circular-shaped mesoscale and microscale vortices, and can be interpreted as a vortex filaments with any shape and size. The method is based on a quantization scheme for classical closed vortex filaments that was proposed by the author early \cite{Tal18,Tal22_1,Tal_Chaos25J}. The model we consider examines the instantaneous picture of the locations in space $\mathbb R_3$ of such filaments with a small, but non-zero, core diameter.
  Both energy and circulation of the studied filaments are calculated using the proposed approach. We demonstrate that the adopted concept leads to the emergence of secondary vortices around these investigated filament-like objects.
  We also study the specific mechanisms by which large vortex loops can disconnect and create the filament fragments . From our point of view, the proposed approach to describing vortex filaments within a vortex tangle can be seen as an important step toward understanding the appearance of quantum turbulence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we find weak generating sets for a classical W-algebra $\mathcal{W}^k(\mathfrak{g},f)$ when $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{sl}_N$ or $\mathfrak{sl}_{N_1|N_2}$. Furthermore, observing the relation between quantum and classical W-algebras, we further derive crucial information about the weak generating sets of quantum W-algebras at generic levels.</description>

      <title>Harmonic functions on Tutte's embeddings and linearized Monge-Amp\`ere equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove convergence of solutions of Dirichlet problems and Green's functions on Tutte's harmonic embeddings to those of the linearized Monge-Amp\`ere equation $\mathcal{L}_\varphi h=0$. The potential $\varphi$ appears as the limit of piecewise linear potentials associated with the embeddings and the only assumption that we use is the uniform convexity of $\varphi$. Even if $\varphi$ is quadratic, this setup significantly generalizes known results for discrete harmonic functions on orthodiagonal tilings. Motivated by potential applications to the analysis of 2d lattice models on irregular graphs, we also study the situation in which the limits are harmonic in a different complex structure.</description>

      <title>Average Winding Number for Determinantal Curves associated to 2-Matrix Models in the Class AIII</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To classify one-dimensional disordered quantum systems with chiral symmetry, we analyse the winding number of the determinant of a parametrized non-Hermitian random matrix field over the unit circle modelling the off-diagonal block of a disordered chiral Hamiltonian. The associated partition function is computed explicitly for a broad class of additive two-matrix models extending beyond the Ginibre Unitary Ensemble. In the large-dimension limit, we derive an asymptotic expansion of the average winding number whose leading term exhibits universal features, up to the tail behaviour of the underlying random matrix ensemble, and identify a new correction term absent in the previously studied Ginibre case.</description>

Abstract: Given a semisimple Frobenius manifold, we construct a class of integrable deformations of its hierarchy of topological type. We show that these integrable deformations have polynomial tau-structures, and conjecture that for the one-dimensional Frobenius manifold they give a universal object for integrable deformations of the Riemann--Hopf hierarchy having a tau-structure.</description>

      <title>A third medium approach for thermo-mechanical contact based on low order ansatz spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The third medium contact approach has been successfully employed in structural applications and extended to various optimization problems. This discretization technique replaces classical contact formulations and algorithms by introducing a compliant interfacial layer - referred to as the third medium - between the contacting bodies. Unlike traditional contact methods, this formulation naturally accommodates finite deformations at the interface. As the two bodies approach each other, the third medium undergoes compression and effectively acts as a deformable barrier, preventing interpenetration and transmitting contact forces in a smooth and numerically stable manner. In thermo-mechanical problems, heat conduction must be incorporated into the model, which typically requires specialized interface laws when using classical contact formulations. These laws aim to capture the complex thermal behavior at the contact interface, including discontinuities and varying conductance. In contrast, the third medium approach offers a significant advantage: the thermo-mechanical formulation inherently accounts for the interface behavior without the need for additional interface conditions. This includes the gradual heat transfer through the surrounding gas when the bodies are near each other, as well as the localized heat conduction that occurs upon physical contact. As a result, the third medium naturally captures both non-contact and contact-phase thermal conduction within a unified framework. In this paper, we propose a new thermo-mechanical model based on a continuum formulation for finite strains and show by means of examples the behaviour of the associated finite element formulation based on linear ansatz functions.</description>

      <title>Planar Dirac equation with radial contact potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the planar Dirac equation with the most general time-independent contact (singular) potential supported on a circumference. Taking advantage of the radial symmetry, the problem is effectively reduced to a one-dimensional one (the radial), and the contact potential is addressed in a mathematically rigorous way using a distributional approach that was originally developed to treat point interactions in one dimension, providing a physical interpretation for the interaction parameters. The most general contact interaction for this system is obtained in terms of four physical parameters: the strengths of a scalar and the three components of a singular Lorentz vector potential supported on the circumference. We then investigate the bound and scattering solutions for several choices of the physical parameters, and analyze the confinement properties of the corresponding potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the matrix representation of magnetic pseudo-differential operators in a tight Gabor frame from [arXiv:1804.05220, arXiv:2212.12229] to asymmetrical quantizations and smooth symbols dominated by a tempered weight (and not just decay/growth properties in the momentum variables). This leads to new results regarding the symbol calculus of such operators and their Schatten-class properties.</description>

      <title>On the Leading Order Term of the Lattice Yang-Mills Free Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In \cite{Cha1}, the leading order term of the free energy of $\text{U(N)}$ lattice Yang-Mills theory in $\Lambda_n=\{0,\ldots,n\}^d\subset \mathbb{Z}^d$ was determined, for every $N\geq 1$ and $d\geq 2$. The formula is explicit apart from a contribution $K_d$ which corresponds to the limiting free energy of lattice Maxwell theory with boundary conditions induced by the axial gauge. By suitably adjusting the boundary conditions, we provide an equivalent characterization of $K_d$ that admits its explicit computation.</description>

      <title>Symmetries shape the current in ratchets induced by a bi-harmonic force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/0907.2029</link>
      <description>arXiv:0907.2029v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract:   Equations describing the evolution of particles, solitons, or localized structures, driven by a zero-average, periodic, external force, and invariant under time reversal and a half-period time shift, exhibit a ratchet current when the driving force breaks these symmetries. The bi-harmonic force $f(t)=\epsilon_1\cos(q \omega t+\phi_1)+\epsilon_2\cos(p\omega t+\phi_2)$ does it for almost any choice of $\phi_{1}$ and $\phi_{2}$, provided $p$ and $q$ are two co-prime integers such that $p+q$ is odd. It has been widely observed, in experiments in Josephson-junctions, photonic crystals, etc., as well as in simulations, that the ratchet current induced by this force has the shape $v\propto\epsilon_1^p\epsilon_2^q\cos(p \phi_{1} - q \phi_{2} + \theta_0)$ for small amplitudes, where $\theta_0$ depends on the damping ($\theta_0=\pi/2$ if there is no damping, and $\theta_0=0$ for overdamped systems). We rigorously prove that this precise shape can be obtained solely from the broken symmetries of the system and is independent of the details of the equation describing the system.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation with Spatio-Temporal Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/0907.2438</link>
      <description>arXiv:0907.2438v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract:   We investigate the dynamics of solitons of the cubic Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation (NLSE) with the following perturbations: non-parametric spatio-temporal driving of the form $f(x,t) = a \exp[i K(t) x]$, damping, and a linear term which serves to stabilize the driven soliton. Using the time evolution of norm, momentum and energy, or, alternatively, a Lagrangian approach, we develop a Collective-Coordinate-Theory which yields a set of ODEs for our four collective coordinates. These ODEs are solved analytically and numerically for the case of a constant, spatially periodic force $f(x)$. The soliton position exhibits oscillations around a mean trajectory with constant velocity. This means that the soliton performs, on the average, a unidirectional motion although the spatial average of the force vanishes. The amplitude of the oscillations is much smaller than the period of $f(x)$. In order to find out for which regions the above solutions are stable, we calculate the time evolution of the soliton momentum $P(t)$ and soliton velocity $V(t)$: This is a parameter representation of a curve $P(V)$ which is visited by the soliton while time evolves. Our conjecture is that the soliton becomes unstable, if this curve has a branch with negative slope. This conjecture is fully confirmed by our simulations for the perturbed NLSE. Moreover, this curve also yields a good estimate for the soliton lifetime: the soliton lives longer, the shorter the branch with negative slope is.</description>

      <title>Ratchet effect on a relativistic particle driven by external forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1106.4861</link>
      <description>arXiv:1106.4861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the ratchet effect of a damped relativistic particle driven by both asymmetric temporal bi-harmonic and time-periodic piecewise constant forces. This system can be formally solved for any external force, providing the ratchet velocity as a non-linear functional of the driving force. This allows us to explicitly illustrate the functional Taylor expansion formalism recently proposed for this kind of systems. The Taylor expansion reveals particularly useful to obtain the shape of the current when the force is periodic, piecewise constant. We also illustrate the somewhat counterintuitive effect that introducing damping may induce a ratchet effect. When the force is symmetric under time-reversal and the system is undamped, under symmetry principles no ratchet effect is possible. In this situation increasing damping generates a ratchet current which, upon increasing the damping coefficient eventually reaches a maximum and decreases toward zero. We argue that this effect is not specific of this example and should appear in any ratchet system with tunable damping driven by a time-reversible external force.</description>

      <title>Speed-of-light pulses in the massless nonlinear Dirac equation with a potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.11037</link>
      <description>arXiv:1705.11037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the massless nonlinear Dirac (NLD) equation in $1+1$ dimension with scalar-scalar self-interaction $\frac{g^2}{2} (\bar{\Psi} \Psi)^2$ in the presence of three external electromagnetic potentials $V(x)$, a potential barrier, a constant potential, and a potential well. By solving numerically the NLD equation, we find that, for all three cases, after a short transit time, the initial pulse breaks into two pulses which are solutions of the massless linear Dirac equation traveling in opposite directions with the speed of light. During this splitting the charge and the energy are conserved, whereas the momentum is conserved when the solutions possess specific symmetries. For the case of the constant potential, we derive exact analytical solutions of the massless NLD equation that are also solutions of the massless linearized Dirac equation.</description>

      <title>Schwinger-Dyson approximants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the solution to the Schwinger-Dyson equations in the simple case of the 0-dimensional $\frac{1}{2}m^2 \phi^2 +\frac{\lambda}{4} \phi^4$ theory with $m^2&gt;0$ and $\lambda \geq 0$. We argue that the truncated Schwinger-Dyson equations are solved by rational approximants to all n-point functions $\langle \phi^{2k} \rangle$, and provide strikingly simple recursive relations for them. These rational approximants are constructed without any reference to ordinary perturbative expansions. They turn out to be Pad\'e approximants for $\langle \phi^2 \rangle$ and for half of the truncations in the case of $\langle \phi^4 \rangle$, but they are not Pad\'e approximants for higher n-point functions. This difference is related to the fact that $\langle \phi^2 \rangle$ and $\langle \phi^4 \rangle$ are Stieltjes functions, while higher n-point functions are not. We prove that as the size of the truncation tends to infinity, these rational approximants converge to the full non-perturbative n-point functions for all positive values of the coupling $\lambda$. Thus, in the example studied in this work, these new rational approximants are much easier to derive than the usual Pad\'e approximants, and when different, they are better suited to approximate the full non-perturbative n-point functions.</description>

      <title>Stability theory of flat band solitons in nonlinear wave systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a sharp criterion for the stability of a class of compactly supported, homogeneous density``minimal compact solitons'' or MCS states, of the time-dependent discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on a multi-lattice, $\mathbb L$ ($\mathbb L$-DNLS). MCS states arise for multi-lattices where a nearest neighbor Laplace-type operator on $\mathbb L$ has a flat band. Our stability criterion is in terms of the explicit form of the nonlinearity and the projection of distinguished vectors onto the flat band eigenspace. We apply our general results to MCS states of DNLS for the diamond, Kagom{\'e} and checkerboard lattices. In lattices where MCS states are unstable, we demonstrate how to engineer the nonlinearity to stabilize small amplitude MCS states. Finally, via systematic numerical computations, we put our analytical results in the context of global bifurcation diagrams.</description>

      <title>Infinite-dimensional Lagrange-Dirac systems with boundary energy flow II: Field theories with bundle-valued forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Part I of this paper introduced the infinite dimensional Lagrange-Dirac theory for physical systems on the space of differential forms over a smooth manifold with boundary. This approach is particularly well-suited for systems involving energy exchange through the boundary, as it is built upon a restricted dual space -- a vector subspace of the topological dual of the configuration space -- that captures information about both the interior dynamics and boundary interactions. Consequently, the resulting dynamical equations naturally incorporate boundary energy flow. In this second part, the theory is extended to encompass vector-bundle-valued differential forms and non-Abelian gauge theories. To account for two commonly used forms of energy flux and boundary power densities, we introduce two distinct but equivalent formulations of the restricted dual. The results are derived from both geometric and variational viewpoints and are illustrated through applications to matter and gauge field theories. The interaction between gauge and matter fields is also addressed, along with the associated boundary conditions, applied to the case of the Yang-Mills-Higgs equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was shown roughly thirty years ago that the density correlations of eigenvalues of large random matrices display a universal form, independent of most of the details of the distribution of the random matrix itself. We show that when the matrix elements evolve according to a Dyson Brownian motion, dynamical correlations retain a large degree of the universality found at equal times when expressed in terms of the characteristics of some partial differential equation in the complex plane.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporally Localized Optical Links and Knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical links and knots have attracted growing attention owing to their exotic topologic features and promising applications in next-generation information transfer and storage. However, current protocols for optical topology realization rely on paraxial propagation of spatial modes, which inherently limits their three-dimensional topological structures to longitudinal space-filling. In this work we propose and experimentally demonstrate a scheme for creating optical knots and links that are localized in space within a transverse plane of a paraxial field, as well as in time. These spatiotemporal topological structures arise from polychromatic wave fields with tightly coupled spatial and temporal degrees of freedom that can be realized in the form of superpositions of toroidal light vortices of opposite topological charges. The (2+1)-dimensional nature of a toroidal light vortex imparts spatiotemporally localized wave fields with nontrivial topological textures, encompassing both individual and nested links or knots configurations. Moreover, the resulting topological textures are localized on an ultrashort timescale propagate at the group velocity of the wave packets and exhibit remarkable topological robustness during propagation as optical carriers. The nascent connection between spatiotemporally localized fields and topology offers exciting prospects for advancing space-time photonic topologies and exploring their potential applications in high-capacity informatics and communications.</description>

      <title>Hearing the Shape of the Universe: A Personal Journey in Noncommutative Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article surveys the noncommutative-geometric (NCG) approach to fundamental physics, in which geometry is encoded spectrally by a generalized Dirac operator and where dynamics arise from the spectral action. I review historically how the simple idea of marrying a Riemannian manifold to a two point space, progressed to lead to the uniqueness of the Standard Model and beyond. I explain how inner fluctuations of the Dirac operator reconstruct the full gauge-Higgs sector of the Standard Model on an almost-commutative space, fixing representations and hypercharges and naturally accommodating right-handed neutrinos and the see-saw mechanism. On the gravitational side, the heat-kernel expansion of the spectral action yields the cosmological constant, Einstein--Hilbert term, and higher-curvature corrections, with volume-quantized variants clarifying the status of $\Lambda$. I discuss the renormalization-group interpretation of the spectral action as a high-scale boundary condition, phenomenological implications for Higgs stability and neutrino masses. I present generalized Heisenberg equation leading to identify the NCG space at unification. I conclude by emphasizing that NCG provides a unified, testable, and geometrically principled quantum framework, linking matter, gauge fields, and gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The seminal work of Coleman, Glaser, and Martin established that, at zero temperature, any non-trivial solution to the equations of motion with the least Euclidean action is $O(D)$-symmetric. This paper extends their foundational analysis to finite temperature. We rigorously prove that for a broad class of scalar potentials, any saddle-point configuration with the least action is necessarily $O(D\!-\!1)$-symmetric and monotonic in the spatial directions. This result provides a firm mathematical justification for the symmetry properties widely assumed in studies of thermal vacuum decay and cosmological phase transitions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The definition of quantum states in terms of tagged vector spaces is generalized to incorporate the spatiotemporal and spin degrees of freedom. Considering a tagged vector space where the index space is a function space, representing the additional degrees of freedom, we obtained axioms for the tags that include a completeness condition expressed in terms of a functional integral with an abstract functional integration measure. Using these axioms, we derive a generating functional for the moments of this functional integration measure. These moments are then used to evaluate the functional integrals of Gaussian functionals, leading to expressions in accordance with those obtained as generalizations of equivalent integrals over a finite number of integration variables. For a Gaussian functional used as a probability distributions, we show that its moments, obtained with this functional integration measure, satisfy Carleman's condition, indicating that the measure is unique.</description>

      <title>Black holes and black regions, horizons and barriers in Lorentzian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that if S is a time-oriented null hypersurface of a Lorentzian n-manifold (M, g), the causal world-lines, which intersect transversally S and are time-oriented in a compatible way, cross the hypersurface all in the same direction, the other being forbidden. Even if it is known that a smooth event horizon (in the sense of Penrose, Hawking and Ellis) is a null hypersurface and has the above semi-permeability property, at the best of our knowledge, it was not known so far that the latter is a mere consequence of the former. Our result leads to the concepts of barriers (= null hypersurfaces separating the space-time into disjoint regions) and black regions (= time-oriented regions bounded by barriers). These objects naturally include (smooth) event horizons and (smoothly bounded) black holes. Since barriers are defined by two simple properties -- the merely local property of "nullity" combined with the global property of "separating the space-time" -- we expect they may be used to simplify computations for locating static and/or dynamic horizons in numerical computations.</description>

      <title>Lifting $I$-functions from the Grassmannians to their cotangent bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We relate two fundamental enumerative functions, namely the $I$-functions in the quantum $K$-ring of $G(r,n)$ and of its cotangent bundle, by defining a $K$-theoretic operator on classes, called balancing. This operator lifts the $I$-function of $G(r,n)$ to that of $T^*G(r,n)$, providing an explicit geometric interpretation. We also define an operator acting on difference operators and show that, for certain $K$-theoretic functions and the corresponding difference operators that annihilate them, including the $I$-functions of projective spaces $\mathbb{P}^n$, the balancing operation on difference operators and on classes is compatible. Moreover, for general $G(r,n)$, we recover the Bethe-Ansatz equations for $T^*G(r,n)$ via a procedure inspired by both balancing and the abelian/non-abelian correspondence.</description>

Abstract: We use martingale embeddings to prove a central limit theorem (CLT) for projections of high-dimensional random vectors satisfying a Poincar\'e inequality. We obtain a non-asymptotic error bound for the CLT in 2-Wasserstein distance involving two-point and three-point covariances. We present two illustrative applications to Ising models: one with finite-range interactions and the other in the ferromagnetic case under the Dobrushin condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis advances the spectral theory of structured matrix-sequences within the framework of Generalized Locally Toeplitz (GLT) $*$-algebras, focusing on the geometric mean of Hermitian positive definite (HPD) GLT sequences and its applications in mathematical physics. For two HPD sequences $\{A_n\}_n \sim_{\mathrm{GLT}} \kappa$ and $\{B_n\}_n \sim_{\mathrm{GLT}} \xi$ in the same $d$-level, $r$-block GLT $*$-algebra, we prove that when $\kappa$ and $\xi$ commute, the geometric mean sequence $\{G(A_n,B_n)\}_n$ is GLT with symbol $(\kappa\xi)^{1/2}$, without requiring invertibility of either symbol, settling \cite[Conjecture 10.1]{garoni2017} for $r=1$, $d\ge1$. In degenerate cases, we identify conditions ensuring $\{G(A_n,B_n)\}_n \sim_{\mathrm{GLT}} G(\kappa,\xi)$. For $r&gt;1$ and non-commuting symbols, numerical evidence shows the sequence still admits a spectral symbol, indicating maximality of the commuting result. Numerical experiments in scalar and block settings confirm the theory and illustrate spectral behaviour. We also sketch the extension to $k\ge2$ sequences via the Karcher mean, obtaining $\{G(A_n^{(1)},\ldots,A_n^{(k)})\}_n \sim_{\mathrm{GLT}} G(\kappa_1,\ldots,\kappa_k)$. Finally, we apply the GLT framework to mean-field quantum spin systems, showing that matrices from the quantum Curie--Weiss model form GLT sequences with explicitly computable spectral distributions.</description>

      <title>Torus scaling limits and the plateau of the critical weakly coupled $|\varphi|^4$ model in $d \ge 4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $n$-component weakly coupled $|\varphi|^4$ model on the $\Z^d$ lattice ($d\ge 4$) exhibits a critical two-point correlation function with an exact polynomial decay in infinite volume, regardless of whether the interaction is short- or long-range. This paper presents a rigorous analysis of the system in both $\Z^d$ and a finite-volume torus. In a torus, we prove the existence of a plateau effect, where the correlation function undergoes a crossover from the polynomial decay to a uniform constant state.
  We then establish the precise scaling limit picture that provides a complementary description of this crossover. As immediate consequences, we verify the finite-size scaling limit predicted by Zinn-Justin, the finite-size scaling exponents (qoppas) suggested by Kenna and Berche and the role of the Fourier modes in finite-size scaling suggested by Flores-Sola, Berche, Kenna and Weigel. The proofs use the renormalisation group map constructed in the author's previous work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We emphasize that construction of travelling wave solutions for partial differential equations is a problem of considerable interest and thus introduce a simple algebraic method to generate such solutions for equations in the Burgers hierarchy. Our method based on a judicious use of the well known Cole-Hopf transformation is found to work satisfactorily for higher Burgers equations for which the direct method of integration is inapplicable. For Burgers equation we clearly demonstrate how does the diffusion term in the equation counteract the nonlinearity to result in a smooth wave. We envisage a similar study for higher equations in the Buggers hierarchy and establish that (i) as opposed to the solution of the Burgers equation, the purely nonlinear terms of these equations support smooth solutions and more interestingly (ii) the complete solutions of all higher-order equations are identical.</description>

      <title>Explicit Baker--Campbell--Hausdorff Radii in Special Banach--Malcev Algebras of Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06357v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish explicit convergence radii for the Baker--Campbell--Hausdorff (BCH) series in special Banach--Malcev algebras of shifts-those embeddable into a Banach alternative algebra. Under the continuity estimate $\|[x,y]\|\leq B\|x\|\|y\|$, the series converges absolutely whenever $B(\|x\|+\|y\|)&lt;1/(4K)$, where $K\geq1$ bounds the absolute BCH coefficients. The constant $1/(4K)$ stems from a Catalan-number majorization and is sharp in the exponential-weight model. We compute $B$ explicitly for operator, exponential, polynomial, damped, and tree-like shift algebras, including the non-Lie split-octonionic (Zorn) algebra ($B=2$, $\rho=1/(8K)$). All results require the speciality assumption; the framework does not apply to general Malcev algebras. Geometrically, $\rho=1/(4KB)$ is the analyticity radius of the induced Moufang loop; numerically, it governs stability of BCH-type integrators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown that the collapse model derived from the theory of causal fermion systems does not give rise to a heating of the probe. Experimental consequences are worked out. The connections to the continuous spontaneous localization (CSL) model and the events-trees-histories (ETH) formulation of quantum theory are discussed.</description>

      <title>Poncelet property of planar elliptic integrable Kepler billiards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the integrable dynamics of a Kepler billiard in the plane bounded by a branch of a conic section focused at the Kepler center. We show that in this case, for non-zero-energy orbits, the lines of consecutive second orbital foci along a billiard trajectory are all tangent to a fixed circle. Based on this observation we analyse in details the integrable dynamics of a planar Kepler billiard inside or outside an elliptic reflection wall, with the Kepler center occupying one of its foci. We identify the associated elliptic curve on which the dynamics is linearized, and the shift defined thereon. We also discuss explicit conditions on $n$-periodicity using Cayley's criteria.</description>

      <title>Quantum Monads in Phase Space and Related Toeplitz Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In earlier work, we introduced quantum blobs as minimum-uncertainty symplectic ellipsoids in phase space. These objects may be viewed as geometric monads in the Leibnizian sense, representing the elementary units of phase-space structure consistent with the uncertainty principle. We establish a one-to-one correspondence between such monads and generalized coherent states, represented by arbitrary non-degenerate Gaussian wave functions in configuration space. To each of these states, we associate a classs of Toeplitz operators that extends the standard anti-Wick quantization scheme. The mathematical and physical properties of these operators are analyzed, allowing for a generalized definition of density matrices within the phase-space formulation of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Topological Thermodynamics of Black Holes: Revisiting the methods of winding numbers calculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the equivalence between two methods for computing winding numbers is established: the approach of $\phi$-mapping topological current and the residue method. The methods are shown to be equivalent when the condition $M'' S' - S'' M' \neq 0$ holds, while deviations appear when this relation fails, signaling subtle connections between mass $M(r_h)$, entropy $S(r_h)$, and topological structure, with $r_h$ being the horizon radius. We first verify this equivalence to Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr"om black holes, recovering known classifications and confirming the consistency of our approach with respect to the validity of the above condition. We then extend the analysis to four-dimensional black strings, regarded as cylindrically symmetric black hole solutions in asymptotically AdS spacetimes. Our results show that both neutral and charged black strings possess the same global topological number, $W = +1$, implying that electric charge does not influence their topological classification. This insensitivity to charge mirrors earlier findings for BTZ black holes in three dimensions, suggesting that it may represent a universal property of cylindrically symmetric black holes in AdS backgrounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine a thermodynamically consistent diffuse interface model for bulk-surface viscous fluid mixtures. This model consists of a Navier--Stokes--Cahn--Hilliard model in the bulk coupled to a surface Navier--Stokes--Cahn--Hilliard system on the boundary. In this paper, we address the global well-posedness of strong solutions in the two-dimensional setting, also covering the physically meaningful case of non-degenerate mobility functions. Lastly, we prove the uniqueness of the corresponding strong solutions and their continuous dependence on the initial data. Our approach hinges upon new well-posedness and regularity theory for a convective bulk-surface Cahn--Hilliard equation with non-degenerate mobilities, as well as a bulk-surface Stokes equation with non-constant coefficients.</description>

      <title>Vortex Solutions for A Mixed Boundary-Value Problem in the Abelian-Higgs Model with A Neutral Scalar Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vortices represent a class of topological solitons arising in gauge theories coupled with complex scalar fields, holding significant importance across various domains of modern physics. In this paper we establish the existence of vortex solutions for a mixed boundary-value problem derived from the Abelian-Higgs model incorporating a neutral scalar field, a system recently investigated by Eto, Peterson et al. [7]. By synergistically combining the shooting method with the Schauder fixed-point theorem, we derive sharp analytical criteria that delineate the Abelian vortex phase from the non-Abelian one. We also rigorously establish the monotonicity, uniform boundedness, and precise asymptotic behavior of the vortex profile functions. Our results provide rigorous confirmation of numerical observations regarding the phase boundary between these distinct vortex types.</description>

      <title>Finite-dimensional Lie algebras in bosonic quantum dynamics: The single-mode case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study, classify, and explore the mathematical properties of finite-dimensional Lie algebras occurring in the quantum dynamics of single-mode and self-interacting bosonic systems. These Lie algebras are contained in the real skew-hermitian Weyl algebra $\hat{A}_1$, defined as the real subalgebra of the Weyl algebra $A_1$ consisting of all skew-hermitian polynomials. A central aspect of our analysis is the choice of basis for $\hat{A}_1$, which is composed of skew-symmetric combinations of two elements of the Weyl algebra called monomials, namely strings of creation and annihilation operators combined with their hermitian conjugate. Motivated by the quest for analytical solutions in quantum optimal control and dynamics, we aim at answering the following three fundamental questions: (i) What are the finite-dimensional Lie subalgebras in $\hat{A}_1$ generated by monomials alone? (ii)~What are the finite-dimensional Lie subalgebras in $\hat{A}_1$ that contain the free Hamiltonian? (iii) What are the non-abelian and finite-dimensional Lie subalgebras that can be faithfully realized in $\hat{A}_1$? We answer the first question by providing all possible realizations of all finite-dimensional non-abelian Lie algebras that are generated by monomials alone. We answer the second question by proving that any non-abelian and finite-dimensional subalgebra of $\hat{A}_1$ that contains a free Hamiltonian term must be a subalgebra of the Schr\"odinger algebra. We partially answer the third question by classifying all nilpotent and non-solvable Lie algebras that can be realized in $\hat{A}_1$, and comment on the remaining cases. Finally, we also discuss the implications of our results for quantum control theory. Our work constitutes an important stepping stone to understanding quantum dynamics of bosonic systems in full generality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within density-functional theory, Moreau-Yosida regularization enables both a reformulation of the theory and a mathematically well-defined definition of the Kohn-Sham approach. It is further employed in density-potential inversion schemes and, through the choice of topology for the density and potential space, can be directly linked to classical field theories. This perspective collects various appearances of the regularization technique within density-functional theory alongside possibilities for their future development.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Thermodynamic Formalism: Mean-field Phase Transitions, Large Deviations and Bogoliubov's Variational Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Omega =\{1,2,\ldots ,d\}^{\mathbb{N}}$, $T$ be the shift acting on $\Omega $, $\mathcal{P}(T)$ the set of $T$-invariant probabilities. Given a H\"{o}lder potential $A$ and a continuous function $F$, we investigate the probabilities $\rho _{F,A}$ that are maximizers of the nonlinear pressure
  $\mathfrak{P}_{F,A}:=\sup_{\rho \in \mathcal{P}(T)}\{ F(\int A(x)\rho (\mathrm{d}x))+h(\rho )\} .$
  $\rho _{F,A}$} is called a nonlinear equilibrium; a nonlinear phase transition occurs when there is more than one. In the case $F$\ is convex or concave, we combine Varadhan's lemma and Bogoliubov's variational principle to characterize them via the linear pressure problem and self-consistency conditions. Let $\mu \in \mathcal{P}(T)$ be the maximal entropy measure, $\varphi _{n}(x)=n^{-1}(\varphi (x)+\varphi (T(x))+\cdots +\varphi (T^{n-1}(x)))$ and $\beta &gt;0$.}\newline
  (I) We also consider the limit measure $\mathfrak{m}$ on $ \Omega $, so that $\forall \psi \in C(\Omega )$,
  $\int \psi (x)\,\mathfrak{m}\,( \mathrm{d}x)\,\,=\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty }\frac{\,\int \,\psi (x)\,\,\,e^{ \frac{\beta n}{2}\,\,A_{n}((x)^{2}}\,\,\mu \,(\mathrm{d}x)\,}{\int e^{\frac{ \beta n}{2}\,\,A_{n}((x)^{2}}\mu \,(\mathrm{d}x)\,\,}.$
  We call $\mathfrak{m}$ a \textit{quadratic mean-field Gibbs probability
  (II) Via subsequences $n_{k}$, $k\in \mathbb{N}$, we study the limit measure $\mathfrak{M}$ on $\Omega $, so that $\forall \psi \in C(\Omega )$,
  $\int \psi (x)\mathfrak{M}(\mathrm{d} x)=\lim_{k\rightarrow \infty }\frac{\,\int \psi _{n_{k}}(x)e^{\frac{\beta n_{k}}{2}A_{n_{k}}(x)^{2}}\mu (\mathrm{d}x)}{\int e^{\frac{\beta n_{k}}{2} A_{n_{k}}(x)^{2}}\mu (\mathrm{d}x)}.$
  We call $\mathfrak{M}$ a quadratic mean-field equilibrium probability; it is shift-invariant.

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The flow equation approach is a robust framework applicable to a broad class of singular SPDEs, including those with fractional Laplacians, throughout the entire subcritical regime. Inspired by Wilson's renormalization group, this method studies the coarse-grained process, which captures the behaviour of solutions across spatial scales. The corresponding flow equation describes how the nonlinear terms in the effective dynamics evolve with the coarse-graining scale, playing a role analogous to the Polchinski equation in quantum field theory. The renormalization problem is then solved inductively by imposing appropriate boundary conditions on the flow equation.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a minimalistic presentation for the twisted Yangian ${}^\imath\mathscr Y$ associated with split symmetric pairs (or Satake diagrams) introduced in arXiv:2406.05067 via a Drinfeld type presentation. As applications, we establish an injective algebra homomorphism from ${}^\imath\mathscr Y$ to the Yangian ${}^\imath\mathscr Y$, thereby identifying ${}^\imath\mathscr Y$ as a right coideal subalgebra of $\mathscr Y$ and proving its isomorphism with the twisted Yangian in the $J$ presentation. Furthermore, we provide estimates for the Drinfeld generators of ${}^\imath\mathscr Y$ and describe their coproduct images in terms of the Drinfeld generators of $\mathscr Y$ under this identification.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Vaccine Prioritization via Non-Markovian Final-state Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective vaccine prioritization is critical for epidemic control, yet real outbreaks exhibit memory effects that inflate state space and make long-term prediction and optimization challenging. As a result, many strategies are tuned to short-term objectives and overlook how vaccinating certain individuals indirectly protects others. We develop a general age-stratified non-Markovian epidemic model that captures memory dynamics and accommodates diverse epidemic models within one framework via state aggregation. Building on this, we map non-Markovian final states to an equivalent Markovian representation, enabling real-time fast direct prediction of long-term epidemic outcomes under vaccination. Leveraging this mapping, we design a dynamic prioritization strategy that continually allocates doses to minimize the predicted long-term final epidemic burden, explicitly balancing indirect transmission blocking with the direct protection of important groups and outperforming static policies and those short-term heuristics that target only immediate direct effects. We further uncover the underlying mechanism that drives shifts in vaccine prioritization as the epidemic progresses and coverage accumulates, underscoring the importance of adaptive allocations. This study renders long-term prediction tractable in systems with memory and provides actionable guidance for optimal vaccine deployment.</description>

      <title>Matrix-product state skeletons in Onsager-integrable quantum chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matrix-product state (MPS) skeletons are connected networks of Hamiltonians with exact MPS ground states that underlie a phase diagram. Such skeletons have previously been found in classes of free-fermion models. For the translation-invariant BDI and AIII free-fermion classes, it has been shown that the underlying skeleton is dense, giving an analytic approach to MPS approximation of ground states anywhere in the class. In this paper, we partially expose the skeleton in certain interacting spin chains: the $N$-state Onsager-integrable chiral clock families. We construct MPS that form a dense MPS skeleton in the gapped regions surrounding a sequence of fixed-point Hamiltonians (the generators of the Onsager algebra). Outside these gapped regions, these MPS remain eigenstates, but no longer give the many-body ground state. Rather, they are ground states in particular sectors of the spectrum. Our methods also allow us to find further MPS eigenstates; these correspond to low-lying excited states within the aforementioned gapped regions. This set of MPS excited states goes beyond the previous analysis of ground states on the $N=2$ free-fermion MPS skeleton. As an application of our results, we find a closed form for the disorder parameter in a family of interacting models. Finally, we remark that many of our results use only the Onsager algebra and are not specific to the chiral clock model representation.</description>

      <title>Decoupling of clusters in independent sets in a percolated hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Independent sets in graphs are sets of vertices containing no neighbors, and they represent a canonical spin system with hardcore constraints. Of particular interest is the setting of the boolean hypercube, where counting independent sets was the original motivator for Sapozhenko's famous graph container method. A modern perspective on such problems is to consider the effect of disorder, and the study of independent sets in random subgraphs of the hypercube obtained via bond percolation with parameter $p$ was initiated by Kronenberg and Spinka. They employed tools from statistical mechanics to obtain detailed information about the moments of the number of independent sets (now a random variable), and posed many interesting questions. Previous work by the authors addressed many of these questions in the regime $p \geq \frac{2}{3}$, where the behavior is relatively simple and can be modeled well by a related family of independent particles.
  As $p$ decreases, though, typical independent sets become larger and feature more intricate clustering behavior. In the present article we overcome many of the challenges presented by this phenomenon and analyze the model for all $p&gt; 0.465$. We obtain a sharp in-probability approximation for the number of independent sets in the percolated hypercube in terms of explicit random variables, as well as provide a sampling algorithm. Note that this shows, curiously, that $p = \frac{1}{2}$ is not a natural barrier for this problem unlike in many other problems where it appears as a point of a phase transition. A key contribution of this work is the introduction of a new probabilistic framework to handle the clustering behavior for these low values of $p$. Although our analysis is restricted to $p &gt; 0.465$, our arguments are expected to be helpful for studying this model at even lower values of $p$, and possibly for other related problems.</description>

      <title>Some of the many uses of scalar fields: kinks, lumps, and geometric constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This perspective deals with real scalar fields in two-dimensional spacetime. We focus on models described by one and two real scalar fields, paying closer attention to kinks and lumps, which are localized structures of current interest in high energy physics and in other areas of nonlinear science. We briefly review some of the main results presented in the literature and then focus on some new issues concerning the compact and long-range behavior of solutions and the presence of geometric constraints, suggesting how they can be used in applications in other areas of nonlinear science.</description>

      <title>Decoherence from universal tomographic measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The decoherence phenomenon arising from an environmental monitoring of the state of a quantum system, as opposed to monitoring of a preferred observable, is worked out in detail using two equivalent formulations, namely, repeated applications of universal tomographic measurements using positive operator-valued measures, and its continuous time unravelling from the Lindblad equation. The effect of decoherence is analysed by studying the evolution of Stratonovich-Weyl quasiprobability distributions on the state-space of the system. It is shown that decoherence makes an arbitrary-given quasiprobability distribution manifestly positive, thus modelling the emergence of classicality in some sense. The decoherence timescale, the minimum time that quasiprobability distributions of every initial state of the system become nonnegative, is shown to decrease in Hilbert-space dimension, and hence larger quantum systems decohere faster.</description>

      <title>Solving the Scattering Problem for Open Wave-Guide Networks, I Fundamental Solutions and Integral Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.04353v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a layer potential representation for the solution of the transmission problem defined by two dielectric channels, or open wave-guides, meeting along the straight-line interface, $\{x_1=0\}.$ The main observation is that the outgoing fundamental solution for the operator $\Delta +k_1^2+q(x_2),$ acting on functions defined in ${\mathbb R}^2,$ is easily constructed using the Fourier transform in the $x_1$-variable and the elementary theory of ordinary differential equations. These fundamental solutions can then be used to represent the solution to the transmission problem in half planes. The transmission boundary conditions lead to integral equations along the intersection of the half planes, which, in our normalization, is the $x_2$-axis. We show that, in appropriate Banach spaces, these integral equations are Fredholm equations of second kind, which are therefore generically solvable. We analyze the representation of the guided modes in our formulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper continues the analysis, started in [1] (Part I,arXiv:2302.04353), of the model open wave-guide problem defined by 2 semi-infinite, rectangular wave-guides meeting along a common perpendicular line. In Part I we reduce the solution of the physical problem to a transmission problem rephrased as a system of integral equations on the common perpendicular line. In this part we show that solutions of the integral equations introduced in Part I have asymptotic expansions, if the data allows it. Using these expansions we show that the solutions to the PDE found in each half space satisfy appropriate outgoing radiation conditions. In Part III we show that these conditions imply uniqueness of the solution to the PDE as well as uniqueness for our system of integral equations.</description>

Abstract: We study entropic fluctuations in the Spin-Fermion model describing an $N$-level quantum system coupled to several independent thermal free Fermi gas reservoirs. We establish the quantum Evans-Searles and Gallavotti-Cohen fluctuation theorems and identify their link with entropic ancilla state tomography and quantum phase space contraction of non-equilibrium steady state. The method of proof involves the spectral resonance theory of quantum transfer operators developed by the authors in previous works.</description>

      <title>Principal SUSY and nonSUSY W-algebras and their Zhu algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper consists of two parts. In the first part, we prove that when $\mathfrak{g}$ is a simple basic Lie superalgebra with a principal odd nilpotent element $f$, the W-algebra $W^k(\mathfrak{g}, F)$ for $F=-\frac{1}{2}[f,f]$ is isomorphic to the SUSY W-algebra $W^k(\bar{\mathfrak{g}},f)$ via screening operators, which implies the supersymmetry of $W^k(\mathfrak{g}, F)$. In the second part, we show that a finite SUSY W-algebra, which is a Hamiltonian reduction of $U(\widetilde{\mathfrak{g}})$ for the SUSY Takiff algebra $\widetilde{\mathfrak{g}}=\mathfrak{g}\otimes \wedge(\theta)$ is isomorphic to the Zhu algebra of a SUSY W-algebra. As a corollary, we show that a finite SUSY principal W-algebra is isomorphic to a finite principal W-algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate Jones polynomials $V(H_r,t)$ for a family of alternating knots and links $H_r$ with arbitrarily many crossings $r$, by computing the Tutte polynomials $T(G_+(H_r),x,y)$ for the associated graphs $G_+(H_r)$ and evaluating these with $x=-t$ and $y=-1/t$. Our method enables us to circumvent the generic feature that the computational complexity of $V(L_r,t)$ for a knot or link $L_r$ for generic $t$ grows exponentially rapidly with $r$. We also study the accumulation set of the zeros of these polynomials in the limit of infinitely many crossings, $r \to \infty$.</description>

      <title>On Riemann wave superpositions obtained from the Euler system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09576v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper contains an analysis of the conditions for the existence of elastic versus non-elastic wave superpositions governed by the Euler system in (1+1)-dimensions. A review of recently obtained results is presented including the introduction of the notion of quasi-rectifiability of vector fields and its application to both elastic and non-elastic wave superpositions. It is shown that the smallest real Lie algebra containing vector fields associated with the waves admitted by the Euler system is isomorphic to an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra which is the semi-direct sum of an Abelian ideal and the three-dimensional real Lie algebra K+ or K-. The maximal module corresponding to the Euler system can be transformed by an angle preserving transformation to a real algebra isomorphic to the Lie algebras K+, K-. The algebras K+ and K- are quasirectifiable and describe the behavior of wave superpositions. Based on these facts, we are able to find a parametrization of the region of non-elastic wave superpositions which allows for the construction of the reduced form of the Euler system.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we leverage a mixture model learning approach to identify defects in laser-based Additive Manufacturing (AM) processes. By incorporating physics based principles, we also ensure that the model is sensitive to meaningful physical parameter variations. The empirical evaluation was conducted by analyzing real-world data from two AM processes: Directed Energy Deposition and Laser Powder Bed Fusion. In addition, we also studied the performance of the developed framework over public datasets with different alloy type and experimental parameter information. The results show the potential of physics-guided mixture models to examine the underlying physical behavior of an AM system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.00563v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a one-dimensional gas of $N$ Brownian particles that diffuse independently, but are {\it simultaneously} reset to the origin at a constant rate $r$. The system approaches a non-equilibrium stationary state (NESS) with long-range interactions induced by the simultaneous resetting. Despite the presence of strong correlations, we show that several observables can be computed exactly, which include the global average density, the distribution of the position of the $k$-th rightmost particle and the spacing distribution between two successive particles. Our analytical results are confirmed by numerical simulations. We also discuss a possible experimental realisation of this resetting gas using optical traps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.06349v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spectral variant of the quantum marginal problem asks: Given prescribed spectra for a set of overlapping quantum marginals, does there exist a compatible joint state? The main idea of this work is a symmetry-reduced semidefinite programming hierarchy that detects when no such joint state exists. The hierarchy is complete, in the sense that it detects every incompatible set of spectra. The refutations it provides are dimension-free, certifying incompatibility in all local dimensions. The hierarchy also applies to the sums of Hermitian matrices problem, the compatibility of local unitary invariants, for certifying vanishing Kronecker coefficients, and to optimize over equivariant state polynomials.</description>

      <title>Classical uncertainty relations and entropy production in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.08290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze F\"urth's 1933 classical uncertainty relations in the modern language of stochastic differential equations. Our interest is motivated by applications to non-equilibrium classical statistical mechanics. We show that F\"urth's uncertainty relations are a property enjoyed by martingales under the measure of a diffusion process. This result implies a lower bound on fluctuations in current velocities of entropic quantifiers of transitions in stochastic thermodynamics. In cases of particular interest, we recover an inequality well known in optimal mass transport relating the mean kinetic energy of the current velocity and the squared quadratic Wasserstein distance between the probability distributions of the entropy. In performing our analysis, we also avail us of an unpublished argument due to Krzysztof Gaw\c{e}dzki to derive a lower bound to the entropy production by transition described by Langevin-Kramers process in terms of the squared quadratic Wasserstein distance between the initial and final states of the transition. Finally, we illustrate how F\"urth's relations admit a straightforward extension to piecewise deterministic processes. We thus show that the results in the paper concern properties enjoyed by general Markov processes.</description>

Abstract: Our work proves rigidity theorems for initial data sets associated with compact smooth spin manifolds with boundary and with compact convex polytopes, subject to the dominant energy condition. For manifolds with smooth boundary, this is based on the solution of a boundary value problem for Dirac operators. For convex polytopes we use approximations by manifolds with smooth boundary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03963v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider scalar perturbations of the Reissner--Nordstr\"{o}m family and the Kerr family. We derive a characteristic expression of the radiation field, at any given unit solid angle of future null infinity, and numerically show that its amplitude gets excited only in the extremal case. Our work, therefore, identifies an observational signature for extremal black holes. Moreover, we show that the source of the excitation is the extremal horizon instability and its magnitude is exactly equal to the conserved horizon charge.</description>

      <title>Solving the Scattering Problem for Open Wave-Guide Networks, III: Radiation Conditions and Uniqueness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper continues the analysis of the scattering problem for a network of open wave-guides started in [arXiv:2302.04353, arXiv:2310.05816]. In this part we present explicit, physically motivated radiation conditions that ensure uniqueness of the solution to the scattering problem. These conditions stem from a 2000 paper of A. Vasy on 3-body Schrodinger operators; we discuss closely related conditions from a 1994 paper of H. Isozaki. Vasy's paper also proves the existence of the limiting absorption resolvents, and that the limiting solutions satisfy the radiation conditions. The statements of these results require a calculus of pseudodifferential operators, called the 3-body scattering calculus, which is briefly introduced here. We show that the solutions to the model problem obtained in arXiv:2302.04353 satisfy these radiation conditions, which makes it possible to prove uniqueness, and therefore existence, for the system of Fredholm integral equations introduced in that paper.</description>

      <title>Strong disorder and very strong disorder are equivalent for directed polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02562v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that if the normalized partition function $W^{\beta}_n$ of the directed polymer model on $\mathbb Z^d$ converges to zero, then it does so exponentially fast. This implies that there exists a critical value $\beta_c$ for the inverse temperature such that the normalized partition function has a non-degenerate limit for all $\beta\in [0,\beta_c]$ -- weak disorder holds -- while for $\beta\in (\beta_c,\infty)$ it converges exponentially fast to zero -- very strong disorder holds. This solves a twenty-years-old conjecture formulated by Comets, Yoshida, Carmona and Hu.

      <title>Differential equations for the series of hypermaps with control on their full degree profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the generating series of oriented and non-oriented hypermaps with controlled degrees of vertices, hyperedges and faces. It is well known that these series have natural expansions in terms of Schur and Zonal symmetric functions, and with some particular specializations, they satisfy the celebrated KP and BKP equations.
  We prove that the full generating series of hypermaps satisfy a family of differential equations. We give a first proof which works for an $\alpha$ deformation of these series related to Jack polynomials. This proof is based on a recent construction formula for Jack characters using differential operators. We also provide a combinatorial proof for the orientable case.
  Our approach also applies to the series of $k$-constellations with control of the degrees of vertices of all colors. In other words, we obtain an equation for the generating function of Hurwitz numbers (and their $\alpha$-deformations) with control of full ramification profiles above an arbitrary number of points. Such equations are new even in the orientable case.</description>

      <title>Isochronous waveforms of Li\'enard equations via commutative factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08659v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Isochronous waveform solutions of homogeneous Li\'enard equations are obtained by a modification of the nonlinear factorization method of Rosu and Cornejo-P\'erez. The scheme is based on the assumption that the intermediate function $\Phi$ that can be introduced in this factorization method depends on both the dependent and independent variables of the nonlinear equation. The method is applied to three cases, a noted cubic anharmonic oscillator, a Li\'enard-reduced form of the Sharma-Tasso-Olver evolution equation, and the cubic-quintic Wilson's Li\'enard equation. All these cases are written in a commutative factored form that allows to obtain the general solutions as solutions of a certain type of Bernoulli differential equation. A theorem is also given asserting the general form of the Li\'enard equation, i.e., for given polynomial degree n of its coefficients, which can be solved by this method. The conditions under which these equations can be also approached by non-local transformations are established.</description>

      <title>Lattice Models for Phases and Transitions with Non-Invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05964v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-invertible categorical symmetries have emerged as a powerful tool to uncover new beyond-Landau phases of matter, both gapped and gapless, along with second order phase transitions between them. The general theory of such phases in (1+1)d has been studied using the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT), also known as topological holography. This has unearthed the infrared (IR) structure of these phases and transitions. In this paper, we describe how the SymTFT information can be converted into an ultraviolet (UV) anyonic chain lattice model realizing, in the IR limit, these phases and transitions. In many cases, the Hilbert space of the anyonic chain is tensor product decomposable and the model can be realized as a quantum spin-chain Hamiltonian. We also describe operators acting on the lattice models that are charged under non-invertible symmetries and act as order parameters for the phases and transitions. In order to fully describe the action of non-invertible symmetries, it is crucial to understand the symmetry twisted sectors of the lattice models, which we describe in detail. Throughout the paper, we illustrate the general concepts using the symmetry category $\mathsf{Rep}(S_3)$ formed by representations of the permutation group $S_3$, but our procedure can be applied to any fusion category symmetry.</description>

      <title>Infinite-dimensional Lagrange-Dirac systems with boundary energy flow I: Foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new geometric approach to systems with boundary energy flow is developed using infinite-dimensional Dirac structures within the Lagrangian formalism. This framework satisfies a list of consistency criteria with the geometric setting of finite-dimensional mechanics. In particular, the infinite-dimensional Dirac structure can be constructed from the canonical symplectic form on the system's phase space; the system's evolution equations can be derived equivalently from either a variational perspective or a Dirac structure perspective; the variational principle employed is a direct extension of Hamilton's principle in classical mechanics; and the approach allows for a process of system interconnection within its formulation. This is achieved by developing an appropriate infinite dimensional version of the previously developed Lagrange-Dirac dynamical systems. A key step in this construction is the careful choice of a suitable dual space to the configuration space, specifically, a subspace of the topological dual that captures the system's behavior in both the interior and the boundary, while allowing for a natural extension of the canonical geometric structures of mechanics. This paper focuses on systems where the configuration space consists of differential forms on a smooth manifold with a boundary. To illustrate our theory, several examples, including nonlinear wave equations, the telegraph equation, and the Maxwell equations are presented.</description>

      <title>Sufficiency of the counterfactual account of L\"uders' rule to rule out ontological models of quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15615v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ontological models, as used in the generalised contextuality literature, play a central role in current research on quantum foundations, providing a framework for defining classicality, constructing classical analogues of key quantum phenomena, and examining the ontology of quantum states. In this work, we show that a counterfactual account of L\"uders' rule -- which we argue is naturally implied by the mathematical structure of the rule itself -- renders such models inherently incompatible with the quantum formalism. This incompatibility arises because the counterfactual update requires ontological models to update their states according to conditional probability, which in turn which in turn renders predictions of sequential measurements order-independent. This implies that ontological models, even contextual ones, must either act differently to what we would expect given (this, typically implicitly-assumed account of) quantum state update rule, or cannot model quantum behaviour.</description>

      <title>The paint group Tits Satake theory of hyperbolic symmetric spaces: the distance function, paint invariants and discrete subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present paper, which is partially a review, but also contains several completely new results, aims at presenting, in a unified mathematical framework, a complex and articulated lore regarding non-compact symmetric spaces, with negative curvature, whose isometry group is a non-compact, real simple Lie group. All such manifolds are Riemannian normal manifolds, according to Alekseevsky's definition, in the sense that they are metrically equivalent to a solvable Lie group manifold. This identification provides a vision in which, on one side one can derive quite explicit and challenging formulae for the unique distance function between points of the manifold, on the other one, one can organize the entire set of the available manifolds in universality classes distinguished by their common Tits Satake submanifold and, correspondingly, by their non-compact rank. The members of the class are distinguished by their different Paint Groups, the latter notion having been introduced by two of the present authors in an earlier collaboration. In relation to the construction of neural networks, these mathematical structures offer unique possibilities of replacing ad hoc activation functions with the naturally defined non-linear operations that relate Lie algebras to Lie Groups and vice-versa. The Paint Group invariants offer new tokens both to construct algorithms and inspect (hopefully to control) their working. A conspicuous part of the paper is devoted to the study and systematic construction of parabolic/elliptic discrete subgroups of the Lie groups SO(r,r+q), in view of discretization and/or tessellations of the space to which data are to be mapped. Furthermore, it is shown how the ingredients of Special K\"ahler Geometry and the c-map, well known in the supergravity literature, provide a unified classification scheme of the relevant Tits Satake universality classes with non-compact rank r&lt;5.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first formulation of a homotopy algebra adapted to a $1/r$ expansion near future null infinity ($\mathcal{I^+}$). Focusing on self-dual Yang-Mills theory in Bondi coordinates, we demonstrate that imposing the homotopy algebra relations naturally yields the physically consistent fall-off behavior of the fields near $\mathcal{I^+}$. Furthermore, we employ this framework to systematically construct kinematic algebras, uncovering novel infinite families of such algebras that satisfy the Jacobi identity on slices near $\mathcal{I^+}$.</description>

      <title>Neural Thermodynamics: Entropic Forces in Deep and Universal Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12387v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid discovery of emergent phenomena in deep learning and large language models, understanding their cause has become an urgent need. Here, we propose a rigorous entropic-force theory for understanding the learning dynamics of neural networks trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants. Building on the theory of parameter symmetries and an entropic loss landscape, we show that representation learning is crucially governed by emergent entropic forces arising from stochasticity and discrete-time updates. These forces systematically break continuous parameter symmetries and preserve discrete ones, leading to a series of gradient balance phenomena that resemble the equipartition property of thermal systems. These phenomena, in turn, (a) explain the universal alignment of neural representations between AI models and lead to a proof of the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, and (b) reconcile the seemingly contradictory observations of sharpness- and flatness-seeking behavior of deep learning optimization. Our theory and experiments demonstrate that a combination of entropic forces and symmetry breaking is key to understanding emergent phenomena in deep learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a unified theory that connects the quasiparticle picture of Fermi polarons for mobile impurities to the Anderson orthogonality catastrophe for static impurities. By operator reordering of the underlying many-body Hamiltonian, we obtain a modified fermionic dispersion relation that features a recoil-induced energy gap, which we call the `mass gap'. We show that the resulting mean-field Hamiltonian exhibits an in-gap state for finite impurity mass, which takes a key role in Fermi polaron and molecule formation. We identify the mass gap as the microscopic origin of the quasiparticle weight of Fermi polarons and derive a power-law scaling of the weight with the impurity-to-fermion mass ratio. The associated in-gap state is shown to give rise to the emergence of the polaron-to-molecule transition away from the limiting case of the Anderson orthogonality catastrophe in which the transition is absent.</description>

Abstract: This paper develops a mathematical framework for interpreting observations of solar inertial waves in an idealized setting. Under the assumption of purely toroidal linear waves on the sphere, the stream function of the flow satisfies a fourth-order scalar equation. We prove well-posedness of wave solutions under explicit conditions on differential rotation. Moreover, we study the inverse problem of simultaneously reconstructing viscosity and differential rotation parameters from either complete or partial surface data. We establish convergence guarantee of iterative regularization methods by verifying the tangential cone condition, and prove local unique identifiability of the unknown parameters. Numerical experiments with Nesterov-Landweber iteration confirm reconstruction robustness across different observation strategies and noise levels.</description>

      <title>A Gentle Introduction to Algebraic Operads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This text, based on the author's Bachelor's thesis, introduces the theory of Algebraic Operads, a mathematical formalism that provides a unifying framework for modern algebra. We demonstrate how the fundamental theories of associative, commutative, and Lie algebras can be fully recovered as categories of representations of three archetypal operads: $\mathsf{As}$, $\mathsf{Com}$ and $\mathsf{Lie}$ -- the so-called 'three graces' of algebra.
  Following a deductive and self-contained approach, the notion of an operad is initially presented in its classical form, as a single-object multicategory. Subsequently, alternative definitions -- namely, the partial and functorial definitions -- are provided. This framework allows for the extension of classical algebraic notions, such as free objects and quotients, to the operadic context, thereby enabling operads to be formally presented through generators and relations.
  The central result of this work is the rigorous proof of the correspondence between operads and algebras. We establish isomorphisms of categories between the algebras over the operads $\mathsf{As}$, $\mathsf{Com}$ and $\mathsf{Lie}$, and their respective classical counterparts.
  This thesis thus highlights how the theory of operads offers a higher-level language for algebra, encoding entire algebraic theories within single mathematical objects. This formalism not only unifies known structures but also lays the foundation for advanced concepts, such as 'algebras up to homotopy,' with applications in fields like theoretical physics and geometry.</description>

      <title>Geometric, topological and dynamical properties of conformally symplectic systems, normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds, and scattering maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformally symplectic diffeomorphisms $f:M \rightarrow M$ transform a symplectic form $\omega$ on a manifold M into a multiple of itself, $f^* \omega = \eta \omega$. We assume $\omega$ is bounded, as some of the results may fail otherwise. We show that there are deep interactions between the topological properties of the manifold, the dynamical properties of the map, and the geometry of invariant manifolds. We show that, when the symplectic form is not exact, the possible conformal factors $\eta$ are related to topological properties of the manifold. For some manifolds the conformal factors are restricted to be algebraic numbers. We also find relations between dynamical properties (relations between growth rate of vectors and $\eta$) and symplectic properties. Normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds (NHIM) and their (un)stable manifolds are important landmarks that organize long-term dynamical behaviour. We prove that a NHIM is symplectic if and only if the rates satisfy certain pairing rules and if and only if the rates and the conformal factor satisfy certain (natural) inequalities. Homoclinic excursions to NHIMs are quantitatively described by scattering maps. These maps give the trajectory asymptotic in the future as a function of the trajectory asymptotic in the past. We prove that the scattering maps are symplectic even if the dynamics is dissipative. We also show that if the symplectic form is exact, then the scattering maps are exact, even if the dynamics is not exact. We give a variational interpretation of scattering maps in the conformally symplectic setting. We also show that similar properties of NHIMs and scattering maps hold in the case when $\omega$ is presymplectic. In dynamical systems with many rates (e.g., quasi-integrable systems near multiple resonances), pre-symplectic geometries appear naturally.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10370v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the type A, BC, and D root systems, we determine equivalent conditions between the coefficients of an exponential holomorphic function and the asymptotic values taken by the Dunkl bilinear form when one of its entries is the function. We establish these conditions over the $|\theta N| \rightarrow\infty$ regime for the type A and D root systems and over the $|\theta_0 N|\rightarrow \infty, \frac{\theta_1}{\theta_0 N}\rightarrow c\in\mathbb{C}$ regime for the type BC root system. We also generalize existing equivalent conditions over the $\theta N \rightarrow c\in\mathbb{C}$ regime for the type A root system and over the $\theta_0 N\rightarrow c_0\in\mathbb{C}, \frac{\theta_1}{\theta_0 N}\rightarrow c_1\in\mathbb{C}$ regime for the type BC root system and prove new equivalent conditions over the $\theta N \rightarrow c\in\mathbb{C}$ regime for the type D root system. Furthermore, we determine the asymptotics of the coefficients of the Bessel functions over the regimes that we have mentioned.</description>

      <title>On dynamical invariants of coadjoint orbits of 3D volume-preserving diffeomorphisms</title>

Abstract: The helicity, or asymptotic linking number, is a functional of exact volume-preserving vector fields on 3-manifolds, invariant under volume-preserving transformations. It is known to exhibit remarkable uniqueness properties: many invariant functionals reduce to functions of helicity. We examine how severely this uniqueness can fail. On integral homology spheres with the $C^{1}$-topology, the failure is extreme: for every $C^{1}$-open set of nonvanishing exact fields of fixed helicity, some other global dynamical invariant is continuous and non-constant in that set; the Ruelle invariant if some field is non-Anosov, and topological entropy otherwise. In particular, on the three-sphere, the Ruelle invariant is everywhere independent of helicity. This implies, in a very strong sense, a negative answer to a question of Arnold and Khesin on the somewhere density of coadjoint orbits of 3D volume-preserving diffeomorphisms, when considered for the $C^1$-topology. On arbitrary three-manifolds, we also answer the question in the negative using local rather than global invariants.</description>

      <title>Multiscale analysis of the conductivity in the Lorentz mirrors model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the mirrors model in $d$ dimensions on an infinite slab and with unit density. This is a deterministic dynamics in a random environment. We argue that the crossing probability of the slab goes like $\kappa/(\kappa+N)$ where $N$ is the width of the slab. We are able to compute $\kappa$ perturbatively by using a multiscale approach. The only small parameter involved in the expansion is the inverse of the size of the system. This approach rests on an inductive process and a closure assumption adapted to the mirrors model. For $d=3$, we propose the recursive relation for the conductivity $\kappa_n$ at scale $n$ : $\kappa_{n+1}=\kappa_n(1+\frac{\kappa_n}{2^{n}}\alpha)$, up to $o(1/2^n)$ terms and with $\alpha\simeq 0.0374$. This sequence has a finite limit.</description>

      <title>A No-Go Theorem for Shaping Quantum Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to engineer non-Gaussian quantum resources underlies quantum technologies from communication and metrology to universal computation. However, while a number of canonical works have set no-go limits for attaining such resources from Gaussian operations, it is widely assumed that such resources can be tuned freely by non-Gaussian Hamiltonian dynamics. Here we prove a general no-go theorem for such resource shaping: no smooth Hamiltonian dynamics can modify higher-order statistical moments of a continuous-variable state without simultaneously changing its mean and covariance. This analytic constraint implies a rigidity theorem for Hamiltonian quantum control-only quadratic (symplectic) generators preserve the Gaussian moment hierarchy, while every non-quadratic term necessarily couples the Gaussian and non-Gaussian sectors. The theorem identifies the symplectic algebra as the unique invariant subalgebra whose differential representations terminate at finite (second) order within the otherwise infinite Hamiltonian algebra. It thereby defines the analytic boundary between classically simulable Gaussian dynamics and the fully universal non-Gaussian regime-the continuous-variable analogue of the Gottesman-Knill frontier.</description>

      <title>Geometric Solution of Turbulence as Diffusion in Loop Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strongly nonlinear dynamics, from fluid turbulence to quantum chromodynamics, have long constituted some of the most challenging problems in theoretical physics. This review describes a unified theoretical framework, the loop space calculus, which offers an analytical approach to these problems. The central idea is a shift in perspective from pointwise fields to integrated loop observables, a transformation that recasts the governing nonlinear equations into a universal linear diffusion equation in the space of loops. This framework, supported by recent mathematical analysis, is analytically solvable and yields an exact, parameter-free solution for decaying hydrodynamic turbulence--the Euler ensemble--which is shown to be dual to a solvable string theory. The theory's predictions include: (i) the unification of spatial and temporal scaling laws, which are shown to be governed by two related, infinite spectra of intermittency and decay exponents, respectively, both derived from the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function; (ii) a first-order phase transition in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence; and (iii) the formation of quantized, concentric shells in passive scalar mixing. The theory also predicts log-periodic oscillations in correlation functions, effects not described by standard phenomenology, for which there is now emerging evidence from high-precision turbulence experiments. The appearance of identical mathematical structures as solutions to the turbulent regime of Yang-Mills gradient flow points towards the broad applicability of this approach. The framework also yields a new type of minimal surface that solves the QCD loop equations in the limit of large loops.</description>

      <title>Exact solutions of the reverse space-time higher-order modified self-steepening nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a reverse space-time higher-order modified self-steepening nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, which distinguishes its standard local counterparts through the reverse space-time symmetry. The integrability of this nonlocal equation is rigorously verified by presenting its associated Lax pair and infinitely many conservation laws. Utilizing the Darboux transformation, we systematically construct a diverse range of localized wave solutions on both zero and nonzero backgrounds. These patterns, such as kinks, exponentially decaying solitons, asymmetric rogue waves and their interaction solutions, exhibit novel dynamical behaviors that are not found in the local counterparts. This work not only enriches the family of solutions for the equation, but also highlights the effectiveness of the Darboux transformation in exploring nonlinear wave dynamics in nonlocal systems.</description>

      <title>Exact strong zero modes in quantum circuits and spin chains with non-diagonal boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct exact strong zero mode operators (ESZM) in integrable quantum circuits and the spin-1/2 XXZ chain for general open boundary conditions, which break the bulk U(1) symmetry of the time evolution operators. We show that the ESZM is localized around one of the boundaries and induces infinite boundary coherence times. Finally, we prove that the ESZM becomes spatially non-local under the map that relates the spin-1/2 XXZ chain to the asymmetric simple exclusion process, which suggests that it does not play a significant role in the dynamics of the latter.</description>
