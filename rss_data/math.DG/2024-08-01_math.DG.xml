      <title>Persistent de Rham-Hodge Laplacians in the Eulerian representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, topological data analysis (TDA) has become a trending topic in data science and engineering. However, the key technique of TDA, i.e., persistent homology, is defined on point cloud data, which restricts its scope. In this work, we propose persistent de Rham-Hodge Laplacian, or persistent Hodge Laplacian (PHL) for abbreviation, for the TDA on manifolds with boundaries, or volumetric data. Specifically, we extended the evolutionary de Rham-Hodge theory from the Lagrangian formulation to the Eulerian formulation via structure-persevering Cartesian grids, and extended the persistent Laplacian on point clouds to persistent (de Rham-)Hodge Laplacian on nested families of manifolds with appropriate boundary conditions. The proposed PHL facilitates the machine learning and deep learning prediction of volumetric data. For a proof-of-principle application of the proposed PHL, we propose a persistent Hodge Laplacian learning (PHLL) algorithm for data on manifolds or volumetric data. To this end, we showcase the PHLL prediction of protein-ligand binding affinities in two benchmark datasets. Our numerical experiments highlight the power and promise of PHLL.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe singularities of distance squared functions on singular surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$ parameterized by smooth map-germs $\mathcal{A}$-equivalent to one of $S_k$, $B_k$, $C_k$ and $F_4$ singularities in terms of extended geometric language via finite succession of blowing-ups. We investigate singularities of wave-fronts and caustics of such singular surfaces.</description>

      <title>Singularities of generalized timelike minimal surfaces in Lorentz-Minkowski 3-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A timelike minimal surface in Minkowski 3-space is a surface whose induced metric is Lorentzian and with vanishing mean curvature. Such surfaces have many kinds of singularities. In this paper, we prove existence and non-existence theorems of singularities of timelike minimal surfaces, and show that various diffeomorphism types of singularities that do not appear on these Riemannian counter parts, such as minimal surfaces in Euclidean space and maximal surfaces in Minkowski space, appear on timelike minimal surfaces. We also give criteria for cuspidal butterfly, cuspidal $S_1$ singularity, $(2,5)$-cuspidal edge, cuspidal beaks and $D_4$ singularity of timelike minimal surfaces. Finally, duality and invariance theorems for these singularities and examples are given.</description>

      <title>Einstein metrics on aligned homogeneous spaces with two factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given two homogeneous spaces of the form G_1/K and G_2/K, where G_1 and G_2 are compact simple Lie groups, we study the existence problem for G_1xG_2-invariant Einstein metrics on the homogeneous space M=G_1xG_2/K. For the large subclass C of spaces having three pairwise inequivalent isotropy irreducible summands (12 infinite families and 70 sporadic examples), we obtain that existence is equivalent to the existence of a real root for certain quartic polynomial depending on the dimensions and two Killing constants, which allows a full classification and the possibility to weigh the existence and non-existence pieces of C.</description>

      <title>On Space-like Class $\mathcal A$ Surfaces in Robertson-Walker Space Times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we consider space-like surfaces in Robertson-Walker Space times $L^4_1(f,c)$ with comoving observer field $\frac{\partial}{\partial t}$. We study some problems related to such surfaces satisfying the geometric conditions imposed on the tangential part and normal part of the unit vector field $\frac{\partial}{\partial t}$ naturally defined. First, we investigate space-like surfaces in $L^4_1(f,c)$ satisfying that the tangent component of $\frac{\partial}{\partial t}$ is an eigenvector of all shape operators, called class $\mathcal A$ surfaces. Then, we get a classification theorem of space-like class $\mathcal A$ surfaces in $L^4_1(f,0)$. Also, we examine minimal space-like class $\mathcal A$ surfaces in $L^4_1(f,0)$. Finally, we give the parametrizations of space-like surfaces in $L^4_1(f,0)$ when the normal part of the unit vector field $\frac{\partial}{\partial t}$ is parallel.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beginning the study of non-Euclidean geometries, physical models or representations, such as crochet ones, provide a tangible portrayal of these advanced mathematical concepts. However, their connection to local Euclidean surfaces still needs further investigation. This work aims to explore how the characteristics of crochet models relate to non-Euclidean concepts by providing a parametrization of such surfaces.</description>

      <title>Free boundary Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangian discs in $\mathbb{C}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Omega \subset \mathbb{C}^2$ be a smooth domain. We establish conditions under which a weakly conformal, branched $\Omega$-free boundary Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangian immersion $u$ of a disc in $\mathbb{C}^2$ is a $\Omega$-free boundary minimal immersion. We deduce that if $u$ is a weakly conformal, branched $B_1(0)$-free boundary Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangian immersion of a disc with Legendrian boundary data, then $u(D^2)$ must be a Lagrangian equatorial plane disc. We also present examples of $\Omega$-free boundary Hamiltonain stationary discs, demonstrating the optimality of our assumptions.</description>

      <title>The index of sub-laplacians: beyond contact manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the following question: do sub-Laplacian type operators have non-trivial index theory on Carnot manifolds in higher degree of nilpotency? The problem relates to characterizing the structure of the space of hypoelliptic sub-Laplacian type operators, and results going back to Rothschild-Stein and Helffer-Nourrigat. In two degrees of nilpotency, there is a rich index theory by work of van Erp-Baum on contact manifolds, that was later extended to polycontact manifolds by Goffeng-Kuzmin. We provide a plethora of examples in higher degree of nilpotency where the index theory is trivial.</description>

      <title>Affine Connection Approach to the Realization of Nonholonomic Constraints by Strong Friction Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study an affine connection approach to realizing nonholonomic mechanical systems mediated by viscous friction forces with large coefficients, viewed as a singular perturbation of the nonholonomic system. We show that the associated slow manifold is represented coordinate-free as the image of a section over the nonholonomic distribution. We propose a novel invariance condition based on covariant derivatives and prove that this condition is equivalent to the classical invariance condition based on time derivatives. Accordingly, we propose a novel recursive procedure to approximate the slow manifold based on the covariant derivatives of a formal power series expansion of the section. Using this recurrence relation, we derive, up to second order, approximations of the slip velocities residing in the slow manifold, as well as the associated approximated dynamics up to first order. Lastly, we illustrate our approach with a case study of a vertical rolling disk.</description>

Abstract: For an asymptotically locally Euclidean (ALE) or asymptotically locally flat (ALF) gravitational instanton $(M,g)$ with toric symmetry, we express the signature of $(M,g)$ directly in terms of its rod structure. Applying Hitchin$\unicode{x2013}$Thorpe-type inequalities for Ricci-flat ALE/ALF manifolds, we formulate, as a step toward a classification of toric ALE/ALF instantons, necessary conditions that the rod structures of such spaces must satisfy. Finally, we apply these results to the study of rod structures with three turning points.</description>

Abstract: Given a closed connected manifold smoothly immersed in a complete noncompact Riemannian manifold with nonnegative sectional curvature, we estimate the intrinsic diameter of the submanifold in terms of its mean curvature field integral. On the other hand, for a compact convex surface with boundary smoothly immersed in a complete noncompact Riemannian manifold with nonnegative sectional curvature, we can estimate its intrinsic diameter in terms of its mean curvature field integral and the length of its boundary. These results are supplements of previous work of Topping, Wu-Zheng and Paeng.</description>

      <title>Operators on nonlinear metric measure spaces I: A New Laplacian comparison theorem on Finsler manifolds and a generalized Li-Yau approach to gradient estimates of Finslerian Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is the first in a series of paper where we describe the differential operators on general nonlinear metric measure spaces, namely, the Finsler spaces. We try to propose a general method for gradient estimates of the positive solutions to nonlinear parabolic (or elliptic) equations on both compact and noncompact forward complete Finsler manifolds. The key of this approach is to find a valid comparison theorem, and particularly, to find related suitable curvature conditions. Actually, we define some non-Riemannian tensors and a generalization of the weighted Ricci curvature, called the mixed weighted Ricci curvature. With the assistance of these concepts, we prove a new kind of Laplacian comparison theorem. As an illustration of such method, we apply it to Finslerian Schr\"odinger equation. The Schr\"odinger equation is a typical class of parabolic equations, and the gradient estimation of their positive solution is representative. In this paper, based on the new Laplacian comparison theorem, we give global and local Li-Yau type gradient estimates for positive solutions to the Finslerian Schr\"odinger equation with respect to two different mixed weighted Ricci curvature conditions.</description>

      <title>Quasi-spherical metrics and the static Minkowski inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that equality in the Minkowski inequality for asymptotically flat static manifolds is achieved only by slices of Schwarzschild space. To show this, we establish uniqueness of *quasi-spherical* static metrics: rotationally symmetric regions of Schwarzschild are the only static vacuum metrics which are quasi-spherical with vanishing shear vector. In addition, we observe that the static Minkowski inequality extends to all dimensions for a connected boundary and to asymptotically flat static manifolds of any positive decay order. Altogether, this yields a robust rigidity criterion for Schwarzschild space.
  Using this criterion, we recover Israel's static black hole uniqueness theorem under this mild decay assumption. Likewise, the uniqueness theorems for photon surfaces and static metric extensions from the prequel extend to all dimensions under these weaker asymptotics. Finally, as a notable by-product of our analysis, we establish regularity of weak inverse mean curvature flow in asymptotically flat manifolds -- that is, a weak IMCF is eventually smooth in an arbitrary asymptotically flat background.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove some Willmore-type inequalities for closed hypersurfaces in weighted manifolds with nonnegative Bakry-\'Emery Ricci curvature. In particular, we give a sharp Willmore-like inequality in shrinking gradient Ricci solitons. We also characterize the equality cases of our Willmore-type inequalities. These results can be regarded as generalizations of Agostiniani-Fogagnolo-Mazzieri's Willmore-type inequality to weighted manifolds. As applications, we derive some isoperimetric type inequalities under certain existence assumptions of isoperimetric regions in weighted manifolds.</description>

      <title>A support preserving homotopy for the de Rham complex with boundary decay estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the de Rham complex of relative differential forms on compact manifolds with boundary. Chain homotopies for this complex are highly non-unique, and different homotopies can have different analytic properties, particularly near the boundary. We construct a chain homotopy that has desirable support propagation properties, and that satisfies estimates relative to weighted Sobolev norms, where the weights measure decay at the boundary. The estimates are optimal given the homogeneity properties of the de Rham differential under boundary dilation, and are obtained by showing that the homotopy is a b-pseudodifferential operator. As a corollary we obtain a right inverse of the divergence operator on Euclidean space that preserves support on large balls around the origin, and satisfies estimates that measure decay at infinity. Such a support preserving right inverse was constructed before by Bogovskii, but its mapping properties are not optimal with respect to decay. As a further corollary, in three dimensions we obtain a right inverse of the divergence operator on symmetric traceless matrices, and therefore of the linearized constraint operator of general relativity about flat space.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove a transversality theorem for the moduli space of perturbed special Lagrangian submanifolds in a 6-dimensional manifold equipped with a generalization of a Calabi-Yau structure. These perturbed special Lagrangian submanifolds arise as solutions to an infinite-dimensional Lagrange multipliers problem which is part of a proposal for counting special Lagrangians outlined by Donaldson and Segal in their paper Gauge theory in higher dimensions II. More specifically, we prove that this moduli space is generically a set of isolated points.</description>

      <title>Defining equations of $7$-dimensional model CR hypersurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18588v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain a complete normal form for models of real analytic uniformly $2$-nondegenerate CR hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{C}^4$, and present a detailed study of their local invariants. The normal form illustrates that $2$-nondegenerate models in $\mathbb{C}^4$ comprise a moduli space parameterized by two univariate holomorphic functions, which is in sharp contrast to the well known Levi-nondegenerate setting and the more recently discovered behavior of $2$-nondegenerate structures in $\mathbb{C}^3$. In further contrast to these previously studied settings, we demonstrate that not all $2$-nondegenerate structures in $\mathbb{C}^4$ arise as perturbations of homogeneous models. We derive defining equations for the homogeneous models, a set of $9$ structures, and find explicit formulas for their infinitesimal symmetries.</description>

Abstract: Parallel transport, or path development, provides a rich characterization of paths which preserves the underlying algebraic structure of concatenation. The path signature is universal among such maps: any (translation-invariant) parallel transport factors uniquely through the path signature. Furthermore, the path signature is a central object in the theory of rough paths, which provides an integration theory for highly irregular paths. A fundamental result is Lyons' extension theorem, which allows us to compute the signature of rough paths, and in turn provides a way to compute parallel transport of arbitrarily irregular paths. In this article, we consider the notion of surface holonomy, a generalization of parallel transport to the higher dimensional setting of surfaces parametrized by rectangular domains, which preserves the higher algebraic structures of horizontal and vertical concatenation. Building on work of Kapranov, we introduce the surface signature, which is universal among surface holonomy maps with respect to continuous 2-connections. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of a rough surface and prove a surface extension theorem, which allows us to compute the signature of rough surfaces. By exploiting the universal property of the surface signature, this provides a method to compute the surface holonomy of arbitrarily irregular surfaces.</description>
