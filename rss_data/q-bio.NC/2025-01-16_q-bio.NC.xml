      <title>High-throughput digital twin framework for predicting neurite deterioration using MetaFormer attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) cover a variety of conditions, including autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and epilepsy, which impair the central and peripheral nervous systems. Their high comorbidity and complex etiologies present significant challenges for accurate diagnosis and effective treatments. Conventional clinical and experimental studies are time-intensive, burdening research progress considerably. This paper introduces a high-throughput digital twin framework for modeling neurite deteriorations associated with NDDs, integrating synthetic data generation, experimental images, and machine learning (ML) models. The synthetic data generator utilizes an isogeometric analysis (IGA)-based phase field model to capture diverse neurite deterioration patterns such as neurite retraction, atrophy, and fragmentation while mitigating the limitations of scarce experimental data. The ML model utilizes MetaFormer-based gated spatiotemporal attention architecture with deep temporal layers and provides fast predictions. The framework effectively captures long-range temporal dependencies and intricate morphological transformations with average errors of 1.9641% and 6.0339% for synthetic and experimental neurite deterioration, respectively. Seamlessly integrating simulations, experiments, and ML, the digital twin framework can guide researchers to make informed experimental decisions by predicting potential experimental outcomes, significantly reducing costs and saving valuable time. It can also advance our understanding of neurite deterioration and provide a scalable solution for exploring complex neurological mechanisms, contributing to the development of targeted treatments.</description>

      <title>A Bioplausible Model for the Expanding Hole Illusion: Insights into Retinal Processing and Illusory Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Expanding Hole Illusion is a compelling visual phenomenon in which a static, concentric pattern evokes a strong perception of continuous forward motion. Despite its simplicity, this illusion challenges our understanding of how the brain processes visual information, particularly motion derived from static cues. While the neural basis of this illusion has remained elusive, recent psychophysical studies [1] reveal that this illusion induces not only a perceptual effect but also physiological responses, such as pupil dilation. This paper presents a computational model based on Difference of Gaussians (DoG) filtering and a classical receptive field (CRF) implementation to simulate early retinal processing and to explain the underlying mechanisms of this illusion. Based on our results we hypothesize that the illusion arises from contrast-dependent lateral inhibition in early visual processing. Our results demonstrate that contrast gradients and multi-layered spatial processing contribute to the perception of expansion, aligning closely with psychophysical findings and supporting the role of retinal ganglion cells in generating this illusory motion signal. Our findings provide insights into the perceptual biases driving dynamic illusions and offer a new framework for studying complex visual phenomena.</description>

      <title>Unconditional stability of a recurrent neural circuit implementing divisive normalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18946v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stability in recurrent neural models poses a significant challenge, particularly in developing biologically plausible neurodynamical models that can be seamlessly trained. Traditional cortical circuit models are notoriously difficult to train due to expansive nonlinearities in the dynamical system, leading to an optimization problem with nonlinear stability constraints that are difficult to impose. Conversely, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) excel in tasks involving sequential data but lack biological plausibility and interpretability. In this work, we address these challenges by linking dynamic divisive normalization (DN) to the stability of ORGaNICs, a biologically plausible recurrent cortical circuit model that dynamically achieves DN and that has been shown to simulate a wide range of neurophysiological phenomena. By using the indirect method of Lyapunov, we prove the remarkable property of unconditional local stability for an arbitrary-dimensional ORGaNICs circuit when the recurrent weight matrix is the identity. We thus connect ORGaNICs to a system of coupled damped harmonic oscillators, which enables us to derive the circuit's energy function, providing a normative principle of what the circuit, and individual neurons, aim to accomplish. Further, for a generic recurrent weight matrix, we prove the stability of the 2D model and demonstrate empirically that stability holds in higher dimensions. Finally, we show that ORGaNICs can be trained by backpropagation through time without gradient clipping/scaling, thanks to its intrinsic stability property and adaptive time constants, which address the problems of exploding, vanishing, and oscillating gradients. By evaluating the model's performance on RNN benchmarks, we find that ORGaNICs outperform alternative neurodynamical models on static image classification tasks and perform comparably to LSTMs on sequential tasks.</description>

      <title>Inferring stochastic low-rank recurrent neural networks from neural data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16749v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central aim in computational neuroscience is to relate the activity of large populations of neurons to an underlying dynamical system. Models of these neural dynamics should ideally be both interpretable and fit the observed data well. Low-rank recurrent neural networks (RNNs) exhibit such interpretability by having tractable dynamics. However, it is unclear how to best fit low-rank RNNs to data consisting of noisy observations of an underlying stochastic system. Here, we propose to fit stochastic low-rank RNNs with variational sequential Monte Carlo methods. We validate our method on several datasets consisting of both continuous and spiking neural data, where we obtain lower dimensional latent dynamics than current state of the art methods. Additionally, for low-rank models with piecewise linear nonlinearities, we show how to efficiently identify all fixed points in polynomial rather than exponential cost in the number of units, making analysis of the inferred dynamics tractable for large RNNs. Our method both elucidates the dynamical systems underlying experimental recordings and provides a generative model whose trajectories match observed variability.</description>
