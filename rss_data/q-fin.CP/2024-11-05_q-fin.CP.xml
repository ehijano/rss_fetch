      <title>Whack-a-mole Online Learning: Physics-Informed Neural Network for Intraday Implied Volatility Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calibrating the time-dependent Implied Volatility Surface (IVS) using sparse market data is an essential challenge in computational finance, particularly for real-time applications. This task requires not only fitting market data but also satisfying a specified partial differential equation (PDE) and no-arbitrage conditions modelled by differential inequalities. This paper proposes a novel Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) approach called Whack-a-mole Online Learning (WamOL) to address this multi-objective optimisation problem. WamOL integrates self-adaptive and auto-balancing processes for each loss term, efficiently reweighting objective functions to ensure smooth surface fitting while adhering to PDE and no-arbitrage constraints and updating for intraday predictions. In our experiments, WamOL demonstrates superior performance in calibrating intraday IVS from uneven and sparse market data, effectively capturing the dynamic evolution of option prices and associated risk profiles. This approach offers an efficient solution for intraday IVS calibration, extending PINNs applications and providing a method for real-time financial modelling.</description>

      <title>AI in Investment Analysis: LLMs for Equity Stock Ratings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Investment Analysis is a cornerstone of the Financial Services industry. The rapid integration of advanced machine learning techniques, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), offers opportunities to enhance the equity rating process. This paper explores the application of LLMs to generate multi-horizon stock ratings by ingesting diverse datasets. Traditional stock rating methods rely heavily on the expertise of financial analysts, and face several challenges such as data overload, inconsistencies in filings, and delayed reactions to market events. Our study addresses these issues by leveraging LLMs to improve the accuracy and consistency of stock ratings. Additionally, we assess the efficacy of using different data modalities with LLMs for the financial domain.
  We utilize varied datasets comprising fundamental financial, market, and news data from January 2022 to June 2024, along with GPT-4-32k (v0613) (with a training cutoff in Sep. 2021 to prevent information leakage). Our results show that our benchmark method outperforms traditional stock rating methods when assessed by forward returns, specially when incorporating financial fundamentals. While integrating news data improves short-term performance, substituting detailed news summaries with sentiment scores reduces token use without loss of performance. In many cases, omitting news data entirely enhances performance by reducing bias.
  Our research shows that LLMs can be leveraged to effectively utilize large amounts of multimodal financial data, as showcased by their effectiveness at the stock rating prediction task. Our work provides a reproducible and efficient framework for generating accurate stock ratings, serving as a cost-effective alternative to traditional methods. Future work will extend to longer timeframes, incorporate diverse data, and utilize newer models for enhanced insights.</description>

      <title>Combining Financial Data and News Articles for Stock Price Movement Prediction Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting financial markets and stock price movements requires analyzing a company's performance, historic price movements, industry-specific events alongside the influence of human factors such as social media and press coverage. We assume that financial reports (such as income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements), historical price data, and recent news articles can collectively represent aforementioned factors. We combine financial data in tabular format with textual news articles and employ pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict market movements. Recent research in LLMs has demonstrated that they are able to perform both tabular and text classification tasks, making them our primary model to classify the multi-modal data. We utilize retrieval augmentation techniques to retrieve and attach relevant chunks of news articles to financial metrics related to a company and prompt the LLMs in zero, two, and four-shot settings. Our dataset contains news articles collected from different sources, historic stock price, and financial report data for 20 companies with the highest trading volume across different industries in the stock market. We utilized recently released language models for our LLM-based classifier, including GPT- 3 and 4, and LLaMA- 2 and 3 models. We introduce an LLM-based classifier capable of performing classification tasks using combination of tabular (structured) and textual (unstructured) data. By using this model, we predicted the movement of a given stock's price in our dataset with a weighted F1-score of 58.5% and 59.1% and Matthews Correlation Coefficient of 0.175 for both 3-month and 6-month periods.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Optimal Control of an Industrial Power-to-Heat System with High-Temperature Heat Pump and Thermal Energy Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optimal control of sustainable energy supply systems, including renewable energies and energy storages, takes a central role in the decarbonization of industrial systems. However, the use of fluctuating renewable energies leads to fluctuations in energy generation and requires a suitable control strategy for the complex systems in order to ensure energy supply. In this paper, we consider an electrified power-to-heat system which is designed to supply heat in form of superheated steam for industrial processes. The system consists of a high-temperature heat pump for heat supply, a wind turbine (WT) for power generation, a sensible thermal energy storage (TES) for storing excess heat and a steam generator for providing steam. If the system's energy demand cannot be covered by electricity from the WT, additional electricity must be purchased from the power grid. For this system, we investigate the cost-optimal operation aiming to minimize the electricity cost from the grid by a suitable system control depending on the available wind power and the amount of energy stored in the TES. This is a decision making problem under uncertainties about the future prices for electricity from the grid and the future generation of wind power. The resulting stochastic optimal control problem is treated as finite horizon Markov decision process (MDP) for a multi-dimensional controlled state process. We first consider the classical backward recursion techniques for solving the associated dynamic programming equation for the value function and compute the optimal decision rule. Since that approach suffers from the curse of dimensionality we also apply Q-learning techniques that are able to provide a good approximate solution to the MDP within a reasonable time.</description>

      <title>Attention-Based Reading, Highlighting, and Forecasting of the Limit Order Book</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Managing high-frequency data in a limit order book (LOB) is a complex task that often exceeds the capabilities of conventional time-series forecasting models. Accurately predicting the entire multi-level LOB, beyond just the mid-price, is essential for understanding high-frequency market dynamics. However, this task is challenging due to the complex interdependencies among compound attributes within each dimension, such as order types, features, and levels. In this study, we explore advanced multidimensional sequence-to-sequence models to forecast the entire multi-level LOB, including order prices and volumes. Our main contribution is the development of a compound multivariate embedding method designed to capture the complex relationships between spatiotemporal features. Empirical results show that our method outperforms other multivariate forecasting methods, achieving the lowest forecasting error while preserving the ordinal structure of the LOB.</description>
