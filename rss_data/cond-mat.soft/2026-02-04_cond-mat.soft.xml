      <title>Flow-induced bending response rheometer to measure viscoelastic bending of soft microrods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft, microscale hydrogel fibers and rods play important roles in tissue engineering, flexible electronics, soft robotics, drug delivery, sensors, and other applications. Their viscoelastic mechanical properties, while critical for their function, can be challenging to characterize. We present a flow-induced bending response (FIBR) rheometer that quantifies the bending modulus and viscoelastic properties of small, hydrated fibers and rods using flow through a glass capillary. The fiber is positioned across the capillary entrance, and pressure-driven, controlled inflow of water exerts a quantifiable force on the sample. Fiber deflection is determined by video microscopy obtained simultaneously with measurements of flow rate. We develop an analytical model to resolve the hydrodynamic forces applied to the rod, and use Euler-Bernoulli beam theory to determine its material properties. Using a constant volume flow rate of water enables measurement of steady rod deflection, and thus the bending modulus. Application of viscous forces to the rod in a stepwise, cyclic or oscillatory manner enables measurement of time-dependent responses, creep recovery, viscoelastic moduli, and other properties. We demonstrate the versatility of this technique on natural and synthetic materials spanning diameters from 1 to 500 microns and elastic moduli ranging from 100 Pa to &gt;100 MPa. Because the technique uses water to exert forces on the fiber, it works particularly well for hydrated materials, such as hydrogels and biological fibers, providing a versatile platform to characterize microscale mechanical properties of elongated structures.</description>

      <title>Ultrastable 2D glasses and packings explained by local centrosymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03770v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the most recent numerical data by Bolton-Lum \emph{et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. 136, 058201 (2026)], we demonstrate that ideal ultrastable glasses in the athermal limit (or ultrastable ideal 2D disk packings) possess a remarkably high degree of local centrosymmetry. In particular, we find that the inversion-symmetry order parameter for local force transmission introduced in Milkus and Zaccone, [Phys. Rev. 93, 094204 (2016)], is as high as $F_{IS}= 0.93546$, to be compared with $F_{IS}=1$ for perfect centrosymmetric crystals free of defects, and with $F_{IS} \sim 0.3-0.5$ for standard random packings. This observation provides a clear, natural explanation for the ultra-high shear modulus of ideal packings and ideal glasses, because the high centrosymmetry prevents non-affine relaxations which decrease the shear modulus. The same mechanism explains the absence of boson peak-like soft vibrational modes. These results also confirm what was found previous work, i.e. that the bond-orientational order parameter is a very poor correlator for the vibrational and mechanical</description>

      <title>Vacancy defects in square-triangle tilings and their implications for quasicrystals formed by square-shoulder particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Almost all observed square-triangle quasicrystals in soft-matter systems contain a large number of point-like defects, yet the role these defects play in stabilizing the quasicrystal phase remains poorly understood. In this work, we investigate the thermodynamic role of such defects in the widely observed 12-fold symmetric square-triangle quasicrystal. We develop a new Monte Carlo simulation to compute the configurational entropy of square-triangle tilings augmented to contain two types of irregular hexagons as defect tiles. We find that the introduction of defects leads to a notable entropy gain, with each defect contributing considerably more than a conventional vacancy in a periodic crystal. Intriguingly, the entropy gain is not simply due to individual defect types but isamplified by their combinatorial mixing. We then apply our findings to a microscopic model of core-corona particles interacting via a square-shoulder potential. By combining the configurational entropy with vibrational free-energy calculations, we predict the equilibrium defect concentration and confirm that the quasicrystalline phase contains a higher concentration of point-defects than a typical periodic crystal. These results provide a new understanding of the prominence of observed defects in soft-matter quasicrystals.</description>

      <title>Single-run determination of the saturation vapor pressure and enthalpy of vaporization/sublimation of a substance undergoing successive solid-solid and solid-liquid phase transitions: the case of $N$-methyl acetamide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the dynamical measurement of the saturation vapor pressure of $N$-methyl acetamide in the temperature range $-30^\circ$C to $34^\circ$C. This is achieved by monitoring the pressure inside a vacuum chamber in which a precooled sample of the substance slowly thermalizes to the chamber temperature, undergoing first a phase transition between two crystalline structures around $1^\circ$C and then a solid-liquid phase transition around $30^\circ$C. Such a measurement provides in a single run accurate data for the saturation vapor pressure and the enthalpies of sublimation and vaporization of the different phases of the investigated substance.</description>

      <title>Stable soap bubble clusters with multiple torus bubbles: getting a bit more exotic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, numerical examples of stable soap bubble clusters with multiple torus bubbles have been presented. The geometry of these clusters is based on the Platonic solids whose vertices have valence $3$ (in order to fulfill Plateau's laws): the tetrahedron, the cube, the dodecahedron. The clusters respectively contain a bubble of genus $3, 5, 11$. The construction is quite generic and can be used with any convex polyhedron. If stable, the cluster obtained using a polyhedron with $n$ faces has $3n+2$ bubbles and one of these bubbles has genus $n-1$. We propose here to show that is it possible to get stable soap bubble clusters with multiple torus bubbles using a geometry based on prisms and Archimedean solids as well.</description>

      <title>How to Train Your Resistive Network: Generalized Equilibrium Propagation and Analytical Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03546v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning is a powerful method of extracting meaning from data; unfortunately, current digital hardware is extremely energy-intensive. There is interest in an alternative analog computing implementation that could match the performance of traditional machine learning while being significantly more energy-efficient. However, it remains unclear how to train such analog computing systems while adhering to locality constraints imposed by the physical (as opposed to digital) nature of these systems. Local learning algorithms such as Equilibrium Propagation and Coupled Learning have been proposed to address this issue. In this paper, we develop an algorithm to exactly calculate gradients using a graph theoretic and analytical framework for Kirchhoff's laws. We also introduce Generalized Equilibrium Propagation, a framework encompassing a broad class of Hebbian learning algorithms, including Coupled Learning and Equilibrium Propagation, and show how our algorithm compares. We demonstrate our algorithm using numerical simulations and show that we can train resistor networks without the need for a replica or readout over all resistors, only at the output layer. We also show that under the analytical gradient approach, it is possible to update only a subset of the resistance values without a strong degradation in performance.</description>

      <title>The Mpemba effect in the Descartes protocol: A time-delayed Newton's law of cooling approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the direct and inverse Mpemba effects within the framework of the time-delayed Newton's law of cooling by introducing and analyzing the Descartes protocol, a three-reservoir thermal scheme in which each sample undergoes a single-step quench at different times. This protocol enables a transparent separation of the roles of the delay time $\tau$, the waiting time $t_{\text{w}}$, and the normalized warm temperature $\omega$, thus providing a flexible setting to characterize anomalous thermal relaxation. For instantaneous quenches, exact conditions for the existence of the Mpemba effect are obtained as bounds on $\omega$ for given $\tau$ and $t_{\text{w}}$. Within those bounds, the effect becomes maximal at a specific value $\omega=\widetilde{\omega}(t_{\text{w}})$, and its magnitude is quantified by the extremal value of the temperature-difference function at this optimum. Accurate and compact approximations for both $\widetilde{\omega}(t_{\text{w}})$ and the maximal magnitude $\text{Mp}(t_{\text{w}})$ are derived, showing in particular that the absolute maximum at fixed $\tau$ is reached for $t_{\text{w}}=\tau$. A comparison with a previously studied two-reservoir protocol reveals that, despite its additional control parameter, the Descartes protocol yields a smaller maximal magnitude of the effect. The analysis is extended to finite-rate quenches, where strict equality of bath conditions prevents a genuine Mpemba effect, although an approximate one survives when the bath time scale is sufficiently short. The developed framework offers a unified and analytically tractable approach that can be readily applied to other multi-step thermal protocols.</description>

      <title>Energy Cascades in Driven Granular Liquids : A new Universality Class? I : Model and Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article deals with the existence and scaling of an energy cascade in steady granular liquid flows between the scale at which the system is forced and the scale at which it dissipates energy. In particular, we examine the possible origins of a breaking of the Kolmogorov Universality class that applies to Newtonian liquids under similar conditions. In order to answer these questions, we build a generic field theory of granular liquid flows and, through a study of its symmetries, show that indeed the Kolmogorov scaling can be broken, although most of the symmetries of the Newtonian flows are preserved.</description>

      <title>Likelihood-Based Heterogeneity Inference Reveals Non-Stationary Effects in Biohybrid Cell-Cargo Transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12976v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variability of motility behavior in populations of microbiological agents is a ubiquitous phenomenon even in the case of genetically identical cells. Accordingly, passive objects introduced into such biological systems and driven by them will also exhibit heterogeneous motion patterns. Here, we study a biohybrid system of passive beads driven by active ameboid cells and use a likelihood approach to estimate the heterogeneity of the bead dynamics from their discretely sampled trajectories. We showcase how this approach can deal with information-scarce situations and provides natural uncertainty bounds for heterogeneity estimates. Using these advantages we particularly uncover that the heterogeneity in the system is time-dependent.</description>

      <title>Synchrotron X-Ray Multi-Projection Imaging (XMPI) for High-Resolution 4D Characterization of Multiphase Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiphase flows where particles, bubbles, or droplets are suspended in a fluid govern critical processes in biology, medicine, materials processing, and geophysics. However, observing their microscale dynamics in opaque systems has remained a fundamental challenge. We present Synchrotron X-ray Multi-Projection Imaging (XMPI), a novel approach enabling four-dimensional (3D+time) tracking of microparticles in dense suspension flows without requiring sample rotation. By capturing simultaneous projections from multiple angles using beam-split X-rays at synchrotron facilities, we resolve instantaneous particle positions and trajectories in opaque fluids such as blood. We demonstrate the potential of XMPI through individual particle tracking velocimetry (3D PTV) in dilute conditions, as well as multi-projection optical flow analysis in dense suspensions. The methodology provides otherwise inaccessible experimental validation for particle-resolved computational fluid dynamics models and allows, e.g., observation of inertial focusing effects and microstructural dynamics relevant to suspension rheology and biomedical flows. This work paves the way for high-resolution, time-resolved 4D imaging of complex multiphase flows across a range of scientific and industrial applications. Combining XMPI with recent AI-supported 4D reconstruction algorithms opens a new spatiotemporal frontier for high-speed, rotation-free microtomography.</description>

      <title>A reduced model for droplet dynamics with interfacial viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an extension of the phenomenological Maffettone-Minale (MM) model (P.L. Maffettone and M. Minale, J. Non-Newton. Fluid Mech. 78, 227-241 (1998)) to describe the time-dependent deformation of a droplet with interfacial viscosity in a shear flow. The droplet, characterised by surface tension $\sigma$, is spherical at rest with radius $R$ and deforms into an ellipsoidal shape under a shear flow of rate $G$, described by a symmetric second-order morphological tensor $\boldsymbol{S}$. In addition to surface tension, the extended MM (EMM) model incorporates interfacial shear and dilatational viscosities, $\mu_s$ and $\mu_d$, through the corresponding Boussinesq numbers $\mbox{Bq}_s=\mu_s/\mu R$ and $\mbox{Bq}_d=\mu_d/\mu R$, where $\mu$ is the bulk viscosity. A central goal of this work is to quantify the parameter range over which the EMM model provides a realistic description of droplet deformation, as a function of the capillary number Ca$=\mu R G/\sigma$ and the Boussinesq numbers. To this end, model predictions are systematically compared with fully resolved numerical simulations.</description>
