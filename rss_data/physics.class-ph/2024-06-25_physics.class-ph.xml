      <title>Completely Multipolar Model as a General Framework for Many-Body Interactions as Illustrated for Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general framework for many-body force field models, the Completely Multipolar Model (CMM), that utilizes multipolar electrical moments modulated by exponential decay of electron density as a common functional form for all piecewise terms of an energy decomposition analysis of intermolecular interactions. With this common functional form the CMM model establishes well-formulated damped tensors that reach the correct asymptotes at both long- and short-range while formally ensuring no short-range catastrophes. The CMM describes the separable EDA terms of dispersion, exchange polarization, and Pauli repulsion with short-ranged anisotropy, polarization as intramolecular charge fluctuations and induced dipoles, while charge transfer describes explicit movement of charge between molecules, and naturally describes many-body charge transfer by coupling into the polarization equations. We also utilize a new one-body potential that accounts for intramolecular polarization by including an electric field-dependent correction to the Morse potential to ensure that the CMM reproduces all physically relevant monomer properties including the dipole moment, molecular polarizability, and dipole and polarizability derivatives. The quality of the CMM is illustrated through agreement of individual terms of the EDA and excellent extrapolation to energies and geometries of an extensive validation set of water cluster data.</description>

      <title>Heat conduction in low-dimensional electron gases without and with a magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of heat conduction in two-dimensional (2D) electron gases without and with a magnetic field. We perform simulations with the Multi-Particle-Collision approach, suitably adapted to account for the Lorenz force acting on the particles. For zero magnetic field, we find that the heat conductivity $\kappa$ diverges with the system size $L$ following the logarithmic relation $\kappa\thicksim \ln L$ (as predicted for two-dimensional (2D) systems) for small $L$ values; however, in the thermodynamic limit the heat conductivity tends to follow the relation $\kappa\thicksim L^{1/3}$, as predicted for one-dimensional (1D) fluids. This suggests the presence of a dimensional-crossover effect in heat conduction in electronic systems that adhere to standard momentum conservation. Under the magnetic field, time-reversal symmetry is broken and the standard momentum conservation in the system is no longer satisfied but the \emph{pseudomomentum} of the system is still conserved. In contrast with the zero-field case, both equilibrium and non-equilibrium simulations indicate a finite heat conductivity independent on the system size $L$ as $L$ increases. This indicates that pseudomomentum conservation can exhibit normal diffusive heat transport, which differs from the abnormal behavior observed in low-dimensional coupled charged harmonic oscillators with pseudomomentum conservation in a magnetic field. These findings support the validity of the hydrodynamic theory in electron gases and clarify that pseudomomentum conservation is not enough to ensure the anomalous behavior of heat conduction.</description>

      <title>Brownian friction dynamics: fluctuations in sliding distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have studied the fluctuation (noise) in the position of sliding blocks under constant driving forces on different substrate surfaces. The experimental data are complemented by simulations using a simple spring-block model where the asperity contact regions are modeled by miniblocks connected to the big block by viscoelastic springs. The miniblocks experience forces that fluctuate randomly with the lateral position, simulating the interaction between asperities on the block and the substrate. The theoretical model provides displacement power spectra that agree well with the experimental results.</description>

      <title>Tumbling Downhill along a Given Curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A cylinder will roll down an inclined plane in a straight line. A cone will roll around a circle on that plane and then will stop rolling. We ask the inverse question: For which curves drawn on the inclined plane $\mathbb{R}^2$ can one carve a shape that will roll downhill following precisely this prescribed curve and its translationally repeated copies? This simple question has a solution essentially always, but it turns out that for most curves, the shape will return to its initial orientation only after crossing a few copies of the curve - most often two copies will suffice, but some curves require an arbitrarily large number of copies.</description>
