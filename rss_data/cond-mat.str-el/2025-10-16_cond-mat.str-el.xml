      <title>FFT-Accelerated Auxiliary Variable MCMC for Fermionic Lattice Models: A Determinant-Free Approach with $O(N\log N)$ Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that dramatically accelerates the simulation of quantum many-body systems, a grand challenge in computational science. State-of-the-art methods for these problems are severely limited by $O(N^3)$ computational complexity. Our method avoids this bottleneck, achieving near-linear $O(N \log N)$ scaling per sweep.
  Our approach samples a joint probability measure over two coupled variable sets: (1) particle trajectories of the fundamental fermions, and (2) auxiliary variables that decouple fermion interactions. The key innovation is a novel transition kernel for particle trajectories formulated in the Fourier domain, revealing the transition probability as a convolution that enables massive acceleration via the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The auxiliary variables admit closed-form, factorized conditional distributions, enabling efficient exact Gibbs sampling update.
  We validate our algorithm on benchmark quantum physics problems, accurately reproducing known theoretical results and matching traditional $O(N^3)$ algorithms on $32\times 32$ lattice simulations at a fraction of the wall-clock time, empirically demonstrating $N \log N$ scaling. By reformulating a long-standing physics simulation problem in machine learning language, our work provides a powerful tool for large-scale probabilistic inference and opens avenues for physics-inspired generative models.</description>

      <title>Yamaji effect in models of underdoped cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent angle-dependent magnetoresistance measurements in underdoped cuprates have revealed compelling evidence for small hole pockets in the pseudogap regime, including observation of the Yamaji effect in HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$ (Chan et al., Nature Physics 10.1038/s41567-025-03032-2 (2025)). A key distinction between theories is their predicted Fermi volumes, measured as fractions of the square lattice Brillouin zone: $p/4$ per pocket for spin density wave (SDW) versus $p/8$ for fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*), where $p$ is the hole doping. We calculate the $c$-axis magnetoresistance $\rho_{zz}(\theta, \phi)$ within the semiclassical Boltzmann formalism for both states, and using the ancilla layer model (ALM) for FL* in a single-band Hamiltonian. While the SDW Yamaji azimuthal angle $\theta$ is marginally smaller than the FL* Yamaji $\theta$, the most significant difference is the presence of a second Yamaji peak in the SDW theory near in-plane angle $\phi = 45^\circ$; there is no such second peak in the observations in HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$. Furthermore, we examine the role of anisotropic interlayer hopping present in LSCO, and predict the potential emergence of the Yamaji effect in LSCO at higher magnetic fields. Our results support the FL* interpretation of Fermi arcs in the pseudogap phase, and establish Yamaji angle measurements as a discriminatory tool between theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Impurity-induced spin density wave in the thermoelectric layered cobaltite [Ca$_2$CoO$_3$]$_{0.62}$[CoO$_2$]</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Sn-substitution effect on the thermoelectric transport properties of the layered cobaltite [Ca$_2$CoO$_3$]$_{0.62}$[CoO$_2$] single crystals, which exhibit a non-monotonic temperature variation of the electrical resistivity and the Seebeck coefficient owing to the complex electronic and magnetic states. We find that the onset temperature of the short-range spin-density-wave (SDW) formation increases with the substituted Sn content, indicating the impurity-induced stabilization of the SDW order, reminiscent of the disorder/impurity-induced spin order in the cuprate superconductors. The Seebeck coefficient is well related to such impurity effects, as it is slightly enhanced below the onset temperatures, implying a decrease in the carrier concentration due to a pseudo-gap formation associated with the SDW ordering. We discuss the site-dependent substitution effects including earlier studies, and suggest that substitution to the conducting CoO$_2$ layers is essential to increase the onset temperature, consistent with the impurity-induced SDW picture realized in the conducting layers with the cylindrical Fermi surface.</description>

      <title>Frustration-driven unconventional magnetism in the Mn$^{2+}$ ($S=\frac{5}{2}$) based two-dimensional triangular-lattice antiferromagnet Ba$_{3}$MnTa$_{2}$O$_{9}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A triple perovskite oxide Ba$_{3}$MnTa$_{2}$O$_{9}$ has been synthesized and its magnetic properties have been investigated through dc and ac magnetization, specific heat, electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Mn$^{2+}$ ($S$ = 5/2) ions are the only magnetic species present in the material. These Mn$^{2+}$ ions constitute a quasi-two-dimensional triangular network in the crystallographic $ab$-plane. Magnetization and specific heat measurements reveal the absence of any long-range magnetic order down to 0.5\,K despite the presence of antiferromagnetic correlations between the magnetic ions, suggesting the presence of geometric frustration in the material. The entropy release is lower than the expected theoretical value of $Rln(6)$, further suggesting the presence of frustration. First-principles calculations using density functional theory (DFT) and atomistic spin dynamics (ASD) simulations further support this lack of static magnetic order even at low temperatures and identify the competing magnetic interactions along with the quasi-2D magnetic dimensionality as the underlying origin of such an unconventional magnetic behavior.</description>

      <title>Emergent Shastry-Sutherland network from square-kagome Heisenberg antiferromagnet with trimerization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $S=1/2$ square-kagome lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet with the trimarized modulation. In the trimerized limit, each trimer hosts the four-fold degenearte ground states characterized by the spin and chirality degrees of freedom. We find that, within the first-order perturbation theory with respect to the inter-trimer coupling, the effective Hamiltonian is the Kugel-Khomskii-type model on a Shastry-Sutherland lattice. Based on a mean-field decoupling, we propose a dimer-covering ansatz for the effective Hamiltonian; however, the validity of these states in the low-energy sector remains an open question.</description>

      <title>$^{23}$Na-NMR study on the one-dimensional superoxide spin-chain compound NaO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report $^{23}$Na-NMR study on a candidate one-dimensional quantum spin system NaO$_2$. The Knight shift, linewidth, and spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_1$ were investigated down to 0.3 K under fields up to 16 T. The results reveal the opening of a spin gap of $\Delta(10.1 {\rm T}) \simeq$ 38 K below $T_{\rm S3} =$ 40 K, consistent with a spin-Peierls-like instability. The hyperfine coupling constant was found to drop sharply across the structural phase transition at $T_{\rm S2} =$ 215 K, highlighting the pronounced one-dimensional character of the system. These findings establish NaO$_2$ as a rare example of a $\pi$-orbital-based one-dimensional spin chain that exhibits a spin-gapped ground state.</description>

      <title>Interplay of ferromagnetism, nematicity and Fermi surface nesting in kagome flat band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiment on Fe-doped CoSn has uncovered a series of correlated phases upon hole doping of the kagome flat bands. Among the phases observed, a nematic phase with a six- to two-fold rotation symmetry breaking is found to prevail over a wide doping and temperature range. Motivated by these observations, we investigate the interaction-driven phases realized in a kagome model with partially filled, weakly dispersing flat bands. Density-density interactions up to second-nearest neighbors are considered. We identify a close competition between ferromagnetic and nematic phases in our self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculations: while on-site interaction favors ferromagnetism, the sizable inter-sublattice interactions stabilize nematicity over a wide doping window. Competition from translational-symmetry-breaking phases is also considered. Overall, our results show that nematicity is a generic outcome of partially filled kagome flat bands and establish a minimal framework for understanding correlated flat-band phases.</description>

      <title>Bosonic Laughlin and Moore-Read states from non-Chern flat bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advances in the study of fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) raise a fundamental question: while initially discovered in flat Chern bands motivated by their topological equivalence to Landau levels, is single- particle band topology actually a prerequisite for these many-body topological orders emergent at fractional fillings? Here, we numerically demonstrate bosonic FCIs in two types of non-Chern flat bands in honeycomb lattices, using exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group calculations. In a gapless flat band with a singular band touching, we observe a Laughlin state at half filling, stabilized by onsite interactions from the hard-core limit down to arbitrarily small strength. Furthermore, we report the first example of a non- Abelian FCI in a non-Chern band system: a Moore-Read state at $\nu$ = 1 filling of the same singular flat band with hard-core bosons. Under lattice parameters that realize a gapped trivial band (C = 0) of exact flatness, we also find the Laughlin FCI of soft-core bosons in the isolated band limit where onsite interaction is much smaller than the band gap. In this case, the FCI forms as interacting bosons spontaneously avoid the peaks in quantum metric and Berry curvature, preferentially occupying Brillouin zone region with relatively uniform quantum geometry. Our work significantly expands the landscape for (non-)Abelian FCIs and broadens the understanding of their formation beyond the Chern band paradigm.</description>

      <title>Quantum oscillations and transport properties of layered single-crystal SrCu$_4$As$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a systematic investigation of the physical properties and Fermi-surface topology of layered single-crystal \ce{SrCu4As2} using electrical transport, magnetotransport, and quantum-oscillation experiments plus band-structure calculations. The temperature-dependent electrical resistivity reveals a hysteretic phase transition at $T_P$ = 59 K, most likely associated with a structural change. Hall resistivity data suggest a marked change in the average hole density resulting from the latter phase transition near $T_P$. A large, linear, and nonsaturating magnetoresistance is observed at low temperatures in \ce{SrCu4As2}, likely attributable to the multipocket Fermi surface. Quantum-oscillation data measured in magnetic fields of up to 60 T show several oscillation frequencies exhibiting low effective masses, indicating the presence of Dirac-like band dispersion in \ce{SrCu4As2}, as suggested by the band structure calculations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Fisher Information as a Thermal and Dynamical Probe in Frustrated Magnets: Insights from Quantum Spin Ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Fisher information (QFI) is a novel measure of multipartite quantum entanglement that can be measured in inelastic neutron scattering experiments on quantum magnets. In this work, we demonstrate that the QFI can be used to understand the thermal and dynamical properties of quantum magnets by focusing on the pyrochlore lattice model of quantum spin ice (QSI), a three-dimensional quantum spin liquid that hosts fractionalized quasiparticles and emergent photons. We use the newly developed multi-directed loop update quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm and exact diagonalization (ED) to compute the QFI, which is further utilized to calibrate the gauge mean-field theory results. We show that the temperature and momentum dependence of the QFI can reveal characteristic energy scales of distinct phases and phase transitions in the global phase diagram. In particular, the QFI can clearly distinguish the ferromagnetic ordered phase, the thermal critical region above it, as well as two distinct QSI phases, namely zero-flux and $\pi$-flux QSI. Moreover, the QFI shows two crossover temperature scales, one from the trivial paramagnet to the classical spin ice regime and a lower temperature crossover to QSI. We discuss our results, especially for the $\pi$-flux QSI, in light of the ongoing experimental efforts on Cerium-based pyrochlore systems. Our results demonstrate that the QFI not only detects entanglement properties but can also be viewed as a sensitive thermal and dynamical probe in the investigation of quantum magnets.</description>

      <title>A universal description of Mott insulators: Characterizing quantum phases beyond broken symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using Mott insulators as a prototypical example, we demonstrate a dynamics-based characterization of quantum phases of matter through a general N-body renormalization group framework. The essential "Mott-ness" turns out to be characterized by a change of size-scaling of the effective intra- momentum repulsions between long-lived emergent "eigen-particles" that encodes the dynamics of two-body bound states in the high-energy sector. This directly offers a universal characterization at long space-time scale for the corresponding class of Mott insulators through a uniform single occupation of all momenta, and otherwise Mott metals. This universal description naturally paves the way to topological Mott insulators and is straightforward to extend to bosonic Mott systems. More generally, this demonstration exemplifies a generic paradigm of characterizing quantum phases of matter through their distinct dynamics beyond broken symmetries.</description>

      <title>Extra force in charged resonant capacitors: a new macroscopic effect of vacuum fluctuations ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on measurements of the mechanical vibrations of the fundamental mode of resonant capacitive transducers, consisting of parallel plates at different gaps (10 - 26 $\mu$m). Resonant frequency data were taken vs the electric field at constant charge, at various temperatures and different configurations. All measurements exhibited unexpectedly large tuning, caused by an additional, unpredicted attractive force. Such force has a divergent behaviour characterized by a critical electrical field and start to diverge long before the critical point. Many known physical mechanisms have been considered to explain this force, but all of them had to be discarded. Thus, we turn to non-conventional physical mechanisms and suggest that vacuum fluctuations inside the gap could be a possible cause of this anomalous force.</description>

      <title>Diffeomorphism invariant tensor networks for 3d gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor networks prepare states that share many features of states in quantum gravity. However, standard constructions are not diffeomorphism invariant and do not support an algebra of non-commuting area operators. Recently, analogues of both problems were addressed in a tensor network discretization of topological field theories (TFT) with finite or compact gauge groups. Here, we extend this work towards gravity by generalizing to gauge groups that are discrete or continuous, compact or non-compact. Applied to $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{R}) \times \text{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ Chern-Simons theory, our construction can be interpreted as building states of three dimensional gravity with a negative cosmological constant. Our tensor networks prepare states that satisfy the constraints of Chern-Simons theory. In metric variables, this implies that the states we construct satisfy the Wheeler-DeWitt equation and momentum constraints, and so are diffeomorphism invariant.</description>

      <title>Ferroelasticity tunable altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets have garnered great interest due to their non-relativistic spin splitting and novel physical properties. However, the control of altermagnetic states remains underexplored. Here, we propose a new multiferroic state, i.e. ferroelastic altermagnetic state, in which ferroelastic strain couples directly to the spin-splitting. Through symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we identify the ferroelastic $d$-wave altermagnetism of puckered pentagonal CoSe$_2$ monolayer. Interestingly, uniaxial stress can induce a ferroelastic phase transition, accompanied by a $90^\circ$ rotation of the spin-splitting bands. Cooperative rotation of the lattice and N\'eel vectors preserves the sign of Kerr angle, whereas noncooperative rotation reverses it. Our work provides a general strategy for manipulating altermagnetism in multiferroic systems and opens new avenues for exploring emergent magnetoelastic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric amplitude switching and continuous memory</title>

Abstract: Although ferroelectric systems inherently exhibit binary switching behavior, recent advances in analog memory device have spurred growing interest in achieving continuous memory states. In this work, we demonstrate ferroelectric amplitude switching at the mesoscopic scale in compositionally graded Ba1-xSrxTiO3 heterostructures, enabling continuous modulation of polarization magnitude without altering its direction, which we defined as amplitude switching. Using switching current measurement, piezoresponse force microscopy and Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire simulations, we reveal that compositionally graded ferroelectric heterostructure can possess amplitude switching behavior through a double well potential with flattened minima. This behavior supports stable, continuous polarization states and establishes a new platform for analog memory applications. These findings introduce amplitude switching as a new dynamic of the order parameter, paving the way for energy-efficient and reliable analog memory systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov Equations and Integrability of Quantum Field Theories with Time-dependent Interaction Strength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of solving quantum field theories with time dependent interaction strengths. We show that the recently formulated framework [P. R. Pasnoori, Phys. Rev. B 112, L060409 (2025)], which is a generalization of the regular Bethe ansatz technique, provides the exact many-body wavefunction. In this framework, the time-dependent Schrodinger equation is reduced to a set of analytic difference equations and matrix difference equations, called the quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (qKZ) equations. The consistency of the solution gives rise to constraints on the time-dependent interaction strengths. For interaction strengths satisfying these constraints, the system is integrable, and the solution to the qKZ and the analytic difference equations provides the explicit form of the many-body wavefunction that satisfies the time-dependent Schrodinger equation. We provide a concrete example by considering the $SU(2)$ Gross-Neveu model with time dependent interaction strength. Using this framework we solve the model with the most general time-dependent interaction strength and obtain the explicit form of the wave function.</description>

      <title>Pinch-line spin liquids as layered Coulomb phases and applications to cubic models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16978v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin liquids form fluctuating magnetic textures which have to obey certain rules imposed by frustration. These rules can often be written in the form of a Gauss law, indicating the local conservation of an emergent electric field. In reciprocal space, these emergent Gauss laws appear as singularities known as pinch points, that are accessible to neutron-scattering measurements. But more exotic forms of electromagnetism have been stabilized in spin liquids, and in a few rare instances, these zero-dimensional singularities have been extended into one-dimensional pinch lines. Here we propose a simple framework for the design of pinch-line spin liquids in a layered structure of two-dimensional algebraic spin liquids. A plethora of models can be build within this framework, as exemplified by several concrete examples where our theory is confirmed by simulations, and where the rank of the tensorial gauge field is continuously varied along the pinch line, opening new avenues in fractonic matter. Then we use our framework to understand how the evolution of the singularity pinch point along the pinch line can be understood as the interference pattern of two emergent electric fields. Finally, we apply our intuition on these emergent electric fields in real space to generic pinch line models beyond our layered framework, and revisit the recently proposed pinch line model on the octochlore lattice.</description>

      <title>Particle-Hole Asymmetry and Pinball Liquid in a Triangular-Lattice Extended Hubbard Model within Mean-Field Approximation</title>

Abstract: Recently, triangular lattice models have received a lot of attention since they can describe a number of strongly-correlated materials that exhibit superconductivity and various magnetic and charge orders. In this research we present an extensive analysis of the charge-ordering phenomenon of the triangular-lattice extended Hubbard model with repulsive onsite and nearest-neighbor interaction, arbitrary charge concentration, and $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ supercell (3-sublattice assumption). The model is solved in the ground state with the mean-field approximation which allowed to identify $8$ charge-ordered phases and a large variety of phase transitions. An exotic pinball-liquid phase was found and described. Moreover, strong particle-hole asymmetry of the phase diagram is found to play an important role for triangular lattices. The detailed analysis of band structures, unavailable for more advanced methods, such as dynamical mean-field theory, allowed us to interpret the found triangular-lattice phases and provided a great insight into the mechanisms behind the phase transitions that can also be met when correlation effects are taken into account. The complexity of the mean-field phase diagram showed the importance and usefulness of the results for the further research with correlation effects included. Together with atomic-limit approximation it can serve them as both a starting point, and a tool to interpret results.</description>

      <title>Finding local integrals of motion in quantum lattice models in the thermodynamic limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05882v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Local integrals of motion (LIOMs) play a key role in understanding the long-time properties of closed macroscopic systems. They were found for selected integrable systems via complex analytical calculations. The existence of LIOMs and their structure can also be studied via numerical methods, which, however, involve exact diagonalization of Hamiltonians, posing a bottleneck for such studies. We show that finding LIOMs in translationally invariant lattice models or unitary quantum circuits can be reduced to a problem for which one may numerically find an exact solution in the thermodynamic limit. We develop a simple algorithm and demonstrate its efficiency by calculating LIOMs and bounds on correlations (the Mazur bounds) for infinite integrable spin chains and unitary circuits. Finally, we demonstrate that this approach identifies slow modes in nearly integrable spin models and estimates their relaxation times.</description>

      <title>Topology meets symmetry breaking: Hidden order, intrinsically gapless topological states and finite-temperature topological transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the discovery of phase transitions driven by topological defects, the classification of phases of matter has been significantly extended beyond Ginzburg and Landau's paradigm of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB). In particular, intrinsic and symmetry-protected topological (SPT) orders have been discovered in (mostly gapped) quantum many-body ground states. However, these are commonly viewed as zero-temperature phenomena, and their robustness in a gapless ground state or against thermal fluctuations remains challenging to tackle. Here we introduce an explicit construction for SPT-type states with hidden order associated with SSB: They feature (quasi) long-range correlations along appropriate edges, but short-range order in the bulk; ground state degeneracy associated with SSB; and non-local string order in the bulk. We apply our construction to predict two types of finite-temperature SPT transitions, in the Ising and BKT class respectively, where the usual signs of criticality appear despite the absence of a diverging correlation length in the bulk. While the state featuring hidden Ising order is gapped, the other SPT state associated with the BKT-SPT transition has hidden $U(1)$, or XY-order and constitutes an intrinsically gapless SPT state, associated with a gapless Goldstone mode. Specifically, in this work we discuss spins with global $\mathbb{Z}_2$ or $U(1)$ symmetry coupled to link variables constituting a loop gas model. By mapping this system to an Ising-gauge theory, we demonstrate that one of the SPT phases we construct corresponds to the Higgs-SPT phase at $T=0$ -- which we show here to remain stable at finite temperature. Our work paves the way for a more systematic search for hidden order SPT phases, including in gapless systems, and raises the question if a natural (finite-$T$) spin liquid candidate exists that realizes hidden order in the Higgs-SPT class.</description>

      <title>Quantization and quantum oscillations of the sublattice charge order in Dirac insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the quantization, quantum oscillations, and singular behavior of sublattice symmetry-breaking sublattice charge order (SCO) in two-dimensional Dirac insulators at charge neutrality under perpendicular magnetic fields $B$. SCO is induced by staggered sublattice potentials, such as those originating from substrates, strains, hydrogenation, and chemical doping. In small non-quantizing magnetic fields that result in less than a flux quantum threading the system, and small sublattice symmetry breaking potentials, SCO exhibits perturbative singular magnetic field dependence, $\sim |B|$, originating from hopping between neighboring sites of the same sublattice. At intermediate magnetic fields, when the cyclotron gap between the zeroth Landau level and the first Landau level, $\omega_c$, is smaller than the sublattice potential, $\omega_c\lesssim \Delta$, SCO shows $\textit{universally}$ quantized plateaus owing to discrete Landau-level degeneracy. As the magnetic flux increases by one flux quantum, one electron (per spin) is transferred from the sublattice with a higher chemical potential to the sublattice with a lower chemical potential. One electron transfer between sublattices per flux quantum results from the sublattice polarization of the zeroth Landau level in gapped Dirac materials, realizing the topological Thouless pump effect. At stronger magnetic fields, $\omega_c\gtrsim \ \Delta$, corresponding to integer quantum Hall regimes, SCO displays singularities based on the physics of quantum magneto-oscillations. Our findings suggest new ways to experimentally detect the presence of the energy gap in Dirac materials, irrespective of the gap size.</description>

Abstract: We present a model for strongly interacting fermions with internal O(3) symmetry on the fuzzy-sphere that (i) preserves the rotational symmetry of the fuzzy sphere and (ii) undergoes a quantum phase transition in the (2+1)-dimensional O(3) Wilson-Fisher universality class. Using exact diagonalization (ED) and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), we locate the quantum critical point via conformal perturbation theory and obtain scaling dimensions from finite-size spectra. We identify 24 primary operators and determine some of their operator product expansion coefficients through first-order conformal perturbation theory. The results are benchmarked against conformal bootstrap and large quantum-number expansions and reveal a weakly irrelevant operator that plays a role in dimerized antiferromagnets. Our work establishes the fuzzy sphere as a general framework for quantitatively accessing conformal data in non-Abelian conformal field theories (CFTs).</description>

      <title>A recipe for local simulation of strongly-correlated fermionic matter on quantum computers: the 2D Fermi-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The simulation of quantum many-body systems, relevant for quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics, is one of the most promising applications of near-term quantum computers before fault-tolerance. However, since the vast majority of quantum computing technologies are built around qubits and discrete gate-based operations, the translation of the physical problem into this framework is a crucial step. This translation will often be device specific, and a suboptimal implementation will be punished by the exponential compounding of errors on real devices. The importance of an efficient mapping is already revealed for models of spinful fermions in two or three dimensions, which naturally arise when the relevant physics relates to electrons. Using the most direct and well-known mapping, the Jordan-Wigner transformation, leads to a non-local representation of local degrees of freedom, and necessities efficient decompositions of non-local unitary gates into a sequence of hardware accessible local gates. In this paper, we provide a step-by-step recipe for simulating the paradigmatic two-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model on a quantum computer using only local operations. To provide the ingredients for such a recipe, we briefly review the plethora of different approaches that have emerged recently but focus on the Derby-Klassen compact fermion mapping in order to make our discussion concrete. We provide a detailed recipe for an end-to-end simulation including embedding on a physical device, preparing initial states such as ground states, simulation of unitary time evolution, and measurement of observables and spectral functions. We explicitly compute the resource requirements for simulating a global quantum quench and conclude by discussing the challenges and future directions for simulating strongly-correlated fermionic matter on quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Localized fermions on the triangular lattice with Ising-like interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The model of localized fermions on the triangular lattice is analyzed in means of the Monte Carlo simulations in the grand canonical ensemble. The Hamiltonian of the system has a form of the extended Hubbard model (at the atomic limit) with nearest-neighbor Ising-like magnetic $J$ interactions and onsite Coulomb $U$ interactions. The model is investigated for both signs of $J$, arbitrary $U$ interaction and arbitrary chemical potential $\mu$ (or, equivalently, arbitrary particle concentration $n$). Based on the specific heat capacity and sublattice magnetization analyses, the phase diagrams of the model are determined. For ferromagnetic case ($J&lt;0$), the transition from the ordered phase (which is a standard ferromagnet and can be stable up to $k_{B}T/|J| \approx 0.61$) is found to be second-order (for sufficiently large temperatures $k_{B}T/|J| \gtrsim 0.2$) or first-order (for $-1&lt;U/|J|&lt;-0.65$ at the half-filling, i.e., $n=1$). In the case of $J&gt;0$, the ordered phase occurs in a range of $-1/2&lt;U/|J|&lt;0$ (for $n=1$), while for larger $U$ the state with short-range order is also found (also for $n \neq 1$). The ordered phase is characterized by an antiferromagnetic arrangement of magnetic moments in two sublattices forming the hexagonal lattice. The transition from this ordered phase, which is found also for $\mu \neq 0$ ($n \neq 1$) and $U/|J|&gt;-1/2$ is always second-order for any model parameters. The ordered phase for $J&gt;0$ can be stable up to $k_{B}T/|J| \approx 0.06$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03266v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a local offline decoder for topological codes that operates according to a parallelized message-passing framework. The decoder works by passing messages between anyons, with the contents of received messages used to move nearby anyons towards one another. We prove the existence of a threshold, and show that in a system of linear size $L$, decoding terminates with an $O((\log L)^\eta)$ average-case runtime, where $\eta$ is a small constant. For the toric code subject to i.i.d Pauli noise, our decoder has $\eta=1$ and a threshold at a noise strength of $p_c\approx 7.3\%$.</description>
