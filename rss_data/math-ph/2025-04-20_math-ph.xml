      <title>From Lorentz to $SIM(2)$: contraction, four-dimensional algebraic relations and projective representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study on $SIM(2)$ and $ISIM(2)$ groups, their representations and algebraic aspects. After obtaining $SIM(2)$ through the In\"on\"u-Wigner contraction procedure, a complete four-dimensional algebraic representation is shown for $\mathfrak{sim(2)}$ and $\mathfrak{isim(2)}$. Besides that, we apply Bargmann's formalism to investigate the (projective) representations for both cases, keeping track of the source of phase factors. We complete the study by presenting a particularly simple analysis to probe the existence of local phase factors, which is useful when dealing with non-abelian groups.</description>

      <title>Generalized super-$W_{1+\infty}$-$n$-algebra and Landau Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the $\mathcal{R}(p,q)$-super $n$-bracket and study their properties such that the generalized super Jacobi identity (GJSI). Furthermore, from the $\mathcal{R}(p,q)$-operators in a Supersymmetric Landau problem, we furnish the $\mathcal{R}(p,q)$-super $W_{1+\infty}$ $n$-algebra which obey the generalized super Jacobi identity (GSJI) for $n$ even. Also, we derive the $\mathcal{R}(p,q)$-super $W_{1+\infty}$ sub-$2n$-algebra and deduce particular cases induced by quantum algebras existing in the literature.</description>

      <title>Lie Superheaps and their Groupification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a Lie superheaps as a generalisation of Lie supergroups. We show that the well-known `groupification' and `heapification' functors generalise to the ambience of supergeometry. In particular, we show that there is an isomorphism between the categories of pointed Lie superheaps and Lie supergroups. To do this we make extensive use of the functor of points.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we examine the discrete Laplacian acting on a hexagonal lattice by introducing long-range modifications in both the metric and the potential. Our objective is to establish a Limiting Absorption Principle, excluding possible embedded eigenvalues. To this end, we employ the positive commutator technique as our method.</description>

      <title>Whither the Zeroth Law of Turbulence?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experimental and numerical studies of incompressible turbulence suggest that the mean dissipation rate of kinetic energy remains constant as the Reynolds number tends to infinity (or the non-dimensional viscosity tends to zero). This anomalous behavior is central to many theories of high-Reynolds-number turbulence and for this reason has been termed the "zeroth law". Here we report a sequence of direct numerical simulations of incompressible Navier-Stokes in a box with periodic boundary conditions, which indicate that the anomaly vanishes at a rate that agrees with the scaling of third-moment of absolute velocity increments. Our results suggest that turbulence without boundaries may not develop strong enough singularities to sustain the zeroth law.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Thomas-Fermi theory for 2D abelian anyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional abelian anyons are, in the magnetic gauge picture, represented as fermions coupled to magnetic flux tubes. For the ground state of such a system in a trapping potential, we theoretically and numerically investigate a Hartree approximate model, obtained by restricting trial states to Slater determinants and introducing a self-consistent magnetic field, locally proportional to matter density. This leads to a fermionic variant of the Chern-Simons-Schr{\"o}dinger system. We find that for dense systems, a semi-classical approximation yields qualitatively good results. Namely, we derive a density functional theory of magnetic Thomas-Fermi type, which correctly captures the trends of our numerical results. In particular, we explore the subtle dependence of the ground state with respect to the fraction of magnetic flux units attached to particles.</description>

      <title>Accurate semiclassical analysis of light propagation on tilted hyperplanes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the scalar light model given by Helmholtz' equation in R^{1+d} , we consider the transformation of an initial scene (a hologram) in {0}xR^d by an arbitrary affine transformation (which can be viewed as a propagation into a tilted hyperplane). In the high frequency regime, we use microlocal and semiclassical analysis to describe the propagator as a semiclassical Fourier integral operator, thus generalising the well-known Angular Spectrum formula from optics. We then prove new precise Egorov theorems, including subprincipal terms, which indicate how to take into account the propagation along rays of geometric optics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider $2\times 2$ matrix-valued pseudodifferential equations in which the two characteristic sets intersect with finite contact order. We show that the asymptotic behavior of its solution changes dramatically before and after the crossing point, and provide a precise asymptotic formula. This is a generalization of the previous results for matrix-valued Schr\"odinger operators and Landau-Zener models. The proof relies on a normal form reduction and a detailed analysis of a simple first-order system.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional dynamics in low-dimensional networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many networks that arise in nature and applications are effectively low-dimensional in the sense that their connectivity structure is dominated by a few dimensions. It is natural to expect that dynamics on such networks might also be low-dimensional. Indeed, recent results show that low-rank networks produce low-dimensional dynamics whenever the network is isolated from external perturbations or noise. However, networks in nature are rarely isolated. We show that recurrent networks with low-rank structure often produce high-dimensional dynamics in the presence of high-dimensional perturbations. Counter to intuition, dynamics in these networks are \textit{suppressed} in directions that are aligned with the network's low-rank structure, a phenomenon we term "low-rank suppression." Our results clarify important, but counterintuitive relationships between a network's connectivity structure and the structure of the dynamics it generates.</description>

      <title>A dynamical Amrein-Berthier uncertainty principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a selfadjoint magnetic Schr\"odinger operator
  \begin{equation*}
  H = ( i \partial + A(x) )^2 + V(x)
  \end{equation*} on $L^{2}(\mathbb{R}^n)$, with $V(x)$ strictly subquadratic and $A(x)$ strictly sublinear, we prove that the flow $u(t)=e^{-itH}u(0)$ satisfies an Amrein--Berthier type inequality
  \begin{equation*}
  \|u(t)\|_{L^{2}}\lesssim_{E,F,T,A,V}
  \|u(0)\|_{L^{2}(E^{c})}
  +
  \|u(T)\|_{L^{2}(F^{c})},
  \qquad
  0\le t\le T
  \end{equation*} for all compact sets $E,F \subset \mathbb{R}^{n}$. In particular, if both $u(0)$ and $u(T)$ are compactly supported, then $u$ vanishes identically. Under different assumptions on the operator, which allow for time--dependent coefficients, the result extends to sets $E,F$ of finite measure. We also consider a few variants for Schr\"{o}dinger operators with singular coefficients, metaplectic operators, and we include applications to control theory.</description>

      <title>A new quasi-lisse affine vertex algebra of type $D_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a family of potential quasi-lisse affine vertex algebras $L_{k_m}(D_4)$ at levels $k_m =-6 + \frac{4}{2m+1}$. In the case $m=0$, the irreducible $L_{k_0}(D_4)$--modules were classified in arXiv:1205.3003, and it was proved in arXiv:1610.05865 that $L_{k_0}(D_4)$ is a quasi-lisse vertex algebra. We conjecture that $L_{k_m}(D_4)$ is quasi-lisse for every $m \in {\mathbb{Z}}_{&gt;0}$, and that it contains a unique irreducible ordinary module. In this article we prove this conjecture for $m=1$, by using mostly computational methods. We show that the maximal ideal in the universal affine vertex algebra $V^{k_1}(D_4)$ is generated by three singular vectors of conformal weight six. The explicit formulas were obtained using software. Then we apply Zhu's theory and classify all irreducible $L_{k_1}(D_4)$--modules. It turns out that $L_{k_1}(D_4)$ has $405$ irreducible modules in the category $\mathcal O$, but a unique irreducible ordinary module. Finally, we prove that $L_{k_1}(D_4)$ is quasi-lisse by showing that its associated variety is contained in the nilpotent cone of $D_4$.</description>

      <title>On Refined Vogel's universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In accordance with P. Vogel, a set of algebra structures in Chern-Simons theory can be made universal, independent of a particular family of simple Lie algebras. In particular, this means that various quantities in the adjoint representations of these simple Lie algebras such as dimensions and quantum dimensions, Racah coefficients, etc. are simple rational functions of two parameters on Vogel's plane, giving three lines associated with $sl$, $so/sp$ and exceptional algebras correspondingly. By analyzing the partition function of refined of Chern-Simons theory, it was suggested earlier that the refinement may preserve the universality for simply laced algebras. Here we support this conjecture by analysing the Macdonald dimensions, i.e. values of Macdonald polynomials at $q^\rho$, where $\rho$ is the Weyl vector: there is a universality formula that describes these dimensions for the simply laced algebras as a function on the Vogel's plane.</description>

      <title>Derivation of renormalized Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov and quantum Boltzmann equations in an interacting Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06298v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our previous work [37] presented a rigorous derivation of quantum Boltzmann equations near a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Here, we extend it with a complete characterization of the leading order fluctuation dynamics. For this purpose, we correct the latter via an appropriate Bogoliubov rotation, in partial analogy to the approach by Grillakis-Machedon et al. [59], in addition to the Weyl transformation applied in [37]. Based on the analysis of the third order expansion of the BEC wave function, and the second order expansions of the pair-correlations, we show that through a renormalization strategy, various contributions to the effective Hamiltonian can be iteratively eliminated by an appropriate choice of the Weyl and Bogoliubov transformations. This leads to a separation of renormalized Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) equations and quantum Boltzmann equations. A multitude of terms that were included in the error term in [37] are now identified as contributions to the HFB renormalization terms. Thereby, the error bound in the work at hand is improved significantly. To the given order, it is now sharp, and matches the order or magnitude expected from scaling considerations. Consequently, we extend the time of validity to $t\sim (\log N)^2$ compared to $t\sim (\log N/\log \log N)^2$ before. We expect our approach to be extensible to smaller orders in $\frac1N$.</description>

      <title>Polynomial potentials and nilpotent groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with the partial solution of the energy-eigenvalue problem for one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operators of the form $H_N=X_0^2+V_N$, where $V_N=X_N^2+\alpha X_{N-1}$ is a polynomial potential of degree $(2N-2)$ and $X_i$ are the generators of an irreducible representation of a particular nilpotent group $\mathcal{G}_N$. Algebraization of the eigenvalue problem is achieved for eigenfunctions of the form $\sum_{k=0}^M a_k X_2^k \exp(-\int dx\, X_N)$. It is shown that the overdetermined linear system of equations for the coefficients $a_k$ has a nontrivial solution, if the parameter $\alpha$ and $(N-3)$ Casimir invariants satisfy certain constraints. This general setting works for even $N\geq 2$ and can also be applied to odd $N\geq 3$, if the potential is symmetrized by considering it as function of $|x|$ rather than $x$. It provides a unified approach to quasi-exactly solvable polynomial interactions, including the harmonic oscillator, and extends corresponding results known from the literature. Explicit expressions for energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are given for the quasi-exactly solvable sextic, octic and decatic potentials. The case of $E=0$ solutions for general $N$ and $M$ is also discussed. As physical application, the movement of a charged particle in an electromagnetic field of pertinent polynomial form is shortly sketched.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a \emph{q}-differential operator adapted to \emph{q}-spinor variables, establishing a corresponding \emph{q}-spinor chain rule and defining both standard and Dirac-type \emph{q}-differential operators. Integral formulas in \emph{q}-spinor variables are derived, and applications to \emph{q}-deformed spinor differential equations are explored through explicit examples. The framework extends existing \emph{q}-calculus to spinorial structures, offering potential insights into quantum deformations of relativistic field equations. We conclude with suggestions for future developments, including a \emph{q}-analogue of the Dirac--Maxwell algebra.</description>

      <title>Family Floer SYZ singularities for the conifold transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.13948v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show a mathematically precise version of the SYZ conjecture, proposed in the family Floer context, for the conifold with a conjectural mirror relation between smoothing and crepant resolution. The singular T-duality fibers are explicitly written and exactly correspond to the codimension-2 `missing points' in the mirror cluster variety, which confirms the speculation of Chan, Pomerleano, and Ueda but only in the non-archimedean setting. Concerning purely the area of Berkovich geometry and forgetting all the mirror symmetry background, our B-side analytic fibration is also a new explicit example of affinoid torus fibration with singular extension.</description>

      <title>Anomalous current fluctuations from Euler hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20091v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the hydrodynamic origin of anomalous current fluctuations in a family of stochastic charged cellular automata. Using ballistic macroscopic fluctuation theory, we study both typical and large fluctuations of the charge current and reproduce microscopic results which are available for the deterministic single-file limit of the models. Our results indicate that in general initial fluctuations propagated by Euler equations fully characterize both scales of anomalous fluctuations. For stochastic dynamics, we find an additional contribution to typical fluctuations and conjecture the functional form of the typical probability distribution, which we confirm by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Quantum theory from classical mechanics near equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider classical theories described by Hamiltonians $H(p,q)$ that have a non-degenerate minimum at the point where generalized momenta $p$ and generalized coordinates $q$ vanish. We assume that the sum of squares of generalized momenta and generalized coordinates is an integral of motion. In this situation, in the neighborhood of the point $p=0, q=0$ quadratic part of a Hamiltonian plays a dominant role. We suppose that a classical observer can observe only physical quantities corresponding to quadratic Hamiltonians and show that in this case, he should conclude that the laws of quantum theory govern his world.</description>
