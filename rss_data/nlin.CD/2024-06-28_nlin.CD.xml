      <title>Local and Global Dynamics of a Functionally Graded Dielectric Elastomer Plate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the nonlinear vibrations of a functionally graded dielectric elastomer plate subjected to electromechanical loads. We focus on local and global dynamics in the system. We employ the Gent strain energy function to model the dielectric elastomer. The functionally graded parameters are the shear modulus, mass density, and permittivity of the elastomer, which are formulated by a common through-thickness power-law scheme. We derive the equation of motion using the Euler-Lagrange equations and solve it numerically with the Runge-Kutta method and a continuation-based method. We investigate the influence of the functionally graded parameters on equilibrium points, natural frequencies, and static/dynamic instability. We also establish a Hamiltonian energy method to detect safe regions of operating gradient parameters. Furthermore, we explore the effect of the functionally graded parameters on chaos and resonance by plotting several numerical diagrams, including time histories, phase portraits, Poincar\'e maps, largest Lyapunov exponent criteria, bifurcation diagram of Poincar\'e maps, and frequency-stretch curves. The results provide a benchmark for developing functionally graded soft smart materials.</description>

      <title>Computing Quantum Mean Values in the Deep Chaotic Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the time evolution of mean values of quantum operators in a regime plagued by two difficulties: The smallness of $\hbar$ and the presence of strong and ubiquitous classical chaos. While numerics become too computationally expensive for purely quantum calculations as $\hbar \to 0$, methods that take advantage of the smallness of $\hbar$ -- that is, semiclassical methods -- suffer from both conceptual and practical difficulties in the deep chaotic regime. We implement an approach which addresses these conceptual problems, leading to a deeper understanding of the origin of the interference contributions to the operator's mean value. We show that in the deep chaotic regime our approach is capable of unprecedented accuracy, while a standard semiclassical method (the Herman-Kluk propagator) produces only numerical noise. Our work paves the way to the development and employment of more efficient and accurate methods for quantum simulations of systems with strongly chaotic classical limits.</description>

      <title>Efficient point-based simulation of four-way coupled particles in turbulence at high number density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many natural and industrial applications, turbulent flows encompass some form of dispersed particles. Although this type of multiphase turbulent flow is omnipresent, its numerical modeling has proven to be a remarkably challenging problem. Models that fully resolve the particle phase are computationally very expensive, strongly limiting the number of particles that can be considered in practice. This warrants the need for efficient reduced order modeling of the complex system of particles in turbulence that can handle high number densities of particles. Here, we present an efficient method for point-based simulation of particles in turbulence that are four-way coupled. In contrast with traditional one-way coupled simulations, where only the effect of the fluid phase on the particle phase is modeled, this method additionally captures the back-reaction of the particle phase on the fluid phase, as well as the interactions between particles themselves. We focus on the most challenging case of very light particles or bubbles, which show strong clustering in the high-vorticity regions of the fluid. This strong clustering poses numerical difficulties which are systematically treated in our work. Our method is valid in the limit of small particles with respect to the Kolmogorov scales of the flow and is able to handle very large number densities of particles. This methods paves the way for comprehensive studies of the collective effect of small particles in fluid turbulence for a multitude of applications.</description>
