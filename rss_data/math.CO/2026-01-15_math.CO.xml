      <title>Multiple cluster algebra structures for TCD maps I: theoretical framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce triple crossing diagram (TCD) maps, which encode projective configurations of points and lines, as a unified framework for constructions arising in various areas of geometry, such as discrete differential geometry, discrete geometric dynamics and hyperbolic geometry. We define two types of local moves for TCD maps, one of which is governed by the discrete Schwarzian KP (dSKP) equation, and establish their multi-dimensional consistency. We construct two distinct cluster structures on the space of TCD maps, called projective and affine cluster structures, and show that they are related via an operation called section. This framework organizes and unifies a wide range of examples, including Q-nets, Darboux maps, line complexes, T-graphs, t-embeddings, triangulations and geometric discrete integrable systems such as the pentagram map and cross-ratio dynamics, which are further developed in a companion paper and in (arXiv:2108.12692).</description>

      <title>Solution to a Problem of Erd\H{o}s Concerning Distances and Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1997, Erd\H{o}s asked whether for arbitrarily large $n$ there exists a set of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ that determines $O(\frac{n}{\sqrt{\log n}})$ distinct distances while satisfying the local constraint that every 4-point subset determines at least 3 distinct pairwise distances. We construct $n$-point sets from an $m\times m$ box of the lattice $L = \{(x,\sqrt{2}y):x,y \in \mathbb{Z}\} \subset \mathbb{R}^2.$ The distinct distance bound follows from applying Bernays' theorem to the number of integers represented by the binary quadratic form $u^2 + 2v^2$. The local 4-point constraint is verified through Perucca's similarity classification of the six similarity types determining exactly two distances.</description>

      <title>Chip-firing on the Lattice of Nonnegative Integer Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chip-firing on a directed graph is a game in which chips, a discrete commodity, are placed on the vertices of the graph and are transferred between vertices. In this paper, we study a chip-firing game on the Hasse diagram of the lattice of nonnegative integer points on the plane, where we start with $2^n$ chips at the origin. When we fire a vertex $v$, we send one chip to each out-neighbor. We fire until we reach a stable configuration, a distribution of chips where no vertex can fire.
  We study the intermediate firing configuration: a table that assigns to each vertex the total number of chips that pass through it. We prove that the nonzero entries of the stable configuration correspond to the odd entries of the intermediate configuration. The intermediate configuration consists of three parts: the top triangle, the midsection, and the bottom triangle. We describe properties of each part. We study properties of each row and the number of rows of the intermediate configuration. We also explore properties of the difference tables, which are tables of first differences of each row of the intermediate firing configuration.</description>

      <title>On the complexity of global Roman domination problem in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Roman dominating function of a graph $G=(V,E)$ is a labeling $f: V \rightarrow{} \{0 ,1, 2\}$ such that for each vertex $u \in V$ with $f(u) = 0$, there exists a vertex $v \in N(u)$ with $f(v) =2$. A Roman dominating function $f$ is a global Roman dominating function if it is a Roman dominating function for both $G$ and its complement $\overline{G}$. The weight of $f$ is the sum of $f(u)$ over all the vertices $u \in V$. The objective of Global Roman Domination problem is to find a global Roman dominating function with minimum weight. The objective of Global Roman Domination is to compute a global Roman dominating function of minimum weight.
  In this paper, we study the algorithmic aspects of Global Roman Domination problem on various graph classes and obtain the following results.
  1. We prove that Roman domination and Global Roman Domination problems are not computationally equivalent by identifying graph classes on which one is linear-time solvable, while the other is NP-complete.
 2. We show that Global Roman Domination problem is NP-complete on split graphs, thereby resolving an open question posed by Panda and Goyal [Discrete Applied Mathematics, 2023].
  3. We prove that Global Roman Domination problem is NP-complete on chordal bipartite graphs, planar bipartite graphs with maximum degree five and circle graphs.
  4. On the positive side, we present a linear-time algorithm for Global Roman domination problem on cographs.</description>

      <title>Line Multigraphs of Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A line multigraph is obtained from a hypergraph as follows: the vertices of the multigraph correspond to the hyperedges of the hypergraph, and the number of edges between two vertices is given by the number of vertices shared by the corresponding hyperedges. In this paper, we establish several structural and spectral properties of this class of multigraphs. More precisely, we show that important structural characteristics, such as connectivity, linearity, and regularity are, in some sense, preserved between a hypergraph and its line multigraph. We also prove that the eigenvalues of the line multigraph associated with a general hypergraph of rank $r$ are greater than or equal to $-r$, which generalizes a fundamental spectral property of line graphs. Furthermore, we provide sufficient conditions for $-r$ to be an eigenvalue of the line multigraph. Finally, we present applications of line multigraphs to the spectral theory of hypergraphs, including bounds for the signless Laplacian spectral radius of a hypergraph and a characterization of the signless Laplacian spectrum for a specific class of hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>On generalized Tur\'{a}n problems for expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $F$, the $r$-expansion $F^r$ of $F$ is the $r$-uniform hypergraph obtained from $F$ by inserting $r-2$ new distinct vertices in each edge of $F$. Given $r$-uniform hypergraphs $\cH$ and $\cF$, the generalized Tur\'{a}n number, denoted by $\ex_r(n,\cH,\cF)$, is the maximum number of copies of $\cH$ in an $n$-vertex $r$-uniform hypergraph that does not contain $\cF$ as a subhypergraph. In the case where $r=2$ (i.e., the graph case), the study of generalized Tur\'{a}n problems was initiated by Alon and Shikhelman [\textit{J. Combin. Theory Series B.} 121 (2016) 146--172]. Motivated by their work, we systematically study generalized Tur\'{a}n problems for expansions and obtain several general and exact results. In particular, for the non-degenerate case, we determine the exact generalized Tur\'{a}n number for expansions of complete graphs, and establish the asymptotics of the generalized Tur\'{a}n number for expansions of the vertex-disjoint union of complete graphs. For the degenerate case, we establish the asymptotics of generalized Tur\'{a}n numbers for expansions of several classes of forests, including star forests, linear forests and star-path forests.</description>

      <title>Hopf Algebras of B-Diagrams and Boson Normal Ordering: Exploring the Dual Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Hopf algebra of B-diagrams as an algebra projecting onto the Heisenberg algebra and designed to encode the combinatorics of the bosonic normal-ordering problem. In order to understand and generalize the properties of the algebra of noncommutative symmetric polynomials viewed as a Hopf subalgebra of the Hopf algebra linearly spanned by B-diagrams, we describe and study its dual Hopf algebra. This construction also allows us to establish connections with combinatorial Hopf algebras based on colored set partitions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we provide an upper bound for the number of one-element commutation classes of a permutation, that is, the number of reduced words in which no commutation can be applied. Using this upper bound, we prove a conjecture that relates the number of reduced words with the number of commutation classes of a permutation.</description>

      <title>Generalizing two families of scattered quadrinomials in $\mathbb{F}_{q^{2t}}[X]$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, several efforts have focused on identifying new families of scattered polynomials. Currently, only three families in $\mathbb{F}_{q^n}[X]$ are known to exist for infinitely many values of $n$ and $q$: (i) pseudoregulus-type monomials, (ii) Lunardon-Polverino-type binomials, and (iii) a family of quadrinomials studied in a series of papers. In this work, we provide sufficient conditions under which these quadrinomials, denoted by $\psi_{m,h,s}$, are scattered. Our results both include and generalize those obtained in previous studies. We also investigate the equivalences between the previously known families of scattered polynomials and those in this new class.</description>

      <title>Exact number of flips required to sort a burnt stack of pancakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the buffet, the waiter of a restaurant gets a large stack of pancakes from the overworked cook. As usual, one side is burnt, and as the level of batter decreases, the pancakes became smaller and smaller. Hence, the waiter ends up with a stack of one-sided burnt pancakes sorted by size, with the larger at the bottom and burnt side up. However, the waiter cannot serve them this way. He needs to turn all the burnt sides down, without changing the order. Having only a spatula, he can only perform flips to the top of the stack. How can he perform this transformation in a minimum number of flips? Having n pancakes, this problem can be modeled in the burnt pancake graph, having 2^n*n! vertices, where each possible stack of pancakes corresponds to a vertex expressed by a permutation of size n, where the pancakes are ordered by size, and the pancake numbers are multiplied by -1, if the corresponding pancake has the burnt side side up. An edge exists in this graph, if the corresponding stacks can be reached from each other by one flip. Let T(n) be the minimum number of flips to sort the stack of n pancakes (-1,...,-n). General burnt pancake sorting has been introduced by Bill Gates and Papadimitriou. The instance (-1,...,-n) has strong relevance because of its easy structure and as it has been shown to be a worst-case instance for several small n. Heydari and Sudborough gave the currently best upper bound of T(n), namely (3n+3)/2 for n = 3 mod 4, which later has been shown to be exact by a work of Cibulka. Except these two works, no progress regarding lower and upper bounds has been made until now. In our work, we present that (3n+3)/2 is also an upper bound of T(n) for n = 1 mod 4, which again matches the lower bound of Cibulka and thus is exact. The case of even n keeps an open problem, where two possible values for T(n) are possible, namely (3/2)n + 1 or (3/2)n + 2.</description>

      <title>The maximum number of triangles in graphs without the square of a path</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generalized Tur\'an number for $H$ of $G$, denoted by $\ex(n,H,G)$, is the maximum number of copies of $H$ in an $n$-vertex $G$-free graph. When $H$ is an edge, $\ex(n,H,G)$ is the classical Tur\'an number $\ex(n,G)$. Let $P_k$ be the path with $k$ vertices. The square of $P_k$, denoted by $P_k^2$, is obtained by joining the pairs of vertices with distance at most two in $P_k$.
  The Tur\'an number of $P_k^2$, $\ex(n, P_k^2)$, was determined by several researchers. When $k=3$, $P_3^2$ is the triangle and $\ex(n, P_3^2)$ is well-known from Mantel's theorem. When $k=4$, $\ex(n, P_4^2)$ was solved by Dirac in a more general context. When $k=5,6$, the problem was solved by Xiao, Katona, Xiao, and Zamora. For general $k \ge 7$, the problem was solved by Yuan in a more general context.
  Recently, Mukherjee determined the generalized Tur\'an number $\ex(n, K_3, P_5^2)$. In this paper, we determine the exact value of $\ex(n, K_3, P_6^2)$ and characterize all the extremal graphs for $n \ge 11$.</description>

      <title>Forbidding edge-critical graphs as trace in uniform hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We say a hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$ contains a graph $G$ as trace if there exists a vertex subset $S \subseteq V(\mathcal{H})$ such that $|S| = V(G)$ and $\{e \cap S \mid e \in E(\mathcal{H})\}$ contains $G$ as a subgraph.
  We use $\mathrm{ex}(n, Tr_r(G))$ to denote the maximum number of edges in an $r$-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices not containing $G$ as trace.
  The study of Tur\'an numbers for traces was initiated by Mubayi and Zhao~(2017) who studied $\mathrm{ex}(n, Tr_r(K_{s+1}))$ where $K_{s+1}$ is a clique on $s+1$ vertices and conjectured the exact value of $\mathrm{ex}(n, Tr_r(K_{s+1}))$.
  When $r \le s$, the conjecture was covered by a result of Pikhurko~(2013) who gave the exact value of Tur\'an numbers for expanded cliques.
  Then Gerbner and Picollelli~(2023) gave the exact value for book graphs~($K_{1,1,t}$, the complete tripartite graph with two parts of size one and one part of size $t \ge 2$).
  We say $G$ is edge-critical if there exists an edge $e \in E(G)$ such that $\chi(G - e) &lt; \chi(G)$ where $\chi(G)$ is the chromatic number of $G$.
  The definition of edge-critical was given by Simonovits~(1974), who proved that for an edge-critical graph $G$ with $\chi(G) = s+1 \ge 3$, the Tur\'an graph $T(n,s)$ is the unique extremal graph for $ex(n,G)$ as $n$ is sufficiently large.
  In this paper, we further generalize the results of Gerbner and Picollelli~(2023) to edge-critical graphs.
  More precisely, we prove that for an edge-critical graph $G$ with $\chi(G) = s+1$, when $s \ge r \ge 3$ and $n$ is sufficiently large, the $r$-uniform Tur\'an graph $T_r(n,s)$ is the unique extremal hypergraph.</description>

      <title>Proof of a Conjecture on Young Tableaux with Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Banderier, Marchal and Wallner considered Young tableaux with walls, which are similar to standard Young tableaux, except that local decreases are allowed at some walls. In this work, we prove a conjecture of Fuchs and Yu concerning the enumeration of two classes of three-row Young tableaux with walls. Combining with the work by Chang, Fuchs, Liu, Wallner and Yu leads to the verification of a conjecture on tree-child networks proposed by Pons and Batle. This conjecture was regarded as a specific and challenging problem in the Phylogenetics community until it was finally resolved by the present work.</description>

      <title>Token positional games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical Maker-Breaker positional game is played on a board which is a hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$, with two players, Maker and Breaker, alternately claiming vertices of $\mathcal{H}$ until all the vertices are claimed. When the game ends, Maker wins if she has claimed all the vertices of some edge of $\mathcal{H}$; otherwise, Breaker wins. Playing this game in real life can be done by placing tokens on the vertices of the board. In this paper, we study the unfortunate case in which one or both players do not have enough tokens to cover all the vertices and, as such, will have to move their tokens around at some point instead of placing new ones. There may be a bias, in that Maker and Breaker do not necessarily have the same amount of tokens. The present paper initiates the study of this generalization of positional games, called token positional games. A particularly interesting case is when Maker has a winning strategy in the classical game: what is the lowest number of tokens with which she still wins against Breaker's unlimited stock? We notably show that, for $k$-uniform hypergraphs on an arbitrarily large number $n$ of vertices, this number equals $k$ if $k \in\{2,3\}$ but can vary from $k$ to $\Omega(n)$ if $k \geq 4$. From an algorithmic point of view, PSPACE-hardness in general is inherited from classical positional games, but we get a polynomial-time algorithm to solve the case where Breaker only has one token. We also establish EXPTIME-completeness for a "token sliding" variation of the game.</description>

      <title>Optimal factor matchings for point processes on non-amenable unimodular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a unit-intensity point process $\Pi$ on the vertex set $V$ of a transitive non-amenable unimodular graph. We study invariant matchings between $\Pi$ and $V$ having small typical matching distances. When $\Pi$ is either a Poisson process or i.i.d. perturbations of the vertex set, we determine the optimal matching distance and show that it can be attained by a factor matching scheme (that is, a deterministic and equivariant function of $\Pi$).</description>

      <title>Quantum Latin squares of order $6m$ with all possible cardinalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quantum Latin square of order $n$ (denoted as QLS$(n)$) is an $n\times n$ array whose entries are unit column vectors from the $n$-dimensional Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_n$, such that each row and column forms an orthonormal basis. Two unit vectors $|u\rangle, |v\rangle\in \mathcal{H}_n$ are regarded as identical if there exists a real number $\theta$ such that $|u\rangle=e^{i\theta}|v\rangle$; otherwise, they are considered distinct. The cardinality $c$ of a QLS$(n)$ is the number of distinct vectors in the array. In this note,we use sub-QLS$(6)$ to prove that for any integer $m\geq 2$ and any $c\in [6m,36m^2]\setminus \{6m+1\}$, there is a QLS$(6m)$ with cardinality $c$.</description>

      <title>Computational Complexity of Swish</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Swish is a card game in which players are given cards having symbols (hoops and balls), and find a valid superposition of cards, called a "swish." Dailly, Lafourcade, and Marcadet (FUN 2024) studied a generalized version of Swish and showed that the problem is solvable in polynomial time with one symbol per card, while it is NP-complete with three or more symbols per card. In this paper, we resolve the previously open case of two symbols per card, which corresponds to the original game. We show that Swish is NP-complete for this case. Specifically, we prove the NP-hardness when the allowed transformations of cards are restricted to a single (horizontal or vertical) flip or 180-degree rotation, and extend the results to the original setting allowing all three transformations. In contrast, when neither transformation is allowed, we present a polynomial-time algorithm. Combining known and our results, we establish a complete characterization of the computational complexity of Swish with respect to both the number of symbols per card and the allowed transformations.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Rate Bounds and Constructions for the Inclusive Variant of Disjunct Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disjunct matrices, also known as cover-free families and superimposed codes, are combinatorial arrays widely used in group testing. Among their variants, those that satisfy an additional combinatorial property called inclusiveness form a special class suitable for computationally efficient and highly error-tolerant group testing under the general inhibitor complex model, a broad framework that subsumes practical settings such as DNA screening. Despite this relevance, the asymptotic behavior of the inclusive variant of disjunct matrices has remained largely unexplored. In particular, it was not previously known whether this variant can achieve an asymptotically positive rate, a requirement for scalable group testing designs. In this work, we establish the first nontrivial asymptotic lower bound on the maximum achievable rate of the inclusive variant, which matches the strongest known upper bound up to a logarithmic factor. Our proof is based on the probabilistic method and yields a simple and efficient randomized construction. Furthermore, we derandomize this construction to obtain a deterministic polynomial-time construction. These results clarify the asymptotic potential of robust and scalable group testing under the general inhibitor complex model.</description>

      <title>$q$-deformation of the Marchenko-Pastur law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a $q$-deformed random unitary ensemble associated with the little-$q$ Laguerre weight, which provides a discrete analogue of the classical Laguerre unitary ensemble. In the double scaling regime $q=e^{-\lambda/N}$, where $N$ is the system size and $\lambda \ge 0$, we derive the limiting spectral distribution as $N\to \infty$, which yields a $q$-deformation of the Marchenko-Pastur law. The limiting density undergoes a phase transition at an explicitly determined critical value $\lambda_c$: for $\lambda&lt;\lambda_c$, the support consists of a single band region, whereas for $\lambda&gt;\lambda_c$ an additional saturated region emerges adjacent to the band region. Our derivation of the limiting distribution is based on three complementary approaches: the method of moments, the analysis of a constrained equilibrium problem, and the asymptotic zero distribution of orthogonal polynomials. As a consequence, we establish the convergence of the empirical measure as well as a large deviation principle. In addition, we derive closed-form expressions for the spectral moments using the combinatorial structure of orthogonal polynomials, and obtain large-$N$ expansions for these moments.</description>

      <title>On $L^2$ estimates for quadratic images of product Frostman measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $f\in\mathbb R[x,y,z]$ be a fixed non-degenerate quadratic polynomial. Given an $\alpha$-Frostman probability measure $\mu$ supported on $[0,1]$ with $\alpha\in(0,1)$, consider the pushforward measure $\nu=f_{\#}(\mu\times\mu\times\mu)$ on $\mathbb R$. We prove the following $L^2$ energy estimate: for a fixed nonnegative Schwartz function $\varphi$ with $\int\varphi=1$ and $\varphi_\delta(t)=\delta^{-1}\varphi(t/\delta)$, there exist $\epsilon&gt;0$ and $\delta_{0}&gt;0$ (depending only on $\alpha$ and the coefficients of $f$) such that \[ \int_{\mathbb R}(\varphi_\delta*\nu(t))^{2}\,dt \ \lesssim\ \delta^{\alpha+\epsilon-1} \qquad \text{for all } \delta\in(0,\delta_{0}]. \] The proof expands the $L^2$ energy into a weighted six-fold coincidence integral and reduces the main contribution to a planar incidence problem after a controlled change of variables. The key new input is an incidence estimate for point sets that arise as bi-Lipschitz images of a Cartesian product $M\times M$ of a $\delta$-separated and non-concentrated set $M$, yielding a power saving beyond what is available from separation and non-concentration alone. We also give examples showing that bounded support and Frostman-type hypotheses are necessary for such $L^{2}$ control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When can one change the diagonal of a matrix without changing its spectrum? We completely answer this question over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero or larger than the size of the matrix: An $n \times n$ matrix $A$ admits a nonzero diagonal matrix $D$ such that $A$ and $A+D$ have the same spectrum if and only if, for some size $k$, the $k \times k$ principal minors of $A$ are not all equal. This relates to the classical additive inverse eigenvalue problem in numerical analysis and has implications for existence and rigidity results in the theory of Floquet isospectrality of discrete periodic operators in solid state physics. The proof employs new techniques involving Hilbert schemes of points and the infinitesimal structure of the Hilbert--Chow morphism.</description>

      <title>Quantative universality for cokernels of matrices with symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove universality for cokernels of random integral matrices with symmetries via an approach different from the classical surjection moment method introduced by Wood (arXiv:1402.5149). In the symmetric case, we reprove Hodges' universality theorem (arXiv:2311.07078), i.e. the version incorporating the canonical pairing from Wood's setting, and in the alternating case we reprove the local universality theorem of Nguyen-Wood (arXiv:2210.08526). A key advantage of our method is that it is quantitative: we obtain explicit error bounds, which are exponentially small in most regimes, thereby addressing Wood's question on effective convergence rates. Our argument is inspired by Maples' exposure-process and coupling viewpoint (arXiv:1301.1239) and uses a generalized form of Fourier-analytic estimates in the exponentially sharp style of Ferber-Jain-Sah-Sawhney (arXiv:2106.04049).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09973v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is a treatise on finite point configurations spanning a fixed volume to be found in a single color-class of an arbitrary finite (measurable) coloring of the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$, or in a single large measurable subset $A\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$. More specifically, we study vertex-sets of simplices, rectangular boxes, and parallelotopes, attempting to make progress on several open problems posed in the 1970s and the 1980s. As one of the highlights, we give a negative answer to a question of Erd\H{o}s and Graham, by coloring the Euclidean plane $\mathbb{R}^2$ in $25$ colors without creating monochromatic rectangles of unit area. More generally, we construct a finite coloring of the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$ such that no color-class contains the $2^m$ vertices of any (possibly rotated) $m$-dimensional rectangular box of volume $1$. A positive result is still possible if rectangular boxes of merely sufficiently large volumes are sought in a single color-class of a finite measurable coloring of $\mathbb{R}^n$, and we establish it under an additional assumption $n\geq m+1$. Also, motivated by a question of Graham on reasonable bounds in his result on monochromatic axes-aligned right-angled $m$-dimensional simplices, we establish its measurable coloring and density variants with polylogarithmic bounds, again in dimensions $n\geq m+1$. Next, we generalize a result of Erd\H{o}s and Mauldin, by constructing an infinite measure set $A\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$ such that every $n$-parallelotope with vertices in $A$ has volume strictly smaller than $1$. Finally, some results complementing the literature on isometric embeddings of hypercube graphs and on the hyperbolic analogue of the Hadwiger-Nelson problem also follow as byproducts of our approaches.</description>

Abstract: Barber and Erde asked the following question: if $B$ generates $\mathbb Z^d$ as an additive group, then must the extremal sets for the vertex/edge-isoperimetric inequality on the Cayley graph $\operatorname{Cay}(\mathbb Z^d,B)$ form a nested family? We answer this question negatively for both the vertex- and edge-isoperimetric inequalities, specifically in the case of $d=1$. The key is to show that the structure of the cylinder $\mathbb Z\times(\mathbb Z/k\mathbb Z)$ can be mimicked in certain Cayley graphs on $\mathbb Z$, leading to a phase transition. We do, however, show that Barber--Erde's question for Cayley graphs on $\mathbb Z$ has a positive answer if one is allowed to ignore finitely many sets.</description>

      <title>Towards a classification of $1$-homogeneous distance-regular graphs with positive intersection number $a_1$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01134v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a graph with diameter at least two. Then $\Gamma$ is said to be $1$-homogeneous (in the sense of Nomura) whenever for every pair of adjacent vertices $x$ and $y$ in $\Gamma$, the distance partition of the vertex set of $\Gamma$ with respect to both $x$ and $y$ is equitable, and the parameters corresponding to equitable partitions are independent of the choice of $x$ and $y$. Assume that $\Gamma$ is $1$-homogeneous distance-regular with intersection number $a_1&gt;0$ and diameter $D\geqslant 5$. Define $b=b_1/(\theta_1+1)$, where $b_1$ is the intersection number and $\theta_1$ is the second largest eigenvalue of $\Gamma$. We show that if intersection number $c_2$ is at least $2$, then $b\geqslant 1$ and one of the following (i)--(vi) holds: (i) $\Gamma$ is a regular near $2D$-gon, (ii) $\Gamma$ is a Johnson graph $J(2D,D)$, (iii) $\Gamma$ is a halved $\ell$-cube with $\ell \in \{2D,2D+1\}$, (iv) $\Gamma$ is a folded Johnson graph $\bar{J}(4D,2D)$, (v) $\Gamma$ is a folded halved $4D$-cube, (vi) the valency of $\Gamma$ is bounded by a function of $b$. Using this result, we characterize $1$-homogeneous graphs with classical parameters and $a_1&gt;0$, as well as tight distance-regular graphs.</description>

Abstract: A graph matroid family $\mathcal{M}$ is a family of matroids $\mathcal{M}(G)$ defined on the edge set of each finite graph $G$ in a compatible and isomorphism-invariant way. We say that $\mathcal{M}$ has the Whitney property if there is a constant $c$ such that every $c$-connected graph $G$ is uniquely determined by $\mathcal{M}(G)$. Similarly, $\mathcal{M}$ has the Lov\'asz-Yemini property if there is a constant $c$ such that for every $c$-connected graph $G$, $\mathcal{M}(G)$ has maximal rank among graphs on the same number of vertices.
  We show that if $\mathcal{M}$ is unbounded (that is, there is no absolute constant bounding the rank of $\mathcal{M}(G)$ for every $G$), then $\mathcal{M}$ has the Whitney property if and only if it has the Lov\'asz-Yemini property. We also give a complete characterization of these properties in the bounded case. As an application, we show that if some graph matroid families have the Whitney property, then so does their union. Finally, we show that every $1$-extendable graph matroid family has the Lov\'asz-Yemini (and thus the Whitney) property. These results unify and extend a number of earlier results about graph reconstruction from an underlying matroid.</description>

      <title>The Polymatroid Representation of a Greedoid, and Associated Galois Connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15363v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A greedoid is a generalization of a matroid allowing for more flexible analyses and modeling of combinatorial optimization problems. However, these structures decimate many matroid properties contributing to their pervasive nature. A polymatroid greedoid [KL85a] presents an interesting middle ground, so we further develop this class. First we prove every local poset greedoid for which the greedy algorithm correctly solves linear optimizations over its basic words must have a polymatroid representation. For this, we use relationships between the lattices of greedoid flats and closed sets of a polymatroid to generalize concepts in [KL85a]. Then, we show our generalization induces a Galois injection between the greedoid flats and closed sets of a representation. Finally, we apply this duality to identify a subclass of polymatroid greedoids with a maximum representation, giving a partial answer to an open problem of [KL85a]. As technical tools for our analyses, we introduce optimism and the Forking Lemma for interval greedoids. Both are pervasive in our work, and are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Generalized degree polynomials of trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The generalized degree polynomial $\mathbf{G}_T(x,y,z)$ of a tree $T$ is an invariant introduced by Crew that enumerates subsets of vertices by size and number of internal and boundary edges. Aliste-Prieto et al. proved that $\mathbf{G}_T$ is determined linearly by the chromatic symmetric function $\mathbf{X}_T$, introduced by Stanley. We present several classes of information about $T$ that can be recovered from $\mathbf{G}_T$ and hence also from $\mathbf{X}_T$. Examples of such information include the double-degree sequence of $T$, which enumerates edges of $T$ by the pair of degrees of their endpoints, and the leaf adjacency sequence of $T$, which enumerates vertices of $T$ by degree and number of adjacent leaves. We also discuss a further generalization of $\mathbf{G}_T$ that enumerates tuples of vertex sets and show that this is also determined by $\mathbf{X}_T$.</description>

      <title>Van Lint-MacWilliams' conjecture and maximum cliques in Cayley graphs over finite fields, II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The well-known Van Lint--MacWilliams' conjecture states that if $q$ is an odd prime power, and $A\subseteq \mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ such that $0,1 \in A$, $|A|=q$, and $a-b$ is a square for each $a,b \in A$, then $A$ must be the subfield $\mathbb{F}_q$. This conjecture was first proved by Blokhuis and is often phrased in terms of the maximum cliques in Paley graphs of square order. Previously, Asgarli and the author extended Blokhuis' theorem to a larger family of Cayley graphs. In this paper, we give a new simple proof of Blokhuis' theorem and its extensions. More generally, we show that if $S \subseteq \mathbb{F}_{q^2}^*$ has small multiplicative doubling, and $A\subseteq \mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ with $0,1 \in A$, $|A|=q$, such that $A-A \subseteq S \cup \{0\}$, then $A=\mathbb{F}_q$. This new result refines and extends several previous works; moreover, our new approach avoids using heavy machinery from number theory.</description>

      <title>Remarks on $d$-ary partitions and an application to elementary symmetric partitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove new formulas for $p_d(n)$, the number of $d$-ary partitions of $n$, and, also, for its polynomial part. Given a partition $\lambda=(\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_{\ell})$, its associated $j$-th symmetric elementary partition, $pre_{j}(\lambda)$, is the partition whose parts are $\{\lambda_{i_1}\cdots\lambda_{i_j}\;:\;1\leq i_1 &lt; \cdots &lt; i_j\leq \ell\}$. We prove that if $\lambda$ and $\mu$ are two $d$-ary partitions of length $\ell$ such that $pre_j(\lambda)=pre_j(\mu)$ and $\lambda_{i_1}\cdots \lambda_{i_j} = \mu_{i_1}\cdots \mu_{i_j}$, for all $1\leq i_1 &lt; \cdots &lt; i_j\leq \ell$, then $\lambda=\mu$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19362v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an explicit algorithm to construct aperiodic tile sets based on Sturmian words of quadratic slopes. The method works for any quadratic irrational slope, and we can produce infinitely many aperiodic tile sets whose underlying scaling constant is a unit of any real quadratic field. There are two key ingredients in our construction. The first one is ``Sturmian lattices''; an interesting grid structure generated by Sturmian words that emerged in an aperiodic monotile called Smith Turtle. We shall give a classification of Sturmian lattices. The second is the bounded displacement equivalence of Delone sets, which plays a central role in this construction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1978, Anderson and White asked whether there is a decomposition of $K_{12}$ into two graphs, one planar and one toroidal. Using theoretical arguments and a computer search of all maximal planar graphs of order 12, we show that no such decomposition exists. We further show that if $G$ is planar of order 12 and $H\subseteq\overline{G}$ is toroidal, then $H$ has at least two fewer edges than $\overline{G}$. A computer search found all 123 unique pairs $\left(G,H\right)$ that make this an equality.</description>

      <title>Maximum Spread of Vertex Degrees in a Simple Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the following problem: let $n&gt;k$ be natural numbers, and let $G$ be a graph on $n$ vertices (undirected, without loops or multiple edges). Denote by $h_k(G)$ the number of unordered pairs of vertices in the graph $G$ whose degrees differ by less than $k$. We aim to determine the smallest possible value $f(n,k)$ of the quantity $h_k(G)$. Interest in this question is motivated by the fact that the bipartite analogue of the problem enabled S. Cichomski and F. Petrov to prove the Burdzy -- Pitman conjecture on the spread of independent coherent random variables.
  The problem has been solved under a number of restrictions on $n$ and $k$. A conjecture about the answer in the general case is also presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A well-known consequence of Schur's theorem is that for $r\in \mathbb{N}$, if $n$ is sufficiently large, then any $r$-colouring of $[n]$ results in monochromatic $a,b,c\in [n]$ such that $ab=c$. In this paper we are interested in the threshold at which the binomial random set $[n]_p$ almost surely inherits this Ramsey-type property. In particular for $r=2$ colours, we show that this threshold lies between $n^{-1/9-o(1)}$ and $n^{-1/11}$. Whilst analogous questions for solutions to (sets of) linear equations are now well understood, our work suggests that both the behaviour of the thresholds and the proof methods needed to determine them differ substantially in the non-linear setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use sign-reversing involutions to solve two computational problems that arise naturally in the geometry of moduli spaces of curves. In particular, we give an explicit combinatorial formula for arbitrary $\psi$ class intersection products on the genus zero multicolored spaces $\overline{M}_{0,[r_1,\ldots,r_m]}$ using a novel sign reversing involution on decorated diagrams. As an application, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for when these intersection products are nonzero in terms of matchings on graphs.
  We also calculate the analog of the tropical Euler characteristic for the graphical moduli spaces $\overline{M}_{0,\Gamma}$ for graphs with two dominant vertices $P, Q$, by constructing two new sign-reversing involutions to simplify the sum. We show that (up to sign) it is the number of acyclic orientations of $\Gamma \smallsetminus \{P, Q\}$.</description>

Abstract: The game of cops and robber has been studied for many years. Denoting $\mathsf{Forb}(4K_1)$ to be the family of all graphs that contain no induced subgraph isomorphic to $4K_1$ (e.g., with independence number less than $4$), we prove that for any $G\in\mathsf{Forb}(4K_1)$, we have $c(G)\leq 2$, where $c(\cdot)$ is the cop number. This improves a lower bound of a question proposed by Char et al. in a recent paper (arxiv, 2025), that any counterexample of a conjecture raised by Turcotte (2022) when $p=4$ must have at least 14 vertices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a set function $\nu$ satisfies the gross substitutes property if and only if its homogeneous generating polynomial $Z_{q,\nu}$ is a Lorentzian polynomial for all positive $q \le 1$, answering a question of Eur-Huh. We achieve this by giving a rank 1 upper bound for the distance matrix of an ultrametric tree, refining a classical result of Graham-Pollak. This characterization enables us to resolve two open problems that strengthen Mason's log-concavity conjectures for the number of independent sets of a matroid: one posed by Giansiracusa-Rinc\'on-Schleis-Ulirsch for valuated matroids, and two posed by Dowling in 1980 and Zhao in 1985 for ordinary matroids.</description>

      <title>On complexity of substructure connectivity and restricted connectivity of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.05917v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The connectivity of a graph is an important parameter to evaluate its reliability. $k$-restricted connectivity (resp. $R^h$-restricted connectivity) of a graph $G$ is the minimum cardinality of a set $S$ of vertices in $G$, if exists, whose deletion disconnects $G$ and leaves each component of $G-S$ with more than $k$ vertices (resp. $\delta(G-S)\geq h$). In contrast, structure (substructure) connectivity of $G$ is defined as the minimum number of vertex-disjoint subgraphs whose deletion disconnects $G$. As generalizations of the concept of connectivity, structure (substructure) connectivity, restricted connectivity and $R^h$-restricted connectivity have been extensively studied from the combinatorial point of view. Very little is known about the computational complexity of these variants, except for the recently established NP-completeness of $k$-restricted edge-connectivity. In this paper, we prove that the problems of determining structure, substructure, restricted, and $R^h$-restricted connectivity are all NP-complete.</description>

Moreover, we deliver a combinatorial non-freeness criterion for essential hyperplane arrangements in $\mathbb{C}^{4}$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the existence of quantum fractional revival in unitary Cayley graphs over finite commutative rings with identity. We characterize all finite local rings that permit quantum fractional revival in their unitary Cayley graphs. Additionally, we present results for the case of finite commutative rings, as they can be expressed as products of finite local rings.</description>
