      <title>Zero-Dimensional Cardiovascular Modeling: A Personalized Approach to Non-Invasive Measurement and Sensitivity Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-dimensional cardiovascular models provide a computationally efficient framework for studying global hemodynamic behavior, yet the influence of model complexity on parameter sensitivity remains insufficiently understood. This work investigates two lumped-parameter cardiovascular models, a simplified single-ventricle configuration and a detailed four-chamber representation, to examine how physiological parameter sensitivities vary with model structure. Time-varying elastance functions are used to represent cardiac dynamics, and global sensitivity analysis is performed using Sobol and Morris methods to quantify the impact of key physiological parameters, including venous return, myocardial contractility, total peripheral resistance, and arterial compliance. The results demonstrate that sensitivity rankings differ substantially between the two models, highlighting the role of model granularity and parameter interactions in shaping cardiovascular responses. These findings support sensitivity-driven model reduction and provide a foundation for scalable, non-invasive cardiovascular simulation frameworks.</description>

      <title>Cuffless, calibration-free hemodynamic monitoring with physics-informed machine learning models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wearable technologies have the potential to transform ambulatory and at-home hemodynamic monitoring by providing continuous assessments of cardiovascular health metrics and guiding clinical management. However, existing cuffless wearable devices for blood pressure (BP) monitoring often rely on methods lacking theoretical foundations, such as pulse wave analysis or pulse arrival time, making them vulnerable to physiological and experimental confounders that undermine their accuracy and clinical utility. Here, we developed a smartwatch device with real-time electrical bioimpedance (BioZ) sensing for cuffless hemodynamic monitoring. We elucidate the biophysical relationship between BioZ and BP via a multiscale analytical and computational modeling framework, and identify physiological, anatomical, and experimental parameters that influence the pulsatile BioZ signal at the wrist. A signal-tagged physics-informed neural network incorporating fluid dynamics principles enables calibration-free estimation of BP and radial and axial blood velocity. We successfully tested our approach with healthy individuals at rest and after physical activity including physical and autonomic challenges, and with patients with hypertension and cardiovascular disease in outpatient and intensive care settings. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of BioZ technology for cuffless BP and blood velocity monitoring, addressing critical limitations of existing cuffless technologies.</description>

      <title>Human-like AI-based Auto-Field-in-Field Whole-Brain Radiotherapy Treatment Planning With Conversation Large Language Model Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) is a common treatment due to its simplicity and effectiveness. While automated Field-in-Field (Auto-FiF) functions assist WBRT planning in modern treatment planning systems, it still requires manual approaches for optimal plan generation including patient-specific hyperparameters definition and plan refinement based on quality feedback. This study introduces an automated WBRT planning pipeline that integrates a deep learning (DL) Hyperparameter Prediction model for patient-specific parameter generation and a large-language model (LLM)-based conversational interface for interactive plan refinement. The Hyperparameter Prediction module was trained on 55 WBRT cases using geometric features of clinical target volume (CTV) and organs at risk (OARs) to determine optimal Auto-FiF settings in RayStation treatment planning system. Plans were generated under predicted hyperparameters. For cases in which the generated plan was suboptimal, quality feedback via voice input was captured by a Conversation module, transcribed using Whisper, and interpreted by GPT-4o to adjust planning settings. Plan quality was evaluated in 15 independent cases using clinical metrics and expert review, and model explainability was supported through analysis of feature importance. Fourteen of 15 DL-generated plans were clinically acceptable. Normalized to identical CTV D95% as the clinical plans, the DL-generated and clinical plans showed no statistically significant differences in doses to the eyes, lenses, or CTV dose metrics D1% and D99%. The DL-based planning required under 1 minute of computation and achieved total workflow execution in approximately 7 minutes with a single mouse click, compared to 15 minutes for manual planning. In cases requiring adjustment, the Conversational module successfully improved dose conformity and hotspot reduction.</description>

      <title>Let Distortion Guide Restoration (DGR): A physics-informed learning framework for Prostate Diffusion MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Distortion-Guided Restoration (DGR), a physics-informed hybrid CNN-diffusion framework for acquisition-free correction of severe susceptibility-induced distortions in prostate single-shot EPI diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). DGR is trained to invert a realistic forward distortion model using large-scale paired distorted and undistorted data synthesized from distortion-free prostate DWI and co-registered T2-weighted images from 410 multi-institutional studies, together with 11 measured B0 field maps from metal-implant cases incorporated into a forward simulator to generate low-b DWI (b = 50 s per mm squared), high-b DWI (b = 1400 s per mm squared), and ADC distortions. The network couples a CNN-based geometric correction module with conditional diffusion refinement under T2-weighted anatomical guidance. On a held-out synthetic validation set (n = 34) using ground-truth simulated distortion fields, DGR achieved higher PSNR and lower NMSE than FSL TOPUP and FUGUE. In 34 real clinical studies with severe distortion, including hip prostheses and marked rectal distension, DGR improved geometric fidelity and increased radiologist-rated image quality and diagnostic confidence. Overall, learning the inverse of a physically simulated forward process provides a practical alternative to acquisition-dependent distortion-correction pipelines for prostate DWI.</description>

      <title>Associations between iron and mean kurtosis in iron-rich grey matter nuclei in aging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04706v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Elevated kurtosis values have been observed in subcortical grey matter structures of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. Here we tested whether these elevated values are related to iron content, which generate magnetic fields that add to the diffusion encoding gradients. Multi-shell diffusion and multi-echo gradient echo acquisitions were used to derive mean kurtosis and iron measures (R2* and magnetic susceptibility), respectively, in subcortical grey matter nuclei and white matter tracts in a discovery cohort (110 older and 63 younger adults) and replication cohort (72 healthy older adults). Iron-rich grey matter regions exhibited higher mean kurtosis, R2*, and magnetic susceptibility and white matter regions had lower mean kurtosis in the older adult group. In both cohorts, mean kurtosis was significantly correlated with R2* and magnetic susceptibility in iron-rich grey matter nuclei. No association was seen between signal-to-noise ratio and mean kurtosis in any grey matter region, indicating that the increase in mean kurtosis was not due to reduced signal-to-noise. Finally, a phantom experiment found higher mean kurtosis as iron concentrations increased. Our findings indicate that kurtosis is associated with iron-sensitive metrics in iron-rich grey matter structures, suggesting that kurtosis may be sensitive to iron deposits.</description>

      <title>Dipolar order mapping based on spin-lock magnetic resonance imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02847v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: Inhomogeneous magnetization transfer (ihMT) effect reflects dipolar order with a dipolar relaxation time ($T_{1D}$), specific to motion-restricted macromolecules. We aim to quantify $T_{1D}$ using spin-lock MRI implemented with a novel rotary-echo sequence. Methods: In proposed method, we defined a relaxation rate $R_{dosl}$ that is specific to dipolar order and obtained as the difference of dual-frequency $R_{1rho}^{dual}$ relaxation and single-frequency $R_{1rho}^{single}$ relaxation. A novel rotary-echo spin-lock sequence was developed to enable dual-frequency acquisition. We derive the framework to estimate $T_{1D}$ from $R_{dosl}$ under macromolecular pool fraction (MPF) map constraints. The proposed approach was validated via Bloch-McConnell-Provotorov simulation, phantom studies, and in-vivo white matter studies on a 3T scanner. Results: Simulations demonstrated that $R_{dosl}$ exhibits an approximately linear relationship with $T_{1D}$. Phantom experiments showed robust ihMT contrast in $R_{dosl}$ and confirmed the feasibility and reliability of $T_{1D}$ quantification via $R_{dosl}$. In vivo white-matter studies further supported the clinical potential of this $T_{1D}$ mapping approach. Conclusion: We propose a novel, clinical feasible method for $T_{1D}$ quantification based on spin-lock MRI. This method requires substantially fewer contrast-prepared images compared to the conventional $T_{1D}$ quantification approach. This technique provides a promising pathway for robust MPF and $T_{1D}$ quantification in a single rapid scan with reduced confounds.</description>

      <title>Proton therapy range uncertainty reduction using vendor-agnostic tissue characterization on a virtual photon-counting CT head scan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we proposed virtual imaging simulators as an alternative approach to experimental validation of beam range uncertainty in complex patient geometry using a computational model of a human head and a photon-counting CT scanner. We validate the accuracy of stopping power ratio (SPR) calculations using a conventional stoichiometric calibration approach and a prototype software, TissueXplorer. A validated CT simulator (DukeSim) was used to generate photon-counting CT projections of a computational head model, which were reconstructed with an open-source toolbox (ASTRA). The dose of 2 Gy was delivered through protons in a single fraction to target two different cases of nasal and brain tumors with a single lateral beam angle. Ground truth treatment plan was made directly on the computational head model using clinical treatment planning software (RayStation). This plan was then recalculated on the corresponding CT images for which SPR values were estimated using both the conventional method and the prototype software TissueXplorer. The mean percentage difference in estimating the stopping power ratio with TissueXplorer in all head tissues inside the scanned volume was 0.28%. Stopping power ratios obtained with this method showed smaller dose distribution differences from the ground truth plan than the conventional stoichiometric calibration method on the computational head model. Virtual imaging offers an alternative approach to validation of the SPR prediction from CT imaging, as well as its effect on the dose distribution and thus downstream clinical outcomes. According to this simulation study, software solutions that utilize spectral information, such as TissueXplorer, hold promise for more accurate prediction of the stopping power ratio than the conventional stoichiometric approach.</description>

      <title>Measuring the time-scale-dependent information flow between maternal and fetal heartbeats during the third trimester</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22270v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prenatal maternal stress alters maternal-fetal heart rate coupling, as demonstrated by the Fetal Stress Index derived from bivariate phase-rectified signal averaging. Here, we extend this framework using information-theoretical measures to elucidate underlying mechanisms. In 120 third-trimester pregnancies (58 stressed, 62 control), we computed transfer entropy (TE), entropy rate (ER), and sample entropy (SE) under multiple conditioning paradigms, employing mixed linear models for repeated measures. We identify dual coupling mechanisms at the short-term (0.5 - 2.5 s), but not long-term (2.5 - 5 s) time scales: (1) stress-invariant state-dependent synchronization, with maternal decelerations exerting approximately 60% coupling strength on fetal heart rate complexity - a fundamental coordination conserved across demographics; and (2) stress-sensitive temporal information transfer (TE), showing exploratory associations with maternal cortisol that require replication. A robust sex-by-stress interaction emerged in TE from mixed models, with exploratory female-specific coupling patterns absent in males. Universal acceleration predominance was observed in both maternal and fetal heart rates, stronger in fetuses and independent of sex or stress. We provide insight into the dependence of these findings on the sampling rate of the underlying data, identifying 4 Hz, commonly used for ultrasound-derived fetal heart rate recordings, as the necessary and sufficient sampling rate regime to capture the information flow. Information-theoretical analysis reveals that maternal-fetal coupling operates through complementary pathways with differential stress sensitivity, extending the Fetal Stress Index by elucidating causal foundations. Future studies should explore additional information-theoretical conditional approaches to resolve stress-specific and time-scale-specific differences in information flow.</description>
