      <title>A Review of Reinforcement Learning in Financial Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing trend of applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) in financial applications.
  This approach has shown great potential to solve decision-making tasks in finance.
  In this survey, we present a comprehensive study of the applications of RL in finance and conduct a series of meta-analyses to investigate the common themes in the literature, such as the factors that most significantly affect RL's performance compared to traditional methods.
  Moreover, we identify challenges including explainability, Markov Decision Process (MDP) modeling, and robustness that hinder the broader utilization of RL in the financial industry and discuss recent advancements in overcoming these challenges.
  Finally, we propose future research directions, such as benchmarking, contextual RL, multi-agent RL, and model-based RL to address these challenges and to further enhance the implementation of RL in finance.</description>

      <title>Death, Taxes, and Inequality. Can a Minimal Model Explain Real Economic Inequality?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Income inequality and redistribution policies are modeled with a minimal, endogenous model of a simple foraging economy. Significant income inequalities emerge from the model for populations of equally capable individuals presented with equal opportunities. Stochastic income distributions from the model are compared to empirical data from actual economies. The impacts of redistribution policies on total wealth, income distributions, and inequality are shown to be similar for the empirical data and the model. These comparisons enable detailed determinations of population welfare beyond what is possible with total wealth and inequality metrics. I</description>
