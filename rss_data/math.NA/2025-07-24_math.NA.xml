      <title>A parameterized block-splitting preconditioner for indefinite least squares problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a stationary iteration based upon a block splitting for a class of indefinite least squares problem. Convergence of the proposed method is investigated and optimal value of the involving parameter is used. The induced preconditioner is applied to accelerate the convergence of the GMRES method for solving the problem. We also analysed the eigenpair distribution of the preconditioned matrix. Some numerical are presented to show the effectiveness of the preconditioner. Numerical comparison with other well-known methods are also presented.</description>

      <title>DDFEM: A Python Package for Diffuse Domain Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) on complex domains can present significant computational challenges. The Diffuse Domain Method (DDM) is an alternative that reformulates the partial differential equations on a larger, simpler domain. The original geometry is embedded into the problem by representing it with a phase-field function. This paper introduces ddfem, an extensible Python package to provide a framework for transforming PDEs into a Diffuse Domain formulation. We aim to make the application of a variety of different Diffuse Domain approaches more accessible and straightforward to use. The ddfem package includes features to intuitively define complex domains by combining signed distance functions and provides a number of DDM transformers for general second evolution equations. In addition, we present a new approach for combining multiple boundary conditions of different types on distinct boundary segments. This is achieved by applying a normalised weighting, derived from multiple phase fields, to combine the additional boundary terms in the Diffuse Domain formulations. The domain definition and Diffuse Domain transformation provided by our package are designed to be compatible with a wide range of existing finite element solvers without requiring code alterations. Both the original (non-linear) PDEs provided by the user and the resulting transformed PDEs on the extended domain are defined using the Unified Form Language UFL which is a domain specific language used by a number of software packages. Our experiments were carried out using the Dune-Fem framework.</description>

      <title>Exact closure for discrete large-eddy simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we propose new discretization-consistent expressions for the sub-filter stress (SFS) tensor in discrete LES, where the filter is induced by the discretization. We introduce a new two-grid filter that allows us to exactly compute the SFS tensor when DNS data is available. This new filter satisfies a "filter-swap" property, such that filtering and finite differencing can be interchanged and the resulting commutator expressions are of structural form (they can be written as the discrete divergence of an SFS tensor). For 1D conservation laws such as Burgers' equation, the resulting discretization-consistent SFS expression is markedly different from the commonly used (discretization-inconsistent) expression $\overline{u u} - \bar{u} \bar{u}$. For the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, we propose three new two-grid filters, based on either volume- or surface-averaging, each inducing new discretization-consistent commutator expressions. We show that volume-averaging is required to obtain a commutator expression of structural form. However, the resulting SFS tensor is shown to be non-symmetric. Based on DNS results, we show that the non-symmetric part of the SFS tensor plays an important role in the discrete LES equation. When the non-symmetric part is included, our SFS expressions give zero a-posteriori error in LES, while existing SFS expressions give errors that increase over time. We propose to use a class of non-symmetric tensor-basis closure models to approximate the new exact SFS expressions.</description>

      <title>Matrix-Free Evaluation of High-Order Shifted Boundary Finite Element Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a matrix-free approach for implementing the shifted boundary method (SBM) in finite element analysis. The SBM is a versatile technique for solving partial differential equations on complex geometries by shifting boundary conditions to nearby surrogate boundaries. We focus on the efficient evaluation of shifted boundary operators using precomputed data and tensor-product structures. The proposed method avoids the explicit assembly of global matrices, achieving a computational complexity of $O(p^{2d-1})$ per face for the evaluation of shifted boundary contributions on elements of polynomial degree $p$ in $d$ dimensions. Numerical experiments validate the accuracy and efficiency of the approach, demonstrating its scalability and applicability to high-order finite element methods for both continuous and discontinuous Galerkin formulations. We compare the performance of the proposed method with a matrix-free CutFEM implementation.</description>

      <title>Explicit Monotone Stable Super-Time-Stepping Methods for Finite Time Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a novel way to numerically resolve the scaling behavior of finite-time singularities in solutions of nonlinear parabolic PDEs. The Runge--Kutta--Legendre (RKL) and Runge--Kutta--Gegenbauer (RKG) super-time-stepping methods were originally developed for nonlinear complex physics problems with diffusion. These are multi-stage single step second-order, forward-in-time methods with no implicit solves. The advantage is that the timestep size for stability scales with stage number $s$ as $\mathcal{O}(s^2)$. Many interesting nonlinear PDEs have finite-time singularities, and the presence of diffusion often limits one to using implicit or semi-implicit timestep methods for stability constraints. Finite-time singularities are particularly challenging due to the large range of scales that one desires to resolve, often with adaptive spatial grids and adaptive timesteps. Here we show two examples of nonlinear PDEs for which the self-similar singularity structure has time and space scales that are resolvable using the RKL and RKG methods, without forcing even smaller timesteps. Compared to commonly-used implicit numerical methods, we achieve significantly smaller run time while maintaining comparable accuracy. We also prove numerical monotonicity for both the RKL and RKG methods under their linear stability conditions for the constant coefficient heat equation, in the case of infinite domain and periodic boundary condition, leading to a theoretical guarantee of the superiority of the RKL and RKG methods over traditional super-time-stepping methods, such as the Runge-Kutta-Chebyshev (RKC) and the orthogonal Runge-Kutta-Chebyshev (ROCK) methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We design a discrete Bernstein--Gelfand--Gelfand (BGG) diagram on polygonal meshes based on the DDR framework; the diagram is made of a discrete Stokes polygonal complex and a tensorised Discrete De Rham complex, and the BGG construction leads to a novel elasticity complex applicable on generic polygonal meshes. Complete homological and analytical properties of the discrete Stokes complex are established, including primal and adjoint consistency estimates as well as Poincar\'e inequalities. Homological properties of the complexes built from the BGG diagram are also established.</description>

      <title>An FDM-sFEM scheme on time-space manifolds and its superconvergence analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study superconvergent discretization of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on time-space product manifolds with Neumann temporal boundary values, which arise in the context of dynamic optimal transport on general surfaces. We propose a coupled scheme that combines finite difference methods in time with surface finite element methods in space. By establishing a new summation by parts formula and proving the supercloseness of the semi-discrete solution, we derive superconvergence results for the recovered gradient via post-processing techniques. In addition, our geometric error analysis is implemented within a novel framework based on the approximation of the Riemannian metric. Several numerical examples are provided to validate and illustrate the theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concepts of amenable and compatible functions have been introduced in a recent work, in order to state precise mathematical theorems that guarantee that a backward stable algorithm is also forward stable, and that the composition of two stable algorithms results in an stable algorithm. In this work, we elaborate in this theory for univariate real analytic functions, providing simple tests for both concepts and producing tables for a number of elementary functions which are or fail to be amenable.</description>

      <title>A new data-driven energy-stable Evolve-Filter-Relax model for turbulent flow simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to define the filter and relax steps in the evolve-filter-relax (EFR) framework for simulating turbulent flows. The EFR main advantages are its ease of implementation and computational efficiency. However, as it only contains two parameters (one for the filter step and one for the relax step) its flexibility is rather limited. In this work, we propose a data-driven approach in which the optimal filter is found based on DNS data in the frequency domain. The optimization step is computationally efficient and only involves one-dimensional least-squares problems for each wavenumber. Across both decaying turbulence and Kolmogorov flow, our learned filter decisively outperforms the standard differential filter and the Smagorinsky model, yielding significantly improved accuracy in energy spectra and in the temporal evolution of both energy and enstrophy. In addition, the relax parameter is determined by requiring energy and/or enstrophy conservation, which enforces stability of the method and reduces the appearance of numerical wiggles, especially when the filter is built in scarce data regimes. Applying the learned filter is also more computationally efficient compared to traditional differential filters, as it circumvents solving a linear system.</description>

      <title>Error estimates and adaptivity for a least-squares method applied to the Monge-Amp\`ere equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce novel a posteriori error indicators for a nonlinear least-squares solver for smooth solutions of the Monge--Amp\`ere equation on convex polygonal domains in $\mathbb{R}^2$. At each iteration, our iterative scheme decouples the problem into (i) a pointwise nonlinear minimization problem and (ii) a linear biharmonic variational problem. For the latter, we derive an equivalence to a biharmonic problem with Navier boundary conditions and solve it via mixed piecewise-linear finite elements. Reformulating this as a coupled second-order system, we derive a priori and a posteriori $\mathbb{P}^1$ finite element error estimators and we design a robust adaptive mesh refinement strategy. Numerical tests confirm that errors in different norms scale appropriately. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our a posteriori indicators in guiding mesh refinement.</description>

      <title>Stable Iterative Solvers for Ill-conditioned Linear Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Iterative solvers for large-scale linear systems such as Krylov subspace methods can diverge when the linear system is ill-conditioned, thus significantly reducing the applicability of these iterative methods in practice for high-performance computing solutions of such large-scale linear systems. To address this fundamental problem, we propose general algorithmic frameworks to modify Krylov subspace iterative solution methods which ensure that the algorithms are stable and do not diverge. We then apply our general frameworks to current implementations of the corresponding iterative methods in SciPy and demonstrate the efficacy of our stable iterative approach with respect to numerical experiments across a wide range of synthetic and real-world ill-conditioned linear systems.</description>

      <title>Data assimilation using a global Girsanov nudged particle filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a particle filtering algorithm for stochastic models on infinite dimensional state space, making use of Girsanov perturbations to nudge the ensemble of particles into regions of higher likelihood. We argue that the optimal control problem needs to couple control variables for all of the particles to maintain an ensemble with good effective sample size (ESS). We provide an optimisation formulation that separates the problem into three stages, separating the nonlinearity in the ESS term in the functional with the nonlinearity due to the forward problem, and allowing independent parallel computation for each particle when calculations are performed over control variable space. The particle filter is applied to the stochastic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and compared with the temper-jitter particle filter approach. We observe that whilst the nudging filter is over spread compared to the temper-jitter filter, it responds to extreme events in the assimilated data more quickly and robustly.</description>

      <title>Avoiding spectral pollution for transfer operators using residuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Koopman operator theory enables linear analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems by lifting their evolution to infinite-dimensional function spaces. However, finite-dimensional approximations of Koopman and transfer (Frobenius--Perron) operators are prone to spectral pollution, introducing spurious eigenvalues that can compromise spectral computations. While recent advances have yielded provably convergent methods for Koopman operators, analogous tools for general transfer operators remain limited. In this paper, we present algorithms for computing spectral properties of transfer operators without spectral pollution, including extensions to the Hardy-Hilbert space. Case studies--ranging from families of Blaschke maps with known spectrum to a molecular dynamics model of protein folding--demonstrate the accuracy and flexibility of our approach. Notably, we demonstrate that spectral features can arise even when the corresponding eigenfunctions lie outside the chosen space, highlighting the functional-analytic subtleties in defining the "true" Koopman spectrum. Our methods offer robust tools for spectral estimation across a broad range of applications.</description>

      <title>Qubit-Efficient Quantum Algorithm for Linear Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As quantum hardware rapidly advances toward the early fault-tolerant era, a key challenge is to develop quantum algorithms that are not only theoretically sound but also hardware-friendly on near-term devices. In this work, we propose a quantum algorithm for solving linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with a provable runtime guarantee. Our algorithm uses only a single ancilla qubit, and is locality preserving, i.e., when the coefficient matrix of the ODE is $k$-local, the algorithm only needs to implement the time evolution of $(k+1)$-local Hamiltonians. We also discuss the connection between our proposed algorithm and Lindbladian simulation as well as its application to the interacting Hatano-Nelson model, a widely studied non-Hermitian model with rich phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Fast One-Pass Sparse Approximation of the Top Eigenvectors of Huge Low-Rank Matrices? Yes, $MAM^*$!</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by applications such as sparse PCA, in this paper we present provably-accurate one-pass algorithms for the sparse approximation of the top eigenvectors of extremely massive matrices based on a single compact linear sketch. The resulting compressive-sensing-based approaches can approximate the leading eigenvectors of huge approximately low-rank matrices that are too large to store in memory based on a single pass over its entries while utilizing a total memory footprint on the order of the much smaller desired sparse eigenvector approximations. Finally, the compressive sensing recovery algorithm itself (which takes the gathered compressive matrix measurements as input, and then outputs sparse approximations of its top eigenvectors) can also be formulated to run in a time which principally depends on the size of the sought sparse approximations, making its runtime sublinear in the size of the large matrix whose eigenvectors one aims to approximate. Preliminary experiments on huge matrices having $\sim 10^{16}$ entries illustrate the developed theory and demonstrate the practical potential of the proposed approach.</description>

Abstract: When given a generalized matrix separation problem, which aims to recover a low rank matrix $L_0$ and a sparse matrix $S_0$ from $M_0=L_0+HS_0$, the work \cite{CW25} proposes a novel convex optimization problem whose objective function is the sum of the $\ell_1$-norm and nuclear norm. In this paper we detail the iterative algorithms and its associated computations for solving this convex optimization problem. We present various efficient implementation strategies, with attention to practical cases where $H$ is circulant, separable, or block structured. Notably, we propose a preconditioning technique that drastically improved the performance of our algorithms in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and robustness. While this paper serves as an illustrative algorithm implementation manual, we also provide theoretical guarantee for our preconditioning strategy. Numerical results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>ZORMS-LfD: Learning from Demonstrations with Zeroth-Order Random Matrix Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Zeroth-Order Random Matrix Search for Learning from Demonstrations (ZORMS-LfD). ZORMS-LfD enables the costs, constraints, and dynamics of constrained optimal control problems, in both continuous and discrete time, to be learned from expert demonstrations without requiring smoothness of the learning-loss landscape. In contrast, existing state-of-the-art first-order methods require the existence and computation of gradients of the costs, constraints, dynamics, and learning loss with respect to states, controls and/or parameters. Most existing methods are also tailored to discrete time, with constrained problems in continuous time receiving only cursory attention. We demonstrate that ZORMS-LfD matches or surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art methods in terms of both learning loss and compute time across a variety of benchmark problems. On unconstrained continuous-time benchmark problems, ZORMS-LfD achieves similar loss performance to state-of-the-art first-order methods with an over $80$\% reduction in compute time. On constrained continuous-time benchmark problems where there is no specialized state-of-the-art method, ZORMS-LfD is shown to outperform the commonly used gradient-free Nelder-Mead optimization method.</description>

      <title>A Scientist Question: Research on the Impact of Super Structured Quadrilateral Meshes on Convergence and Accuracy of Finite Element Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the current practices of both industry and academia, the convergence and accuracy of finite element calculations are closely related to the methods and quality of mesh generation. For years, the research on high-quality mesh generation in the domestic academic field has mainly referred to the local quality of quadrilaterals and hexahedrons approximating that of squares and cubes. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a brand-new research direction and content: it is necessary to explore and study the influence of the overall global arrangement structure and pattern of super structured quadrilateral meshes on the convergence and calculation accuracy of finite element calculations. Through the research in this new field, it can help solve the non-rigorous state of serious reliance on "experience" in the mesh generation stage during simulation in the current industry and academia, and make clear judgments on which global arrangements of mesh generation can ensure the convergence of finite element calculations. In order to generate and design super-structured quadrilateral meshes with controllable overall arrangement structures, a large number of modern two-dimensional and three-dimensional geometric topology theories are required, such as moduli space, Teichm\"uller space, harmonic foliations, dynamical systems, surface mappings, meromorphic quadratic differentials, surface mappings, etc.</description>

      <title>An immersed $CR$-$P_0$ element for Stokes interface problems and the optimal convergence analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.03776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.03776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents and analyzes an immersed finite element (IFE) method for solving Stokes interface problems with a piecewise constant viscosity coefficient that has a jump across the interface. In the method, the triangulation does not need to fit the interface and the IFE spaces are constructed from the traditional $CR$-$P_0$ element with modifications near the interface according to the interface jump conditions. We prove that the IFE basis functions are unisolvent on arbitrary interface elements and the IFE spaces have the optimal approximation capabilities, although the proof is challenging due to the coupling of the velocity and the pressure. The stability and the optimal error estimates of the proposed IFE method are also derived rigorously. The constants in the error estimates are shown to be independent of the interface location relative to the triangulation. Numerical examples are provided to verify the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>A reduced-order model for segregated fluid-structure interaction solvers based on an ALE approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.13613v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents a Galerkin projection-based reduced-order modelling (ROM) approach for segregated fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems, formulated within an Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) framework at low Reynolds numbers using the Finite Volume Method (FVM). The ROM is constructed using Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and incorporates a data-driven technique that combines classical Galerkin projection with radial basis function (RBF) networks. The results demonstrate the numerical stability and accuracy of the proposed method relative to the high-fidelity model. The ROM successfully captures transient flow fields and, importantly, the forces acting on the moving structure without exhibiting unphysical growth or divergence over time. This is further supported by the bounded evolution of error metrics and physical observables, which remain consistent with the full-order simulations throughout the prediction horizon. The method's effectiveness is validated through a benchmark vortex-induced vibration (VIV) case involving a circular cylinder at Reynolds number Re=200. The hybrid ROM approach yields an accurate and efficient tool for solving FSI problems involving mesh motion.</description>

      <title>A frame approach for equations involving the fractional Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12451v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exceptionally elegant formulae exist for the fractional Laplacian operator applied to weighted classical orthogonal polynomials. We utilize these results to construct a solver, based on frame properties, for equations involving the fractional Laplacian of any power, $s \in (0,1)$, on an unbounded domain in one or two dimensions. The numerical method represents solutions in an expansion of weighted classical orthogonal polynomials as well as their unweighted counterparts with a specific extension to $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d \in \{1,2\}$. We examine the frame properties of this family of functions for the solution expansion and, under standard frame conditions, derive an a priori estimate for the stationary equation. Moreover, we prove one achieves the expected order of convergence when considering an implicit Euler discretization in time for the fractional heat equation. We apply our solver to numerous examples including the fractional heat equation (utilizing up to a $6^\text{th}$-order Runge--Kutta time discretization), a fractional heat equation with a time-dependent exponent $s(t)$, and a two-dimensional problem, observing spectral convergence in the spatial dimension for sufficiently smooth data.</description>

      <title>An explicit factorization of the Green's function for an acoustic half-space problem with impedance boundary conditions into an oscillatory exponential and a slowly varying function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, new representations of the Green's function for an acoustic d-dimensional half-space problem with impedance boundary conditions are presented. The main features of the new representation are: a) in addition to additive terms that appear also in the case of Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions, the remaining part of the Green's function is factored into an oscillatory complex exponential function (with the product of the wavenumber and the eikonal as argument) and a remaining function which is slowly varying and hence allows for efficient polynomial approximation; b) the representation is given uniformly for all parameters by a single formula which consists of the product of two analytic functions.</description>

      <title>A velocity-vorticity-pressure formulation for the steady Navier--Stokes--Brinkman--Forchheimer problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The flow of incompressible fluid in highly permeable porous media in vorticity - velocity - Bernoulli pressure form leads to a double saddle-point problem in the Navier--Stokes--Brinkman--Forchheimer equations. The paper establishes, for small sources, the existence of solutions on the continuous and discrete level of lowest-order piecewise divergence-free Crouzeix--Raviart finite elements. The vorticity employs a vector version of the pressure space with normal and tangential velocity jump penalisation terms. A simple Raviart--Thomas interpolant leads to pressure-robust a priori error estimates. An explicit residual-based a posteriori error estimate allows for efficient and reliable a posteriori error control. The efficiency for the Forchheimer nonlinearity requires a novel discrete inequality of independent interest. The implementation is based upon a light-weight forest-of-trees data structure handled by a highly parallel set of adaptive mesh refining algorithms. Numerical simulations reveal robustness of the a posteriori error estimates and improved convergence rates by adaptive mesh-refining.</description>

      <title>On the non-convexity issue in the radial Calder\'on problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A classical approach to the Calder\'on problem is to estimate the unknown conductivity by solving a nonlinear least-squares problem. It is generally believed that it leads to a nonconvex optimization problem which is riddled with bad local minimums. This has motivated the development of reconstruction methods based on convex optimization, one recent contribution being the nonlinear convex semidefinite programming approach of Harrach (2023). In this work, we investigate the computational viability of this convex approach in a simple setting where the conductivities are piecewise constant and radial. We implement this convex reconstruction method and compare it extensively to the least squares approach. Our experiments suggest that this convex programming approach only allows to accurately estimate the unknown for problems with a very small size. Moreover, surprisingly, it is consistently outperformed by Newton-type least squares solvers, which are also faster and require less measurements. We revisit the issue of nonconvexity in this piecewise constant radial setting and prove that, contrary to previous claims, there are no local minimums in the case of two scalar unknowns with no measurement noise. We also provide a partial proof of this result in the general setting which holds under a numerically verifiable assumption.</description>

      <title>Adaptive feature capture method for solving partial differential equations with near singular solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12941v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) with near singular solutions pose significant challenges for traditional numerical methods, particularly in complex geometries where mesh generation and adaptive refinement become computationally expensive. While deep-learning-based approaches, such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and the Random Feature Method (RFM), offer mesh-free alternatives, they often lack adaptive resolution in critical regions, limiting their accuracy for solutions with steep gradients or singularities. In this work, we propose the Adaptive Feature Capture Method (AFCM), a novel machine learning framework that adaptively redistributes neurons and collocation points in high-gradient regions to enhance local expressive power. Inspired by adaptive moving mesh techniques, AFCM employs the gradient norm of an approximate solution as a monitor function to guide the reinitialization of feature function parameters. This ensures that partition hyperplanes and collocation points cluster where they are most needed, achieving higher resolution without increasing computational overhead. The AFCM extends the capabilities of RFM to handle PDEs with near-singular solutions while preserving its mesh-free efficiency. Numerical experiments demonstrate the method's effectiveness in accurately resolving near-singular problems, even in complex geometries. By bridging the gap between adaptive mesh refinement and randomized neural networks, AFCM offers a robust and scalable approach for solving challenging PDEs in scientific and engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Solving nonconvex Hamilton--Jacobi--Isaacs equations with PINN-based policy iteration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a mesh-free policy iteration framework that combines classical dynamic programming with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to solve high-dimensional, nonconvex Hamilton--Jacobi--Isaacs (HJI) equations arising in stochastic differential games and robust control. The method alternates between solving linear second-order PDEs under fixed feedback policies and updating the controls via pointwise minimax optimization using automatic differentiation. Under standard Lipschitz and uniform ellipticity assumptions, we prove that the value function iterates converge locally uniformly to the unique viscosity solution of the HJI equation. The analysis establishes equi-Lipschitz regularity of the iterates, enabling provable stability and convergence without requiring convexity of the Hamiltonian. Numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy and scalability of the method. In a two-dimensional stochastic path-planning game with a moving obstacle, our method matches finite-difference benchmarks with relative $L^2$-errors below %10^{-2}%. In five- and ten-dimensional publisher-subscriber differential games with anisotropic noise, the proposed approach consistently outperforms direct PINN solvers, yielding smoother value functions and lower residuals. Our results suggest that integrating PINNs with policy iteration is a practical and theoretically grounded method for solving high-dimensional, nonconvex HJI equations, with potential applications in robotics, finance, and multi-agent reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>Polynomial time guarantees for sampling based posterior inference in high-dimensional generalised linear models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.13296v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of computing posterior functionals in general high-dimensional statistical models with possibly non-log-concave likelihood functions is considered. Based on the proof strategy of Nickl and Wang (2022), but using only local likelihood conditions and without relying on M-estimation theory, nonasymptotic statistical and computational guarantees are provided for a gradient based MCMC algorithm. Given a suitable initialiser, these guarantees scale polynomially in key algorithmic quantities. The abstract results are applied to several concrete statistical models, including density estimation, nonparametric regression with generalised linear models and a canonical statistical non-linear inverse problem from PDEs.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically optimal $t$-design curves on $S^3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A $\textit{spherical $t$-design curve}$ was defined by Ehler and Gr\"{o}chenig to be a continuous, piecewise smooth, closed curve on the sphere with finitely many self-intersections whose associated line integral applied to any polynomial of degree at most $t$ evaluates to the average of this polynomial on the sphere. These authors posed the problem of proving that there exist sequences $(\gamma_t)_{t=0}^\infty$ of $t$-design curves on $S^d$ of asymptotically optimal length $\ell(\gamma_t)\asymp t^{d-1}$ as $t\to\infty$ and solved this problem for $d=2$. This work solves the problem for $d=3$ by proving that there exists a constant $\mathscr C&gt;0$ such that for any $C\geq\mathscr C$ and $t\in\Bbb N_+$, there exists a simple $t$-design curve on $S^3$ of length $Ct^2$.</description>
