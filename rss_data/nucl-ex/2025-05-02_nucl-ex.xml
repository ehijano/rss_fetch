      <title>Hard-jet correlations in large and small systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hard-jet correlations probe parton energy loss and the microscopic structure of the quark-gluon plasma formed in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The correlation of high-$p_\mathrm{T}$ jets with other jets, hadrons, or electroweak bosons, offers differential sensitivity to medium-induced effects such as momentum broadening, color decoherence, and medium response in different types of nuclear reactions. Such correlations can also be used to study cold nuclear matter effects arising in $p$+A collisions. This proceeding summarizes recent advances achieved by studying hard-jet correlations in large and small systems discussed at Hard Probes 2024, complementing the experimental jet overview.</description>

      <title>Features of the EAR2 neutron beam following the spallation target upgrade at the n_TOF facility at CERN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The n_TOF facility at CERN has undergone a major upgrade after the installation of a new spallation target, designed to improve the features of both neutron beamlines at the experimental areas 1 and 2 (EAR1 and EAR2) and the commissioning of a new experimental area (NEAR). Due to improved coupling of the spallation target with the EAR2 beamline, the upgrade resulted in a significantly increased neutron flux and improved neutron energy resolution. This paper presents the results of the commissioning phase that followed to characterise the EAR2 neutron beamline and validate the FLUKA Monte Carlo simulations of the facility. The main features of the neutron beam, namely the neutron flux, spatial profile and energy resolution, are evaluated and compared to the previous target. The neutron flux presents a general increase of 20% below 1 eV, 40% between 1 eV and 100 keV and 50% between 100 keV and 10 MeV. The measured width of the beam profile was 3 cm (FWHM) at the reference position for neutron capture measurements. The energy resolution with the new spallation target shows a significant improvement compared to the previous one. Moreover, FLUKA Monte Carlo simulations present a good agreement with the measured neutron flux and profile within uncertainties, and a remarkable reproduction of the energy resolution.</description>

      <title>Full realization of the RIBLL2 separator at the HIRFL-CSR facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new experimental platform was constructed at the Second Radioactive Ion Beam Line in Lanzhou (RIBLL2) of HIRFL-CSR accelerator facility at Lanzhou, China. Its performance, along with several newly developed detectors, was tested in two radioactive ion beam experiments utilizing a 400 MeV/u 40Ar beam and a 350 MeV/u 78Kr beam, respectively. The first results from these two experiments demonstrate a good particle identification capability of the setup, thereby affirming the full realization of the RIBLL2 separator.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference of Core Properties of Hybrid Stars from Future High-Precision Measurements of Their Radii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future high-precision X-ray and gravitational wave observations of neutron stars (NSs) are expected to measure NS radii to better than $\sigma=0.1$ km accuracy, providing unprecedented opportunities to extract novel information about the nature and equation of state (EOS) of supradense matter in NS cores. Within a Bayesian framework using a meta-model for NS EOS encapsulating a first-order hadron-quark phase transition and satisfying all known constraints from both nuclear physics and astrophysics, we investigate how NS radius data with higher precision may better inform us about (1) the NS crust-core transition density $\rho_{cc}$, (2) the hadron-quark transition density $\rho_t$, quark matter fraction $F_{\rm{QM}}$ and its radius $R_{\rm{QM}}$, and (3) high-density NS EOS parameters. Using fiducial NS radius data with mocked precisions varying from $\sigma=1.0$ km to 0.1 km, we found (a) the most probable crust-core transition density $\rho_{cc}$ and its 68\% confidence boundaries are essentially unaffected by $\sigma$ especially for massive NSs; (b) our answers to the questions (2) and (3) listed above depend sensitively on the prior range of hadron-quark transition density $\rho_t$ assumed. Using its fiducial range of $(1.0-6.0)\rho_0$, the posterior PDF($\rho_t$) has a major peak around $(1.7-2.0)\rho_0$ that is sufficient but unnecessary in describing all existing NS radius data, and a minor peak around $(3.0-5.0)\rho_0$ consistent with the indication about $\rho_t$ of recent Beam Energy Scan Experiments at RHIC. Narrowing down the prior range of $\rho_t$ to $(3.0-6.0)\rho_0$, NS radius data with smaller $\sigma$ can constrain more stringently the posterior PDF($\rho_t$), $F_{\rm{QM}}$, $R_{\rm{QM}}$ and several high-density hadronic EOS parameters.</description>

      <title>Neutron Star Radii from Laboratory Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our present knowledge of the nuclear equation of state is briefly reviewed in this article intended for a wider readership. Particular emphasis is given to the asymmetric-matter equation of state required for modeling neutron stars, neutron-star mergers, and r-process nucleosynthesis. Recent analyses based on combining information obtained from nuclear theory, heavy-ion collisions and astrophysical observations confine the obtained radii of the canonical 1.4-solar-mass neutron star to values between 12 km and 13 km. The remaining uncertainty is primarily related to missing information in the density interval between nuclear saturation density and about twice that value which, however, is accessible with laboratory experiments.</description>

      <title>Remeasurement of the $^{239}$Pu(n,f)/$^{235}$U(n,f) Cross-Section Ratio with the NIFFTE fission Time Projection Chamber Using Vapor-deposited Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The NIFFTE fission Time Projection Chamber (fissionTPC) has been used to measure the $^{239}$Pu(n,f)/$^{235}$U(n,f) cross-section ratio for neutron-induced fission in the range of 0.1 - 100 MeV, with high precision. A white neutron source was provided by the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center, where the experiment was conducted as a remeasurement to evaluate a roughly 2% discrepancy of the previous fissionTPC results with ENDF/B-VIII.0. A detailed accounting of measurement uncertainties was performed, based on the fissionTPC's novel ability to provide three-dimensional reconstruction of fission-fragment ionization profiles. Current results obtained using a vapor-deposited, highly uniform $^{239}$Pu target, in comparison to the measurement published in 2021, where a $^{239}$Pu electroplated target was used, are presented and discussed. The remeasurement presented here is in agreement with the previous fissionTPC result within measurement uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Double $\phi$ Production in $\bar{p}p$ Reactions Near Threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16615v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ an effective Lagrangian approach to investigate double $\phi$ production in the $\bar{p}p$ reaction near the threshold and describe a notable violation of the Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka (OZI) rule in this reaction process through hadronic degrees of freedom, using the currently available theoretical and experimental information. The ground-state nucleon and its $s$-wave resonances, i.e., $N^*(1535,1650,1895)$, are taken into account in the $t$- and $u$-channel tree-level diagrams. The pentaquark-like nucleon resonance $P_s(2071,3/2^-)$ is also considered. In the $s$-channel diagrams, scalar and tensor mesons are incorporated, specifically $f_0(2020,2100,2200)$ and $f_2(1950,2010,2150)$, respectively, along with the pseudoscalar meson $\eta(2225)$. Our calculations suggest that contributions from the $N$ and $N^*$ resonances significantly enhance the cross-section near the threshold. At the same time, those from the $f_0$ and $f_2$ mesons produce distinctive peak structures around $W=2.2$ GeV, qualitatively reproducing the JETSET experimental data. The openings of the $\bar{\Lambda}\Lambda$ and $\bar{\Sigma}\Sigma$ channels lead to the cusp structures, which can explain the nontrivial structures in the cross-section at $W\approx2M_{\Lambda}$ and $2M_{\Sigma}$ observed in the data. It turns out that contributions from the $\eta$ and $P_s$ resonances are almost negligible. Additionally, polarization observables such as the spin density matrix element (SDME) provide crucial insights into the individual hadronic processes involved in this reaction.</description>
