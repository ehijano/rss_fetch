      <title>Particle Multi-Axis Transformer for Jet Tagging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jet tagging is an essential categorization problem in high energy physics. In recent times, Deep Learning has not only risen to the challenge of jet tagging but also significantly improved its performance. In this article, we propose an idea of a new architecture, Particle Multi-Axis transformer (ParMAT) which is a modified version of Particle transformer (ParT). ParMAT contains local and global spatial interactions within a single unit which improves its ability to handle various input lengths. We trained our model on JETCLASS, a publicly available large dataset that contains 100M jets of 10 different classes of particles. By integrating a parallel attention mechanism and pairwise interactions of particles in the attention mechanism,ParMAT achieves robustness and higher accuracy over the ParT and ParticleNet. The scalability of the model to huge datasets and its ability to automatically extract essential features demonstrate its potential for enhancing jet tagging.</description>

      <title>Scaling violation in power corrections to energy correlators from the light-ray OPE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, energy correlators have emerged as a powerful tool to explore the field theoretic structure of strong interactions at particle colliders. In this Letter we initiate a novel study of the non-perturbative power corrections to the projected $N$-point energy correlators in the limit where the angle between the detectors is small. Using the light-ray operator product expansion (OPE) as a guiding principle, we derive the power corrections in terms of two non-perturbative quantities describing the fragmentation of quarks and gluons. In analogy with their perturbative leading-power counterpart, we show that power corrections obey a classical scaling behavior that is violated at the quantum level. This crucially results in a dependence on the hard scale $Q$ of the problem that is calculable in perturbation theory. Our analytic predictions are successfully tested against Monte Carlo simulations for both lepton and hadron colliders, marking a significant step forward in the understanding of these observables.</description>

      <title>Impact of SMEFT renormalisation group running on Higgs production at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effects of the one-loop renormalisation group running/mixing of the Wilson coefficients in the standard model effective field theory on the predictions for $Hj$, $t\bar tH$ and $HH$ production at the LHC. We focus on a subset of operators closed under QCD corrections and explore the differences between employing a fixed or dynamical scale on the SMEFT predictions for key observables such as the Higgs transverse momentum and the Higgs pair invariant mass. We then study the impact of consistently taking into account renormalisation group effects on the constraints that can be obtained on the Wilson coefficients through current and future measurements at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Top-quark pair production as a probe of light top-philic scalars and anomalous Higgs interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the effects due to the virtual exchange (or the soft emission) of a scalar particle with generic couplings to the top quark in $t\bar t$ pair production at the LHC. We apply the results to two cases of interest, extending and completing previous studies. First, we consider the indirect search for light ($m_S&lt;2 m_t$) top-philic scalars with CP-even and/or CP-odd interactions. Second, we investigate how to set constraints on anomalous Yukawa couplings of the Higgs boson to the top quark. Our results show that the current precision of experimental data together with the accuracy of the SM predictions make such indirect determinations a powerful probe for new physics.</description>

      <title>Inflaton Production of Scalar Dark Matter through Fluctuations and Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effects on particle production of a Planck-suppressed coupling between the inflaton and a scalar dark matter candidate, $\chi$. In the absence of this coupling, the dominant source for the relic density of $\chi$ is the long wavelength modes produced from the scalar field fluctuations during inflation. In this case, there are strong constraints on the mass of the scalar and the reheating temperature after inflation from the present-day relic density of $\chi$ (assuming $\chi$ is stable). When a coupling $\sigma \phi^2 \chi^2$ is introduced, with $\sigma = {\tilde \sigma} m_\phi^2/ M_P^2 \sim 10^{-10} {\tilde \sigma}$, where $m_\phi$ is the inflaton mass, the allowed parameter space begins to open up considerably even for ${\tilde \sigma}$ as small as $\gtrsim 10^{-7}$. For ${\tilde \sigma} \gtrsim \frac{9}{16}$, particle production is dominated by the scattering of the inflaton condensate, either through single graviton exchange or the contact interaction between $\phi$ and $\chi$. In this regime, the range of allowed masses and reheating temperatures is maximal. For $0.004 &lt; {\tilde \sigma} &lt; 50$, constraints from isocurvature fluctuations are satisfied, and the production from parametric resonance can be neglected.</description>

      <title>Theory of neutrino fast flavor evolution. I. Linear response theory and stability conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrino-neutrino refraction leads to collective flavor evolution that can include fast flavor conversion, an ingredient still missing in numerical simulations of core-collapse supernovae. We provide a theoretical framework for the linear regime of this phenomenon using the language of response theory. In analogy to electromagnetic waves, we introduce a flavor susceptibility as the linear response to an external flavor field. By requiring self-consistency, this approach leads to the usual dispersion relation for growing modes, but differs from the traditional treatment in that it predicts Landau damping of subluminal collective modes. The new dispersion relation has definite analyticity properties and can be expanded for small growth rates. This approach simplifies and intuitively explains Morinaga's proof of sufficiency for the occurrence of growing modes. We show that weakly growing modes arise as soon as an angular crossing is formed, due to their resonant interaction with individual neutrino modes. For longitudinal plasma waves, a similar resonance causes Landau damping or conversely, the two-stream instability.</description>

      <title>Pseudoscalar and vector tetraquarks $bb\overline{c}\overline{c}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pseudoscalar and vector four-quark states $bb\overline{c}\overline{c}$ are studied in the context of the QCD sum rule method. We model $T_{\mathrm{ PS}} $ and $T_{\mathrm{V}}$ as structures built of diquarks $ b^{T}C\gamma_{5}b$, $\overline{c}C\overline{c}^{T}$ and $b^{T}C\gamma _{5}b$ , $\overline{c}C\gamma_{\mu}\gamma_{5}\overline{c}^{T}$, respectively, with $ C$ being the charge conjugation matrix. The spectroscopic parameters of the tetraquarks $T_{\mathrm{PS}}$ and $T_{\mathrm{V}}$, i.e., their masses and current couplings are calculated using QCD two-point sum rule method. We evaluate the full widths of $T_{\mathrm{PS}}$ and $T_{\mathrm{V}}$ by taking into account their kinematically allowed decay channels. In the case of the pseudoscalar particle they are processes $T_{\mathrm{PS}} \to B_{c}^{-}B_{c}^{\ast -}$, $B_{c}^{-}B_{c}^{-}(1^{3}P_{0})$ and $B_{c}^{\ast -}B_{c}^{-}(1^{1}P_{1})$. The vector state $T_{\mathrm{V}}$ can dissociate to meson pairs $2 B_{c}^{-}$, $2 B_{c}^{\ast -}$ and $ B_{c}^{-}B_{c}^{-}(1^{1}P_{1})$. Partial widths of these decays are determined by the strong couplings at relevant tetraquark-meson-meson vertices, which evaluated in the context of the three-point sum rule approach. Predictions obtained for the mass and full width of the pseudoscalar $m =(13.092\pm 0.095)~\mathrm{GeV}$, $\Gamma _{\mathrm{PS} }=(63.7\pm 9.4)~\mathrm{MeV}$ and vector $\widetilde{m} =(13.15\pm 0.10)~ \mathrm{GeV}$, $\Gamma_{\mathrm{V}}=(57.5.3\pm 8.6)~\mathrm{MeV}$ tetraquarks can be useful for analyses of different four-quark resonances.</description>

      <title>Modified Coulomb potential and the S-state wavefunction of heavy quarkonia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combination of relativistic kinematics together with Coulomb or Yukawa potentials is a common place in atomic, nuclear and meson mass phenomenology. In meson spectroscopy, linear and Coulomb-like potentials are the most commonly used potentials and decays rates are also calculated using the value of the wavefunction at the origin. But, it has been known for sometime that the use of relativistic kinematics together with Coulomb or Coulomb-like potentials produces wavefunction singularity at the origin for S-wave \cite{DuranFriarPolyzou}. Therefore, there is a need to address this problem somehow. In this letter, we show how to overcome this problem without destroying the phenomenological success of the use of relativistic kinematics in meson mass spectroscopy. Our method can be easily implemented for similar problems in atomic, nuclear and particle phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Unambiguous detection of high energy vortex states via the superkick effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vortex states of photons, electrons, and other particles are freely propagating wave packets with helicoidal wave fronts winding around the axis of a phase vortex. A particle prepared in a vortex state possesses a non-zero orbital angular momentum projection on the propagation direction, a quantum number that has never been exploited in experimental particle and nuclear physics. Low-energy vortex photons, electrons, neutrons, and helium atoms have been demonstrated in experiment and found numerous applications, and there exist proposals of boosting them to higher energies. However, the verification that a high energy particle is indeed in a vortex state will be a major challenge, since the low energy techniques become impractical for highly energetic particles. Here, we propose a new diagnostic method based of the so-called superkick effect, which can unambiguously detect the presence of a phase vortex. A proof-of-principle experiment with vortex electrons can be done with the existing technology and will, at the same time, constitute the first observation of the superkick effect.</description>

      <title>Exploring flavour space of an economical SU(5) GUT in future proton decay measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the potential of future proton decay experiments on the exploration of the flavour space of grand unification. We focus on an economical SU(5) grand unified model (GUT) with the fermion sector extended by including only one copy of 24-plet. Neutrino masses are generated via type-(I+III) seesaw mechanism with the lightest neutrino massless. Gauge unification requires masses of fermions in the 24-plet to be hierarchical, in particular, the electroweak singlet and triplet heavy leptons to be around the canonical seesaw scale and TeV scale, respectively. We address how extra parameters in the flavour space which cannot be touched in flavour measurements can be tested by a multi-channel analysis in future proton decay measurements.</description>

      <title>On Lepton and Baryon Numbers as Local Gauge Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simple theory where the total lepton number is a local gauge symmetry is proposed. In this context, the gauge anomalies are cancelled with the minimal number of extra fermionic fields and one predicts that the neutrinos are Majorana fermions. The properties of the neutrino sector are discussed showing that this theory predicts a $3+2$ light neutrino sector. We show that using the same fermionic fields one can gauge the baryon number and define a simple theory where the lepton and baryon numbers can be spontaneously broken at the low scale in agreement with experiments.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of the molecular hexaquarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the mass spectra of molecular-type hexaquark states in the dibaryon systems. These systems are composed of the charmed baryons $[\Sigma_c^{(\ast)}$, $\Xi_c^{(\prime,\ast)}]$, doubly charmed baryons $[\Xi_{cc}^{(\ast)}]$, and hyperons $[\Sigma^{(\ast)}$, $\Xi^{(\ast)}]$. We consider all possible combinations of particle-particle and particle-antiparticle pairs, including the S-wave spin multiplets in each combination. We establish the underlying connections among the molecular tetraquarks, pentaquarks, and hexaquarks with the effective quark-level interactions. We find that the existence of molecular states in $DD^\ast$, $D\bar{D}^\ast$, and $\Sigma_c\bar{D}^{(\ast)}$ systems leads to the emergence of a large number of deuteron-like hexaquarks in the heavy flavor sectors. Currently, there have been several experimental candidates for molecular tetraquarks and pentaquarks. The experimental search for near-threshold hexaquarks will further advance the establishment of the underlying dynamical picture of hadronic molecules and deepen our understanding of the role of spin-flavor symmetry in near-threshold residual strong interactions.</description>

      <title>Strong decays of the isovector-scalar $D^\ast\bar{D}^\ast$ hadronic molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We adopt the effective Lagrangian approach to study the strong decays of the $1^-(0^{++})$ $D^\ast\bar{D}^\ast$ molecular state [denoted as $T_{\psi0}^a(4010)$ according to the LHCb naming convention] through triangle diagrams. The decay channels include the open-charm $D\bar{D}$, and the hidden-charm $\eta_c\pi$, $J/\psi\rho$, and $\chi_{c1}\pi$. The coupling between the $T_{\psi0}^a(4010)$ and its constituents $D^\ast\bar{D}^\ast$ is obtained by solving for the residue of the scattering T-matrix at the pole. Our calculation yields a total width of $(12.0$$-$$35.4)$ MeV for the $T_{\psi0}^a(4010)$ state, with its main decay channels being $\eta_c\pi$ and $\chi_{c1}\pi$. The $X(4100)$ and $X(4050)$ have similar masses and widths, with both masses being close to the $D^\ast\bar{D}^\ast$ threshold. Additionally, their decay final states are consistent with those of the $T_{\psi0}^a(4010)$. Therefore, it is likely that they represent the same state and both potentially correspond to the $T_{\psi0}^a(4010)$. We suggest that future experiments focus on searching for the $T_{\psi0}^a(4010)$ signal in the final states $\eta_c\pi^-$, $\chi_{c1}\pi^-$ and $D^0D^-$ of the $B^0\to\eta_c\pi^-K^+$, $\chi_{c1}\pi^- K^+$ and $D^0D^-K^+$ processes, respectively, as well as further investigating its resonance parameters with Flatt\'e-like formula.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the constraints on low-energy coefficients of the $\nu$SMEFT generalization of the Standard Model effective theory in the simple case of a $\text{U}(1)^\prime$ enlargement of the Standard Model gauge group. In particular, we analyse the constraints imposed by the requirement that the extended theory remains free of gauge anomalies. We present the cases of explicit realisations, showing the obtained correlations among the coefficients of $d=6$ operators.</description>

      <title>Contributions of QED diagrams with vacuum polarization insertions to the lepton anomaly within the Mellin--Barnes representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the radiative QED corrections to the lepton ($L=e,~\mu$ and $\tau$) anomalous magnetic moment arising from vacuum polarization diagrams by four closed lepton loops. The method is based on the consecutive application of dispersion relations for the polarization operator and the Mellin--Barnes transform for the propagators of massive particles. This allows one to obtain, for the first time, exact analytical expressions for the radiative corrections to the anomalous magnetic moments of leptons from diagrams with insertions of four identical lepton loops all of the same type $\ell$ different from the external one, $L$. The result is expressed in terms of the mass ratio $r=m_\ell/m_L$. We investigate the behaviour of the exact analytical expressions at $r\to 0$ and $r\to \infty$ and compare with the corresponding asymptotic expansions known in the literature.</description>

      <title>Probing Mirror Neutrons and Dark Matter through Cold Neutron Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel neutron interferometry setup to explore the potential existence of mirror neutrons, a candidate for dark matter. Our work demonstrates that if mirror neutrons exist, neutrons will acquire an observable geometric phase due to mixing with these mirror counterparts. This geometric phase, detectable through our interferometric setup, could serve as a direct probe for the presence of mirror matter particles. Additionally, this investigation could shed light on unresolved issues in particle physics, such as the neutron lifetime puzzle. We discuss the setup's versatility and limitations, showing its capability to explore a wide range of parameters in neutron interferometry and potentially uncover new physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several extensions of the Standard Model predict the existence of sub-GeV particles that can be copiously produced in the cores of supernovae. A broad family of these particles are dubbed feebly interacting particles (FIPs), which can have masses of up to a few hundreds of MeV. Here, we review the most recent and leading constraints on electrophilic FIPs, describing multimessenger techniques that allow us to probe the full phenomenology of the electron/positron emission produced by these FIPs; from their associated X-ray emission to the production of the $511$~keV line. Furthermore, the approach described here is independent of the specific particle model and can be translated to the coupling and other properties of a variety of different particles, such as axion-like particles, sterile neutrinos or dark photons</description>

      <title>The magic of entangled top quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have seen an increasing body of work examining how quantum entanglement can be measured at high energy particle physics experiments, thereby complementing traditional table-top experiments. This begs the question of whether more concepts from quantum computation can be examined at colliders, and we here consider the property of magic, which distinguishes those quantum states which have a genuine computational advantage over classical states. We examine top anti-top pair production at the LHC, showing that nature chooses to produce magic tops, where the amount of magic varies with the kinematics of the final state. We compare results for individual partonic channels and at proton-level, showing that averaging over final states typically increases magic. This is in contrast to entanglement measures, such as the concurrence, which typically decrease. Our results create new links between the quantum information and particle physics literatures, providing practical insights for further study.</description>

      <title>Calculating the two-photon exchange contribution to $K_L\rightarrow\mu^+\mu^-$ decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework within which both the real and imaginary parts of the complex, two-photon exchange amplitude contributing to $K_L\rightarrow\mu^+\mu^-$ decay can be calculated using lattice QCD. The real part of this two-photon amplitude is of approximately the same size as that coming from a second-order weak strangeness-changing neutral-current process. Thus a test of the standard model prediction for this second-order weak process depends on an accurate result of this two-photon amplitude. A limiting factor of our proposed method comes from low-energy three-particle $\pi\pi\gamma$ states. The contribution from these states will be significantly distorted by the finite volume of our calculation -- a distortion for which there is no available correction. However, a simple estimate of the contribution of these three-particle states suggests their contribution to be at most a few percent allowing their neglect in a lattice calculation with a 10% target accuracy.</description>

      <title>Neutrino magnetic dipole portal with low energy neutrino nucleus scattering data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sterile neutrinos that couple to the Standard Model via the neutrino magnetic dipole portals have been extensively studied at various experiments. In this work, we scrutinize these interactions for sterile neutrinos in the mass range of $\unit[0.1]{}-\unit[50]{MeV}$ through the nuclear and electron recoils at various neutrino scattering experiments. For the $e$-flavor specific dipole portal, we demonstrate that Dresden-II can provide leading constraints for $m_N \lesssim \unit[0.5]{MeV}$, setting aside currently unresolved theoretical uncertainties. For the $\mu$-flavor case, we show that the COHERENT experiment can probe a unique parameter region for $m_N$ in the range of $\unit[10]{}-\unit[40]{MeV}$ with the full dataset collected by the CsI[Na] scintillation detector, including both the energy and timing structure of the neutrino beam. We also present limits on the parameter regions of the $\tau$-flavor dipole portal using measurements of the solar neutrino flux from dark matter direct detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Spread Complexity of High Energy Neutrino Propagation over Astrophysical Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spread complexity measures the minimized spread of quantum states over all choices of basis. It generalizes Krylov operator complexity to quantum states under continuous Hamiltonian evolution. In this paper, we study spread complexity in the context of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos and propose a new flavor ratio based on complexity. Our findings indicate that our proposal might favor an initial ratio of fluxes as $\phi_{\nu_e}^0: \phi_{\nu_\mu}^0: \phi_{\nu_\tau}^0 = 1:0:0$ over a more generally expected ratio of $1:2:0$, when the IceCube neutrino observatory achieves its projected sensitivity to discriminate between flavors. Additionally, complexity-based definitions of flavor ratios exhibit a slight but nonzero sensitivity to the neutrino mass ordering, which traditional flavor ratios cannot capture.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the processes, $e^- e^+ \rightarrow \gamma^* \gamma^* \rightarrow J/\psi +J/\psi$, and $e^- e^+ \rightarrow \gamma^* \gamma^* \rightarrow \eta_c+ \eta_c$ at $\sqrt{s}=10.6$ GeV in the framework of $4\times 4$ Bethe-Salpeter equation. For $J/\psi+J/\psi$ production, the dominant contribution is through fragmentation process, while for $\eta_c+\eta_c$ production, the quark rearrangement diagrams contribute. Our results of cross section for $J/\psi+J/\psi$ and $\psi(2S)+\psi(2S)$ are compatible with the experimental upper limits set by Belle Collaboration, while in the absence of experimental data for $\eta_c(1S)+\eta_c(1S)$, and $\eta_c(2S)+\eta_c(2S)$ production, we have given theoretical prediction of their cross sections, and compared with NRQCD prediction.</description>

      <title>Instanton Density Operator in Lattice QCD from Higher Category Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A natural definition for instanton density operator in lattice QCD has been long desired. We show this problem is, and has to be, resolved by higher category theory. The problem is resolved by refining at a conceptual level the Yang-Mills theory on lattice, in order to recover the homotopy information in the continuum, which would have been lost if we put the theory on lattice in the traditional way.
  The refinement needed is a generalization -- through the lens of higher category theory -- of the familiar process of Villainization that captures winding in lattice XY model and Dirac quantization in lattice Maxwell theory. The apparent difference is that Villainization is in the end described by principal bundles, hence familiar, but more general topological operators can only be captured on the lattice by more flexible structures beyond the usual group theory and fibre bundles, hence the language of categories becomes natural and necessary. The key structure we need for our particular problem is called multiplicative bundle gerbe, based upon which we can construct suitable structures to naturally define the 2d Wess-Zumino-Witten term, 3d skyrmion density operator and 4d hedgehog defect for lattice $S^3$ (pion vacua) non-linear sigma model, and the 3d Chern-Simons term, 4d instanton density operator and 5d Yang monopole defect for lattice $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory.
  In a broader perspective, higher category theory enables us to rethink more systematically the relation between continuum quantum field theory and lattice quantum field theory. We sketch a proposal towards a general machinery that constructs the suitably refined lattice degrees of freedom for a given non-linear sigma model or gauge theory in the continuum, realizing the desired topological operators on the lattice.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty quantification for $\mu \to e$ conversion in nuclei: charge distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the rate for $\mu\to e$ conversion in nuclei for a given set of effective operators mediating the violation of lepton flavor symmetry crucially depends on hadronic and nuclear matrix elements. In particular, the uncertainties inherent in this non-perturbative input limit the discriminating power that can be achieved among operators by studying different target isotopes. In order to quantify the associated uncertainties, as a first step, we go back to nuclear charge densities and propagate the uncertainties from electron scattering data for a range of isotopes relevant for $\mu\to e$ conversion in nuclei, including $^{40,48}$Ca, $^{48,50}$Ti, and $^{27}$Al. We provide as central results Fourier-Bessel expansions of the corresponding charge distributions with complete covariance matrices, accounting for Coulomb-distortion effects in a self-consistent manner throughout the calculation. As an application, we evaluate the overlap integrals for $\mu\to e$ conversion mediated by dipole operators. In combination with modern ab-initio methods, our results will allow for the evaluation of general $\mu\to e$ conversion rates with quantified uncertainties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been shown that some Lorentz-invariant quantum field theories, such as those with higher-dimensional operators with negative coefficients, lead to superluminality on some classical backgrounds. While superluminality by itself is not logically inconsistent, these theories also predict the formation of closed time-like curves at the classical level, starting from initial conditions without such curves. This leads to the formation of a Cauchy Horizon which prevents a complete description of the time evolution of such systems. Inspired by the chronology protection arguments of General Relativity, we show that quantum mechanical effects from low energy quanta strongly backreact on such configurations, exciting unknown short-distance degrees of freedom and invalidating the classical predictions. Thus, there is no obvious low-energy obstruction to the existence of these operators.</description>

      <title>Universal properties of the evolution of the Universe in modified loop quantum cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we systematically study the evolution of the Universe in the framework of a modified loop quantum cosmological model (mLQC-I) with various inflationary potentials, including chaotic, Starobinsky, generalized Starobinsky, polynomials of the first and second kinds, generalized T- models and natural inflation. In all these models, the big bang singularity is represented by a quantum bounce, and the evolution of the Universe both before and after the bounce is universal and weakly depends on the inflationary potentials, as long as the evolution is dominated by the kinetic energy of the inflaton at the bounce. In particular, the evolution in the pre-bounce region can be universally divided into three different phases: pre-bouncing, pre-transition, and pre-de Sitter. The pre-bouncing phase occurs immediately before the quantum bounce, during which the evolution of the Universe is dominated by the kinetic energy of the inflaton. Thus, the equation of state of the inflaton is about one, w = 1. Soon, the inflation potential takes over, so w rapidly falls from one to negative one. This pre-transition phase is very short and quickly turns into the pre-de Sitter phase, whereby the effective cosmological constant with a Planck size takes over and dominates the rest of the contracting phase. In the entire pre-bounce regime, the evolution of the expansion factor and the inflaton can be approximated by analytical solutions, which are universal and independent of the inflation potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown that using Noether's Theorem explicitly employing gauge invariance for variations of the electromagnetic four-potential $A^\mu$ straightforwardly ensures that the resulting electromagnetic energy-momentum tensor is symmetric. The Belinfante symmetrization procedure is not necessary. The method is based on Bessel-Hagen's 1921 clarification of Noether's original procedure, suggesting that the symmetry problem arises from an incomplete implementation of Noether's Theorem.</description>

Abstract: The quantum kinetic equation for the gauge-invariant Wigner function, constructed from spinor fields that obey the Dirac equation modified by CPT and Lorentz symmetry-violating terms, is presented. The equations for the components of Wigner function in the Clifford algebra basis are accomplished. Focusing on the massless case, an extended semiclassical chiral kinetic theory in the presence of external electromagnetic fields is developed. We calculate the chiral currents and establish the anomalous magnetic and separation effects in a Lorentz-violating background. The chiral anomaly within the context of extended Quantum Electrodynamics is elucidated. Finally, we derive the semiclassical Lorentz-violating extended chiral transport equation.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Lorentz invariance violation from the extraordinary Mrk 421 flare of 2014 using a novel analysis method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV), a proposed consequence of certain quantum gravity (QG) scenarios, could instigate an energy-dependent group velocity for ultra-relativistic particles. This energy dependence, although suppressed by the massive QG energy scale $E_\mathrm{QG}$, expected to be on the level of the Planck energy $1.22 \times 10^{19}$ GeV, is potentially detectable in astrophysical observations. In this scenario, the cosmological distances traversed by photons act as an amplifier for this effect. By leveraging the observation of a remarkable flare from the blazar Mrk\,421, recorded at energies above 100 GeV by the MAGIC telescopes on the night of April 25 to 26, 2014, we look for time delays scaling linearly and quadratically with the photon energies. Using for the first time in LIV studies a binned-likelihood approach we set constraints on the QG energy scale. For the linear scenario, we set $95\%$ lower limits $E_\mathrm{QG}&gt;2.7\times10^{17}$ GeV for the subluminal case and $E_\mathrm{QG}&gt; 3.6 \times10^{17}$ GeV for the superluminal case. For the quadratic scenario, the $95\%$ lower limits for the subluminal and superluminal cases are $E_\mathrm{QG}&gt;2.6 \times10^{10}$ GeV and $E_\mathrm{QG}&gt;2.5\times10^{10}$ GeV, respectively.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of $k$-essence and Quintessence Scalar Field Models: A Data Analysis Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a comparative analysis of quintessence and $k$-essence scalar field models in the data analysis perspective. We study the quintessence field with an exponential potential and the $k$-essence field with an inverse square potential in the present work. Before delving into data analysis, we provide a brief perspective on dynamical evolution on both of the models and obtain the stability constraints on the model parameters. We adopt Bayesian inference procedure to estimate the model parameters that best-fit the data. A comprehensive analysis utilizing Observational Hubble data (OHD) and Pantheon+ compilation of Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) shows that $k$-essence model fits the data slightly better than the quintessence model while the evidence of these models in comparison with the $\Lambda$CDM model is weak. The value of the Hubble constant predicted by both the models is in close agreement with the value obtained by the Planck2018 collaboration assuming the $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

      <title>Coupled-channel $J^{--}$ meson resonances from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend an earlier calculation within lattice QCD of excited light meson resonances with $J^{PC}=1^{--}, 2^{--}, 3^{--}$ at the SU(3) flavor point in the singlet representation, by considering the octet representation. In this case the resonances appear in coupled-channel amplitudes, which we determine, establishing the relative strength of pseudoscalar-pseudoscalar to pseudoscalar-vector decays. Combining the new octet results with the prior results for the singlet, we perform a plausible extrapolation to the physical quark mass, and compare to experimental $\rho^\star_J, K^\star_J, \omega^\star_J$ and $\phi^\star_J$ resonances.</description>

      <title>Helium-4 gravitational form factors: exchange currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the leading exchange corrections to the Helium-4 gravitational form factors (GFFs) upto momenta of the order of the nucleon mass. We use both the K-harmonic method with simple pair nucleon potential, and a Jastrow trial function using the Argonne $v_{14}$ potential, to evaluate the Helium-4 GFFs. The exchange current contributions include the pair interaction, plus the seagull and the pion exchange interactions, modulo the recoil corrections. To estimate the off-shellness of the pion nucleon coupling in this momenta range, we discuss the results using either the pseudo-scalar (PS) or pseudo-vector (PV) pion-nucleon couplings. When the PV coupling is used, the pair diagram contribution is higher order in the non relativistic expansion. The results for the Helium-4 A-GFF are comparable to those given by the impulse approximation, especially for the PS coupling using both the K-Harmonic method and variational method. The exchange current contributions with the PS coupling for the charge form factor of Helium-4, yield better agreement with the existing data over a broad range of momenta, especially when the Argonne $v_{14}$ potential including the D-wave admixture is used.</description>

      <title>Holographic and Gravity-Thermodynamic Approaches in Entropic Cosmology: Bayesian Assessment using late-time Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological implications of entropy-based approaches in the context of Holographic Dark Energy (HDE) and Gravity-Thermodynamics (GT) formalisms. We utilise the extended Barrow entropy form, with the index parameter $\Delta$, representing the fractal dimension of the horizon. We also test implementing different parameter ranges for $\Delta$, which can be extended to Tsallis' interpretation within the same formal cosmology. We perform a Bayesian analysis to constrain the cosmological parameters using the Pantheon+, more recent DESy5, DESI, and, as a supplement, Quasar datasets. We find that the HDE model within almost all data combinations performs extremely well in comparison to the GT approach, which is usually strongly disfavored. Using the combination of DESy5+DESI alone, we find that the GT approaches are disfavored at $|\log \mathcal{B}| \sim 5.8$ and $|\log \mathcal{B}| \sim 6.2$ for the Barrow and Tsallis limits on $\Delta$, respectively, wrt $\Lambda$CDM model. While the HDE approach is statistically equivalent to $\Lambda$CDM when comparing the Bayesian evidence. We also investigate the evolution of the dark energy equation of state and place limits on the same, consistent with quintessence-like behaviour in the HDE approaches.</description>

      <title>Prospects for the detection of Dark Matter with Long-lived Mediators in the Sun using the Southern Wide-field Gamma-ray Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The operation of the next generation of gamma-ray observatories will lead to a great advance in dark matter searches. In this paper, we use the hidden sectors hypothesis within the so-called secluded models to calculate the capabilities of the Southern Wide-field Gamma-ray Observatory (SWGO) to detect gamma-ray signatures produced by dark matter particles concentrated in the Sun. We assume the dark matter particle annihilates into metastable mediators which decay into $\gamma\gamma$, $e^+e^-$, $\tau^+\tau^-$, and $\bar{b}b$ outside the Sun. We found that the SWGO will be able to probe a spin-dependent cross-section of about $10^{-46}$ cm$^2$ for dark matter masses smaller than 5 TeV. This result shows an unprecedented sensitivity surpassing the current instruments by more than one order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>A model-independent test of pre-recombination New Physics: Machine Learning based estimate of the Sound Horizon from Gravitational Wave Standard Sirens and the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation Angular Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In any cosmological model where spacetime is described by a pseudo-Riemannian manifold, photons propagate along null geodesics, and their number is conserved, upcoming Gravitational Wave (GW) observations can be combined with measurements of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) angular scale to provide model-independent estimates of the sound horizon at the baryon-drag epoch. By focusing on the accuracy expected from forthcoming surveys such as LISA GW standard sirens and DESI or Euclid angular BAO measurements, we forecast a relative precision of $\sigma_{r_{\rm d}} /r_{\rm d} \sim 1.5\%$ within the redshift range $z \lesssim 1$. This approach will offer a unique model-independent measure of a fundamental scale characterizing the early universe, which is competitive with model-dependent values inferred within specific theoretical frameworks. These measurements can serve as a consistency test for $\Lambda$CDM, potentially clarifying the nature of the Hubble tension and confirming or ruling out new physics prior to recombination with a statistical significance of $\sim 4\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Cosmological constraints on $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM scenario in a type II minimally modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The idea of a rapid sign-switching cosmological constant (mirror AdS-dS transition) in the late universe at $z\sim1.7$, known as the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model, has significantly improved the fit to observational data and provides a promising scenario for alleviating major cosmological tensions, such as the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions. However, in the absence of a fully predictive model, implementing this fit required conjecturing that the dynamics of the linear perturbations are governed by general relativity. Recent work embedding the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model with the Lagrangian of a type-II minimally modified gravity known as VCDM has propelled $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM to a fully predictive model, removing the uncertainty related to the aforementioned assumption; we call this new model $\Lambda_{\rm s}$VCDM. In this work, we demonstrate that not only does $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM fit the data better than the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, but the new model, $\Lambda_{\rm s}$VCDM, performs even better in alleviating cosmological tensions while also providing a better fit to the data, including CMB, BAO, SNe Ia, and Cosmic Shear measurements. Our findings highlight the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM framework, particularly the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$VCDM model, as a compelling alternative to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, especially by successfully alleviating the $H_0$ tension. Additionally, these models predict higher values for $\sigma_8$, indicating enhanced structuring, albeit with lower present-day matter density parameter values and consequently reduced $S_8$ values, alleviating the $S_8$ tension as well. This demonstrates that the data are well fit by a combination of background and linear perturbations, both having dynamics differing from those of $\Lambda$CDM. This paves the way for further exploration of new ways for embedding the sign-switching cosmological constant into other models.</description>

      <title>Interpreting DESI 2024 BAO: late-time dynamical dark energy or a local effect?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform fits to DESI, CMB and supernova data to understand the physical origin of the DESI hint for dynamical dark energy. We find that the linear parametrization of the equation of state $w$ may guide to misleading interpretations, such as the hint for a phantom Universe, which are not preferred by the data. Instead, physical quintessence models fit the data well. Model-independently, present observations prefer deviations from the constant dark energy, $w=-1$, only at very low redshifts, $z &lt; \mathcal{O}(0.1)$. We find that this result is driven by low-$z$ supernova data. Therefore, either the fundamental properties of our Universe, characterised by the equation of state $w$ and the Hubble parameter $H$, underwent dramatic changes very recently or, alternatively, we do not fully understand the systematics of our local Universe in a radius of about $300\,h^{-1}\rm Mpc$.</description>

      <title>Improving Heavy Dijet Resonance Searches Using Jet Substructure at the LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:1912.03511v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The search for new physics at high energy accelerators has been at the crossroads with very little hint of signals suggesting otherwise. The challenges at a hadronic machine such as the LHC is compounded by the fact that final states are swamped with jets which one needs to understand and unravel. A positive step in this direction would be to separate the jets in terms of their gluonic and quark identities, much in a similar spirit of distinguishing heavy quark jets from light quark jets that has helped in improving searches for both neutral and charged Higgs bosons at the LHC. In this work, we utilise this information using the jet substructure techniques to comment on possible improvements in sensitivity as well as discrimination of new resonances in the all hadronic mode that would be crucial in pinning down new physics signals at HL-LHC, HE-LHC and any future 100 TeV hadron collider.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.07241v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop new perturbative tools to accurately study radiatively-induced first-order phase transitions. Previous perturbative methods have suffered internal inconsistencies and been unsuccessful in reproducing lattice data, which is often attributed to infrared divergences of massless modes (the Linde problem). We employ a consistent power counting scheme to perform calculations, and compare our results against lattice data. We conclude that the consistent expansion removes many previous issues, and indicates that the infamous Linde problem is not as big a factor in these calculations as previously thought.</description>

      <title>Renormalization scheme factorization of one-loop Fierz identities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a proof of the factorization of renormalization scheme in one-loop-corrected Fierz identities. This scheme factorization facilitates the simultaneous transformation of operator basis and renormalization scheme using only relations between physical operators; the evanescent operators in the respective bases may be chosen entirely independently of each other. The relations between evanescent operators in the two bases is automatically accounted for by the corrected Fierz identities. We illustrate the utility of this result with a two-loop anomalous dimension matrix computation using the Naive-Dimensional Regularization scheme, which is then transformed via one-loop Fierz identities to the known result in the literature given in a different basis and calculated in the Larin scheme. Additionally, we reproduce results from the literature of basis transformations involving the rotation of evanescent operators into the physical basis using our method, without the need to explicitly compute one-loop matrix elements of evanescent operators.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of heavy flavour in a weakly magnetized hot QCD medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain the spatial and momentum diffusion coefficients ($D_s$ and $\kappa$), and the collisional energy loss ($dE/dx$) of a heavy quark (HQ) traversing through a thermal medium of quarks and gluons in a weak magnetic field ($B$), for the two cases of the HQ moving either parallel or perpendicular to $\bm{B}$. For that purpose, we consider Coulomb scatterings ($t$-channel) of the HQ with the light quarks, obtained from the imaginary part of the HQ self-energy via the cutting rules. Both the normalised (by $T^3$) %\textit{momentum} diffusion coefficients, $\kappa$, as well as $dE/dx$, for charm quarks are larger than that for bottom quarks due to the larger mass of the latter. Also, the effect of $B$ is more feeble on the bottom quark, compared to the charm quark. Comparatively, the magnitudes of both $\kappa$ and $dE/dx$ are significantly smaller for the case of $\bm{v}\perp\bm{B}$. For both the cases, our results show that the momentum transfer between the HQ and the medium takes place preferentially along the direction of HQ velocity, thus leading to a significant increase in the momentum diffusion anisotropy, compared to $B=0$. We also calculate the (scaled) spatial diffusion coefficient, which we find to be independent of the heavy flavor mass and is almost unaffected by changes in $B$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) are one of the most widely discussed extensions of the Standard Model when it comes to the strong CP problem and dark matter candidates. Current experiments are focused on the indirect searches of invisible pseudoscalars in a wide parameter range. In this paper we investigate limits on ALP mass, and its couplings to photons and leptons from 3-photon annihilation at $e^+e^-$ colliders. We provide detailed calculations and apply them to the particular kinematics of the Belle II experiment, covering the ALP mass range from few hundred MeV to around 10 GeV. Our results, which improve upon previous analyses by also including the ALP coupling to electrons, show that such future analyses will allow to significantly extend the ALP search range and impose much more stringent restrictions on their couplings.</description>

Abstract: We study higher-order QCD corrections for the production of a top-antitop quark pair ($t{\bar t}$ production) at the Large Hadron Collider in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory. We consider effects of new physics parametrized by the top-quark chromomagnetic dipole operator. We calculate new physics contributions to the total cross section at approximate NNLO, with second-order soft-gluon corrections added to the complete NLO result, including uncertainties from scale dependence and from parton distributions. We also calculate new physics contributions at approximate NNLO for differential distributions in top-quark transverse momentum.</description>

Abstract: We present the results for the complete next-to-leading order electroweak corrections to $pp \to HH$ at the Large Hadron Collider, focusing on the dominant gluon-gluon fusion process. While the corrections at the total cross-section level are approximately $-4\%$, those near the energy of $HH$ production threshold exceed $+15\%$, and corrections at the high-energy region are around $-10\%$, leading to a shape distortion for the differential distributions. Our findings substantially diminish the theoretical uncertainties associated with this pivotal process, providing valuable input for understanding the shape of the Higgs boson potential upon comparison with experimental measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fragmentation of heavy quarks into heavy-flavoured hadrons receives both perturbative and non-perturbative contributions. We consider perturbative QCD corrections to heavy quark production in $e^+e^-$ collisions to next-to-next-to-leading order accuracy in QCD with next-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic resummation of quasi-collinear and soft emissions. We study multiple matching schemes, and multiple regularisations of the soft resummation, and observe a significant dependence of the perturbative results on these ingredients, suggesting that NNLO+NNLL perturbative accuracy may not lead to real gains unless the interface with non-perturbative physics is properly analysed. We confirm previous evidence that $D^{*+}$ experimental data from CLEO/BELLE and from LEP are not reconcilable with perturbative predictions employing standard DGLAP evolution. We extract non-perturbative contributions from $e^+e^-$ experimental data for both $D$ and $B$ meson fragmentation. Such contributions can be used to predict heavy-quark fragmentation in other processes, e.g. DIS and proton-proton collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate flavour violating four Fermi Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) operators of dimension-six that can be probed via $tc ~(\bar{t}c+t\bar{c})$ production at the multi-TeV muon collider. We study different FCNC and FCCC processes related to $B$, $B_s$, $K$ and $D$ decays and mixings, sensitive to these operators and constrain the corresponding couplings. The tensor operator turns out to be most tightly bound. We perform event simulation of the final state signal from $tc$ production together with the SM background to show that operators after flavour constraint can reach the discovery limit at 10 TeV muon collider. We further adopt the optimal observable technique (OOT) to determine the optimal statistical sensitivity of the Wilson coefficients and compare them with the flavour constraints. We use the limits to predict the observational sensitivities of the rare processes like $K_L \to \pi_0 \ell \ell$, $D_0 \to \mu\mu$, $t \to c\ell\ell$.</description>

      <title>Higgs Precision Analysis of the Full LHC Run 1 and Run 2 Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform global fits of the Higgs boson couplings to the full Higgs datasets collected at the LHC with the integrated luminosities per experiment of approximately 5/fb at 7 TeV, 20/fb at 8 TeV, and up to 139/fb at 13 TeV. Our combined analysis based on the experimental signal strengths used in this work and the theoretical ones elaborated for our analysis reliably reproduce the results in the literature. We reveal that the LHC Higgs precision data are no longer best described by the SM Higgs boson taking account of extensive and comprehensive CP-conserving and CP-violating scenarios found in several well-motivated models beyond the SM. Especially, in most of the fits considered in this work, we observe that the best-fitted values of the normalized Yukawa couplings are about $2\sigma$ below the corresponding SM ones with the $1\sigma$ errors of 3-5%. On the other hand, the gauge-Higgs couplings are consistent with the SM with the $1\sigma$ errors of 2-3%. Incidentally, the reduced Yukawa couplings help to explain the excess of the $H\to Z\gamma$ signal strength of $2.2\pm 0.7$ recently reported by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16737v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the inverse moment of the $B_s$-meson light-cone distribution amplitude (LCDA), denoted as $\lambda_{B_s}$ and defined within the heavy quark effective theory, through the calculation of $B_s \to \eta_s$ form factors. The presence of the $s$-quark inside the $B_s$-meson dictates a notable departure of approximately $20\%$ in the $\lambda_{B_s}$ value compared to the non-strange case $\lambda_{B_q}$, as computed within the QCD sum rule approach, albeit with significant uncertainty. First, we compute the decay constant of the $\eta_s$-meson utilizing two-point sum rules while retaining finite $s$-quark mass contributions. Next, we constrain the parameter $\lambda_{B_s}$ by calculating $B_s \to \eta_s$ form factors within the light-cone sum rule approach, using $B_s$-meson LCDAs, and leveraging Lattice QCD estimates at zero momentum transfer from the HPQCD collaboration. Our findings yield $\lambda_{B_s}$ = 480 $\pm$ 92 MeV when expressing the $B_s$-meson LCDAs in the Exponential model, consistent with previous QCD sum rule estimate yet exhibiting a 1.5-fold improvement in uncertainty. Furthermore, we compare the form factor predictions, based on the extracted $\lambda_{B_s}$ value, with earlier analyses for other channels such as $B_s \to D_s$ and $B_s \to K$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07499v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Very recently, the Belle~II Collaboration presented a measurement for the decays $B^+\to\bar{D}^{(*)0} K^+\bar{K}^0$ and $B^0\to D^{(*)-}K^+\bar{K}^0$, the bulk of observed $m(K^+ K_S^0)$ distributions showing low-mass structures in all four channels. In this work, we study the contributions of $\rho(770,1450)^+$, $a_2(1320)^+$ and $a_0(980,1450)^+$ resonances to these decay processes. The intermediate states $\rho(770,1450)^+$ are found to dominate the low-mass distribution of kaon pairs roughly contributing to half of the total branching fraction in each of the four decay channels. The contribution of the tensor $a_2(1320)^+$ meson is found to be negligible. Near the threshold of the kaon pair, the state $a_0(980)^+$ turns out to be much less important than expected, not being able to account for the enhancement of events in that energy region observed in the $B^+\to\bar{D}^{(*)0} K^+\bar{K}^0$ decays. Further studies both from the theoretical and experimental sides are needed to elucidate the role of the non-resonant contributions governing the formation of $K^+\bar{K}^0$ pairs near their threshold in these decay processes.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity to sub-GeV dark matter from cosmic-ray scattering with very-high-energy gamma-ray observatories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Huge efforts have been deployed to detect dark matter (DM) in the GeV-TeV mass range involving various detection techniques, and led to strong constraints in the available parameter space. We compute here the sensitivity to sub-GeV DM that can be probed from the inevitable cosmic-ray scattering onto DM particles populating the Milky Way halo. Inelastic scattering of energetic cosmic rays off DM would produce high-energy gamma rays in the final state, providing a new avenue to probe the poorly-constrained so far sub-GeV dark matter mass range. In this work we derive sensitivity forecasts for the inelastic cosmic-ray proton - DM cross section for current and future very-high-energy gamma-ray observatories such as H.E.S.S., LHAASO, CTA and SWGO in the 100 eV to 100 MeV mass range. These inelastic cross section constraints are converted to the elastic proton - DM cross section to highlight further complementarity with cosmological, collider and direct detection searches. The sensitivity computed at 95\% confidence level on the elastic cross section reaches $\sim$2$\times$ 10$^{-32}$ cm$^2$ for a 100 keV DM mass for H.E.S.S.-like and $\sim$7$\times$ 10$^{-34}$ cm$^2$ for a $\sim$1 keV DM mass for LHAASO. The sensitivity prospects for CTA and a strawman SWGO model reach $\sim$6$\times$ 10$^{-34}$ cm$^2$ and $\sim$4$\times$ 10$^{-35}$ cm$^2$, for DM masses of 10 keV and 1 keV, respectively. The sensitivity reach of the gamma-ray observatories considered here enables to probe an uncharted region of the DM mass - cross section parameter space.</description>

      <title>Quark anomalous magnetic moment in an extreme magnetic background from perturbative QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the one-loop QCD correction to the photon-quark-antiquark vertex in an extremely strong magnetic background, i.e., one in which $\sqrt{eB}$ is much larger than all other mass scales. We resort to the lowest-Landau level approximation, and consider on shell fermions. We find that the total magnetic moment is such that the anomalous magnetic moment contributes to the electric part $\sim iE_3\sigma_3$, the other contributions to $\boldsymbol{B}\cdot\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ and $i\boldsymbol{E}\cdot\boldsymbol{\sigma}_\perp$ being completely suppressed. We show results for the anomalous magnetic moment of quarks up and down, scaled by their values in the vacuum, as a function of the external magnetic field, considering dressed gluons and a renormalization scale $\mu_\mathrm{\tiny \overline{ MS}}=\sqrt{|eB|}$.</description>

      <title>From pole parameters to line shapes and branching ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Resonances are uniquely characterized by their complex pole locations and the corresponding residues. In practice, however, resonances are typically identified experimentally as structures in invariant mass distributions, with branching fractions of resonances determined as ratios of count rates. To make contact between these quantities it is necessary to connect line shapes and resonance parameters. In this work we propose such a connection and illustrate the formalism with detailed studies of the $\rho(770)$ and $f_0(500)$ resonances. Based on the line shapes inferred from the resonance parameters along these lines, expressions for partial widths and branching ratios are derived and compared to other approaches in the literature.</description>

      <title>Exploring scalar contributions with $K^+ \to \pi^+ \ell^+ \ell^-$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rare kaon decay $K^+ \to \pi^+\ell^+\ell^-$ offers insights into Standard Model (SM) physics and beyond. Driven by vector form factor in the SM, it can also probe non-standard contributions. In this letter we study the scalar contribution, $f_S$. Using differential decay width and Forward-Backward Asymmetry we propose a simultaneous fit to vector and scalar contributions which is necessary for a consistent analysis. Novel bounds on $|f_S|$ are presented for the first time through a reinterpretation of the E865, NA48/2, and NA62 experimental results. The analysis results in the most precise bound $f_S &lt; 7.9\times 10^{-6}$ at 90$\%$ confidence level.</description>

      <title>Recent Neutrino Oscillation Parameters Impact on the Effective Majorana Neutrino Mass in 0$\nu\beta\beta$ Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate how recent updates to neutrino oscillation parameters and the sum of neutrino masses influence the sensitivity of neutrinoless double-beta (0$\nu\beta\beta$) decay experiments. Incorporating the latest cosmological constraints on the sum of neutrino masses and laboratory measurements on oscillations, we determine the sum of neutrino masses for both the normal hierarchy (NH) and the inverted hierarchy (IH). Our analysis reveals a narrow range for the sum of neutrino masses, approximately 0.06 eV/c$^2$ for NH and 0.102 eV/c$^2$ for IH. Utilizing these constraints, we calculate the effective Majorana masses for both NH and IH scenarios, establishing the corresponding allowed regions. Importantly, we find that the minimum neutrino mass is non-zero, as constrained by the current oscillation parameters. Additionally, we estimate the half-life of 0$\nu\beta\beta$ decay using these effective Majorana masses for both NH and IH. Our results suggest that upcoming ton-scale experiments will comprehensively explore the IH scenario, while 100-ton-scale experiments will effectively probe the parameter space for the NH scenario, provided the background index can achieve 1 event/kton-year in the region of interest.</description>

      <title>Importance of the X-ray edge singularity for the detection of relic neutrinos in the PTOLEMY project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.07406v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Direct detection of relic neutrinos in a beta-decay experiment is an ambitious goal that has long been beyond the reach of available technology. One of the most challenging practical difficulties for such an experiment is managing a large amount of radioactive material without compromising the energy resolution required to distinguish useful events from the substantial beta-decay background. The PTOLEMY project offers an innovative solution to this problem by depositing radioactive material on graphene. While this approach is expected to address the main challenge, it introduces new issues due to the proximity of the beta decayers to a solid-state system. In this work, we focus on the effect of the shakeup of the graphene electron system caused by a beta-decay event. We calculate the distortion of the relic neutrino peaks resulting from this shakeup, analyze the impact of the distortion on the visibility of neutrino capture events, and discuss potential technological solutions to enhance the visibility of these events.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive forecast for cosmological parameter estimation using joint observations of gravitational waves and short $\gamma$-ray bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the third-generation (3G) gravitational-wave (GW) detector era, the multi-messenger GW observation for binary neutron star (BNS) merger events can exert great impacts on exploring the cosmic expansion history. In this work, we comprehensively explore the potential of 3G GW standard siren observations in cosmological parameter estimations by considering the 3G GW detectors and the future short $\gamma$-ray burst (GRB) detector THESEUS-like telescope joint observations. Based on the 10-year observation of different detection strategies, we predict that the numbers of detectable GW-GRB events are 334--674 with the redshifts $z&lt;3.5$ and the inclination angles $\iota&lt;15^{\circ}$. For the cosmological analysis, we consider the $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, $w_0w_a$CDM models, and interacting dark energy (IDE) models. We find that GW can tightly constrain the Hubble constant with precisions of $0.345\%-0.065\%$, but perform not well in constraining other cosmological parameters. Fortunately, GW could effectively break the cosmological parameter degeneracies generated by the mainstream EM observations, CMB+BAO+SN (CBS). When combining the mock GW data with the CBS data, CBS+GW can tightly constrain the equation of state of dark energy $w$ with a precision of 1.26\%, close to the standard of precision cosmology. Meanwhile, the addition of GW to CBS could improve constraints on cosmological parameters by $34.2\%-94.9\%$. In conclusion, GW standard siren observations from 3G GW detectors could play a crucial role in helping solve the Hubble tension and probe the fundamental nature of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulations of Hadron Dynamics in the Schwinger Model using 112 Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hadron wavepackets are prepared and time evolved in the Schwinger model using 112 qubits of IBM's 133-qubit Heron quantum computer ibm_torino. The initialization of the hadron wavepacket is performed in two steps. First, the vacuum is prepared across the whole lattice using the recently developed SC-ADAPT-VQE algorithm and workflow. SC-ADAPT-VQE is then extended to the preparation of localized states, and used to establish a hadron wavepacket on top of the vacuum. This is done by adaptively constructing low-depth circuits that maximize the overlap with an adiabatically prepared hadron wavepacket. Due to the localized nature of the wavepacket, these circuits can be determined on a sequence of small lattices using classical computers, and then robustly scaled to prepare wavepackets on large lattices for simulations using quantum computers. Time evolution is implemented with a second-order Trotterization. To reduce both the required qubit connectivity and circuit depth, an approximate quasi-local interaction is introduced. This approximation is made possible by the emergence of confinement at long distances, and converges exponentially with increasing distance of the interactions. Using multiple error-mitigation strategies, up to 14 Trotter steps of time evolution are performed, employing 13,858 two-qubit gates (with a CNOT depth of 370). The propagation of hadrons is clearly identified, with results that compare favorably with Matrix Product State simulations. Prospects for a near-term quantum advantage in simulations of hadron scattering are discussed.</description>

      <title>Muon Capture on $^{6}$Li, $^{12}$C, and $^{16}$O from $Ab~Initio$ Nuclear Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Muon capture on nuclei is one of the most promising probes of the nuclear electroweak current driving the yet-hypothetical neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay. Both processes involve vector and axial-vector currents at finite momentum transfer, $q\sim 100$ MeV, as well as the induced pseudoscalar and weak-magnetism currents. Comparing measured muon-capture rates with reliable $ab~initio$ nuclear-theory predictions could help us validate these currents. To this end, we compute partial muon-capture rates for $^{6}$Li, $^{12}$C and $^{16}$O, feeding the ground and excited states in $^{6}$He, $^{12}$B and $^{16}$N, using $ab~initio$ no-core shell model with two- and three-nucleon chiral interactions. We remove the spurious center-of-mass motion by introducing translationally invariant operators and approximate the effect of hadronic two-body currents by Fermi-gas model. We solve the bound-muon wave function from the Dirac wave equations in the Coulomb field created by a finite nucleus. We find that the computed rates to the low-lying states in the final nuclei are in good agreement with the measured counterparts. We highlight sensitivity of some of the transitions to the sub-leading three-nucleon interaction terms. We also compare summed rates to several tens of final states with the measured total capture rates and note that we slightly underestimate the total rate with this simple approach due to limited range of excitation energies.</description>

      <title>Study of charged Lepton Flavor Violation in electron muon interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the improvement of muon acceleration technology, it has received great interest to exploit high-energy muon beams for collision or target experiments. We investigate possible charged Lepton Flavor Violation (cLFV) processes mediated by an extra massive neutral gauge boson Zprime in electron muon interactions, either at a proposed electron muon collider or in a fixed target experiment with high-energy muon beam hitting electrons in the target. Based on Monte Carlo calculations and fast detector simulations, we study in detail our signal and possible backgrounds, giving the sensitivity results of cLFV signals at the 90% confidence level. Compared with current and prospective limits set by other experiments, electron muon interactions demonstrate significant advantages in the cLFV coupling strength sensitivity with tau in the final states. In addition, a special cLFV coupling combination, lambda_emu * lambda_mumu, can also be probed in our proposal.</description>

      <title>On the number of Regge trajectories for dual amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.21057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Regge poles connect the analytic structure of scattering amplitudes, analytically continued in spin, to the high-energy limit in momentum space. Dual models are expected to have only Regge poles, and string theory suggests there should be an infinite number of them. In this study, we investigate the number of Regge trajectories these models may have. We prove, based solely on crossing symmetry and unitarity, that meromorphic amplitudes, with or without subtractions, cannot produce a reggeizing amplitude if they contain any finite number of Regge trajectories. We argue that this should exclude the existence of such amplitudes altogether. Additionally, we develop and apply a linear programming dual bootstrap method to exclude these amplitudes directly in momentum space.</description>
