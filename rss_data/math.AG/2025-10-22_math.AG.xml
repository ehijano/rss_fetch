      <title>The motivic fundamental groupoid at tangential basepoints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a general construction of the motivic fundamental groupoid at tangential basepoints, extending previous works of P. Deligne, A. B. Goncharov, and M. Levine, which were limited to ordinary basepoints or to specific varieties. Given a smooth variety over a field endowed with a simple normal crossings divisor, we encode its tangential basepoints using the language of logarithmic geometry. Building on the recent construction by F. Binda, D. Park, and P. A. {\O}stv{\ae}r of a stable $\infty$-category of $\mathbb{A}^1$-invariant logarithmic motives and its comparison with the usual $\infty$-category of motives, we define in a functorial manner the associated motivic pointed path spaces. In the presence of a motivic $t$-structure, truncating yields the motivic fundamental groupoid. In general, we construct Betti and de Rham realization functors for logarithmic motives (linearizing the construction of F. Binda, D. Park and P. A. {\O}stv{\ae}r for the Betti case) and we show that the periods of the motivic fundamental groupoid are given by regularized iterated integration of logarithmic differential $1$-forms, thus yielding a general version of Chen's theorem with tangential basepoints.</description>

      <title>Effective calculation of local Weil functions via presentations of Cartier divisors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the question of effectivity for calculation of local Weil functions from the viewpoint of presentations of Cartier divisors. This builds on the approach of Bombieri and Gubler as well as the perspective of our earlier works. Among other features, our approach here gives rise to theoretical effective algorithms for calculating local Weil functions on projective varieties.</description>

      <title>Non-archimedean cylinder counts are logarithmic Gromov-Witten invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a comparison result relating non-archimedean cylinder counts and logarithmic cylinder counts in a smooth affine log Calabi-Yau variety. Using the decomposition theorem and the gluing formula from log Gromov-Witten theory, we can express logarithmic cylinder counts in terms of wall type invariants. As a corollary, we show that in the surface case the non-archimedean scattering diagram from Keel-Yu and the logarithmic scattering diagram from Gross-Siebert coincide, and deduce that the two mirror constructions agree. Along the way, we prove the exponential formula, expressing the non-archimedean wall-crossing function as the exponential of a generating series of punctured log Gromov-Witten invariants. This provides the first explicit formula relating counts of non-archimedean curves with boundary to punctured log invariants.</description>

      <title>A Degree Bound for the c-Boomerang Uniformity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{F}_q$ be a finite field, and let $F \in \mathbb{F}_q [X]$ be a polynomial with $d = \text{deg} \left( F \right)$ such that $\gcd \left( d, q \right) = 1$. In this paper we prove that the $c$-Boomerang uniformity, $c \neq 0$, of $F$ is bounded by
  - $d^2$ if $c^2 \neq 1$,
  - $d \cdot (d - 1)$ if $c = -1$,
  - $d \cdot (d - 2)$ if $c = 1$.
  For all cases of $c$, we present tight examples for $F \in \mathbb{F}_q [X]$.
  Additionally, for the proof of $c = 1$ we establish that the bivariate polynomial $F (x) - F (y) + a \in k [x, y]$, where $k$ is a field of characteristic $p$ and $a \in k \setminus \{ 0 \}$, is absolutely irreducible if $p \nmid \text{deg} \left( F \right)$.</description>

      <title>Period sheaves via perverse pullbacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct period sheaves for Hamiltonian spaces, as conjectured in the work of Ben-Zvi, Sakellaridis and Venkatesh, using the perverse pullback functors introduced in the authors' previous work. We prove a dimensional reduction isomorphism (generalizing the results of Davison and Kinjo in cohomological Donaldson--Thomas theory) which implies that perverse pullbacks refine the ordinary pullback functors in constructible sheaf theory, and relate perverse pullbacks to microstalk functors. These results imply that our period sheaves recover the known constructions in the cotangent and Whittaker cases.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this text is to present the computation by Salmon, in the second half of the XIXth century, of various numbers enumerating planes with a prescribed tangency pattern with a sufficiently general surface $S$ in $\mathbf{P}^3$ (or, equivalently, of hyperplane sections of $S$ with prescribed singularities). Emblematic among these are the number of tritangent planes, and the number of planes cutting out a curve with a tacnode.</description>

      <title>An introduction to field extensions and Galois descent for sheaves of vector spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.14837v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study extension of scalars for sheaves of vector spaces, assembling results that follow from well-known statements about vector spaces, but also developing some complements. In particular, we formulate Galois descent in this context, and we also discuss the case of derived categories and perverse sheaves. Most of the results are not new, but our aim is to give an accessible introduction to this subject relying only on techniques from basic sheaf theory. Our proofs also illustrate some applications of results about the structure of constructible and perverse sheaves.</description>

      <title>Section conjectures over $\mathbb{C}$ and Kodaira fibrations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03248v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we propose and study topological and Hodge theoretic analogues of Grothendieck's section conjecture over the complex numbers. We study these questions in the context of family of curves, in particular Kodaira fibrations, and in the context of the family of Jacobians associated to a Kodaira fibration. We showed that in the case of family of curves, both the topological and Hodge-theoretic analogues of the injectivity part of the section conjecture holds, and that the topological analogue of the surjectivity part of the section conjecture does not hold in general for families of curves (proven in the appendix written by Lee and Serv\'{a}n) and families of Jacobians.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01404v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the $\eta$-completed part of the motivic spectrum $\text{MSp}$ constructed by Panin and Walter, representing the universal $\text{Sp}$-oriented cohomology theory. In particular, we investigate the inclusion $(\text{MSp}^\wedge_\eta)^*\hookrightarrow \text{MGL}^*$ of the cofficient rings, by studying the motivic Adams spectral sequence associated to $\text{MSp}$, mimiking a strategy used by Levine,Yang, Zhao for $\text{MSL}^*$. In order to give a description of $(\text{MSp}^\wedge_\eta)^*$, we refine the Pontryagin-Thom construction in a way that allows one to obtain symplectic bordism classes from a large family of varieties that carry a certain "symplectic twist", and we prove a criterion to select generators among these classes.</description>

      <title>Positive Polytopes with Few Facets in the Grassmannian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we study adjoint hypersurfaces of geometric objects obtained by intersecting simple polytopes with few facets in $\mathbb{P}^5$ with the Grassmannian $\mathrm{Gr}(2,4)$. These generalize the positive Grassmannian, which is the intersection of $\mathrm{Gr}(2,4)$ with the simplex. We show that if the resulting object has five facets, it is a positive geometry and the adjoint hypersurface is unique. For the case of six facets we show that the adjoint hypersurface is not necessarily unique and give an upper bound on the dimension of the family of adjoints. We illustrate our results with a range of examples. In particular, we show that even if the adjoint is not unique, a positive hexahedron can still be a positive geometry.</description>

      <title>On exact sequences of Hodge theoretic fundamental groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to first define a Hodge theoretic fundamental group for smooth connected complex algebraic varieties and then prove and study a right exact sequence of Hodge theoretic fundamental groups associated to a smooth projective family of algebraic varieties $f\colon X\to B$. In particular, we study when this right exact sequence is exact, relate this question to some prior results in non-abelian Hodge theory, and give an obstruction to splitting in terms of \'{e}tale fundamental groups. The main examples we consider in this note is the universal curve $f\colon \mathcal{C}_g\to \mathcal{M}_g$ and the moduli space of degree $1$ line bundles on the universal curves $p \colon \text{Pic}^1_{\mathcal{C}_g/\mathcal{M}_g}\to \mathcal{M}_g$.</description>

We (1) generalize GV invariants to crepant partial resolutions of $cA_n$ singularities, (2) show that generalized GV invariants also satisfy Toda's formula and are determined by their associated contraction algebra, (3) give filtration structures on the parameter space of contraction algebras associated to $cA_n$ crepant resolutions with respect to generalized GV invariants, and (4) numerically constrain the possible tuples of GV invariants that can arise. We further give all the tuples that arise from GV invariants of $cA_2$ crepant resolutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02724v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the relative Matsui spectrum, a new invariant associated with a stable \(\infty\)-category equipped with an action. This construction generalizes both Balmer's tensor triangular spectra and Matsui's triangular spectra, and provides a unified framework for classifying thick submodules. We establish its fundamental properties, including universality, comparison with existing spectra, and descent, and construct a natural morphism to the Balmer spectrum of the base. Applications show that the relative Matsui spectrum recovers the underlying classical geometric spaces from categorical data in various settings: categories of perfect complexes of schemes, twisted derived categories, categories of singularities, and derived matrix factorization categories. Thus the relative Matsui spectrum extends the reach of tensor triangular geometry beyond globally tensorial settings, while preserving geometric intuition.</description>

      <title>Nonvanishing results for K\"ahler varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonvanishing theorems play a central role in birational geometry, since they derive geometric consequences from numerical information and constitute a crucial step towards abundance and semiampleness problems. General nonvanishing statements remain rare, especially in the K\"ahler setting.
  We present two types of nonvanishing results for compact K\"ahler varieties. First, on non-uniruled varieties with nonzero Euler-Poincar\'e characteristic, we prove nonvanishing for adjoint bundles of numerical dimension one on K\"ahler klt pairs, as well as nonvanishing for nef line bundles of numerical dimension one on $K$-trivial varieties. Second, on hyperk\"ahler manifolds we study line bundles $\mathcal L$ which are nef but not big, and establish a dichotomy: either nonvanishing holds for $\mathcal L$, or any closed positive current in the cohomology class of $\mathcal L$ has maximal Lelong components with a rather restricted geometry. We obtain much stronger abundance-type results in dimension $4$.</description>

      <title>Variants on Frobenius Intersection Flatness and Applications to Tate Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06444v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of singularities defined by Frobenius has been extensively developed for $F$-finite rings and for rings that are essentially of finite type over excellent local rings. However, important classes of non-local excellent rings, such as Tate algebras and their quotients (affinoid algebras) do not fit into either setting. We investigate here a framework for moving beyond the $F$-finite setting, developing the theory of three related classes of regular rings defined by properties of Frobenius. In increasing order of strength, these are Frobenius Ohm-Rush (FOR), Frobenius intersection flat, and Frobenius Ohm-Rush trace (FORT).
  We show that Tate algebras are Frobenius intersection flat, from which it follows that reduced affinoid algebras have test elements using a result of Sharp. We also deduce new cases of the openness of the $F$-pure locus.</description>

We define a well-behaved category of equivariant sheaves on the double affine grassmannian \Gr_{G}, seen as a infty-stack, that we equip with a t-structure. We obtain an Braden's hyperbolic localization theorem for such a stack and prove that the constant term functor is t-exact using dimension estimates for affine MV-cycles. We then deduce the sought-for equivalence and prove that the IC-complexes match with the irreducible highest weight representations of the Langlands dual group G^{\vee}.</description>
