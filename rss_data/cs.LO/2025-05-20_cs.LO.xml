      <title>Balanced residuated partially ordered semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A residuated semigroup is a structure $\langle A,\le,\cdot,\backslash,/ \rangle$ where $\langle A,\le \rangle$ is a poset and $\langle A,\cdot \rangle$ is a semigroup such that the residuation law $x\cdot y\le z\iff x\le z/y\iff y\le x \backslash z$ holds. An element $p$ is positive if $a\le pa$ and $a \le ap$ for all $a$. A residuated semigroup is called balanced if it satisfies the equation $x \backslash x \approx x / x$ and moreover each element of the form $a \backslash a = a / a$ is positive, and it is called integrally closed if it satisfies the same equation and moreover each element of this form is a global identity. We show how a wide class of balanced residuated semigroups (so-called steady residuated semigroups) can be decomposed into integrally closed pieces, using a generalization of the classical Plonka sum construction. This generalization involves gluing a disjoint family of ordered algebras together using multiple families of maps, rather than a single family as in ordinary Plonka sums.</description>

      <title>Learning Probabilistic Temporal Logic Specifications for Stochastic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been substantial progress in the inference of formal behavioural specifications from sample trajectories, for example, using Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). However, these techniques cannot handle specifications that correctly characterise systems with stochastic behaviour, which occur commonly in reinforcement learning and formal verification. We consider the passive learning problem of inferring a Boolean combination of probabilistic LTL (PLTL) formulas from a set of Markov chains, classified as either positive or negative. We propose a novel learning algorithm that infers concise PLTL specifications, leveraging grammar-based enumeration, search heuristics, probabilistic model checking and Boolean set-cover procedures. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in two use cases: learning from policies induced by RL algorithms and learning from variants of a probabilistic model. In both cases, our method automatically and efficiently extracts PLTL specifications that succinctly characterise the temporal differences between the policies or model variants.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Knowledge Bases as Grammar-Compressed Proof Terms: Exploring Metamath Proof Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Viewing formal mathematical proofs as logical terms provides a powerful and elegant basis for analyzing how human experts tend to structure proofs and how proofs can be structured by automated methods. We pursue this approach by (1) combining proof structuring and grammar-based tree compression, where we show how they are inherently related, and (2) exploring ways to combine human and automated proof structuring. Our source of human-structured proofs is Metamath, which, based condensed detachment, naturally provides a view of proofs as terms. A knowledge base is then just a grammar that compresses a set of gigantic proof trees. We present a formal account of this view, an implemented practical toolkit as well as experimental results.</description>

      <title>The Modal Cube Revisited: Semantics without Worlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a non-deterministic semantic framework for all modal logics in the modal cube, extending prior works by Kearns and others. Our approach introduces modular and uniform multi-valued non-deterministic matrices (Nmatrices) for each logic, where necessitation is captured by the systematic use of level valuations. The semantics is grounded in an eight-valued system and provides a sound and complete decision procedure for each modal logic, extending and refining earlier semantics as particular cases. Additionally, we propose a novel model-theoretic perspective that links our framework to relational (Kripke-style) semantics, addressing longstanding conjectures regarding the correspondence between modal axioms and semantic conditions within non-deterministic settings. The result is a philosophically robust and technically modular alternative to standard possible-world semantics.</description>

      <title>Geometric Formalization of First-Order Stochastic Dominance in $N$ Dimensions: A Tractable Path to Multi-Dimensional Economic Decision Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces and formally verifies a novel geometric framework for first-order stochastic dominance (FSD) in $N$ dimensions using the Lean 4 theorem prover. Traditional analytical approaches to multi-dimensional stochastic dominance rely heavily on complex measure theory and multivariate calculus, creating significant barriers to formalization in proof assistants. Our geometric approach characterizes $N$-dimensional FSD through direct comparison of survival probabilities in upper-right orthants, bypassing the need for complex integration theory. We formalize key definitions and prove the equivalence between traditional FSD requirements and our geometric characterization. This approach achieves a more tractable and intuitive path to formal verification while maintaining mathematical rigor. We demonstrate how this framework directly enables formal analysis of multi-dimensional economic problems in portfolio selection, risk management, and welfare analysis. The work establishes a foundation for further development of verified decision-making tools in economics and finance, particularly for high-stakes domains requiring rigorous guarantees.</description>

      <title>Interpolation for the two-way modal mu-calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two-way modal mu-calculus is the extension of the (standard) one-way mu-calculus with converse (backward-looking) modalities. For this logic we introduce two new sequent-style proof calculi: a non-wellfounded system admitting infinite branches and a finitary, cyclic version of this that employs annotations. As is common in sequent systems for two-way modal logics, our calculi feature an analytic cut rule. What distinguishes our approach is the use of so-called trace atoms, which serve to apply Vardi's two-way automata in a proof-theoretic setting. We prove soundness and completeness for both systems and subsequently use the cyclic calculus to show that the two-way mu-calculus has the (local) Craig interpolation property, with respect to both propositions and modalities. Our proof uses a version of Maehara's method adapted to cyclic proof systems. As a corollary we prove that the two-way mu-calculus also enjoys Beth's definability property.</description>

      <title>A Non-Interventionist Approach to Causal Reasoning based on Lewisian Counterfactuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12972v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a computationally grounded semantics for counterfactual conditionals in which i) the state in a model is decomposed into two elements: a propositional valuation and a causal base in propositional form that represents the causal information available at the state; and ii) the comparative similarity relation between states is computed from the states' two components. We show that, by means of our semantics, we can elegantly formalize the notion of actual cause without recurring to the primitive notion of intervention. Furthermore, we provide a succinct formulation of the model checking problem for a language of counterfactual conditionals in our semantics. We show that this problem is PSPACE-complete and provide a reduction of it into QBF that can be used for automatic verification of causal properties.</description>

      <title>Domains and Classifying Topoi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a new connection between synthetic domain theory and Grothendieck topoi related to the distributive lattice classifier. In particular, all the axioms of synthetic domain theory (including the inductive fixed point object and the chain completeness of the dominance) emanate from a countable version of the synthetic quasi-coherence principle that has emerged as a central feature in the unification of synthetic algebraic geometry, synthetic Stone duality, and synthetic category theory. The duality between quasi-coherent algebras and affine spaces in a topos with a distributive lattice object provides a new set of techniques for reasoning synthetically about domain-like structures, and reveals a broad class of (higher) sheaf models for synthetic domain theory.</description>

      <title>Information Science Principles of Machine Learning: A Causal Chain Meta-Framework Based on Formalized Information Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: [Objective] This study focuses on addressing the current lack of a unified formal theoretical framework in machine learning, as well as the deficiencies in interpretability and ethical safety assurance. [Methods] A formal information model is first constructed, utilizing sets of well-formed formulas to explicitly define the ontological states and carrier mappings of typical components in machine learning. Learnable and processable predicates, along with learning and processing functions, are introduced to analyze the logical deduction and constraint rules of the causal chains within models. [Results] A meta-framework for machine learning theory (MLT-MF) is established. Based on this framework, universal definitions for model interpretability and ethical safety are proposed. Furthermore, three key theorems are proved: the equivalence of model interpretability and information recoverability, the assurance of ethical safety, and the estimation of generalization error. [Limitations] The current framework assumes ideal conditions with noiseless information-enabling mappings and primarily targets model learning and processing logic in static scenarios. It does not yet address information fusion and conflict resolution across ontological spaces in multimodal or multi-agent systems. [Conclusions] This work overcomes the limitations of fragmented research and provides a unified theoretical foundation for systematically addressing the critical challenges currently faced in machine learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the logic IBV, which is an intuitionistic version of BV, in the sense that its restriction to the MLL connectives is exactly IMLL, the intuitionistic version of MLL. For this logic we give a deep inference proof system and show cut elimination. We also show that the logic obtained from IBV by dropping the associativity of the new non-commutative seq-connective is an intuitionistic variant of the recently introduced logic NML. For this logic, called INML, we give a cut-free sequent calculus.</description>

      <title>The Logical Expressiveness of Temporal GNNs via Two-Dimensional Product Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the expressive power of various neural architectures -- including graph neural networks (GNNs), transformers, and recurrent neural networks -- has been characterised using tools from logic and formal language theory. As the capabilities of basic architectures are becoming well understood, increasing attention is turning to models that combine multiple architectural paradigms. Among them particularly important, and challenging to analyse, are temporal extensions of GNNs, which integrate both spatial (graph-structure) and temporal (evolution over time) dimensions. In this paper, we initiate the study of logical characterisation of temporal GNNs by connecting them to two-dimensional product logics. We show that the expressive power of temporal GNNs depends on how graph and temporal components are combined. In particular, temporal GNNs that apply static GNNs recursively over time can capture all properties definable in the product logic of (past) propositional temporal logic PTL and the modal logic K. In contrast, architectures such as graph-and-time TGNNs and global TGNNs can only express restricted fragments of this logic, where the interaction between temporal and spatial operators is syntactically constrained. These results yield the first logical characterisations of temporal GNNs and establish new relative expressiveness results for temporal GNNs.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Sets for Proving Bounds on Rado Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a linear equation $\cal E$ of the form $ax + by = cz$ where $a$, $b$, $c$ are positive integers, the $k$-colour Rado number $R_k({\cal E})$ is the smallest positive integer $n$, if it exists, such that every $k$-colouring of the positive integers $\{1, 2, \dotsc, n\}$ contains a monochromatic solution to $\cal E$. In this paper, we consider $k = 3$ and the linear equations $ax + by = bz$ and $ax + ay = bz$. Using SAT solvers, we compute a number of previously unknown Rado numbers corresponding to these equations. We prove new general bounds on Rado numbers inspired by the satisfying assignments discovered by the SAT solver. Our proofs require extensive case-based analyses that are difficult to check for correctness by hand, so we automate checking the correctness of our proofs via an approach which makes use of a new tool we developed with support for operations on symbolically-defined sets -- e.g., unions or intersections of sets of the form $\{f(1), f(2), \dotsc, f(a)\}$ where $a$ is a symbolic variable and $f$ is a function possibly dependent on $a$. No computer algebra system that we are aware of currently has sufficiently capable support for symbolic sets, leading us to develop a tool supporting symbolic sets using the Python symbolic computation library SymPy coupled with the Satisfiability Modulo Theories solver Z3.</description>

      <title>Fully Geometric Multi-Hop Reasoning on Knowledge Graphs with Transitive Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geometric embedding methods have shown to be useful for multi-hop reasoning on knowledge graphs by mapping entities and logical operations to geometric regions and geometric transformations, respectively. Geometric embeddings provide direct interpretability framework for queries. However, current methods have only leveraged the geometric construction of entities, failing to map logical operations to geometric transformations and, instead, using neural components to learn these operations. We introduce GeometrE, a geometric embedding method for multi-hop reasoning, which does not require learning the logical operations and enables full geometric interpretability. Additionally, unlike previous methods, we introduce a transitive loss function and show that it can preserve the logical rule $\forall a,b,c: r(a,b) \land r(b,c) \to r(a,c)$. Our experiments show that GeometrE outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmark datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05229v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the extent to which branching-time properties can be adequately verified using runtime monitors. We depart from the classical setup where monitoring is limited to a single system execution and investigate the enhanced observational capabilities when monitoring a system over multiple runs. To ensure generality in our results, we focus on branching-time properties expressed in the modal mu-calculus, a well-studied foundational logic that is used by state-of-the-art model checkers. Our results show that the proposed setup can systematically extend previously established monitorability limits for branching-time properties. We then validate our results by instantiating them to verify actor-based systems. We also prove bounds that capture the correspondence between the syntactic structure of a property and the number of required system runs.</description>

      <title>A Categorical Treatment of Open Linear Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03934v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An open stochastic system \`a la Jan Willems is a system affected by two qualitatively different kinds of uncertainty: one is probabilistic fluctuation, and the other one is nondeterminism caused by a fundamental lack of information. We present a formalization of open stochastic systems in the language of category theory. Central to this is the notion of copartiality which models how the lack of information propagates through a system (corresponding to the coarseness of sigma-algebras in Willems' work). As a concrete example, we study extended Gaussian distributions, which combine Gaussian probability with nondeterminism and correspond precisely to Willems' notion of Gaussian linear systems. We describe them both as measure-theoretic and abstract categorical entities, which enables us to rigorously describe a variety of phenomena like noisy physical laws and uninformative priors in Bayesian statistics. The category of extended Gaussian maps can be seen as a mutual generalization of Gaussian probability and linear relations, which connects the literature on categorical probability with ideas from control theory like signal-flow diagrams.</description>

      <title>Ordinal Exponentiation in Homotopy Type Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14542v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present two seemingly different definitions of constructive ordinal exponentiation, where an ordinal is taken to be a transitive, extensional, and wellfounded order on a set. The first definition is abstract, uses suprema of ordinals, and is solely motivated by the expected equations. The second is more concrete, based on decreasing lists, and can be seen as a constructive version of a classical construction by Sierpi{\'n}ski based on functions with finite support. We show that our two approaches are equivalent (whenever it makes sense to ask the question), and use this equivalence to prove algebraic laws and decidability properties of the exponential. Our work takes place in the framework of homotopy type theory, and all results are formalized in the proof assistant Agda.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Partial-Assignment Enumeration in Optimization Modulo Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimization Modulo Theories (OMT) extends Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) with the task of optimizing some objective function(s). In OMT solvers, a CDCL-based SMT solver enumerates theory-satisfiable total truth assignments, and a theory-specific procedure finds an optimum model for each of them; the current optimum is then used to tighten the search space for the next assignments, until no better solution is found.
  In this paper, we analyze the role of truth-assignment enumeration in OMT. First, we spotlight that the enumeration of total truth assignments is suboptimal, since they may over-restrict the search space for the optimization procedure, whereas using partial truth assignments instead can improve the effectiveness of the optimization. Second, we propose some assignment-reduction techniques for exploiting partial-assignment enumeration within the OMT context. We implemented these techniques in the OptiMathSAT solver, and conducted an experimental evaluation on OMT benchmarks. The results confirm the improvement in both the efficiency of optimal solving and the quality of the obtained solutions for anytime solving.</description>

      <title>Finitely Presentable Higher-Dimensional Automata and the Irrationality of Process Replication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Higher-dimensional automata (HDA) are a formalism to faithfully model the behaviour of concurrent systems. For ordinary automata, there is a correspondence between regular expressions, regular languages and finite automata, which provides a powerful link between algebraic proofs and operational behaviour. It has been shown by Fahrenberg et al. that finite HDA correspond with interfaced interval pomset languages generated by sequential and parallel composition and non-empty iteration, and thereby to a variant of Kleene algebras (KA) with parallel composition. It is known that this correspondence cannot be extended to concurrent KA, which additionally have process replication. An alternative to finite HDA are locally finite HDA, in which every state can only reach finitely many other states, and finitely branching HDA. In this paper, we show that both classes of HDA are closed under process replication and thus models of concurrent KA. To achieve this, we prove that the category of HDA is locally finitely presentable, where the finite HDA generate all other HDA. We then prove that this has the unfortunate side-effect that all HDA are locally finite, which means that the correspondence with concurrent KA trivialises. Similarly, we also show that, even though finitely branching HDA are closed under process replication, the resulting HDA necessarily have infinitely many initial states.</description>

      <title>Reachability and Related Problems in Vector Addition Systems with Nested Zero Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vector addition systems with states (VASS), also known as Petri nets, are a popular model of concurrent systems. Many problems from many areas reduce to the reachability problem for VASS, which consists of deciding whether a target configuration of a VASS is reachable from a given initial configuration. In this paper, we obtain an Ackermannian (primitive-recursive in fixed dimension) upper bound for the reachability problem in VASS with nested zero tests. Furthermore, we provide a uniform approach which also allows to decide most related problems, for example semilinearity and separability, in the same complexity. For some of these problems like semilinearity the complexity was unknown even for plain VASS.</description>

      <title>Most General Explanations of Tree Ensembles (Extended Version)</title>

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is critical for attaining trust in the operation of AI systems. A key question of an AI system is ``why was this decision made this way''. Formal approaches to XAI use a formal model of the AI system to identify abductive explanations. While abductive explanations may be applicable to a large number of inputs sharing the same concrete values, more general explanations may be preferred for numeric inputs. So-called inflated abductive explanations give intervals for each feature ensuring that any input whose values fall withing these intervals is still guaranteed to make the same prediction. Inflated explanations cover a larger portion of the input space, and hence are deemed more general explanations. But there can be many (inflated) abductive explanations for an instance. Which is the best? In this paper, we show how to find a most general abductive explanation for an AI decision. This explanation covers as much of the input space as possible, while still being a correct formal explanation of the model's behaviour. Given that we only want to give a human one explanation for a decision, the most general explanation gives us the explanation with the broadest applicability, and hence the one most likely to seem sensible. (The paper has been accepted at IJCAI2025 conference.)</description>
