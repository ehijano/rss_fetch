      <title>Upstream Laser-based Longitudinal Enhancement of Relativistic Photoelectrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling the longitudinal phase space of high-brightness relativistic electron beams is crucial for advancing a broad spectrum of charged-particle-based instrumentation and scientific frontiers. A generalized method for achieving this control involves manipulating the photoemission laser's temporal distribution at the picosecond level, a long-standing technical challenge. Recent developments in laser shaping have enabled the creation of high-power, picosecond-scale symmetrical and asymmetrical temporal profiles, capable of fine-tuning complex space-charge dynamics and external field effects in relativistic charged-particle beams. Here, we demonstrate that rather than deviations from theorized, idealized laser distributions, a controlled asymmetry can be harnessed to counteract accelerator-induced distortions. By implementing spatiotemporal shaping of the ultraviolet photocathode laser at the LCLS-II superconducting injector, we achieve deterministic control over the longitudinal phase space without downstream corrections. We find that this optical asymmetry induces a self-linearizing effect across both low (40 pC) and high (80 pC) charge regimes, effectively suppressing nonlinear compression and energy chirp. Consequently, this approach is expected to preserve a low emittance comparable to that of ideal flattop or regular Gaussian profiles, while delivering superior current uniformity and shot-to-shot stability. These results establish spatiotemporal laser shaping as a compact, generalizable tool for directly optimizing beam brightness at the source.</description>

      <title>First Thin-Film Lithium Tantalate Polarization Controller Enabling Reset-Free Mrad/s Tracking for Optical Interconnects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid escalation of computing power driven by large-scale artificial intelligence is placing unprecedented demands on the bandwidth, latency, and energy efficiency of data-center interconnects (DCIs). Self-homodyne coherent (SHC) transmission is a promising architecture because it preserves the spectral efficiency of coherent detection while greatly simplifying digital signal processing, but its practical deployment is critically limited by random and often ultrafast state-of-polarization (SOP) fluctuations that induce carrier fading and destabilize coherent reception. Here we report the first integrated polarization controller based on thin-film lithium tantalate (TFLT), enabling reset-free polarization tracking at Mrad/s speeds. The four-stage electro-optic device exhibits polarization-dependent loss (PDL) below 0.3 dB, a half-wave voltage below 2.5 V, high modulation bandwidth, and negligible DC drift. To accommodate the finite tuning range of integrated phase shifters, we develop a finite-boundary gradient-descent (FBGD) control algorithm that ensures reset-free SOP evolution with no phase jump. The implemented adaptive polarization controller (APC) is validated through both standalone polarization-tracking measurements and a dual-polarization 16-QAM SHC 400-Gbps transmission system. Transient polarization disturbances can be tracked at speeds up to 2 Mrad/s, while stable reset-free operation under continuous polarization disturbances is maintained up to 1 Mrad/s. This reset-free performance represents more than doubling the state of the art, while the pre-FEC bit-error rates remain below the HD-FEC threshold under realistic DCI conditions and lightning-scale polarization disturbances. These results establish TFLT as a new platform for ultrafast, low-power, reset-free, and drift-free polarization control in coherent optical interconnects and beyond.</description>

      <title>Radiation processes in dielectric cylindrical waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dielectric cylindrical waveguides are widely used for confining and guiding of electromagnetic waves in relatively wide range of frequencies. They have found numerous technological and scientific applications in telecommunications, medicine, material science, photonics and quantum optics. The electromagnetic field Green function is the central object in investigations of different types of radiation processes in those structures. In this paper, we review and further develop the recurrence procedure for evaluating the electromagnetic field Green function in a medium made of any number of homogeneous cylindrical layers. The general results are specified for a cylindrical waveguide immersed in a homogeneous medium. Expressions are provided for all the components of the Green tensor in both regions inside and outside the cylinder. As an application of the results for the Green function, we consider the radiation of a charged particle rotating around a dielectric cylinder. The intensities for all types of radiation processes are discussed. They include the synchrotron-Cherenkov radiation at large distances from the cylinder and the radiation on guided and surface polaritonic modes confined inside or near the surface of the cylinder. The paper provides explicit formulas for the electromagnetic fields and the spectral-angular densities of those radiations. It also includes a numerical and comparative analysis.</description>

      <title>DNA-Origami-Assembled Rhodium Nanoantennas for Deep-UV Label-Free Single-Protein Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoparticles of plasmonic metals have significantly to the development of spectroscopic techniques, enabling strong confinement of electromagnetic fields at the nanoscale and corresponding signal amplification. However, to date, plasmonic applications have been limited mainly to the visible and near-infrared range, as materials supporting ultraviolet resonances typically exhibit poor chemical stability and lack robust surface functionalisation methods. In this work, we address these limitations by introducing a fully programmable approach to UV plasmonics based on rhodium nanocube dimers assembled using DNA origami templates. We have developed a reliable ligand exchange strategy that allows the functionalisation of rhodium nanocubes with DNA while maintaining their colloidal stability. These DNA-modified nanocubes act as modular building blocks that can be assembled into dimers with 69% efficiency and an average gap size of 10 nm. The DNA origami design also allows for the deterministic placement of a single streptavidin protein in the plasmonic gap, unlike previous methods based on stochastic diffusion. Experiments with single-molecule autofluorescence in UV, supported by numerical simulations, show an increase in brightness of up to 22, a reduction in fluorescence lifetime, and a more than tenfold increase in the total number of detected photons. By creating a robust and versatile platform for the production of UV-resonant plasmonic nanoantennas, this work extends the functionality of plasmonics to the deep UV spectrum and opens up new possibilities for labelling-free single-protein spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Tamm Plasmon Resonance Responsiveness to SARS-CoV-2 Virus-Like Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bioresponsive optical materials that transduce nanoscale biointerface events into measurable spectral signals are of growing interest for sensing and antiviral technologies Here we show that a Tamm plasmon TP device consisting of a SiOTiO distributed Bragg reflector capped with a nanostructured silver layer exhibits a selective and structure dependent response to SARSCoV2 virus like particles VLPs Upon VLP exposure the conventional wavelength shift delta lambda of the TP resonance is minimal whereas the resonance depth undergoes a systematic attenuation To capture both spectral and amplitude variations we introduce a displacement angle alpha defined from the translation vector of the Tamm dip before and after exposure The angle alpha increases monotonically with VLP concentration and enables a limit of detection of 13 ng per mL Control experiments with polystyrene nanoparticles of similar size and with heat denatured VLPs yield negligible changes indicating sensitivity to the native conformational state of viral surface proteins rather than to generic nanoparticle morphology or bulk refractive index effects These results establish Tamm plasmon structures as promising bioresponsive platforms for label free detection and for probing structure dependent virus material interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals materials are offering intriguing opportunities as building blocks for advanced quantum information technologies and integrated quantum photonic systems. Critical to their development, is robust and high quality light-matter interactions which can be delivered through the fabrication of optical resonators. Here we demonstrate a robust fabrication of one dimensional photonic crystal cavities (1D PCC) and microdisk resonators from hexagonal boron nitride, exhibiting Quality factors of ~ 4300 and ~ 8300, respectively. With these two classes of devices we demonstrated cavity mode tuning via atomic layer deposition and gas condensation. Cavity resonances were shifted by and ~9 nm for the 1D PCCs and ~16 nm in the microdisk resonators, respectively. Our work opening a promising pathway for a realisation emitter cavity coupling in hBN and eventually to a fully integrated quantum photonic circuitry with hBN.</description>

      <title>Deterministic integration of quantum emitters and optical cavities in a van der Waals crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-photon emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) combine bright optical emission with optically addressable spin states, offering a promising platform for integrated quantum photonics. However, their stochastic creation and spectral variability have prevented deterministic integration with photonic cavities. Here we demonstrate a fabrication protocol that enables precise, deterministic coupling of pre-selected visible emitters to circular Bragg grating (CBG) cavities in hBN. By patterning etched alignment markers and performing prefabrication confocal mapping, we locate emitters with sub-micron accuracy and design cavity geometries matched to their zero-phonon line wavelengths. The resulting devices show enhanced emission and reliable spectral alignment between emitter and cavity mode. This work establishes a deterministic cavity-emitter integration scheme in a van der Waals material and provides a scalable route towards on-chip quantum photonic and spin-based platforms using hBN.</description>

      <title>DeepBessel: deep learning-based full-field vibration profilometry using single-shot time-averaged interference microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full-field vibration profilometry is essential for dynamic characterizing microelectromechanical systems (MEMS/MOEMS). Time-averaged interferometry (TAI) encodes spatial information about MEMS or MOEMS vibration amplitude in the interferogram's amplitude modulation using Bessel function (besselogram). Classical approaches for interferogram analysis are specialized for cosine function fringe patterns and therefore introduce reconstruction errors for besselogram decoding. This paper presents the DeepBessel: a deep learning-based approach for single-shot TAI interferogram analysis. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained using synthetic data, where the input consisted of besselograms, and the output corresponded to the underlying vibration amplitude distribution. Numerical validation and experimental testing demonstrated that DeepBessel significantly reduces reconstruction errors compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, e.g., Hilbert Spiral Transform (HST) method. The proposed network effectively mitigates errors caused by the mismatch between the Bessel and cosine functions. The results indicate that deep learning can improve the accuracy of full-field vibration measurements, offering new possibilities for optical metrology in MEMS or MOEMS applications.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Pascal's triangle in cascaded polarization optics: an intuitive framework for field transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nature is imbued with mathematics, manifested through its stunning patterns, symmetries, and structures. Here, we unveil that in a multilayered framework of twisted birefringent optical components, a recursive number pattern of Pascal's triangle is naturally embedded in the structure of the Jones matrix which intuitively provide a generalized solution for pixel-to-pixel field transformation. The resulting standalone solution is universal across the electromagnetic spectrum, unifies N-layered metasurface and conventional bulk waveplates in a single framework, offers comprehensive insights about the bidirectional complex amplitude modulation and wavefront engineering in linear and circular polarization bases, and at the same time substantially reduces the computational cost. In essence, the discovery of number patterns in polarization optics/photonics will have broad impact across quantum optics, theory informed artificial intelligence model trainings, biomedical engineering and imaging, polarization information encryption, and advanced sensing applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of plasmonics and related applications in the terahertz range faces limitations due to the intrinsic high electron density of standard metals. All-dielectric systems are profitable alternatives, which allows for customized modulation of the optical response upon doping. Here we focus on plasmon-based hyperbolic metamaterials realized stacking doped III-V semiconductors that have been shown to be optically active in the terahertz spectral region. By using a multi-physics multi-scale theoretical approach, we unravel the role of doping and geometrical characteristics (e.g., thickness, composition, grating) in the modulation of high-k plasmon-polariton modes across the metamaterial.</description>

      <title>Visible octave frequency combs in silicon nitride nanophotonic waveguides driven by Ti:sapphire lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear nanophotonic waveguides have opened a route to compact frequency combs for precision metrology, spectroscopy and astronomy, yet broadband comb access to the visible remains challenging on CMOS-compatible platforms. Silicon nitride is widely accessible and low loss into the visible, but most demonstrations rely on telecom pumping and thick stress-managed films, where the large spectral gap to the visible dispersive wave raises the soliton order and power required for efficient conversion. Here we show that pumping closer to the visible provides a complementary route. Starting from crack-free 400 nm SiN films, we implement dispersion-engineering with air-clad nanophotonic waveguides whose enhanced geometric dispersion opens an anomalous-dispersion window across the Ti-sapphire tuning range. Femtosecond Ti-sapphire pulses then drive octave-spanning combs from the visible to the near-infrared, with the visible edge and overall bandwidth lithographically tuned by the waveguide width at pulse energies of only tens of picojoules. The air-clad geometry also produces strong polarization-dependent dispersion, enabling switching between all-normal and soliton-dominated broadening in the same device, and support octave-spanning combs at 1 GHz repetition rates directly driven by a compact diode-pumped Ti-sapphire oscillator. These results position air-clad SiN nanophotonic waveguides as an efficient interface between emerging short-wavelength integrated gain platforms and fully integrated visible frequency-comb engines.</description>

      <title>Backscatter Communication Through Disordered Media Enabled by a Programmable Leaky Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieving information through disordered scattering systems remains a major challenge in wireless communication and sensing due to the severe distortion and attenuation caused by multiple scattering. Here, we demonstrate robust focusing through random media using a leaky cavity made programmable by reconfigurable metasurfaces. We show that the leaky cavity leverages backscattering from the disordered medium to enhance the degree of control over the transmitted field. We achieve an enhancement in focused intensity by an order of magnitude compared to a horn antenna. We further demonstrate robust communication through the medium using low-power amplitude-modulated signals, and finally implement a backscatter communication scheme in which the same cavity illuminates and decodes data from a passive reflectivity-modulating target embedded within the disorder. Our results open new possibilities for reliable communication and sensing in complex environments.</description>

      <title>Towards Real-world Lens Active Alignment with Unlabeled Data via Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active Alignment (AA) is a key technology for the large-scale automated assembly of high-precision optical systems. Compared with labor-intensive per-model on-device calibration, a digital-twin pipeline built on optical simulation offers a substantial advantage in generating large-scale labeled data. However, complex imaging conditions induce a domain gap between simulation and real-world images, limiting the generalization of simulation-trained models. To address this, we propose augmenting a simulation baseline with minimal unlabeled real-world images captured at random misalignment positions, mitigating the gap from a domain adaptation perspective. We introduce Domain Adaptive Active Alignment (DA3), which utilizes an autoregressive domain transformation generator and an adversarial-based feature alignment strategy to distill real-world domain information via self-supervised learning. This enables the extraction of domain-invariant image degradation features to facilitate robust misalignment prediction. Experiments on two lens types reveal that DA3 improves accuracy by 46% over a purely simulation pipeline. Notably, it approaches the performance achieved with precisely labeled real-world data collected on 3 lens samples, while reducing on-device data collection time by 98.7%. The results demonstrate that domain adaptation effectively endows simulation-trained models with robust real-world performance, validating the digital-twin pipeline as a practical solution to significantly enhance the efficiency of large-scale optical assembly.</description>

      <title>Polarization rotation through differential transmission in refractive CMB telescopes identified using a hybrid physical optics method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify a polarization rotation systematic in the far field beams of refractive cosmic microwave background (CMB) telescopes caused by differential transmission in anti-reflection (AR) coatings of optical elements. This systematic was identified following the development of a hybrid physical optics method that incorporates full-wave electromagnetic simulations of AR coatings to model the full polarization response of refractive systems. Applying this method to a two-lens CMB telescope with non-ideal AR coating, we show that polarization-dependent transmission can produce a rotation of the far-field polarization angle that varies across the focal plane with a typical amplitude of 0.05-0.5 degrees. If ignored in analysis, this effect can produce temperature to polarization leakage and Stokes Q/U mixing.</description>

      <title>A laser plasma soliton fusion scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel fusion scheme enabled by laser-plasma solitons, which promises to overcome several fundamental obstructions to reaching the breakeven condition. For concreteness, we invoke deuterium-tritium (DT) as fuels. The intense electromagnetic field trapped inside the soliton significantly enhances the DT-fusion cross section, its ponderomotive potential evacuates electrons, and it accelerates D/T to kinetic energies suitable for fusion reaction. While electrons are expelled almost instantly, the much heavier D/T moves at picosecond time scale. Such a difference in time scales renders a time window for DT fusion to occur efficiently in an electron-free environment. We inject two consecutive lasers, where the first would excite plasma solitons and the second, much more intense and with a matched lower frequency, would fortify the soliton electromagnetic field resonantly. We impose a plasma density gradient to induce soliton motion. All D/T inside the plasma column swept by the moving soliton during its lifetime would participate in this fusion mechanism. We show that the breakeven condition is attainable. Invoking fiber laser and the iCAN laser technologies for high repetition rate and high intensity operation, gigawatt output maybe conceivable.</description>

      <title>Cavity-Driven Multispectral Gain for High-Sensitivity NV Center Magnetometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a cavity-enabled solid-state magnetometer based on an NV ensemble coupled with a dielectric cavity, achieving 12 pT/$\sqrt{\rm{Hz}}$ sensitivity and a nearly threefold gain from multispectral features. The features originate from cavity-induced splitting of the NV hyperfine levels and leverages robust quantum coherence in the doubly dressed states of the system to achieve high sensitivity. We project simulated near-term sensitivities approaching 100 fT/$\sqrt{\rm{Hz}}$, close to the Johnson-Nyquist limit. Our results establish frequency multiplexing as a new operational paradigm, offering a robust and scalable quantum resource for metrology under ambient conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magneto-optical properties of a Zn$_{0.99}$Mn$_{0.01}$Se/Be$_{0.93}$Mn$_{0.07} $Te diluted magnetic semiconductor heterostructure with type-II band alignment are investigated at cryogenic temperatures down to 16 mK. The temperature of the Mn spin system, which at the lowest possible laser power reaches 270 mK, is evaluated from the giant Zeeman splitting of the direct exciton in the Zn$_{0.99}$Mn$_{0.01}$Se layers subject to an external magnetic field. The degree of circular polarization of the direct and indirect optical transitions, induced by the magnetic field, is a sensitive indicator for the laser heating of the Mn spin system. Evidence of spin glass formation in the Mn spin system of the Be$_{0.93}$Mn$_{0.07}$Te layers with the critical temperature of $T_{SG}=400$ mK is found.</description>

      <title>Below-shot-noise capacity in phase estimation using nonlinear interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, several schemes for imaging and sensing based on nonlinear interferometers have been proposed and demonstrated experimentally. These interferometers exhibit two main advantages. First, they enable probing a sample at a chosen wavelength while detecting light at a different wavelength with high efficiency (bicolor quantum imaging and sensing with undetected light). Second, they can show quantum-enhanced sensitivities below the shot-noise limit, potentially reaching Heisenberg-limited precision in parameter estimation. Here, we compare three quantum-imaging configurations using only easily accessible intensity-based measurements for phase estimation: a Yurke-type SU(1,1) interferometer, a Mandel-type induced-coherence interferometer, and a hybrid scheme that continuously interpolates between them. While an ideal Yurke interferometer can exhibit Heisenberg scaling, this advantage is known to be fragile under realistic detection constraints and in the presence of loss. We demonstrate that differential intensity detection in the Mandel interferometer provides the highest and most robust phase sensitivity among the considered schemes, reaching but not surpassing the shot-noise limit, even in the presence of loss. Intensity measurements in a Yurke-type configuration can achieve genuine sub-shot-noise sensitivity under balanced losses and moderate gain; however, their performance degrades in realistic high-gain regimes. Consequently, in this regime, the Mandel configuration with differential detection outperforms the Yurke-type setup and constitutes the most robust approach for phase estimation.</description>

Abstract: We explore a magnetooptomechanical system consisting of a single magnetic microparticle optically levitated within the core of a helically twisted single-ring hollow-core photonic crystal fibre. We use newly-developed magnetic particles that have a core of antiferromagnetic yttrium-ortho-ferrite (YFeO3) and a shell of ferrimagnetic YIG (Y3Fe5O12) approximately 50 nm thick. Using a 632.8 nm probe beam, we observe optical-torque-induced rotation of the particle and rotation of the magnetization vector in presence of an external static magnetic field. This one-of-a-kind platform opens a path to novel investigations of optomagnetic physics with levitated magnetic particles.</description>

Abstract: A phase-only spatial light modulator (SLM) provides a powerful way to shape laser beams into arbitrary intensity patterns, but at the cost of a hard computational problem of determining an appropriate SLM phase. Here we show that optimal transport methods can generate approximate solutions to this problem that serve as excellent initializations for iterative phase retrieval algorithms, yielding vortex-free solutions with superior accuracy and efficiency. Additionally, we show that analogous algorithms can be used to measure the intensity and phase of the input beam incident upon the SLM via phase diversity imaging. These techniques furnish flexible and convenient solutions to the computational challenges of beam shaping with an SLM.</description>

      <title>Topological Quenching of Noise in a Free-Running Moebius Microcomb</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microcombs require ultralow-noise repetition rates to enable next-generation applications in metrology, high-speed communications, microwave photonics, and sensing, where spectral purity is a central performance metric. Best-performing sources operate actively locked at "quiet points" in parameter space, fixed by device and material properties. Creating broad, low-noise operating regions with relaxed constraints-especially in simplified free-running architectures that avoid electronics-heavy control-remains an open challenge. Here, we demonstrate a symmetry-protected topological M\"obius soliton molecule that enables intrinsically low phase noise in a fully free-running microcomb, operating without any external referencing or control. Using a microresonator-filtered laser, we implement a M\"obius geometry via interleaved microcavity modes. Upon the formation of a topological M\"obius soliton molecule, the free-running laser exhibits over 15 dB of phase-noise suppression across 10 Hz-10 kHz at a 100 GHz repetition rate, yielding -63 dBc/Hz phase noise at 1 kHz and an Allan deviation of 4x10^-10 at 10 s average time-without any external control. We show that the M\"obius structure brings dynamic robustness to the comb, and we demonstrate a symmetry-protected topological regime that enables long-term drift-invariant operation. Our results establish a route to intrinsically noise-quenched microcombs operating in a fully free-running configuration, governed by internal physical principles and suitable for field-deployable, low-noise photonic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electromagnetic waves propagating through vacuum can polarize virtual electron-positron pairs; this polarization, in turn, nonlinearly modifies their propagation. A semi-classical nonlinear wave equation describing the propagation is derived from the Euler--Heisenberg Lagrangian density, which captures vacuum polarization effects up to the one-loop level. Here, we present a reduced-action-integral approach that enables rapid modeling of nonlinear phenomena arising from the Euler--Heisenberg Lagrangian. Application of the variational principle to the reduced action provides equations of motion for familiar light-pulse parameters, such as spot size, phase, polarization, and phase-front curvature, without requiring full-field simulations. Three examples demonstrate the utility of the approach: phase modulation, birefringence, and frequency mixing.</description>

Extending this to 3D anisotropic scattering requires a BTF that, as Monte Carlo reveals, follows a Cauchy kernel:</description>

      <title>Thermally adaptive textile inspired by morpho butterfly for all-season comfort and visible aesthetics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A longstanding challenge in personal thermal management has been transitioning from static, appearance-limited passive radiative cooling (PDRC) materials to systems that are both dynamically adaptive and visually versatile. The central hurdle remains the inherent compromise between color saturation and cooling power. Inspired by organisms such as butterflies, which decouple structural color from thermal function, we present a smart textile that seamlessly merges a dynamic thermochromic layer with static photonic crystals (PCs). This design enables the solar reflectance to be autonomously switched-from approximately 0.6 in the colored state for heating to about 0.9 in the high-reflectance state for cooling. Consequently, outdoor experiments validated substantial temperature regulation: the fabric achieves a surface temperature reduction of 3-4 {\deg}C in summer and a heating difference of &lt;1 {\deg}C in winter compared to commercial reference materials, all while maintaining high-saturation colors. This dual-mode operation offers a viable pathway for achieving adaptive, aesthetic, and energy-free thermal comfort.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03187v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent experimental realization of the half-quantized Hall effect phase in a three-dimensional (3D) semi-magnetic topological insulator [M. Mogi et al., Nature Physics 18, 390 (2022)], we propose a scheme for realizing the half-quantized Hall effect and axion insulator in experimentally mature 3D topological insulator heterostructures. Our approach involves optically pumping and/or magnetically doping the topological insulator surface, such as to break time reversal and gap out the Dirac cones. By toggling between left and right circularly polarized optical pumping, the sign of the half-integer Hall conductance from each of the surface Dirac cones can be controlled, such as to yield half-quantized ($0+1/2$), axion ($-1/2+1/2=0$), and Chern ($1/2+1/2=1$) insulator phases. We substantiate our results based on detailed band structure and Berry curvature numerics on the Floquet Hamiltonian in the high-frequency limit. Our paper showcases how topological phases can be obtained through mature experimental approaches such as magnetic layer doping and circularly polarized laser pumping and opens up potential device applications such as a polarization chirality-controlled topological transistor.</description>

      <title>Dynamically tuneable helicity in twisted electromagnetic resonators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the generation of helical electromagnetic radiation in a microwave cavity resonator, achieved by introducing mirror asymmetry, i.e., chirality, through a controlled geometric twist of the conducting boundary conditions. The emergence of electromagnetic helicity is attributed to a nonzero spatial overlap between the electric and magnetic mode eigenvectors, quantified by $\text{Im}\left[\vec{\mathbf{E}}_i(\vec{r})\cdot{\vec{\mathbf{H}}}_i^*(\vec{r})\right]$, a feature not observed in conventional cavity resonators. This phenomenon originates from magnetoelectric coupling between nearly degenerate transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) modes, resulting in a measurable frequency shift of the resonant modes as a function of the twist angle, $\phi$. In addition to the bulk helicity induced by global geometric twist, internal helical corrugations break structural symmetry on the surface, introducing an effective surface chirality $\kappa_{\text{eff}}$, which perturbs the resonant conditions and contributes to asymmetric frequency tuning. By dynamically varying $\phi$, we demonstrate real-time, macroscopic manipulation of both electromagnetic helicity and resonant frequency. Furthermore, we investigate the underlying mode-coupling dynamics of the system, highlighting strong photon-photon interactions.</description>

      <title>Theory of dynamical superradiance in organic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the theory of dynamical superradiance -- the collective exchange of energy between an ensemble of initially excited emitters and a single-mode cavity -- for organic materials where electronic states are coupled to vibrational modes. We consider two models to capture the vibrational effects: first, vibrations treated as a Markovian bath for two-level emitters, via a pure dephasing term in the Lindblad master equation for the system; second, vibrational modes directly included in the system via the Holstein--Tavis--Cummings Hamiltonian. By exploiting the permutation symmetry of the emitters and weak U(1) symmetry, we develop a numerical method capable of exactly solving the Tavis-Cummings model with local dissipation for up to 140 emitters. Using the exact method, we validate mean-field and second-order cumulant approximations and use them to describe macroscopic numbers of emitters. We analyse the dynamics of the average cavity photon number, electronic coherence, and Bloch vector length, and show that the effect of vibrational mode coupling goes beyond simple dephasing. Our results show that superradiance is possible in the presence of vibrational mode coupling; for negative cavity detunings, the vibrational coupling may even enhance superradiance. We identify asymmetry of the photon number rise time as a function of the detuning of the cavity frequency as an experimentally accessible signature of such vibrationally assisted superradiance.</description>

      <title>Programmable Focal Elongation and Shaping of High-Intensity Laser Pulses using Adaptive Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Controlling the intensity distribution of laser pulses in the focal region is essential for optimizing optically generated plasma waveguides and enabling advanced plasma acceleration techniques, including dephasingless wakefield acceleration. Here, we present a method for programmatic structuring of the high-intensity focal region of a standard off-axis parabolic mirror, extending the length of this region well beyond the Rayleigh length and enabling control over the longitudinal intensity distribution. The theoretical framework is validated through numerical simulations and experimental measurements. Further, we demonstrate the use of this technique in an existing plasma accelerator system using readily available hardware components. Finally, we illustrate the potential application of this method to multi-GeV laser plasma acceleration and the generation of flying foci, research areas which would significantly benefit from improved programmatic structuring of high-intensity laser pulses.</description>

      <title>Non-markovian reservoir profile effects on dynamics of light within a single waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate how different reservoir memory profiles influence the dynamical evolution of a single waveguide coupled to an external environment. We compare three representative memory kernels: Lorentzian, Gaussian and Uniform, highlighting their distinct spatial correlations and their impact on system behavior. We compute the transmission amplitude, transparency properties, as well as long-time behavior of the system under each memory model. To quantify deviations from Markovian dynamics, we employ a non-Markovianity measure based on information backflow, allowing a direct comparison between the structured reservoirs and the Markovian limit. Our results reveal clear signatures of memoryless-induced modifications in the transmission spectrum and demonstrate how specific reservoir profiles enhance or suppress non-Markovian effects.</description>
