      <title>An Effective Learning Management System for Revealing Student Performance Attributes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A learning management system streamlines the management of the teaching process in a centralized place, recording, tracking, and reporting the delivery of educational courses and student performance. Educational knowledge discovery from such an e-learning system plays a crucial role in rule regulation, policy establishment, and system development. However, existing LMSs do not have embedded mining modules to directly extract knowledge. As educational modes become more complex, educational data mining efficiency from those heterogeneous student learning behaviours is gradually degraded. Therefore, an LMS incorporated with an advanced educational mining module is proposed in this study, as a means to mine efficiently from student performance records to provide valuable insights for educators in helping plan effective learning pedagogies, improve curriculum design, and guarantee quality of teaching. Through two illustrative case studies, experimental results demonstrate increased mining efficiency of the proposed mining module without information loss compared to classic educational mining algorithms. The mined knowledge reveals a set of attributes that significantly impact student academic performance, and further classification evaluation validates the identified attributes. The design and application of such an effective LMS can enable educators to learn from past student performance experiences, empowering them to guide and intervene with students in time, and eventually improve their academic success.</description>

      <title>Shortchanged: Uncovering and Analyzing Intimate Partner Financial Abuse in Consumer Complaints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital financial services can introduce new digital-safety risks for users, particularly survivors of intimate partner financial abuse (IPFA). To offer improved support for such users, a comprehensive understanding of their support needs and the barriers they face to redress by financial institutions is essential. Drawing from a dataset of 2.7 million customer complaints, we implement a bespoke workflow that utilizes language-modeling techniques and expert human review to identify complaints describing IPFA. Our mixed-method analysis provides insight into the most common digital financial products involved in these attacks, and the barriers consumers report encountering when doing so. Our contributions are twofold; we offer the first human-labeled dataset for this overlooked harm and provide practical implications for technical practice, research, and design for better supporting and protecting survivors of IPFA.</description>

      <title>Spatial Fairness: The Case for its Importance, Limitations of Existing Work, and Guidelines for Future Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite location being increasingly used in decision-making systems employed in many sensitive domains such as mortgages and insurance, astonishingly little attention has been paid to unfairness that may seep in due to the correlation of location with characteristics considered protected under anti-discrimination law, such as race or national origin. This position paper argues for the urgent need to consider fairness with respect to location, termed \textit{spatial fairness}, by outlining the harms that continue to be perpetuated due to location's correlation with protected characteristics. This interdisciplinary work connects knowledge from fields such as public policy, economic development, and geography to highlight how fair-AI research currently falls short of correcting for spatial biases, and does not consider challenges unique to spatial data. Furthermore, we identify limitations of the handful of spatial fairness work proposed so far, and finally, detail guidelines for future research so subsequent work may avoid such issues and help correct spatial biases.</description>

      <title>On the Conversational Persuasiveness of Large Language Models: A Randomized Controlled Trial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development and popularization of large language models (LLMs) have raised concerns that they will be used to create tailor-made, convincing arguments to push false or misleading narratives online. Early work has found that language models can generate content perceived as at least on par and often more persuasive than human-written messages. However, there is still limited knowledge about LLMs' persuasive capabilities in direct conversations with human counterparts and how personalization can improve their performance. In this pre-registered study, we analyze the effect of AI-driven persuasion in a controlled, harmless setting. We create a web-based platform where participants engage in short, multiple-round debates with a live opponent. Each participant is randomly assigned to one of four treatment conditions, corresponding to a two-by-two factorial design: (1) Games are either played between two humans or between a human and an LLM; (2) Personalization might or might not be enabled, granting one of the two players access to basic sociodemographic information about their opponent. We found that participants who debated GPT-4 with access to their personal information had 81.7% (p &lt; 0.01; N=820 unique participants) higher odds of increased agreement with their opponents compared to participants who debated humans. Without personalization, GPT-4 still outperforms humans, but the effect is lower and statistically non-significant (p=0.31). Overall, our results suggest that concerns around personalization are meaningful and have important implications for the governance of social media and the design of new online environments.</description>

      <title>The Ethics of ChatGPT in Medicine and Healthcare: A Systematic Review on Large Language Models (LLMs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the introduction of ChatGPT, Large Language Models (LLMs) have received enormous attention in healthcare. Despite their potential benefits, researchers have underscored various ethical implications. While individual instances have drawn much attention, the debate lacks a systematic overview of practical applications currently researched and ethical issues connected to them. Against this background, this work aims to map the ethical landscape surrounding the current stage of deployment of LLMs in medicine and healthcare. Electronic databases and preprint servers were queried using a comprehensive search strategy. Studies were screened and extracted following a modified rapid review approach. Methodological quality was assessed using a hybrid approach. For 53 records, a meta-aggregative synthesis was performed. Four fields of applications emerged and testify to a vivid exploration phase. Advantages of using LLMs are attributed to their capacity in data analysis, personalized information provisioning, support in decision-making, mitigating information loss and enhancing information accessibility. However, we also identifies recurrent ethical concerns connected to fairness, bias, non-maleficence, transparency, and privacy. A distinctive concern is the tendency to produce harmful misinformation or convincingly but inaccurate content. A recurrent plea for ethical guidance and human oversight is evident. Given the variety of use cases, it is suggested that the ethical guidance debate be reframed to focus on defining what constitutes acceptable human oversight across the spectrum of applications. This involves considering diverse settings, varying potentials for harm, and different acceptable thresholds for performance and certainty in healthcare. In addition, a critical inquiry is necessary to determine the extent to which the current experimental use of LLMs is necessary and justified.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Analysis of AI-Generated Texts in Academic Research: A Study of AI Presence in Arxiv Submissions using AI Detection Tool</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many people are interested in ChatGPT since it has become a prominent AIGC model that provides high-quality responses in various contexts, such as software development and maintenance. Misuse of ChatGPT might cause significant issues, particularly in public safety and education, despite its immense potential. The majority of researchers choose to publish their work on Arxiv. The effectiveness and originality of future work depend on the ability to detect AI components in such contributions. To address this need, this study will analyze a method that can see purposely manufactured content that academic organizations use to post on Arxiv. For this study, a dataset was created using physics, mathematics, and computer science articles. Using the newly built dataset, the following step is to put originality.ai through its paces. The statistical analysis shows that Originality.ai is very accurate, with a rate of 98%.</description>

      <title>Optimal Transport for Fairness: Archival Data Repair using Small Research Data Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advent of the AI Act and other regulations, there is now an urgent need for algorithms that repair unfairness in training data. In this paper, we define fairness in terms of conditional independence between protected attributes ($S$) and features ($X$), given unprotected attributes ($U$). We address the important setting in which torrents of archival data need to be repaired, using only a small proportion of these data, which are $S|U$-labelled (the research data). We use the latter to design optimal transport (OT)-based repair plans on interpolated supports. This allows {\em off-sample}, labelled, archival data to be repaired, subject to stationarity assumptions. It also significantly reduces the size of the supports of the OT plans, with correspondingly large savings in the cost of their design and of their {\em sequential\/} application to the off-sample data. We provide detailed experimental results with simulated and benchmark real data (the Adult data set). Our performance figures demonstrate effective repair -- in the sense of quenching conditional dependence -- of large quantities of off-sample, labelled (archival) data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algorithmic decision-making is increasingly being adopted across public higher education. The expansion of data-driven practices by post-secondary institutions has occurred in parallel with the adoption of New Public Management approaches by neoliberal administrations. In this study, we conduct a qualitative analysis of an in-depth ethnographic case study of data and algorithms in use at a public college in Ontario, Canada. We identify the data, algorithms, and outcomes in use at the college. We assess how the college's processes and relationships support those outcomes and the different stakeholders' perceptions of the college's data-driven systems. In addition, we find that the growing reliance on algorithmic decisions leads to increased student surveillance, exacerbation of existing inequities, and the automation of the faculty-student relationship. Finally, we identify a cycle of increased institutional power perpetuated by algorithmic decision-making, and driven by a push towards financial sustainability.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Trajectory Data Management and Mining: A Survey and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trajectory computing is a pivotal domain encompassing trajectory data management and mining, garnering widespread attention due to its crucial role in various practical applications such as location services, urban traffic, and public safety. Traditional methods, focusing on simplistic spatio-temporal features, face challenges of complex calculations, limited scalability, and inadequate adaptability to real-world complexities. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the development and recent advances in deep learning for trajectory computing (DL4Traj). We first define trajectory data and provide a brief overview of widely-used deep learning models. Systematically, we explore deep learning applications in trajectory management (pre-processing, storage, analysis, and visualization) and mining (trajectory-related forecasting, trajectory-related recommendation, trajectory classification, travel time estimation, anomaly detection, and mobility generation). Notably, we encapsulate recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) that hold the potential to augment trajectory computing. Additionally, we summarize application scenarios, public datasets, and toolkits. Finally, we outline current challenges in DL4Traj research and propose future directions. Relevant papers and open-source resources have been collated and are continuously updated at: \href{https://github.com/yoshall/Awesome-Trajectory-Computing}{DL4Traj Repo}.</description>

      <title>Recourse for reclamation: Chatting with generative language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Researchers and developers increasingly rely on toxicity scoring to moderate generative language model outputs, in settings such as customer service, information retrieval, and content generation. However, toxicity scoring may render pertinent information inaccessible, rigidify or "value-lock" cultural norms, and prevent language reclamation processes, particularly for marginalized people. In this work, we extend the concept of algorithmic recourse to generative language models: we provide users a novel mechanism to achieve their desired prediction by dynamically setting thresholds for toxicity filtering. Users thereby exercise increased agency relative to interactions with the baseline system. A pilot study ($n = 30$) supports the potential of our proposed recourse mechanism, indicating improvements in usability compared to fixed-threshold toxicity-filtering of model outputs. Future work should explore the intersection of toxicity scoring, model controllability, user agency, and language reclamation processes -- particularly with regard to the bias that many communities encounter when interacting with generative language models.</description>

      <title>How Knowledge Workers Think Generative AI Will (Not) Transform Their Industries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative AI is expected to have transformative effects in multiple knowledge industries. To better understand how knowledge workers expect generative AI may affect their industries in the future, we conducted participatory research workshops for seven different industries, with a total of 54 participants across three US cities. We describe participants' expectations of generative AI's impact, including a dominant narrative that cut across the groups' discourse: participants largely envision generative AI as a tool to perform menial work, under human review. Participants do not generally anticipate the disruptive changes to knowledge industries currently projected in common media and academic narratives. Participants do however envision generative AI may amplify four social forces currently shaping their industries: deskilling, dehumanization, disconnection, and disinformation. We describe these forces, and then we provide additional detail regarding attitudes in specific knowledge industries. We conclude with a discussion of implications and research challenges for the HCI community.</description>

      <title>Designing Digital Voting Systems for Citizens: Achieving Fairness and Legitimacy in Participatory Budgeting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Participatory Budgeting (PB) has evolved into a key democratic instrument for resource allocation in cities. Enabled by digital platforms, cities now have the opportunity to let citizens directly propose and vote on urban projects, using different voting input and aggregation rules. However, the choices cities make in terms of the rules of their PB have often not been informed by academic studies on voter behaviour and preferences. Therefore, this work presents the results of behavioural experiments where participants were asked to vote in a fictional PB setting. We identified approaches to designing PB voting that minimise cognitive load and enhance the perceived fairness and legitimacy of the digital process from the citizens' perspective. In our study, participants preferred voting input formats that are more expressive (like rankings and distributing points) over simpler formats (like approval voting). Participants also indicated a desire for the budget to be fairly distributed across city districts and project categories. Participants found the Method of Equal Shares voting rule to be fairer than the conventional Greedy voting rule. These findings offer actionable insights for digital governance, contributing to the development of fairer and more transparent digital systems and collective decision-making processes for citizens.</description>

      <title>Moral Judgments in Narratives on Reddit: Investigating Moral Sparks via Social Commonsense and Linguistic Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine ethics ensures ethical conduct in Artificial Intelligence (AI) models and agents. Examining real-life applications benefit learning practical ethics in many situations, offering valuable data to grasp the complexities of human ethics in diverse contexts. In this paper, we examine social media platforms for understanding real-life ethical scenarios and human moral judgments. We examine posts from a popular Reddit subreddit (i.e., a subcommunity) called r/AmITheAsshole, where authors and commenters share their moral judgments on who is blameworthy. We employ computational techniques to investigate the underlying reasoning influencing moral judgments. We focus on excerpts-which we term moral sparks-from original posts that commenters include to indicate what motivates their judgments. To this end, we examine how (1) events activating social commonsense and (2) linguistic signals affect moral sparks assignment and their subsequent judgments. By examining over 24 672 posts and 175988 comments, we find that event-related negative character traits (e.g., immature and rude) attract attention and stimulate blame, implying a dependent relationship between character traits and moral values. Specially, we focus on causal graph involving events (c-events) that activate social commonsense. We observe that c-events are perceived with varying levels of informativeness, influencing moral spark and judgment assignment in distinct ways. This observation is reinforced by examining linguistic features describing semantically similar c-events. Moreover, language influencing commenters' cognitive processes enhances the probability of an excerpt becoming a moral spark, while factual and concrete descriptions tend to inhibit this effect.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the shift in crowdsourcing towards self-managed enterprises of crowdworkers (SMECs), diverging from traditional platform-controlled models. It reviews the literature to understand the foundational aspects of this shift, focusing on identifying key factors that may explain the rise of SMECs, particularly concerning power dynamics and tensions between Online Labor Platforms (OLPs) and crowdworkers. The study aims to guide future research and inform policy and platform development, emphasizing the importance of fair labor practices in this evolving landscape.</description>

However, these advancements have also introduced additional safety risks and raised concerns regarding their detrimental impact on already marginalized populations. Despite growing mitigation efforts to develop safety safeguards, such as supervised safety-oriented fine-tuning and leveraging safe reinforcement learning from human feedback, multiple concerns regarding the safety and ingrained biases in these models remain. Furthermore, previous work has demonstrated that models optimized for safety often display exaggerated safety behaviors, such as a tendency to refrain from responding to certain requests as a precautionary measure. As such, a clear trade-off between the helpfulness and safety of these models has been documented in the literature. In this paper, we further investigate the effectiveness of safety measures by evaluating models on already mitigated biases. Using the case of Llama 2 as an example, we illustrate how LLMs' safety responses can still encode harmful assumptions. To do so, we create a set of non-toxic prompts, which we then use to evaluate Llama models. Through our new taxonomy of LLMs responses to users, we observe that the safety/helpfulness trade-offs are more pronounced for certain demographic groups which can lead to quality-of-service harms for marginalized populations.</description>
