      <title>A method for site-specifically tethering the enzyme urease to DNA origami with sustained activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attaching enzymes to nanostructures has proven useful to the study of enzyme functionality under controlled conditions and has led to new technologies. Often, the utility and interest of enzyme-tethered nanostructures lie in how the enzymatic activity is affected by how the enzymes are arranged in space. Therefore, being able to conjugate enzymes to nanostructures while preserving the enzymatic activity is essential. In this paper, we present a method to conjugate single-stranded DNA to the enzyme urease while maintaining enzymatic activity. We show evidence of successful conjugation and quantify the variables that affect the conjugation yield. We also show that the enzymatic activity is unchanged after conjugation compared to the enzyme in its native state. Finally, we demonstrate the tethering of urease to nanostructures made using DNA origami with high site-specificity. Decorating nanostructures with enzymatically-active urease may prove to be useful in studying, or even utilizing, the functionality of urease in disciplines ranging from biotechnology to soft-matter physics. The techniques we present in this paper will enable researchers across these fields to modify enzymes without disrupting their functionality, thus allowing for more insightful studies into their behavior and utility.</description>

      <title>Elephant trunk wrinkles: A mathematical model of function and form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A remarkable feature of the elephant trunk is the pronounced wrinkling that enables its great flexibility. Here, we devise a general mathematical model that accounts for characteristic skin wrinkles formed during morphogenesis in elephant trunk. Using physically realistic parameters and operating within the theoretical framework of nonlinear morphoelasticity, we elucidate analytically and numerically the effect of skin thickness, relative stiffness and differential growth on the physiological pattern of transverse wrinkles distributed along the trunk. We conclude that, since the skin and muscle components have similar material properties, geometric parameters, such as curvature, play important roles. In particular, our model predicts that, in the proximal region close to the skull, where curvature is lower, fewer wrinkles form and sooner than in the distal narrower region where more wrinkles develop. Similarly, less wrinkling is found on the ventral side, which is flatter, compared to the dorsal side. In summary, the mechanical compatibility between the skin and the muscle enables them to grow seamlessly, while the wrinkled skin acts as a protective barrier that is both thicker and more flexible than the unwrinkled skin.</description>

      <title>Alpha helices are more evolutionarily robust to environmental perturbations than beta sheets: Bayesian learning and statistical mechanics to protein evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How typical elements that shape organisms, such as protein secondary structures, have evolved, or how evolutionarily susceptible/resistant they are to environmental changes, are significant issues in evolutionary biology, structural biology, and biophysics. According to Darwinian evolution, natural selection and genetic mutations are the primary drivers of biological evolution. However, the concept of ``robustness of the phenotype to environmental perturbations across successive generations,'' which seems crucial from the perspective of natural selection, has not been formalized or analyzed. In this study, through Bayesian learning and statistical mechanics we formalize the stability of the free energy in the space of amino acid sequences that can design particular protein structure against perturbations of the chemical potential of water surrounding a protein as such robustness. This evolutionary stability is defined as a decreasing function of a quantity analogous to the susceptibility in the statistical mechanics of magnetic bodies specific to the amino acid sequence of a protein. Consequently, in a two-dimensional square lattice protein model composed of 36 residues, we found that as we increase the stability of the free energy against perturbations in environmental conditions, the structural space shows a steep step-like reduction. Furthermore, lattice protein structures with higher stability against perturbations in environmental conditions tend to have a higher proportion of $\alpha$-helices and a lower proportion of $\beta$-sheets. The latter result shows that protein structures rich in $\alpha$-helices are more robust to environmental perturbations through successive generations than those rich in $\beta$-sheets.</description>

      <title>Quantum features of the transport through ion channels in the soft knock-on model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ion channels are protein structures that facilitate the selective passage of ions across the membrane cells of living organisms. They are known for their high conductance and high selectivity. The precise mechanism between these two seemingly contradicting features is not yet firmly established. One possible candidate is the quantum coherence. In this work we study the quantum model of the soft knock-on conduction using the Lindblad equation taking into account the non-hermiticity of the model. We show that the model exhibits a regime in which high conductance coexists with high coherence. Our findings second the role of quantum effects in the transport properties of the ion channels.</description>

Abstract: Water diffusion gives rise to micrometer-scale sensitivity of diffusion MRI (dMRI) to cellular-level tissue structure. The advent of precision medicine and quantitative imaging hinges on revealing the information content of dMRI, and providing its parsimonious basis- and hardware-independent "fingerprint". Here we reveal the geometry of a multi-dimensional dMRI signal, classify all 21 invariants of diffusion and covariance tensors in terms of irreducible representations of the group of rotations, and relate them to tissue properties. Previously studied dMRI contrasts are expressed via 7 invariants, while the remaining 14 provide novel complementary information. We design acquisitions based on icosahedral vertices guaranteeing minimal number of measurements to determine 3-4 most used invariants in only 1-2 minutes for the whole brain. Representing dMRI signals via scalar invariant maps with definite symmetries will underpin machine learning classifiers of brain pathology, development, and aging, while fast protocols will enable translation of advanced dMRI into clinical practice.</description>

      <title>Fluctuating Hydrodynamics Describes Transport in Cellular Aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological functionality of cellular aggregates is largely influenced by the activity and displacements of individual constituent cells. From a theoretical perspective this activity can be characterized by hydrodynamic transport coefficients of diffusivity and conductivity. Motivated by the clustering dynamics of bacterial microcolonies we propose a model of active multicellular aggregates and use recently developed macroscopic fluctuation theory to derive a fluctuating hydrodynamics for this model system. Both semi-analytic theory and microscopic simulations show that the hydrodynamic transport coefficients are affected by non-equilibrium microscopic parameters and significantly decrease inside of the clusters. We further find that the Einstein relation connecting the transport coefficients and fluctuations breaks down in the parameter regime where the detailed balance is not satisfied. This study offers valuable tools for experimental investigation of hydrodynamic transport in other systems of cellular aggregates such as tumor spheroids and organoids.</description>

      <title>Simple measures to capture the robustness and the plasticity of soil microbial communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soil microbial communities are known to be robust against perturbations such as nutrition inputs, which appears as an obstacle for the soil improvement. On the other hand, its adaptable aspect has been also reported. Here we propose simple measures for these seemingly contradicting features of soil microbial communities, robustness and plasticity, based on the distribution of the populations. The first measure is the similarity in the population balance, i.e. the shape of the distribution function, which is found to show resilience against the nutrition inputs. The other is the similarity in the composition of the species measured by the rank order of the population, which shows an adaptable response during the population balance is recovering. These results clearly show that the soil microbial system is robust (or, homeostatic) in its population balance, while the composition of the species is rather plastic and adaptable.</description>

      <title>A multi-scale analysis of the CzrA transcription repressor highlights the allosteric changes induced by metal ion binding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Allosteric regulation is a widespread strategy employed by several proteins to transduce chemical signals and perform biological functions. Metal sensor proteins are exemplary in this respect, e.g., in that they selectively bind and unbind DNA depending on the state of a distal ion coordination site. In this work, we carry out an investigation of the structural and mechanical properties of the CzrA transcription repressor through the analysis of microsecond-long molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories; the latter are processed through the mapping entropy optimisation workflow (MEOW), a recently developed information-theoretical method that highlights, in an unsupervised manner, residues of particular mechanical, functional, and biological importance. This approach allows us to unveil how differences in the properties of the molecule are controlled by the state of the zinc coordination site, with particular attention to the DNA binding region. These changes correlate with a redistribution of the conformational variability of the residues throughout the molecule, in spite of an overall consistency of its architecture in the two (ion-bound and free) coordination states. The results of this work corroborate previous studies, provide novel insight into the fine details of the mechanics of CzrA, and showcase the MEOW approach as a novel instrument for the study of allosteric regulation and other processes in proteins through the analysis of plain MD simulations.</description>

      <title>Critical transition between intensive and extensive active droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emulsions ripen with an average droplet size increasing in time. In chemically active emulsions, coarsening can be absent, leading to a non-equilibrium steady state with mono-disperse droplet sizes. By considering a minimal model for phase separation and chemical reactions maintained away from equilibrium, we show that there is a critical transition in the conserved quantity between two classes of chemically active droplets: intensive and extensive ones. Single intensive active droplets reach a stationary size mainly controlled by the reaction-diffusion length scales. Intensive droplets in an emulsion interact only weakly, and the stationary size of a single droplet approximately sets the size of each droplet. On the contrary, the size of a single extensive active droplet scales with the system size, similar to passive phases. In an emulsion of many extensive droplets, their sizes become stationary only due to interactions among them. We discuss how the critical transition between intensive and extensive active droplets affects shape instabilities, including the division of active droplets, paving the way for the observation of successive division events in chemically active emulsions</description>

      <title>Large Scale Training of Graph Neural Networks for Optimal Markov-Chain Partitioning Using the Kemeny Constant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14847v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional clustering algorithms often struggle to capture the complex relationships within graphs and generalise to arbitrary clustering criteria. The emergence of graph neural networks (GNNs) as a powerful framework for learning representations of graph data provides new approaches to solving the problem. Previous work has shown GNNs to be capable of proposing partitionings using a variety of criteria, however, these approaches have not yet been extended to work on Markov chains or kinetic networks. These arise frequently in the study of molecular systems and are of particular interest to the biochemical modelling community. In this work, we propose several GNN-based architectures to tackle the graph partitioning problem for Markov Chains described as kinetic networks. This approach aims to minimize how much a proposed partitioning changes the Kemeny constant. We propose using an encoder-decoder architecture and show how simple GraphSAGE-based GNNs with linear layers can outperform much larger and more expressive attention-based models in this context. As a proof of concept, we first demonstrate the method's ability to cluster randomly connected graphs. We also use a linear chain architecture corresponding to a 1D free energy profile as our kinetic network. Subsequently, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on a data set derived from molecular dynamics. We compare the performance of our method to other partitioning techniques such as PCCA+. We explore the importance of feature and hyperparameter selection and propose a general strategy for large-scale parallel training of GNNs for discovering optimal graph partitionings.</description>

      <title>On the design space between molecular mechanics and machine learning force fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A force field as accurate as quantum mechanics (QM) and as fast as molecular mechanics (MM), with which one can simulate a biomolecular system efficiently enough and meaningfully enough to get quantitative insights, is among the most ardent dreams of biophysicists -- a dream, nevertheless, not to be fulfilled any time soon. Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) represent a meaningful endeavor towards this direction, where differentiable neural functions are parametrized to fit ab initio energies, and furthermore forces through automatic differentiation. We argue that, as of now, the utility of the MLFF models is no longer bottlenecked by accuracy but primarily by their speed (as well as stability and generalizability), as many recent variants, on limited chemical spaces, have long surpassed the chemical accuracy of $1$ kcal/mol -- the empirical threshold beyond which realistic chemical predictions are possible -- though still magnitudes slower than MM. Hoping to kindle explorations and designs of faster, albeit perhaps slightly less accurate MLFFs, in this review, we focus our attention on the design space (the speed-accuracy tradeoff) between MM and ML force fields. After a brief review of the building blocks of force fields of either kind, we discuss the desired properties and challenges now faced by the force field development community, survey the efforts to make MM force fields more accurate and ML force fields faster, envision what the next generation of MLFF might look like.</description>
