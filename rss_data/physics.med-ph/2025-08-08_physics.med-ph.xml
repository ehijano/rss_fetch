      <title>Influence of bone microstructure on ultrasound loss through skull-mimicking digital phantoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transcranial focused ultrasound applications often use simulations that require accurate acoustic properties, which can be related to computed tomography (CT) Hounsfield Units (HU). However, clinical CT is insensitive to microstructure. This study examines how bone/marrow microstructure introduces variations in acoustic property relationships to CT HUs. The insertion loss was found through skull-mimicking digital phantoms with two materials (bone/marrow) from 0 to 75% porosity. The phantoms had one of six pore diameters ranging from 0.2 mm to 1.0 mm. k-Wave simulations were computed with a continuous 230 kHz or 650 kHz uniform pressure source. The insertion loss was defined as the transmitted mean pressure relative to a water-only reference. The 230 kHz loss changed with porosity, but microstructure had little effect. However, the 650 kHz loss in both non-absorbing and absorbing simulations depended on porosity and pore diameter. Larger pore phantoms generally had higher losses than smaller pore diameter phantoms at the same porosity. In the non-absorbing phantoms, the maximum range in insertion loss was 2% to 52%, which occurred at 20% porosity. Absorption increased the loss by 8.2% on average, with the greatest increase of 13% in the smallest pore (0.2 mm) and 2.5% porosity phantom. Coherent multiple reflections from the phantom's planar interfaces influenced the loss from smaller pores, while larger pores disrupt this phase coherence. The insertion loss dependence on porosity and pore diameter shows that the attenuation-HU relationship is ill-determined at 650 kHz. This uncertainty has implications for CT-derived acoustic models, as no single attenuation corresponds to HUs with variable microstructures.</description>

      <title>Flow-driven magnetic microcatheter for superselective arterial embolization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Minimally invasive interventions performed inside brain vessels with the synergistic use of microcatheters pushed over guidewires have revolutionized the way aneurysms, stroke, arteriovenous malformations, brain tumors and other cerebrovascular conditions are being treated. However, a significant portion of the brain vasculature remains inaccessible from within because the conventional catheterization technique based on transmitting forces from the proximal to the distal end of the instruments imposes stringent constraints on their diameter and stiffness. Here we overcome this mechanical barrier by microengineering a new class of ultraminiaturized magnetic microcatheters in the form of an inflatable flat tube, making them extremely flexible and capable of harnessing the kinetic energy of blood flow for endovascular navigation. We introduce a compact and versatile magnetic steering platform that is compatible with conventional bi-plane fluoroscope imaging, and demonstrate for the first time safe and effortless navigation and tracking of hard-to-reach, distal, tortuous arteries that are as small as 180 um in diameter with a curvature radius as small as 0.69 mm. Furthermore, we demonstrate the superselective infusion of contrast and embolic liquid agents, all in a porcine model. These results pave the way to reach, diagnose, and treat currently inaccessible distal arteries that may be at risk of bleeding or feeding a tumor. Our endovascular technology can also be used to selectively target tissues for drug or gene delivery from within the arteries, not only in the central and peripheral nervous system but almost any other organ system, with improved accuracy, speed and safety.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised learning for inverse problems in computed tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents an unsupervised deep learning approach for computed tomography (CT) image reconstruction, leveraging the inherent similarities between deep neural network training and conventional iterative reconstruction methods. By incorporating forward and backward projection layers within the deep learning framework, we demonstrate the feasibility of reconstructing images from projection data without relying on ground-truth images. Our method is evaluated on the two-dimensional 2DeteCT dataset, showcasing superior performance in terms of mean squared error (MSE) and structural similarity index (SSIM) compared to traditional filtered backprojection (FBP) and maximum likelihood (ML) reconstruction techniques. Additionally, our approach significantly reduces reconstruction time, making it a promising alternative for real-time medical imaging applications. Future work will focus on extending this methodology to three-dimensional reconstructions and enhancing the adaptability of the projection geometry.</description>

      <title>Look-Up Table-Correction for Beam Hardening-Induced Signal of Clinical Dark-Field Chest Radiographs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Material structures at the micrometer scale cause ultra-small-angle X-ray scattering, e.g., seen in lung tissue or plastic foams. In grating-based X-ray imaging, this causes a reduction of the fringe visibility, forming a dark-field signal. Polychromatic beam hardening also changes visibility, adding a false dark-field signal due to attenuation, even in homogeneous, non-scattering materials. Purpose: The objective of this study is to develop a fast, simple, and robust method to correct dark-field signals and bony structures present due to beam hardening on dark-field chest radiographs of study participants. Methods: The method is based on calibration measurements and image processing. Beam hardening by bones and soft tissue is modeled by aluminum and water, respectively, which have no microstructure and thus only generate an artificial dark-field signal. Look-up tables were then created for both. By using a weighted mean of these, forming a single look-up table, and using the attenuation images, the artificial dark-field signal and thus the bone structures present are reduced for study participants. Results: It was found that applying a correction using a weighted look-up table leads to a significant reduction of bone structures in the dark-field image. The weighting of the aluminum component has a substantial impact on the degree to which bone structures remain visible in the dark-field image. Furthermore, a large negative bias in the dark-field image, dependent on the aluminum weighting, was successfully corrected. Conclusions: The beam-hardening-induced signal in the dark-field images was successfully reduced using the method described. The choice of aluminum weighting to suppress rib structures, as well as the selection of bias correction, should be evaluated based on the specific clinical question.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised deep learning model for fast energy layer pre-selection of delivery-efficient proton arc therapy plan optimization of nasopharyngeal carcinoma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proton arc therapy (PAT) is an emerging and promising modality in radiotherapy, offering improved dose distribution and treatment robustness over intensity-modulated proton therapy. Yet, identifying the optimal energy layer (EL) sequence remains challenging due to the intensive computational demand and prolonged treatment delivery time. This study proposes an unsupervised deep learning model for fast EL pre-selection that minimizes EL switch (ELS) time while maintaining high plan quality. We introduce a novel data representation method, spot-count representation, which encodes the number of proton spots intersecting the target and organs at risk (OAR) in a matrix structured by sorted gantry angles and energy layers. This representation serves as the input of an U-Net style architecture, SPArc_dl, which is trained using a tri-objective function: maximizing spot-counts on target, minimizing spot-counts on OAR, and reducing ELS time. The model is evaluated on 35 nasopharyngeal cancer cases, and its performance is compared to SPArc_particle_swarm (SPArc_ps). SPArc_dl produces EL pre-selection that significantly improves both plan quality and delivery efficiency. Compared to SPArc_ps, it enhances the conformity index by 0.1 (p&lt;0.01), reduces the homogeneity index by 0.71 (p&lt;0.01), lowers the brainstem mean dose by 0.25 (p&lt;0.01), and shortens the ELS time by 37.2% (p &lt; 0.01). The results unintentionally reveal employing unchanged ELS is more time-wise efficient than descended ELS. SPArc_dl's inference time is within 1 second. However, SPArc_dl plan demonstrates limitation in robustness. The proposed spot-count representation lays a foundation for incorporating unsupervised deep learning approaches into EL pre-selection task. SPArc_dl is a fast tool for generating high-quality PAT plans by strategically pre-selecting EL to reduce delivery time while maintaining excellent dosimetric performance.</description>
