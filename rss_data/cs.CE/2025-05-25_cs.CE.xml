      <title>Sparse Diffusion Autoencoder for Test-time Adapting Prediction of Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the behavior of complex systems is critical in many scientific and engineering domains, and hinges on the model's ability to capture their underlying dynamics. Existing methods encode the intrinsic dynamics of high-dimensional observations through latent representations and predict autoregressively. However, these latent representations lose the inherent spatial structure of spatiotemporal dynamics, leading to the predictor's inability to effectively model spatial interactions and neglect emerging dynamics during long-term prediction. In this work, we propose SparseDiff, introducing a test-time adaptation strategy to dynamically update the encoding scheme to accommodate emergent spatiotemporal structures during the long-term evolution of the system. Specifically, we first design a codebook-based sparse encoder, which coarsens the continuous spatial domain into a sparse graph topology. Then, we employ a graph neural ordinary differential equation to model the dynamics and guide a diffusion decoder for reconstruction. SparseDiff autoregressively predicts the spatiotemporal evolution and adjust the sparse topological structure to adapt to emergent spatiotemporal patterns by adaptive re-encoding. Extensive evaluations on representative systems demonstrate that SparseDiff achieves an average prediction error reduction of 49.99\% compared to baselines, requiring only 1\% of the spatial resolution.</description>

      <title>Latent Imputation before Prediction: A New Computational Paradigm for De Novo Peptide Sequencing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: De novo peptide sequencing is a fundamental computational technique for ascertaining amino acid sequences of peptides directly from tandem mass spectrometry data, eliminating the need for reference databases. Cutting-edge models usually encode the observed mass spectra into latent representations from which peptides are predicted autoregressively. However, the issue of missing fragmentation, attributable to factors such as suboptimal fragmentation efficiency and instrumental constraints, presents a formidable challenge in practical applications. To tackle this obstacle, we propose a novel computational paradigm called \underline{\textbf{L}}atent \underline{\textbf{I}}mputation before \underline{\textbf{P}}rediction (LIPNovo). LIPNovo is devised to compensate for missing fragmentation information within observed spectra before executing the final peptide prediction. Rather than generating raw missing data, LIPNovo performs imputation in the latent space, guided by the theoretical peak profile of the target peptide sequence. The imputation process is conceptualized as a set-prediction problem, utilizing a set of learnable peak queries to reason about the relationships among observed peaks and directly generate the latent representations of theoretical peaks through optimal bipartite matching. In this way, LIPNovo manages to supplement missing information during inference and thus boosts performance. Despite its simplicity, experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that LIPNovo outperforms state-of-the-art methods by large margins.

      <title>4D-CTA Image and geometry dataset for kinematic analysis of abdominal aortic aneurysms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a dataset used in the article "Kinematics of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms" [arXiv:2405.13377], published in the Journal of Biomechanics. The dataset is publicly available for download from the Zenodo data repository (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15477710). The dataset includes time-resolved 3D computed tomography angiography (4D-CTA) images of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) captured throughout the cardiac cycle from ten patients diagnosed with AAA, along with ten patient-specific AAA geometries extracted from these images. Typically, the 4D-CTA dataset for each patient contains ten electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated 3D-CTA image frames acquired over a cardiac cycle, capturing both the systolic and diastolic phases of the AAA configuration. For method verification, the dataset also includes synthetic ground truth data generated from Patient 1's 3D-CTA AAA image in the diastolic phase. The ground truth data includes the patient-specific finite element (FE) biomechanical model and a synthetic systolic 3D-CTA image. The synthetic systolic image was generated by warping Patient 1's diastolic 3D-CTA image using the realistic displacement field obtained from the AAA biomechanical FE model. The images were acquired at Fiona Stanley Hospital in Western Australia and provided to the researchers at the Intelligent Systems for Medicine Laboratory at The University of Western Australia (ISML-UWA), where image-based AAA kinematic analysis was performed. Our dataset enabled the analysis of AAA wall displacement and strain throughout the cardiac cycle using a non-invasive, in vivo, image registration-based approach. The use of widely adopted, open-source file formats (NRRD for images and STL for geometries) facilitates broad applicability and reusability in AAA biomechanics studies that require patient-specific geometry and information about AAA kinematics during cardiac cycle.</description>

      <title>A brief review of the Deep BSDE method for solving high-dimensional partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) pose significant challenges for numerical computation due to the curse of dimensionality, which limits the applicability of traditional mesh-based methods. Since 2017, the Deep BSDE method has introduced deep learning techniques that enable the effective solution of nonlinear PDEs in very high dimensions. This innovation has sparked considerable interest in using neural networks for high-dimensional PDEs, making it an active area of research. In this short review, we briefly sketch the Deep BSDE method, its subsequent developments, and future directions for the field.</description>

      <title>Towards Robust Evaluation of STEM Education: Leveraging MLLMs in Project-Based Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Project-Based Learning (PBL) involves a variety of highly correlated multimodal data, making it a vital educational approach within STEM disciplines. With the rapid development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), researchers have begun exploring their potential to enhance tasks such as information retrieval, knowledge comprehension, and data generation in educational settings. However, existing benchmarks fall short in providing both a free-form output structure and a rigorous human expert validation process, limiting their effectiveness in evaluating real-world educational tasks. Additionally, few methods have developed automated pipelines to assist with the complex responsibilities of teachers leveraging MLLMs, largely due to model hallucination and instability, which lead to unreliable implementation. To address this gap, we introduce PBLBench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate complex reasoning grounded in domain-specific knowledge and long-context understanding, thereby challenging models with tasks that closely resemble those handled by human experts. To establish reliable ground truth, we adopt the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), utilizing expert-driven pairwise comparisons to derive structured and weighted evaluation criteria. We assess the performance of 15 leading MLLMs/LLMs using PBLBench and demonstrate that even the most advanced models achieve only 59% rank accuracy, underscoring the significant challenges presented by this benchmark. We believe PBLBench will serve as a catalyst for the development of more capable AI agents, ultimately aiming to alleviate teacher workload and enhance educational productivity.</description>

      <title>MOOSE-Chem3: Toward Experiment-Guided Hypothesis Ranking via Simulated Experimental Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hypothesis ranking is a crucial component of automated scientific discovery, particularly in natural sciences where wet-lab experiments are costly and throughput-limited. Existing approaches focus on pre-experiment ranking, relying solely on large language model's internal reasoning without incorporating empirical outcomes from experiments. We introduce the task of experiment-guided ranking, which aims to prioritize candidate hypotheses based on the results of previously tested ones. However, developing such strategies is challenging due to the impracticality of repeatedly conducting real experiments in natural science domains. To address this, we propose a simulator grounded in three domain-informed assumptions, modeling hypothesis performance as a function of similarity to a known ground truth hypothesis, perturbed by noise. We curate a dataset of 124 chemistry hypotheses with experimentally reported outcomes to validate the simulator. Building on this simulator, we develop a pseudo experiment-guided ranking method that clusters hypotheses by shared functional characteristics and prioritizes candidates based on insights derived from simulated experimental feedback. Experiments show that our method outperforms pre-experiment baselines and strong ablations.</description>

      <title>TwinMarket: A Scalable Behavioral and Social Simulation for Financial Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01506v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of social emergence has long been a central focus in social science. Traditional modeling approaches, such as rule-based Agent-Based Models (ABMs), struggle to capture the diversity and complexity of human behavior, particularly the irrational factors emphasized in behavioral economics. Recently, large language model (LLM) agents have gained traction as simulation tools for modeling human behavior in social science and role-playing applications. Studies suggest that LLMs can account for cognitive biases, emotional fluctuations, and other non-rational influences, enabling more realistic simulations of socio-economic dynamics. In this work, we introduce TwinMarket, a novel multi-agent framework that leverages LLMs to simulate socio-economic systems. Specifically, we examine how individual behaviors, through interactions and feedback mechanisms, give rise to collective dynamics and emergent phenomena. Through experiments in a simulated stock market environment, we demonstrate how individual actions can trigger group behaviors, leading to emergent outcomes such as financial bubbles and recessions. Our approach provides valuable insights into the complex interplay between individual decision-making and collective socio-economic patterns.</description>

      <title>SINDyG: Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems from Graph-Structured Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04463v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The combination of machine learning (ML) and sparsity-promoting techniques is enabling direct extraction of governing equations from data, revolutionizing computational modeling in diverse fields of science and engineering. The discovered dynamical models could be used to address challenges in climate science, neuroscience, ecology, finance, epidemiology, and beyond. However, most existing sparse identification methods for discovering dynamical systems treat the whole system as one without considering the interactions between subsystems. As a result, such models are not able to capture small changes in the emergent system behavior. To address this issue, we developed a new method called Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems from Graph-structured data (SINDyG), which incorporates the network structure into sparse regression to identify model parameters that explain the underlying network dynamics. We showcase the application of our proposed method using several case studies of neuronal dynamics, where we model the macroscopic oscillation of a population of neurons using the extended Stuart-Landau (SL) equation and utilize the SINDyG method to identify the underlying nonlinear dynamics. Our extensive computational experiments validate the improved accuracy and simplicity of discovered network dynamics when compared to the original SINDy approach.</description>
