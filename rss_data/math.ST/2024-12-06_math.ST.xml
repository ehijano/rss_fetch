      <title>Information theoretic limits of robust sub-Gaussian mean estimation under star-shaped constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain the minimax rate for a mean location model with a bounded star-shaped set $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ constraint on the mean, in an adversarially corrupted data setting with Gaussian noise. We assume an unknown fraction $\epsilon&lt;1/2-\kappa$ for some fixed $\kappa\in(0,1/2]$ of the $N$ observations are arbitrarily corrupted. We obtain a minimax risk up to proportionality constants under the squared $\ell_2$ loss of $\max(\eta^{*2},\sigma^2\epsilon^2)\wedge d^2$ with \begin{align*}
  \eta^* = \sup \bigg\{\eta : \frac{N\eta^2}{\sigma^2} \leq \log M^{\operatorname{loc}}(\eta,c)\bigg\}, \end{align*} where $\log M^{\operatorname{loc}}(\eta,c)$ denotes the local entropy of the set $K$, $d$ is the diameter of $K$, $\sigma^2$ is the variance, and $c$ is some sufficiently large absolute constant. A variant of our algorithm achieves the same rate for settings with known or symmetric sub-Gaussian noise, with a smaller breakdown point, still of constant order. We further study the case of unknown sub-Gaussian noise and show that the rate is slightly slower: $\max(\eta^{*2},\sigma^2\epsilon^2\log(1/\epsilon))\wedge d^2$. We generalize our results to the case when $K$ is star-shaped but unbounded.</description>

      <title>Alpha shapes and optimal transport on the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [3], the authors used the Legendre transform to give a tractable method for studying Topological Data Analysis (TDA) in terms of sums of Gaussian kernels. In this paper, we prove a variant for sums of cosine similarity-based kernel functions, which requires considering the more general "$c$-transform" from optimal transport theory [16]. We then apply these methods to a point cloud arising from a recent breakthrough study, which exhibits a toroidal structure in the brain activity of rats [11]. A key part of this application is that the transport map and transformed density function arising from the theorem replace certain delicate preprocessing steps related to density-based denoising and subsampling.</description>

      <title>Online Experimental Design With Estimation-Regret Trade-off Under Network Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network interference has garnered significant interest in the field of causal inference. It reflects diverse sociological behaviors, wherein the treatment assigned to one individual within a network may influence the outcome of other individuals, such as their neighbors. To estimate the causal effect, one classical way is to randomly assign experimental candidates into different groups and compare their differences. However, in the context of sequential experiments, such treatment assignment may result in a large regret. In this paper, we develop a unified interference-based online experimental design framework. Compared to existing literature, we expand the definition of arm space by leveraging the statistical concept of exposure mapping. Importantly, we establish the Pareto-optimal trade-off between the estimation accuracy and regret with respect to both time period and arm space, which remains superior to the baseline even in the absence of network interference. We further propose an algorithmic implementation and model generalization.</description>

      <title>How well behaved is finite dimensional Diffusion Maps?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Under a set of assumptions on a family of submanifolds $\subset {\mathbb R}^D$, we derive a series of geometric properties that remain valid after finite-dimensional and almost isometric Diffusion Maps (DM), including almost uniform density, finite polynomial approximation and local reach. Leveraging these properties, we establish rigorous bounds on the embedding errors introduced by the DM algorithm is $O\left((\frac{\log n}{n})^{\frac{1}{8d+16}}\right)$. These results offer a solid theoretical foundation for understanding the performance and reliability of DM in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Pathwise optimization for bridge-type estimators and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sparse parametric models are of great interest in statistical learning and are often analyzed by means of regularized estimators. Pathwise methods allow to efficiently compute the full solution path for penalized estimators, for any possible value of the penalization parameter $\lambda$. In this paper we deal with the pathwise optimization for bridge-type problems; i.e. we are interested in the minimization of a loss function, such as negative log-likelihood or residual sum of squares, plus the sum of $\ell^q$ norms with $q\in(0,1]$ involving adpative coefficients. For some loss functions this regularization achieves asymptotically the oracle properties (such as the selection consistency). Nevertheless, since the objective function involves nonconvex and nondifferentiable terms, the minimization problem is computationally challenging.
  The aim of this paper is to apply some general algorithms, arising from nonconvex optimization theory, to compute efficiently the path solutions for the adaptive bridge estimator with multiple penalties. In particular, we take into account two different approaches: accelerated proximal gradient descent and blockwise alternating optimization. The convergence and the path consistency of these algorithms are discussed. In order to assess our methods, we apply these algorithms to the penalized estimation of diffusion processes observed at discrete times. This latter represents a recent research topic in the field of statistics for time-dependent data.</description>

      <title>Finite-sample performance of the maximum likelihood estimator in logistic regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Logistic regression is a classical model for describing the probabilistic dependence of binary responses to multivariate covariates. We consider the predictive performance of the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for logistic regression, assessed in terms of logistic risk. We consider two questions: first, that of the existence of the MLE (which occurs when the dataset is not linearly separated), and second that of its accuracy when it exists. These properties depend on both the dimension of covariates and on the signal strength. In the case of Gaussian covariates and a well-specified logistic model, we obtain sharp non-asymptotic guarantees for the existence and excess logistic risk of the MLE. We then generalize these results in two ways: first, to non-Gaussian covariates satisfying a certain two-dimensional margin condition, and second to the general case of statistical learning with a possibly misspecified logistic model. Finally, we consider the case of a Bernoulli design, where the behavior of the MLE is highly sensitive to the parameter direction.</description>

      <title>Robust estimation of boundary using doubly stochastic scaling of Gaussian kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of detecting points on or near the boundary of a dataset sampled, potentially with noise, from a compact manifold with boundary. We extend recent advances in doubly stochastic scaling of the Gaussian heat kernel via Sinkhorn iterations to this setting. Our main contributions are: (a) deriving a characterization of the scaling factors for manifolds with boundary, (b) developing a boundary direction estimator, aimed at identifying boundary points, based on doubly stochastic kernel and local principal component analysis, and (c) demonstrating through simulations that the resulting estimates of the boundary points outperform the standard Gaussian kernel-based approach, particularly under noisy conditions.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Personalization in FedProx: A Fine-grained Analysis on Statistical Accuracy and Communication Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08934v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: FedProx is a simple yet effective federated learning method that enables model personalization via regularization. Despite remarkable success in practice, a rigorous analysis of how such a regularization provably improves the statistical accuracy of each client's local model hasn't been fully established. Setting the regularization strength heuristically presents a risk, as an inappropriate choice may even degrade accuracy. This work fills in the gap by analyzing the effect of regularization on statistical accuracy, thereby providing a theoretical guideline for setting the regularization strength for achieving personalization. We prove that by adaptively choosing the regularization strength under different statistical heterogeneity, FedProx can consistently outperform pure local training and achieve a \textit{minimax-optimal} statistical rate. In addition, to shed light on resource allocation, we design an algorithm, provably showing that stronger personalization reduces communication complexity without increasing the computation cost overhead. Finally, our theory is validated on both synthetic and real-world datasets and its generalizability is verified in a non-convex setting.</description>

      <title>On the mean-field limit of diffusive games through the master equation: extreme value analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an $N$-player game where the players control the drifts of their diffusive states which have no interaction in the noise terms. The aim of each player is to minimize the expected value of her cost, which is a function of the player's state and the empirical measure of the states of all the players. Our aim is to determine the $N \to \infty$ asymptotic behavior of the upper order statistics of the player's states under Nash equilibrium (the Nash states). For this purpose, we consider also a system of interacting diffusions which is constructed by using the Master PDE of the game and approximates the system of the Nash states, and we improve an $L^2$ estimate for the distance between the drifts of the two systems which has been used for establishing Central Limit Theorems and Large Deviations Principles for the Nash states in the past. By differentiating the Master PDE, we obtain that estimate also in $L^{\infty}$, which allows us to control the Radon-Nikodym derivative of a Girsanov transformation that connects the two systems. The latter allows us to reduce the problem to the case of $N$ uncontrolled diffusions with standard mean-field interaction in the drifts, which has been treated in a previous work.</description>

      <title>On the Impossibility of Equating the Youden Index with Tjur's $R^2$-like metrics in $2\times2$ Tables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2017, Hughes claimed an equivalence between Tjurs $R^2$ coefficient of discrimination and the Youden index for assessing diagnostic test performance on $2\times 2$ contingency tables. We prove an impossibility result when averaging over binary outcomes (0s and 1s) under any continuous real-valued scoring rule. Our finding clarifies the limitations of such a possible equivalence and highlights the distinct roles these metrics play in diagnostic test assessment.</description>

      <title>Iterative Reweighted Framework Based Algorithms for Sparse Linear Regression with Generalized Elastic Net Penalty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14875v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The elastic net penalty is frequently employed in high-dimensional statistics for parameter regression and variable selection. It is particularly beneficial compared to lasso when the number of predictors greatly surpasses the number of observations. However, empirical evidence has shown that the $\ell_q$-norm penalty (where $0 &lt; q &lt; 1$) often provides better regression compared to the $\ell_1$-norm penalty, demonstrating enhanced robustness in various scenarios. In this paper, we explore a generalized elastic net model that employs a $\ell_r$-norm (where $r \geq 1$) in loss function to accommodate various types of noise, and employs a $\ell_q$-norm (where $0 &lt; q &lt; 1$) to replace the $\ell_1$-norm in elastic net penalty. Theoretically, we establish the computable lower bounds for the nonzero entries of the generalized first-order stationary points of the proposed generalized elastic net model. For implementation, we develop two efficient algorithms based on the locally Lipschitz continuous $\epsilon$-approximation to $\ell_q$-norm. The first algorithm employs an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), while the second utilizes a proximal majorization-minimization method (PMM), where the subproblems are addressed using the semismooth Newton method (SNN). We also perform extensive numerical experiments with both simulated and real data, showing that both algorithms demonstrate superior performance. Notably, the PMM-SSN is efficient than ADMM, even though the latter provides a simpler implementation.</description>
