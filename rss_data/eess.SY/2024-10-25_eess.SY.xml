      <title>Trajectory Optimization for Spatial Microstructure Control in Electron Beam Metal Additive Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal additive manufacturing (AM) opens the possibility for spatial control of as-fabricated microstructure and properties. However, since the solid state diffusional transformations that drive microstructure outcomes are governed by nonlinear ODEs in terms of temperature, which is itself governed by PDEs over the entire part domain, solving for the system inputs needed to achieve desired microstructure distributions has proven difficult. In this work, we present a trajectory optimization approach for spatial control of microstructure in metal AM, which we demonstrate by controlling the hardness of a low-alloy steel in electron beam powder bed fusion (EB-PBF). To this end, we present models for thermal and microstructural dynamics. Next, we use experimental data to identify the parameters of the microstructure transformation dynamics. We then pose spatial microstructure control as a finite-horizon optimal control problem. The optimal power field trajectory is computed using an augmented Lagrangian differential dynamic programming (AL-DDP) method with GPU acceleration. The resulting time-varying power fields are then realized on an EB-PBF machine through an approximation scheme. Measurements of the resultant hardness shows that the optimized power field trajectory is able to closely produce the desired hardness distribution.</description>

      <title>A Methodology for Transformer Ratio Adjustment in Small-Size Rotary Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study addresses a neglected challenge that has been hidden in the Rotary Transformer (RT) field: the possibility of a discrepancy between transformer ratio and turn number ratio in small-size transformers. Previous investigations have shown that in the geometry design of RTs, as well as their resonant circuit design, the transformer ratio has been regarded as the same as the turn number ratio. This estimation is logical and true when a large-size RT is investigated. However, in small-size RTs, the magnitudes of leakage and magnetization inductances are significantly close, which leads to a difference between transformer ratio and turn number ratio. Accordingly, the absence of an exact methodology for transformer ratio calculation brought us to conduct this investigation. In this regard, a transformer ratio adjustment is suggested after proposing a low-error magnetic model. Its accuracy is high enough to consider different air gaps and subsequently calculate inductance with reference to 3D finite element analysis (3D-FEA). Finally, we take advantage of a test bench to show the exactness and proficiency of the suggested transformer ratio adjustment.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Approach to Low-Thrust Maneuvering Spacecraft Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian estimation with an explicit transitional prior is required for a tracking algorithm to be embedded in most multi-target tracking frameworks. This paper describes a novel approach capable of tracking maneuvering spacecraft with an explicit transitional prior and in a Bayesian framework, with fewer than two observations passes per day. The algorithm samples thrust profiles according to a multivariate Laplace distribution. It is shown that multivariate Laplace distributions are particularly suited to track maneuvering spacecraft, leading to a log probability function that is almost linear with the thrust. Principles from rare event simulation theory are used to propagate the tails of the distribution. Fast propagation is enabled by multi-fidelity methods. Because of the diffuse transitional prior, a novel k-nearest neighbor-based ensemble Gaussian mixture filter is developed and used.The method allows Bayesian tracking of maneuvering spacecraft for several scenarios with fewer than two measurement passes per day, and with a mismatch between the true and expected thrust magnitude of up to a factor of 200. The validity domain and statistical significance of the method are shown by simulation through several Monte Carlo trials in different scenarios and with different filter settings.</description>

      <title>Experimental Validation of a 3GPP Compliant 5G-Based Positioning System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of 5G positioning techniques by 3GPP has unlocked possibilities for applications in public safety, vehicular systems, and location-based services. However, these applications demand accurate and reliable positioning performance, which has led to the proposal of newer positioning techniques. To further advance the research on these techniques, in this paper, we develop a 3GPP-compliant 5G positioning testbed, incorporating gNodeBs (gNBs) and User Equipment (UE). The testbed uses New Radio (NR) Positioning Reference Signals (PRS) transmitted by the gNB to generate Time of Arrival (TOA) estimates at the UE. We mathematically model the inter-gNB and UE-gNB time offsets affecting the TOA estimates and examine their impact on positioning performance. Additionally, we propose a calibration method for estimating these time offsets. Furthermore, we investigate the environmental impact on the TOA estimates. Our findings are based on our mathematical model and supported by experimental results.</description>

      <title>Structured Connectivity for 6G Reflex Arc: Task-Oriented Virtual User and New Uplink-Downlink Tradeoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To accommodate the evolving demands of unmanned operations, the future sixth-generation (6G) network will support not only communication links but also sensing-communication-computing-control ($\mathbf{SC}^3$) loops. In each $\mathbf{SC}^3$ cycle, the sensor uploads sensing data to the computing center, and the computing center calculates the control command and sends it to the actuator to take action. To maintain the task-level connections between the sensor-computing center link and the computing center-actuator link, we propose to treat the sensor and actuator as a virtual user. In this way, the two communication links of the $\mathbf{SC}^3$ loop become the uplink and downlink (UL&amp;DL) of the virtual user. Based on the virtual user, we propose a task-oriented UL&amp;DL optimization scheme. This scheme jointly optimizes UL&amp;DL transmit power, time, bandwidth, and CPU frequency to minimize the control linear quadratic regulator (LQR) cost. We decouple the complex problem into a convex UL&amp;DL bandwidth allocation problem with the closed-form solution for the optimal time allocation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves a task-level balance between the UL&amp;DL, surpassing conventional communication schemes that optimize each link separately.</description>

      <title>Sensing-Communication-Computing-Control Closed-Loop Optimization for 6G Unmanned Robotic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid advancements in field robots have brought a new kind of cyber physical system (CPS)--unmanned robotic system--under the spotlight. In the upcoming sixth-generation (6G) era, these systems hold great potential to replace humans in hazardous tasks. This paper investigates an unmanned robotic system comprising a multi-functional unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), sensors, and actuators. The UAV carries communication and computing modules, acting as an edge information hub (EIH) that transfers and processes information. During the task execution, the EIH gathers sensing data, calculates control commands, and transmits commands to actuators--leading to reflex-arc-like sensing-communication-computing-control ($\mathbf{SC}^3$) loops. Unlike existing studies that design $\mathbf{SC}^3$ loop components separately, we take each $\mathbf{SC}^3$ loop as an integrated structure and propose a goal-oriented closed-loop optimization scheme. This scheme jointly optimizes uplink and downlink (UL&amp;DL) communication and computing within and across the $\mathbf{SC}^3$ loops to minimize the total linear quadratic regulator (LQR) cost. We derive optimal closed-form solutions for intra-loop allocation and propose an efficient iterative algorithm for inter-loop optimization. Under the condition of adequate CPU frequency availability, we derive an approximate closed-form solution for inter-loop bandwidth allocation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves a two-tier task-level balance within and across $\mathbf{SC}^3$ loops.</description>

      <title>Learn 2 Rage: Experiencing The Emotional Roller Coaster That Is Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents the experiments and solution outline for our teams winning submission in the Learn To Race Autonomous Racing Virtual Challenge 2022 hosted by AIcrowd. The objective of the Learn-to-Race competition is to push the boundary of autonomous technology, with a focus on achieving the safety benefits of autonomous driving. In the description the competition is framed as a reinforcement learning (RL) challenge. We focused our initial efforts on implementation of Soft Actor Critic (SAC) variants. Our goal was to learn non-trivial control of the race car exclusively from visual and geometric features, directly mapping pixels to control actions. We made suitable modifications to the default reward policy aiming to promote smooth steering and acceleration control. The framework for the competition provided real time simulation, meaning a single episode (learning experience) is measured in minutes. Instead of pursuing parallelisation of episodes we opted to explore a more traditional approach in which the visual perception was processed (via learned operators) and fed into rule-based controllers. Such a system, while not as academically "attractive" as a pixels-to-actions approach, results in a system that requires less training, is more explainable, generalises better and is easily tuned and ultimately out-performed all other agents in the competition by a large margin.</description>

      <title>Bearing-Only Solution for Fermat-Weber Location Problem: Generalized Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents novel algorithms for the Fermat-Weber Location Problem, guiding an autonomous agent to the point that minimizes the weighted sum of Euclidean distances to some beacons using only bearing measurements. The existing results address only the simple scenario where the beacons are stationary and the agent is modeled by a single integrator. In this paper, we propose a number of bearing-only algorithms that let the agent, which can be modeled as either a single-integrator or a double-integrator, follow the Fermat-Weber point of a group of stationary or moving beacons. The theoretical results are rigorously proven using Lyapunov theory and supported with simulation examples.</description>

      <title>Constraint-adaptive MPC for large-scale systems: Satisfying state constraints without imposing them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a successful control methodology, which is applied to increasingly complex systems. However, real-time feasibility of MPC can be challenging for complex systems, certainly when an (extremely) large number of constraints have to be adhered to. For such scenarios with a large number of state constraints, this paper proposes two novel MPC schemes for general nonlinear systems, which we call constraint-adaptive MPC. These novel schemes dynamically select at each time step a (varying) set of constraints that are included in the on-line optimization problem. Carefully selecting the included constraints can significantly reduce, as we will demonstrate, the computational complexity with often only a slight impact on the closed-loop performance. Although not all (state) constraints are imposed in the on-line optimization, the schemes still guarantee recursive feasibility and constraint satisfaction. A numerical case study illustrates the proposed MPC schemes and demonstrates the achieved computation time improvements exceeding two orders of magnitude without loss of performance.</description>

      <title>LLM-Aided Efficient Hardware Design Automation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapidly increasing complexity of modern chips, hardware engineers are required to invest more effort in tasks such as circuit design, verification, and physical implementation. These workflows often involve continuous modifications, which are labor-intensive and prone to errors. Therefore, there is an increasing need for more efficient and cost-effective Electronic Design Automation (EDA) solutions to accelerate new hardware development. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have made significant advancements in contextual understanding, logical reasoning, and response generation. Since hardware designs and intermediate scripts can be expressed in text format, it is reasonable to explore whether integrating LLMs into EDA could simplify and fully automate the entire workflow. Accordingly, this paper discusses such possibilities in several aspects, covering hardware description language (HDL) generation, code debugging, design verification, and physical implementation. Two case studies, along with their future outlook, are introduced to highlight the capabilities of LLMs in code repair and testbench generation. Finally, future directions and challenges are highlighted to further explore the potential of LLMs in shaping the next-generation EDA</description>

      <title>Active Target Tracking Using Bearing-only Measurements With Gaussian Process Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the tracking problem of target with the partially unknown motion model by an active agent with bearing-only measurements using Gaussian process learning. To address this problem, a learning-planning-control framework is proposed. First, to learn and predict the target motion under mild assumptions, a Gaussian-process-based scheme is proposed, and a probabilistic uniform prediction error bound can be rigorously proved. Second, by analyzing the data dependence of the posterior covariance, we obtain an optimal relative trajectory to achieve efficient sampling. Third, to realize efficient learning, a controller to track the planned path is proposed based on the learned target motion, which can provide guaranteed tracking performance. Theoretical analysis is conducted to prove the the given probabilistic error bounds. Numerical examples and comparison with other typical methods verify the feasibility and superior performance of our proposed framework.</description>

      <title>A New Definition of Demand Response in the Distributed Energy Resource Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Demand response is a concept that has been around since the very first electric power systems. However, we have seen an explosion of research on demand response and demand-side technologies in the past 30 years, coinciding with the shift towards liberalized/deregulated electricity markets and efforts to decarbonize the power sector. Now we are also seeing a shift towards more distributed/decentralized electric systems; we have entered the era of "distributed energy resources," which require new grid management, operational, and control strategies. Given this paradigm shift, we argue that the concept of demand response needs to be revisited, and more carefully/consistently defined to enable us to better utilize this massive resource for economic, technical, environmental, and societal aims. In this paper, we survey existing demand response definitions, highlight their shortcomings, propose a new definition, and describe how this new definition enables us to more effectively harness the value of demand response in modern power systems. We conclude with a demand response research agenda informed by a discussion of demand response barriers and enablers.</description>

      <title>A frequency-domain approach for estimating continuous-time diffusively coupled linear networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of consistently estimating a continuous-time (CT) diffusively coupled network (DCN) to identify physical components in a physical network. We develop a three-step frequency-domain identification method for linear CT DCNs that allows to accurately recover all the physical component values of the network while exploiting the particular symmetric structure in a DCN model. This method uses the estimated noise covariance as a non-parametric noise model to minimize variance of the parameter estimates, obviating the need to select a parametric noise model. Moreover, this method is extended to subnetworks identification, which enables identifying the local dynamics in DCNs on the basis of partial measurements. The method is illustrated with an application from In-Circuit Testing of printed circuit boards. Experimental results highlight the method's ability to consistently estimate component values in a complex network with only a single excitation.</description>

      <title>Empowering Cognitive Digital Twins with Generative Foundation Models: Developing a Low-Carbon Integrated Freight Transportation System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective monitoring of freight transportation is essential for advancing sustainable, low-carbon economies. Traditional methods relying on single-modal data and discrete simulations fall short in optimizing intermodal systems holistically. These systems involve interconnected processes that affect shipping time, costs, emissions, and socio-economic factors. Developing digital twins for real-time awareness, predictive analytics, and urban logistics optimization requires extensive efforts in knowledge discovery, data integration, and multi-domain simulation. Recent advancements in generative AI offer new opportunities to streamline digital twin development by automating knowledge discovery and data integration, generating innovative simulation and optimization solutions. These models extend digital twins' capabilities by promoting autonomous workflows for data engineering, analytics, and software development. This paper proposes an innovative paradigm that leverages generative AI to enhance digital twins for urban research and operations. Using freight decarbonization as a case study, we propose a conceptual framework employing transformer-based language models to enhance an urban digital twin through foundation models.

      <title>Movement Control of Smart Mosque's Domes using CSRNet and Fuzzy Logic Techniques</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mosques are worship places of Allah and must be preserved clean, immaculate, provide all the comforts of the worshippers in them. The prophet's mosque in Medina/ Saudi Arabia is one of the most important mosques for Muslims. It occupies second place after the sacred mosque in Mecca/ Saudi Arabia, which is in constant overcrowding by all Muslims to visit the prophet Mohammad's tomb. This paper aims to propose a smart dome model to preserve the fresh air and allow the sunlight to enter the mosque using artificial intelligence techniques. The proposed model controls domes movements based on the weather conditions and the overcrowding rates in the mosque. The data have been collected from two different resources, the first one from the database of Saudi Arabia weather's history, and the other from Shanghai Technology Database. Congested Scene Recognition Network (CSRNet) and Fuzzy techniques have applied using Python programming language to control the domes to be opened and closed for a specific time to renew the air inside the mosque. Also, this model consists of several parts that are connected for controlling the mechanism of opening/closing domes according to weather data and the situation of crowding in the mosque. Finally, the main goal of this paper has been achieved, and the proposed model has worked efficiently and specifies the exact duration time to keep the domes open automatically for a few minutes for each hour head.</description>

      <title>1-2-3-Go! Policy Synthesis for Parameterized Markov Decision Processes via Decision-Tree Learning and Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the advances in probabilistic model checking, the scalability of the verification methods remains limited. In particular, the state space often becomes extremely large when instantiating parameterized Markov decision processes (MDPs) even with moderate values. Synthesizing policies for such \emph{huge} MDPs is beyond the reach of available tools. We propose a learning-based approach to obtain a reasonable policy for such huge MDPs.
  The idea is to generalize optimal policies obtained by model-checking small instances to larger ones using decision-tree learning. Consequently, our method bypasses the need for explicit state-space exploration of large models, providing a practical solution to the state-space explosion problem. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by performing extensive experimentation on the relevant models from the quantitative verification benchmark set. The experimental results indicate that our policies perform well, even when the size of the model is orders of magnitude beyond the reach of state-of-the-art analysis tools.</description>

      <title>Data Publishing in Mechanics and Dynamics: Challenges, Guidelines, and Examples from Engineering Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-based methods have gained increasing importance in engineering, especially but not only driven by successes with deep artificial neural networks. Success stories are prevalent, e.g., in areas such as data-driven modeling, control and automation, as well as surrogate modeling for accelerated simulation. Beyond engineering, generative and large-language models are increasingly performing and helping with tasks that, previously, were solely associated with creative human processes. Thus, it seems timely to seek artificial-intelligence-support for engineering design tasks to automate, help with, or accelerate purpose-built designs of engineering systems, e.g., in mechanics and dynamics, where design so far requires a lot of specialized knowledge. However, research-wise, compared to established, predominantly first-principles-based methods, the datasets used for training, validation, and test become an almost inherent part of the overall methodology. Thus, data publishing becomes just as important in (data-driven) engineering science as appropriate descriptions of conventional methodology in publications in the past. This article analyzes the value and challenges of data publishing in mechanics and dynamics, in particular regarding engineering design tasks, showing that the latter raise also challenges and considerations not typical in fields where data-driven methods have been booming originally. Possible ways to deal with these challenges are discussed and a set of examples from across different design problems shows how data publishing can be put into practice. The analysis, discussions, and examples are based on the research experience made in a priority program of the German research foundation focusing on research on artificially intelligent design assistants in mechanics and dynamics.</description>

      <title>AC-Network-Informed DC Optimal Power Flow for Electricity Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a parametric quadratic approximation of the AC optimal power flow (AC-OPF) problem for time-sensitive and market-based applications. The parametric approximation preserves the physics-based but simple representation provided by the DC-OPF model and leverages market and physics information encoded in the data-driven demand-dependent parameters. To enable the deployment of the proposed model for real-time applications, we propose a supervised learning approach to predict near-optimal parameters, given a certain metric concerning the dispatch quantities and locational marginal prices (LMPs). The training dataset is generated based on the solution of the accurate AC-OPF problem and a bilevel optimization problem, which calibrates parameters satisfying two market properties: cost recovery and revenue adequacy. We show the proposed approach's performance in various test systems in terms of cost and dispatch approximation errors, LMPs, market properties satisfaction, dispatch feasibility, and generalizability with respect to N-1 network topologies.</description>

      <title>Towards Reinforcement Learning Controllers for Soft Robots using Learned Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soft robotic manipulators offer operational advantage due to their compliant and deformable structures. However, their inherently nonlinear dynamics presents substantial challenges. Traditional analytical methods often depend on simplifying assumptions, while learning-based techniques can be computationally demanding and limit the control policies to existing data. This paper introduces a novel approach to soft robotic control, leveraging state-of-the-art policy gradient methods within parallelizable synthetic environments learned from data. We also propose a safety oriented actuation space exploration protocol via cascaded updates and weighted randomness. Specifically, our recurrent forward dynamics model is learned by generating a training dataset from a physically safe \textit{mean reverting} random walk in actuation space to explore the partially-observed state-space. We demonstrate a reinforcement learning approach towards closed-loop control through state-of-the-art actor-critic methods, which efficiently learn high-performance behaviour over long horizons. This approach removes the need for any knowledge regarding the robot's operation or capabilities and sets the stage for a comprehensive benchmarking tool in soft robotics control.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the existence of solutions of reversible and irreversible port-Hamiltonian systems. To this end, we utilize the associated exergy, a function that is composed of the system's Hamiltonian and entropy, to prove global existence in time for bounded control functions. The results are then leveraged to prove existence of solutions of energy- and entropy-optimal control problems. Last, we explore model predictive control tailored to irreversible port-Hamiltonian systems by means of a numerical case study with a heat exchanger network.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning with Model Predictive Control for Highway Ramp Metering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08820v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the backdrop of an increasingly pressing need for effective urban and highway transportation systems, this work explores the synergy between model-based and learning-based strategies to enhance traffic flow management by use of an innovative approach to the problem of ramp metering control that embeds Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques within the Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework. The control problem is formulated as an RL task by crafting a suitable stage cost function that is representative of the traffic conditions, variability in the control action, and violations of the constraint on the maximum number of vehicles in queue. An MPC-based RL approach, which leverages the MPC optimal problem as a function approximation for the RL algorithm, is proposed to learn to efficiently control an on-ramp and satisfy its constraints despite uncertainties in the system model and variable demands. Simulations are performed on a benchmark small-scale highway network to compare the proposed methodology against other state-of-the-art control approaches. Results show that, starting from an MPC controller that has an imprecise model and is poorly tuned, the proposed methodology is able to effectively learn to improve the control policy such that congestion in the network is reduced and constraints are satisfied, yielding an improved performance that is superior to the other controllers.</description>

      <title>State-action control barrier functions: Imposing safety on learning-based control with low online computational costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning-based control with safety guarantees usually requires real-time safety certification and modifications of possibly unsafe learning-based policies. The control barrier function (CBF) method uses a safety filter containing a constrained optimization problem to produce safe policies. However, finding a valid CBF for a general nonlinear system requires a complex function parameterization, which in general, makes the policy optimization problem difficult to solve in real time. For nonlinear systems with nonlinear state constraints, this paper proposes the novel concept of state-action CBFs, which not only characterize the safety at each state but also evaluate the control inputs taken at each state. State-action CBFs, in contrast to CBFs, enable a flexible parameterization, resulting in a safety filter that involves a convex quadratic optimization problem. This, in turn, significantly alleviates the online computational burden. To synthesize state-action CBFs, we propose a learning-based approach exploiting Hamilton-Jacobi reachability. The effect of learning errors on the effectiveness of state-action CBFs is addressed by constraint tightening and introducing a new concept called contractive CBFs. These contributions ensure formal safety guarantees for learned CBFs and control policies, enhancing the applicability of learning-based control in real-time scenarios. Simulation results on an inverted pendulum with elastic walls validate the proposed CBFs in terms of constraint satisfaction and CPU time.</description>

      <title>Provably Safe Neural Network Controllers via Differential Dynamic Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10998v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While neural networks (NNs) have potential as autonomous controllers for Cyber-Physical Systems, verifying the safety of NN based control systems (NNCSs) poses significant challenges for the practical use of NNs, especially when safety is needed for unbounded time horizons. One reason is the intractability of analyzing NNs, ODEs and hybrid systems. To this end, we introduce VerSAILLE (Verifiably Safe AI via Logically Linked Envelopes): The first general approach that allows reusing control theory results for NNCS verification. By joining forces, we exploit the efficiency of NN verification tools while retaining the rigor of differential dynamic logic (dL). Based on provably safe control envelopes in dL, we derive specifications for the NN which is proven via NN verification. We show that a proof of the NN adhering to the specification is mirrored by a dL proof on the infinite-time safety of the NNCS.
  The NN verification properties resulting from hybrid systems typically contain nonlinear arithmetic and arbitrary logical structures while efficient NN verification merely supports linear constraints. To overcome this divide, we present Mosaic: An efficient, sound and complete verification approach for polynomial real arithmetic properties on piece-wise linear NNs. Mosaic partitions complex verification queries into simple queries and lifts off-the-shelf linear constraint tools to the nonlinear setting in a completeness-preserving manner by combining approximation with exact reasoning for counterexample regions. Our evaluation demonstrates the versatility of VerSAILLE and Mosaic: We prove infinite-time safety on the classical Vertical Airborne Collision Avoidance NNCS verification benchmark for two scenarios while (exhaustively) enumerating counterexample regions in unsafe scenarios. We also show that our approach significantly outperforms State-of-the-Art tools in closed-loop NNV.</description>

      <title>Fault-tolerant properties of scale-free linear protocols for synchronization of homogeneous multi-agent systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Originally, protocols were designed for multi-agent systems (MAS) using information about the network which might not be available. Recently, there has been a focus on scale-free synchronization where the protocol is designed without any prior information about the network.
  As long as the network contains a directed spanning tree, a scale-free protocol guarantees that the network achieves synchronization.
  If there is no directed spanning tree then synchronization cannot be achieved. But what happens when these scale-free protocols are applied to such a network where the directed spanning tree no longer exists? This paper establishes that the network decomposes into a number of basic bicomponents which achieves synchronization among all nodes in this basic bicomponent. On the other hand, nodes which are not part of any basic bicomponent converge to a weighted average of the synchronized trajectories of the basic bicomponents. The weights are independent of the initial conditions and are independent of the designed protocol.</description>

      <title>Asymmetry of Frequency Distribution in Power Systems: Sources, Estimation, Impact and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper analyses an emerging real-world phenomena in inverter-based renewable-dominated power systems, namely, asymmetry of frequency distribution. The paper first provides a rationale on why asymmetry reduces the "quality" of the frequency control and system operation. Then it provides qualitative theoretical insights that explain asymmetry in terms of the nonlinearity of real-world power systems and associated models. In particular network losses and pitch angle-based frequency control of wind power plants are discussed. Then the paper proposes a nonlinear compensation control to reduce the asymmetry as well as a statistical metric based on the frequency probability distribution to quantify the level of asymmetry in a power system. Real-world data obtained from the Irish and Australian transmission systems serve to support the theoretical appraisal, whereas simulations based on an IEEE benchmark system show the effectiveness of the proposed nonlinear compensation. The case study also shows that, while automatic generation control reduces asymmetry, frequency control limits and droop-based frequency support provided by wind generation using a tight deadband of 15 mHz, namely active power control, leads to a significant increase in the asymmetry of the frequency probability distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a triggered Batch Least-Squares Identifier (BaLSI) based adaptive safety control scheme is proposed for uncertain systems with potentially conflicting control objectives and safety constraints. A relaxation term is added to the Quadratic Programs (QP) combining the transformed Control Lyapunov Functions (CLFs) and Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), to mediate the potential conflict. The existing Lyapunov-based adaptive schemes designed to guarantee specific properties of the Lyapunov functions, may grow unboundedly under the effects of the relaxation term. The adaptive law is designed by processing system inputs and outputs, to avoid unbounded estimates and overparameterization problems in the existing results. A safetytriggered condition is presented, based on which the forward invariant property of the safe set is shown and Zeno behavior can be excluded. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive control scheme.</description>

Abstract: The evolving energy landscape has propelled energy communities to the forefront of modern energy management. However, existing research has yet to explore the potential synergies between data centres and energy communities, necessitating an assessment on their collective capabilities for cost efficiency, waste heat optimisation, and market participation. This paper presents a mixed integer linear programming model to assess the collaborative performance of energy communities, data centres and energy markets. The evaluation focuses on the efficient use of waste heat and the flexibility of job scheduling while minimising system energy costs and maintaining quality of service requirements for data centres. Our results, based on realistic profiles of an energy community and a data centre, showcase significant benefits of these synergies, with a 38% reduction in operating costs and an 87% decrease in heat demand.</description>

      <title>Effective Finite Time Stability Control for Human-Machine Shared Vehicle Following System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the development of intelligent connected vehicle technology, human-machine shared control has gained popularity in vehicle following due to its effectiveness in driver assistance. However, traditional vehicle following systems struggle to maintain stability when driver reaction time fluctuates, as these variations require different levels of system intervention. To address this issue, the proposed human-machine shared vehicle following assistance system (HM-VFAS) integrates driver outputs under various states with the assistance system. The system employs an intelligent driver model that accounts for reaction time delays, simulating time-varying driver outputs. A control authority allocation strategy is designed to dynamically adjust the level of intervention based on real-time driver state assessment. To handle instability from driver authority switching, the proposed solution includes a two-layer adaptive finite time sliding mode controller (A-FTSMC). The first layer is an integral sliding mode adaptive controller that ensures robustness by compensating for uncertainties in the driver output. The second layer is a fast non-singular terminal sliding mode controller designed to accelerate convergence for rapid stabilization. Using real driver videos as inputs, the performance of the HM-VFAS was evaluated. Results show that the proposed control strategy maintains a safe distance under time-varying driver states, with the actual acceleration error relative to the target acceleration maintained within 0.5m/s~2 and the maximum acceleration error reduced by 1.2m/s~2. Compared to traditional controllers, the A-FTSMC controller offers faster convergence and less vibration, reducing the stabilization time by 27.3%.</description>

      <title>Neural-Rendezvous: Provably Robust Guidance and Control to Encounter Interstellar Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.04883v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interstellar objects (ISOs) are likely representatives of primitive materials invaluable in understanding exoplanetary star systems. Due to their poorly constrained orbits with generally high inclinations and relative velocities, however, exploring ISOs with conventional human-in-the-loop approaches is significantly challenging. This paper presents Neural-Rendezvous -- a deep learning-based guidance and control framework for encountering fast-moving objects, including ISOs, robustly, accurately, and autonomously in real time. It uses pointwise minimum norm tracking control on top of a guidance policy modeled by a spectrally-normalized deep neural network, where its hyperparameters are tuned with a loss function directly penalizing the MPC state trajectory tracking error. We show that Neural-Rendezvous provides a high probability exponential bound on the expected spacecraft delivery error, the proof of which leverages stochastic incremental stability analysis. In particular, it is used to construct a non-negative function with a supermartingale property, explicitly accounting for the ISO state uncertainty and the local nature of nonlinear state estimation guarantees. In numerical simulations, Neural-Rendezvous is demonstrated to satisfy the expected error bound for 100 ISO candidates. This performance is also empirically validated using our spacecraft simulator and in high-conflict and distributed UAV swarm reconfiguration with up to 20 UAVs.</description>

      <title>Where to Decide? Centralized vs. Distributed Vehicle Assignment for Platoon Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09580v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Platooning is a promising cooperative driving application for future intelligent transportation systems. In order to assign vehicles to platoons, some algorithm for platoon formation is required. Such vehicle-to-platoon assignments have to be computed on-demand, e.g., when vehicles join or leave the freeways. In order to get best results from platooning, individual properties of involved vehicles have to be considered during the assignment computation. In this paper, we explore the computation of vehicle-to-platoon assignments as an optimization problem based on similarity between vehicles. We define the similarity and, vice versa, the deviation among vehicles based on the desired driving speed of vehicles and their position on the road. We create three approaches to solve this assignment problem: centralized solver, centralized greedy, and distributed greedy, using a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) solver and greedy heuristics, respectively. Conceptually, the approaches differ in both knowledge about vehicles as well as methodology. We perform a large-scale simulation study using PlaFoSim to compare all approaches. While the distributed greedy approach seems to have disadvantages due to the limited local knowledge, it performs as good as the centralized solver approach across most metrics. Both outperform the centralized greedy approach, which suffers from synchronization and greedy selection effects. The centralized solver approach however assumes global knowledge and requires a complex MIP solver to compute vehicle-to-platoon assignments. Overall, the distributed greedy approach achieves close to optimal results but requires the least assumptions and complexity. Therefore, we consider the distributed greedy approach the best approach among all presented approaches.</description>

      <title>Learning of Hamiltonian Dynamics with Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a method for learning Hamiltonian dynamics from a limited set of data points. The Hamiltonian vector field is found by regularized optimization over a reproducing kernel Hilbert space of vector fields that are inherently Hamiltonian, and where the vector field is required to be odd or even. This is done with a symplectic kernel, and it is shown how this symplectic kernel can be modified to be odd or even. The performance of the method is validated in simulations for two Hamiltonian systems. The simulations show that the learned dynamics reflect the energy-preservation of the Hamiltonian dynamics, and that the restriction to symplectic and odd dynamics gives improved accuracy over a large domain of the phase space.</description>

      <title>Learning Hamiltonian Dynamics with Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces and Random Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A method for learning Hamiltonian dynamics from a limited and noisy dataset is proposed. The method learns a Hamiltonian vector field on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) of inherently Hamiltonian vector fields, and in particular, odd Hamiltonian vector fields. This is done with a symplectic kernel, and it is shown how the kernel can be modified to an odd symplectic kernel to impose the odd symmetry. A random feature approximation is developed for the proposed odd kernel to reduce the problem size. The performance of the method is validated in simulations for three Hamiltonian systems. It is demonstrated that the use of an odd symplectic kernel improves prediction accuracy and data efficiency, and that the learned vector fields are Hamiltonian and exhibit the imposed odd symmetry characteristics.</description>

      <title>Exergetic Port-Hamiltonian Systems: Compositional fluid and electro-magneto hydrodynamics models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluid dynamics plays a crucial role in various multiphysics applications, including energy systems, electronics cooling, and biomedical engineering. Developing computational models for complex coupled systems can be challenging and time-consuming. In particular, ensuring the consistent integration of models from diverse physical domains requires meticulous attention. Considering the example of (electro-)magneto hydrodynamics (on a fixed spatial domain and with linear polarization and magnetization), this article demonstrates how relatively complex models can be composed from simpler parts by means of a formal language for multiphysics modeling. The Exergetic Port-Hamiltonian Systems (EPHS) modeling language features a simple graphical syntax for expressing the energy-based interconnection of subsystems. This reduces cognitive load and facilitates communication, especially in multidisciplinary environments. As the example demonstrates, existing models can be easily integrated as subsystems of new models. Specifically, the ideal fluid model is used as a subsystem of the Navier-Stokes-Fourier fluid model, which in turn is reused as a subsystem of the electro-magneto hydrodynamics model. The compositional approach makes it nearly trivial to encapsulate, reuse, and swap out (parts of) models. Moreover, structural properties of EPHS models guarantee fundamental properties of thermodynamic systems, such as conservation of energy, non-negative entropy production, and Onsager reciprocal relations.</description>

      <title>Guiding Reinforcement Learning with Incomplete System Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) is inherently a reactive method, operating under the assumption that it starts with no prior knowledge of the system and entirely depends on trial-and-error for learning. This approach faces several challenges, such as poor sample efficiency, generalization, and the need for well-designed reward functions to guide learning effectively. On the other hand, controllers based on complete system dynamics do not require data. This paper addresses the intermediate situation where there is not enough model information for complete controller design, but there is enough to suggest that a model-free approach is not the best approach either. By carefully decoupling known and unknown information about the system dynamics, we obtain an embedded controller guided by our partial model and thus improve the learning efficiency of an RL-enhanced approach. A modular design allows us to deploy mainstream RL algorithms to refine the policy. Simulation results show that our method significantly improves sample efficiency compared with standard RL methods on continuous control tasks, and also offers enhanced performance over traditional control approaches. Experiments on a real ground vehicle also validate the performance of our method, including generalization and robustness.</description>
