      <title>Boundary operators in the Brownian loop soup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain infinitely many boundary operators in the Brownian loop soup in the subcritical phase by analyzing the conformal block expansion of the two-point function that computes the probability of having two marked points on the upper half-plane being separated by Brownian loops. The resulting boundary operators are primary operators in a 2D CFT with central charge $c\leq1$ and have conformal dimensions that are non-negative integers. By comparing the above-mentioned conformal block expansion with probabilities in the Brownian loop soup, we provide a physical interpretation of the boundary operators of even dimensions as operators that insert multiple outer boundaries of Brownian loops at points on the real axis.</description>

      <title>Egorov-Type Semiclassical Limits for Open Quantum Systems with a Bi-Lindblad Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a bridge between bi-Hamiltonian structures of Poisson-Lie type, contact Hamiltonian dynamics, and the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) formalism for quantum open systems. On the classical side, we consider bi-Hamiltonian systems defined by a Poisson pencil with non-trivial invariants. Using an exact symplectic realization, these invariants are lifted and projected onto a contact manifold, yielding a completely integrable contact Hamiltonian system in terms of dissipated quantities and a Jacobi-commutative algebra of observables. On the quantum side, we introduce a class of contact-compatible Lindblad generators: GKSL evolutions whose dissipative part preserves a commutative $C^\ast$-subalgebra generated by the quantizations of the classical dissipated quantities, and whose Hamiltonian part admits an Egorov-type semiclassical limit to the contact dynamics. This construction provides a mathematical mechanism compatible with the semiclassical limit for pure dephasing, compatible with integrability and contact dissipation. An explicit Euler-top-type Poisson-Lie pencil, inspired by deformed Euler top models, is developed as a fully worked-out example illustrating the resulting bi-Lindblad structure and its semiclassical behavior.</description>

      <title>Quantum polylogarithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiple polylogarithms are periods of variations of mixed Tate motives. Conjecturally, they deliver all such periods. We introduce deformations of multiple polylogarithms depending on a complex parameter h. We call them quantum polylogarithms. Their asymptotic expansion as h goes to 0 recovers multiple polylogarithms. The quantum dilogarithm was studied by Barnes in the XIX century. Its exponent appears in many areas of Mathematics and Physics. Quantum polylogarithms satisfy a holonomic systems of modular difference equations with coefficients in variations of mixed Hodge-Tate structures of motivic origin. If h is a rational number, the quantum polylogarithms can be expressed via multiple polylogarithms. Otherwise quantum polylogarithms are not periods of variations of mixed motives, i.e. they can not be given by integrals of rational differential forms on algebraic varieties. Instead, quantum polylogarithms are integrals of differential forms built from both rational functions and exponentials of rational functions. We call them rational exponential integrals. We suggest that quantum polylogarithms reflect a very general phenomenon: Periods of variations of mixed motives should have quantum deformations.</description>

      <title>Color-kinematics duality from an algebra of superforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Color-kinematics duality states that the kinematic numerators of the cubic tree-level Yang-Mills scattering amplitudes obey the same symmetry properties that the color factors obey due to the Jacobi identity. We present a novel strategy for deriving this duality, based on the differential forms on a superspace. This space of superforms carries a generalization of a Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) algebra (BV$^{\square}$ algebra). We show that the homotopy algebra of color-stripped Yang-Mills theory is obtained as a quotient of this space in which a subspace, which is an ideal `up to homotopy', is modded out. This algebra is a subsector of a BV$_{\infty}^{\square}$ algebra. Deriving the latter would provide a first-principle proof of color-kinematics duality from field theory.</description>

      <title>Exact critical-temperature bounds for two-dimensional Ising models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive exact critical-temperature bounds for the classical ferromagnetic Ising model on two-dimensional periodic tessellations of the plane. For any such tessellation or lattice, the critical temperature is bounded from a above by a universal number that is solely determined by the largest coordination number on the lattice. Crucially, these bounds are tight in some cases such as the Honeycomb, Square, and Triangular lattices. We prove the bounds using the Feynman--Kac--Ward formalism, confirm their validity for a selection of over two hundred lattices, and construct a two-dimensional lattice with 24-coordinated sites and record high critical temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the accumulation of zeros of a polynomial arising from the enumeration of edge-coloured graphs along certain limit curves. The polynomial is a variant of an edge-chromatic polynomial, which specialises to the partition function of the ferromagnetic Ising model on a random regular graph. We call this accumulation behaviour a Lee-Yang phenomenon in analogy with the Lee-Yang theorem. The limiting loci are semialgebraic and arise from anti-Stokes curves of an exponential integral.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A collision of a rubber rod to a hard floor is regarded as a simple example of obstacle problems for elastic material. In this article we have proposed a new mathematical model for the collision phenomenon by applying beam equations with singular stress functions, which is investigated in our recent works. As in the works we have established a mathematical method to deal with the singular stress function. Here, we demonstrate the validity of our modeling through observation to the numerical results. Also, we present existence and uniqueness results of the model given as initial boundary value problems.</description>

      <title>Symmetric quiver varieties and critical stable envelopes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetric quiver varieties with potentials are natural generalizations of Nakajima quiver varieties, and their equivariant critical cohomologies provide more flexible settings for geometric representation theory and enumerative geometry. In this paper, we study their geometric properties and show that they behave like universally deformed Nakajima quiver varieties. Based on this, we provide a new proof of the existence of critical stable envelopes on them. Following an idea of Nakajima, we give a sheaf theoretic interpretation of critical stable envelopes by the hyperbolic restriction in the affinization of symmetric quiver varieties. The associativity of hyperbolic restrictions implies the triangle lemma of critical stable envelopes.</description>

      <title>Generalized Double Duals of the Riemann Tensor in Geometry and Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Riemann curvature tensor fully encodes local geometry, but its Ricci contraction retains only limited information: only the Ricci tensor and the scalar curvature survive, while the Weyl curvature vanishes identically. We show that contracting instead the double dual of the Riemann tensor unlocks the full curvature structure, producing a canonical hierarchy of symmetric, divergence--free $(p,p)$ double forms. These tensors satisfy the first Bianchi identity and obey a hereditary contraction relation interpolating between the double dual tensor and the Einstein tensor.
  We prove that, in a generic geometric setting, each tensor in this hierarchy is the unique divergence--free $(p,p)$ double form depending linearly on the Riemann curvature tensor, thereby providing canonical higher--rank parents of the Einstein tensor.
  Their sectional curvatures coincide with the $p$--curvatures; notably, the $2$--curvature determines the full Riemann curvature tensor and forces the $\hat A$--genus of a compact spin manifold to vanish when nonnegative, a property not shared by Ricci or scalar curvature. Finally, we extend the construction to Gauss--Kronecker curvature tensors and Lovelock theory, showing in particular that the second Lovelock tensor $T_4$ admits a genuine four--index parent tensor.</description>

      <title>Higher-Dimensional Anyons via Higher Cohomotopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We highlight that integer Heisenberg groups at level 2 underlie topological quantum phenomena: their group algebras coincide with the algebras of quantum observables of abelian anyons in fractional quantum Hall (FQH) systems on closed surfaces. Decades ago, these groups were shown to arise as the fundamental groups of the space of maps from the surface to the 2-sphere -- which has recently been understood as reflecting an effective FQH flux quantization in 2-Cohomotopy. Here we streamline and generalize this theorem using the homotopy theory of H-groups, showing that for $k \in \{1,2,4\}$, the non-torsion part of $\pi_1 \mathrm{Map}\big({(S^{2k-1})^2, S^{2k}}\big)$ is an integer Heisenberg group of level 2, where we identify this level with 2 divided by the Hopf invariant of the generator of $\pi_{4k-1}(S^{2k})$. This result implies the existence of higher-dimensional analogs of FQH anyons in the cohomotopical completion of 11D supergravity ("Hypothesis H").</description>

      <title>Values of ternary quadratic forms at integers and the Berry-Tabor conjecture for 3-tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Berry and Tabor conjectured in 1977 that spectra of generic integrable quantum systems have the same local statistics as a Poisson point process. We verify their conjecture in the case of the two-point spectral density for a quantum particle in a three-dimensional box, subject to a Diophantine condition on the domain's proportions. A permissible choice of width, height and depth is for example $1,2^{1/3},2^{-1/3}$. This extends previous work of Eskin, Margulis and Mozes (Annals of Math., 2005) in dimension two, where the problem reduces to the quantitative Oppenheim conjecture for quadratic forms of signature $(2,2)$. The difficulty in three and higher dimensions is that we need to consider the distribution of indefinite forms in shrinking rather than fixed intervals, which we are able to resolve for special diagonal forms of signature $(3,3)$ in various scalings, including a rate of convergence. A key step of our approach is to represent the relevant counting problem as an average of a theta function on $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})^3\backslash\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})^3$ over an expanding family of one-parameter unipotent orbits. The asymptotic behaviour of these unipotent averages follows from Ratner's measure classification theorem and subtle escape of mass estimates.</description>

      <title>Quantization of bounded symplectic domains associated with compact Lie groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a systematic quantization scheme for bounded symplectic domains of the form $D \times G \subset T^\ast G$, where $D \subset \mathfrak{g}^\ast$ is a bounded region defined by algebraic inequalities and $G$ is a compact Lie group with Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. The finiteness of the symplectic volume implies that quantization yields a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, with observables represented by Hermitian matrices, for which we provide an explicit realization. Boundary effects necessitate modifications of the standard von Neumann and Dirac conditions, which usually underlie the correspondence principle. Physically, the compact group $G$ plays the role of momentum space, while $\mathfrak{g}^\ast$ corresponds to the (noncommutative) position space of a particle. The assumption of compact momentum space has profound physical consequences, including the supertunneling phenomenon and the emergence of a maximal fermion density.</description>

Abstract: A variational formulation for non-equilibrium thermodynamics was developed by Gay-Balmaz and Yoshimura. In a recent article, the first two authors of the present paper introduced partially cosymplectic structures as a geometric framework for thermodynamic systems, recovering the evolution equations obtained variationally. In this paper, we develop a discrete variational principle for adiabatically closed simple thermodynamic systems, which can be utilised to construct numerical integrators for the dynamics of such systems. The effectiveness of our method is illustrated with several examples.</description>

      <title>The Lagrangian and symplectic structures of the Kuramoto oscillator model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite being under intense scrutiny for 50 years, the Kuramoto oscillator model has remained a quintessential representative of non-equilibrium phase transitions. One of the reasons for its enduring relevance is the apparent lack of an optimization formulation, due to the fact that (superficially), the equations of motion seem to not be compatible with a Lagrangian structure. We show that, as a mean-field classical (twisted) spin model on $S^2$, the Kuramoto model can be described variationaly. Based on this result perturbation analysis around (unstable) Kuramoto equilibria are shown to be equivalent to low-energy fluctuations of mean-field Heisenberg spin models. Intriguingly, off-plane perturbations around these equilibria configurations turn out to be described by a semiclassical Gaudin model, pointing to the fact that oscillator synchronization maps to the spin pairing mechanism investigated by Richardson and subsequently by others.</description>

      <title>Integrable systems on multiplicative quiver varieties from cyclic quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.02496v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of complex manifolds constructed as multiplicative quiver varieties associated with a cyclic quiver extended by an arbitrary number of arrows starting at a new vertex. Such varieties admit a Poisson structure, which is obtained by quasi-Hamiltonian reduction. We construct several families of Poisson subalgebras inside the coordinate ring of these spaces, which we use to obtain degenerately integrable systems. We also extend the Poisson centre of these algebras to maximal abelian Poisson algebras, hence defining Liouville integrable systems. By considering a suitable set of local coordinates on the multiplicative quiver varieties, we can derive the local Poisson structure explicitly. This allows us to interpret the integrable systems that we have constructed as new generalisations of the spin Ruijsenaars-Schneider system with several types of spin variables.</description>

      <title>On the Structure of Wave Functions in Complex Chern-Simons Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the structure of wave functions in complex Chern-Simons theory on the complement of a hyperbolic knot, emphasizing the similarities with the topological string/spectral theory correspondence. We first conjecture a hidden integrality structure in the holomorphic blocks and show that this structure guarantees the cancellation of potential singularities in the full non-perturbative wave function at rational values of the coupling constant. We then develop various techniques to determine the wave function at such rational points. Finally, we illustrate our conjectures and obtain explicit results in the examples of the figure-eight and three-twist knots. In the case of the figure-eight knot, we also perform a direct evaluation of the state integral in the rational case and observe that the resulting wave function has the features of the ground state for a quantum mirror curve.</description>

      <title>Bell-CHSH inequality and unitary transformations in Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03840v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unitary transformations are employed to enhance the violations of the Bell-CHSH inequality in relativistic Quantum Field Theory. The case of the scalar field in $1+1$ Minkowski space-time is scrutinized by relying on the Tomita-Takesaki modular theory. The example of the bounded Hermitian operator $sign(\varphi(f))$, where $\varphi(f)$ stands for the smeared scalar field, is worked out. It is shown that unitary deformations enable for violations of the Bell-CHSH inequality. The setup is generalized to the Proca vector field by means of its equivalence with the scalar theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the zero-dimensional Donaldson-Thomas invariants of the quotient stack $[\mathbb{C}^4/\mathbb{Z}_r]$, confirming a conjecture of Cao-Kool-Monavari. Our main theorem is established through an orbifold analogue of Cao-Zhao-Zhou's degeneration formula combined with the zero-dimensional Donaldson-Thomas invariants for $\mathcal{A}_{r-1}\times\mathbb{C}^2$ and an explicit determination of orientations of Hilbert schemes of points on $[\mathbb{C}^4/\mathbb{Z}_r]$.</description>

      <title>On a Grassmann odd analogue of Carrollian Manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14240v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a Grassmann odd analogue of a Carrollian manifold as a supermanifold of dimension $n|1$ with an even degenerate metric such that the kernel is generated by a non-singular odd vector field that is a supersymmetry generator. Alongside other results, we establish that the reduced manifold is a pseudo-Riemannian manifold, and show that compatible affine connections always exist, albeit they must carry torsion. As a physically relevant example, we examine an In\"on\"u--Wigner contraction of the supertranslation algebra on standard superspace $\mathbb{R}^{4|4}$.</description>

      <title>K-theoretic Hikita conjecture for quiver gauge theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study variants of Hikita conjecture for Nakajima quiver varieties and corresponding Coulomb branches. First, we derive the equivariant version of the conjecture from the non-equivariant one for a set of gauge theories. Second, we suggest a variant of the conjecture, with K-theoretic Coulomb branches involved. We show that this version follows from the usual (homological) one for a set of theories. We apply this result to prove the conjecture in finite ADE types. In the course of the proof, we show that appropriate completions of K-theoretic and homological (quantized) Coulomb branches are isomorphic.</description>

      <title>Toward a Complexity Classification of High-Temperature Bosons: Computational Tractability and Power-Law Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determining when quantum many-body systems admit simple, efficiently simulable structure is a central problem. High-temperature thermal states are a natural candidate for such simplicity, yet for bosons, the unbounded local Hilbert space and energy invalidate the usual expectation that large $T$ guarantees tractability. Here we investigate the resulting complexity boundary for interacting lattice bosons and show that the repulsive Bose--Hubbard class lies on the ``simple'' side. For a family with long-range hopping decaying as $r^{-\alpha}$, we prove convergence of a controlled cluster expansion, which implies (above an explicit temperature threshold) an efficient classical algorithm to approximate the partition function and a rigorous power-law clustering bound for connected correlations. More broadly, our results provide a first step toward charting complexity boundaries for high-temperature bosons and suggest the repulsive Bose--Hubbard class as a natural candidate cusp.</description>

      <title>Exact State Evolution and Energy Spectrum in Solvable Bosonic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solvable bosonic models provide a fundamental framework for describing light propagation in nonlinear media, including optical down-conversion processes that generate squeezed states of light and their higher-order generalizations. In quantum optics a central objective is to determine the time evolution of a given initial state. Exact analytic solution to the state-evolution problem is presented, applicable to a broad class of solvable bosonic models and arbitrary initial states. Moreover, the characteristic equation governing the energy spectrum is derived and the eigenstates are found in the form of continued fractions and as the principal minors of the associated Jacobi matrix. The results provide a solid analytical framework for discussion of exactly solvable bosonic models.</description>

      <title>Completeness conditions for spacetimes with low-regularity metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend Beem's three completeness notions -- finite compactness, timelike Cauchy completeness, and Condition A -- originally defined for spacetimes, to Lorentzian length spaces and study their relationships. We prove that finite compactness implies timelike Cauchy completeness and that timelike Cauchy completeness implies Condition A for globally hyperbolic Lorentzian length spaces. Furthermore, for globally hyperbolic $C^{1}$-spacetimes, we establish the equivalence of the three conditions assuming the causally non-branching and non-intertwining conditions, which in fact imply the continuity of the causal exponential map. These results can be regarded as a Hopf-Rinow type theorem for low-regularity Lorentzian geometry. The appendix presents examples of $C^{1}$-spacetimes -- where geodesic uniqueness may fail -- in which causal geodesics nevertheless behave well, illustrating the scope of our results.</description>

      <title>Critical behaviour of the fully packed loop-$O(n)$ model on planar triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the fully packed loop-$O(n)$ model on planar triangulations. This model is also bijectively equivalent to the Fortuin--Kasteleyn model of planar maps with parameter $q\in (0,4)$ at its self-dual point. These have been traditionally studied using either techniques from analytic combinatorics (based in particular on the gasket decomposition of Borot, Bouttier and Guitter arXiv:1106.0153) or probabilistic arguments (based on Sheffield's hamburger-cheeseburger bijection arXiv:1108.2241). In this paper we establish a dictionary relating quantities of interest in both approaches. This has several consequences. First, we derive an exact expression for the partition function of the fully packed loop-$O(n)$ model on triangulations, as a function of the outer boundary length. This confirms predictions by Gaudin and Kostov. In particular, this model exhibits critical behaviour, in the sense that the partition function exhibits a power-law decay characteristic of the critical regime at this self-dual point. Finally, we derive precise asymptotics for geometric features of the FK model of planar maps when $0 &lt; q &lt;4$, such as the exact tail behaviour of the perimeters of clusters and loops. This sharpens previous results of arXiv:1502.00450 and arXiv:1502.00546. A key step is to use the above dictionary and the probabilistic results to justify rigorously an ansatz commonly assumed in the analytic combinatorics literature.</description>

      <title>Boundary-driven quantum systems near the Zeno limit: steady states and long-time behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study composite open quantum systems with a finite-dimensional state space ${\mathcal H}_A\otimes {\mathcal H}_B$ governed by a Lindblad equation $\rho'(t) = {\mathcal L}_\gamma \rho(t)$ where ${\mathcal L}_\gamma\rho = -i[H,\rho] + \gamma {\mathcal D} \rho$, and ${\mathcal D}$ is a dissipator ${\mathcal D}_A\otimes I$ acting non-trivially only on part $A$ of the system, which can be thought of as the boundary, and $\gamma$ is a parameter. It is known that the dynamics simplifies for large $\gamma$: after a time of order $\gamma^{-1}$, $\rho(t)$ is well approximated for times small compared to $\gamma^2$ by $\pi_A\otimes R(t)$ where $\pi_A$ is a steady state of ${\mathcal D}_A$, and $R(t)$ is a solution of $\frac{{\rm d}}{{\rm d}t}R(t) = {\mathcal L}_{P,\gamma}R(t)$ where ${\mathcal L}_{P,\gamma} R := -i[H_P,R] + \gamma^{-1} {\mathcal D}_P R$ with $H_P$ being a Hamiltonian on ${\mathcal H}_B$ and ${\mathcal D}_P$ being a Lindblad generator over ${\mathcal H}_B$. We prove this assuming only that ${\mathcal D}_A$ is ergodic and gapped. In order to better control the long time behavior, and study the steady states $\bar\rho_\gamma$, we introduce a third Lindblad generator ${\mathcal D}_P^\sharp$ that does not involve $\gamma$, but still closely related to ${\mathcal L}_\gamma$. We show that if ${\mathcal D}_P^\sharp$ is ergodic and gapped, then so is ${\mathcal L}_\gamma$ for all large $\gamma$, and if $\bar\rho_\gamma$ denotes the unique steady state for ${\mathcal L}_\gamma$, then $\lim_{\gamma\to\infty}\bar\rho_\gamma = \pi_A\otimes \bar R$ where $\bar R$ is the unique steady state for ${\mathcal D}_P^\sharp$. We show that there is a convergent expansion $\bar\rho_\gamma = \pi_A\otimes\bar R +\gamma^{-1} \sum_{k=0}^\infty \gamma^{-k} \bar n_k$ where, defining $\bar n_{-1} := \pi_A\otimes\bar R$, ${\mathcal D} \bar n_k = -i[H,\bar n_{k-1}]$ for all $k\geq 0$.</description>
