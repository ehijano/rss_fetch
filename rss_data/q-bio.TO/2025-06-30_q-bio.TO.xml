      <title>Feasibility of spectral-element modeling of wave propagation through the anatomy of marine mammals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces the first 3D spectral-element method (SEM) simulation of ultrasonic wave propagation in a bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) head. Unlike traditional finite-element methods (FEM), which struggle with high-frequency simulations due to costly linear-system inversions and slower convergence, SEM offers exponential convergence and efficient parallel computation. Using Computed Tomography (CT) scan data, we developed a detailed hexahedral mesh capturing complex anatomical features, such as acoustic fats and jaws. Our simulations of plane and spherical waves confirm SEM's effectiveness for ultrasonic time-domain modeling. This approach opens new avenues for marine biology, contributing to research in echolocation, the impacts of anthropogenic marine noise pollution and the biophysics of hearing and click generation in marine mammals. By overcoming FEM's limitations, SEM provides a powerful scalable tool to test hypotheses about dolphin bioacoustics, with significant implications for conservation and understanding marine mammal auditory systems under increasing environmental challenges.</description>

      <title>Emerging AI Approaches for Cancer Spatial Omics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Technological breakthroughs in spatial omics and artificial intelligence (AI) have the potential to transform the understanding of cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment. Here we review the role of AI in spatial omics, discussing the current state-of-the-art and further needs to decipher cancer biology from large-scale spatial tissue data. An overarching challenge is the development of interpretable spatial AI models, an activity which demands not only improved data integration, but also new conceptual frameworks. We discuss emerging paradigms, in particular data-driven spatial AI, constraint-based spatial AI, and mechanistic spatial modeling, as well as the importance of integrating AI with hypothesis-driven strategies and model systems to realize the value of cancer spatial information.</description>

      <title>A functional exchange shunt in the umbilical cord: the role of coiling in solute and heat transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The umbilical cord plays a critical role in delivering nutrients and oxygen from the placenta to the fetus through the umbilical vein, while the two umbilical arteries carry deoxygenated blood with waste products back to the placenta. Although solute exchange in the placenta has been extensively studied, exchange within the cord tissue has not been investigated. Here, we explore the hypothesis that the coiled structure of the umbilical cord could strengthen diffusive coupling between the arteries and the vein, resulting in a functional shunt. We calculate the diffusion of solutes, such as oxygen, and heat in the umbilical cord to quantify how this shunt is affected by vascular configuration within the cord. We demonstrate that the shunt is enhanced by coiling and vessel proximity. Furthermore, our model predicts that typical vascular configurations of the human cord tend to minimise shunting, which could otherwise disrupt thermal regulation of the fetus. We also show that the exchange, amplified by coiling, can provide additional oxygen supply to the cord tissue surrounding the umbilical vessels.</description>
