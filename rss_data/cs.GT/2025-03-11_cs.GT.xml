      <title>Welfare Approximation in Additively Separable Hedonic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partitioning a set of $n$ items or agents while maximizing the value of the partition is a fundamental algorithmic task. We study this problem in the specific setting of maximizing social welfare in additively separable hedonic games. Unfortunately, this task faces strong computational boundaries: Extending previous results, we show that approximating welfare by a factor of $n^{1-\epsilon}$ is NP-hard, even for severely restricted weights. However, we can obtain a randomized $\log n$-approximation on instances for which the sum of input valuations is nonnegative. Finally, we study two stochastic models of aversion-to-enemies games, where the weights are derived from Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi or multipartite graphs. We obtain constant-factor and logarithmic-factor approximations with high probability.</description>

      <title>A Practical Guide to Budget Pacing Algorithms in Digital Advertising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A typical real-time ad-serving funnel comprises ad targeting, conversion modeling (e.g., click-through rate prediction), budget pacing (bidding), and auction processes. While there is a wealth of research and articles on ad targeting and conversion modeling, budget pacing,a crucial component,lacks a systematic treatment specifically tailored for engineers in existing literature. This book aims to provide engineers with a practical yet relatively comprehensive introduction to budget pacing algorithms within the digital advertising domain.</description>

      <title>Are System Optimal Dynamic Flows Implementable by Tolls?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A seminal result of [Fleischer et al. and Karakostas and Kolliopulos, both FOCS 2004] states that system optimal multi-commodity static network flows are always implementable as tolled Wardrop equilibrium flows even if users have heterogeneous value-of-time sensitivities. Their proof uses LP-duality to characterize the general implementability of network flows by tolls. For the much more complex setting of $\textit{dynamic flows}$, [Graf et al., SODA 2025] identified necessary and sufficient conditions for a dynamic $s$-$d$ flow to be implementable as a tolled dynamic equilibrium. They used the machinery of (infinite-dimensional) strong duality to obtain their characterizations. Their work, however, does not answer the question of whether system optimal dynamic network flows are implementable by tolls.
  We consider this question for a general dynamic flow model involving multiple commodities with individual source-destination pairs, fixed inflow rates and heterogeneous valuations of travel time and money spent. We present both a positive and a, perhaps surprising, negative result: For the negative result, we provide a network with multiple source and destination pairs in which under the Vickrey queuing model no system optimal flow is implementable -- even if all users value travel times and spent money the same. Our counter-example even shows that the ratio of the achievable equilibrium travel times by using tolls and of the system optimal travel times can be unbounded. For the single-source, single-destination case, we show that if the traversal time functions are suitably well-behaved (as is the case, for example, in the Vickrey queuing model), any system optimal flow is implementable.</description>

      <title>Incentive-Compatible Recovery from Manipulated Signals, with Applications to Decentralized Physical Infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the first formal model capturing the elicitation of unverifiable information from a party (the "source") with implicit signals derived by other players (the "observers"). Our model is motivated in part by applications in decentralized physical infrastructure networks (a.k.a. "DePIN"), an emerging application domain in which physical services (e.g., sensor information, bandwidth, or energy) are provided at least in part by untrusted and self-interested parties. A key challenge in these signal network applications is verifying the level of service that was actually provided by network participants.
  We first establish a condition called source identifiability, which we show is necessary for the existence of a mechanism for which truthful signal reporting is a strict equilibrium. For a converse, we build on techniques from peer prediction to show that in every signal network that satisfies the source identifiability condition, there is in fact a strictly truthful mechanism, where truthful signal reporting gives strictly higher total expected payoff than any less informative equilibrium. We furthermore show that this truthful equilibrium is in fact the unique equilibrium of the mechanism if there is positive probability that any one observer is unconditionally honest (e.g., if an observer were run by the network owner). Also, by extending our condition to coalitions, we show that there are generally no collusion-resistant mechanisms in the settings that we consider.
  We apply our framework and results to two DePIN applications: proving location, and proving bandwidth. In the location-proving setting observers learn (potentially enlarged) Euclidean distances to the source. Here, our condition has an appealing geometric interpretation, implying that the source's location can be truthfully elicited if and only if it is guaranteed to lie inside the convex hull of the observers.</description>

      <title>Construction of Compromise Values for Cooperative Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a broad class of values for cooperative games in characteristic function form, known as compromise values. These values efficiently allocate payoffs by linearly combining well-specified upper and lower bounds on payoffs. We identify subclasses of games that admit non-trivial efficient allocations within the considered bounds, which we call bound-balanced games. Subsequently, we define the associated compromise value. We also provide an axiomatisation of this class of compromise values using a combination of the minimal-rights property and a variant of restricted proportionality.
  We construct and axiomatise various well-known and new compromise values based on these methods, including the $\tau$-, the $\chi$-, the Gately, the CIS-, the PANSC-, the EANSC-, and the new KM-values. We conclude that this approach establishes a common foundation for a wide range of different values.</description>

      <title>ElementaryNet: A Non-Strategic Neural Network for Predicting Human Behavior in Normal-Form Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Models of human behavior in game-theoretic settings often distinguish between strategic behavior, in which a player both reasons about how others will act and best responds to these beliefs, and "level-0" non-strategic behavior, in which they do not respond to explicit beliefs about others. The state of the art for predicting human behavior on unrepeated simultaneous-move games is GameNet, a neural network that learns extremely complex level-0 specifications from data. The current paper makes three contributions. First, it shows that GameNet's level-0 specifications are too powerful, because they are capable of strategic reasoning. Second, it introduces a novel neural network architecture (dubbed ElementaryNet) and proves that it is only capable of nonstrategic behavior. Third, it describes an extensive experimental evaluation of ElementaryNet. Our overall findings are that (1) ElementaryNet dramatically underperforms GameNet when neither model is allowed to explicitly model higher level agents who best-respond to the model's predictions, indicating that good performance on our dataset requires a model capable of strategic reasoning; (2) that the two models achieve statistically indistinguishable performance when such higher-level agents are introduced, meaning that ElementaryNet's restriction to a non-strategic level-0 specification does not degrade model performance; and (3) that this continues to hold even when ElementaryNet is restricted to a set of level-0 building blocks previously introduced in the literature, with only the functional form being learned by the neural network.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Graph Traversal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research considers Bayesian decision-analytic approaches toward the traversal of an uncertain graph. Namely, a traveler progresses over a graph in which rewards are gained upon a node's first visit and costs are incurred for every edge traversal. The traveler knows the graph's adjacency matrix and his starting position but does not know the rewards and costs. The traveler is a Bayesian who encodes his beliefs about these values using a Gaussian process prior and who seeks to maximize his expected utility over these beliefs. Adopting a decision-analytic perspective, we develop sequential decision-making solution strategies for this coupled information-collection and network-routing problem. We show that the problem is NP-Hard and derive properties of the optimal walk. These properties provide heuristics for the traveler's problem that balance exploration and exploitation. We provide a practical case study focused on the use of unmanned aerial systems for public safety and empirically study policy performance in myriad Erdos-Renyi settings.</description>

      <title>The Role of the Marketplace Operator in Inducing Competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The steady rise of e-commerce marketplaces underscores the need to study a market structure that captures the key features of this setting. To this end, we consider a price-quantity Stackelberg duopoly in which the leader is the marketplace operator and the follower is an independent seller. The objective of the marketplace operator is to maximize a weighted sum of profit and a term capturing positive customer experience, whereas the independent seller solely seeks to maximize their own profit. Furthermore, the independent seller is required to share a fraction of their revenue with the marketplace operator for the privilege of selling on the platform. We derive the subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium of this game and find that the equilibrium strategies depend on the assumed rationing rule. We then consider practical implications for marketplace operators. Finally, we show that, under intensity rationing, consumer surplus and total welfare in the duopoly marketplace is always at least as high as under an independent seller monopoly, demonstrating that it is socially beneficial for the operator to join the market as a seller.</description>

      <title>Learning Nash Equilibrial Hamiltonian for Two-Player Collision-Avoiding Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of learning Nash equilibrial policies for two-player risk-sensitive collision-avoiding interactions. Solving the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equations of such general-sum differential games in real time is an open challenge due to the discontinuity of equilibrium values on the state space. A common solution is to learn a neural network that approximates the equilibrium Hamiltonian for given system states and actions. The learning, however, is usually supervised and requires a large amount of sample equilibrium policies from different initial states in order to mitigate the risks of collisions. This paper claims two contributions towards more data-efficient learning of equilibrium policies: First, instead of computing Hamiltonian through a value network, we show that the equilibrium co-states have simple structures when collision avoidance dominates the agents' loss functions and system dynamics is linear, and therefore are more data-efficient to learn. Second, we introduce theory-driven active learning to guide data sampling, where the acquisition function measures the compliance of the predicted co-states to Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. On an uncontrolled intersection case, the proposed method leads to more generalizable approximation of the equilibrium policies, and in turn, lower collision probabilities, than the state-of-the-art under the same data acquisition budget.</description>

      <title>Online Coalition Formation under Random Arrival or Coalition Dissolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coalition formation explores how to partition a set of $n$ agents into disjoint coalitions according to their preferences. We consider a cardinal utility model with an additively separable aggregation of preferences and study the online variant of coalition formation, where the agents arrive in sequence. The goal is to achieve competitive social welfare. In the basic model, agents arrive in an arbitrary order and have to be assigned to coalitions immediately and irrevocably. There, the natural greedy algorithm is known to achieve an optimal competitive ratio, which heavily relies on the range of utilities.
  We complement this result by considering two related models. First, we study a model where agents arrive in a random order. We find that the competitive ratio of the greedy algorithm is $\Theta\left(\frac{1}{n^2}\right)$. In contrast, an alternative algorithm, which is based on alternating between waiting and greedy phases, can achieve a competitive ratio of $\Theta\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)$. Second, we relax the irrevocability of decisions by allowing the dissolution of coalitions into singleton coalitions. We achieve an asymptotically optimal competitive ratio of $\Theta\left(\frac 1n\right)$ by drawing a close connection to a general model of online matching. Hence, in both models, we obtain a competitive ratio that removes the unavoidable utility dependencies in the basic model and essentially matches the best possible approximation ratio by polynomial-time algorithms.</description>

      <title>Robust and Performance Incentivizing Algorithms for Multi-Armed Bandits with Strategic Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by applications such as online labor markets we consider a variant of the stochastic multi-armed bandit problem where we have a collection of arms representing strategic agents with different performance characteristics. The platform (principal) chooses an agent in each round to complete a task. Unlike the standard setting, when an arm is pulled it can modify its reward by absorbing it or improving it at the expense of a higher cost. The principle has to solve a mechanism design problem to incentivize the arms to give their best performance. However, since even with an effective mechanism agents may still deviate from rational behavior, the principal wants a robust algorithm that also gives a non-vacuous guarantee on the total accumulated rewards under non-equilibrium behavior. In this paper, we introduce a class of bandit algorithms that meet the two objectives of performance incentivization and robustness simultaneously. We do this by identifying a collection of intuitive properties that a bandit algorithm has to satisfy to achieve these objectives. Finally, we show that settings where the principal has no information about the arms' performance characteristics can be handled by combining ideas from second price auctions with our algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coalition formation is concerned with the question of how to partition a set of agents into disjoint coalitions according to their preferences. Deviating from most of the previous work, we consider an online variant of the problem, where agents arrive in sequence. Whenever an agent arrives, they must be assigned to a coalition immediately and irrevocably. The scarce existing literature on online coalition formation has focused on maximizing social welfare, a demanding requirement, even in the offline setting. Instead, we seek to achieve \emph{stable} coalition structures online and treat the most common stability concepts based on deviations by single agents and groups of agents. We present a comprehensive picture in additively separable hedonic games, leading to dichotomies, where positive results are obtained by deterministic algorithms and negative results even hold for randomized algorithms.</description>

      <title>Does bilevel optimization result in more competitive racing behavior?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-vehicle racing is natural example of a competitive dynamic game. As with most dynamic games, there are many ways in which the underlying solution concept can be structured, resulting in different equilibrium concepts. The assumed solution concept influences the behaviors of two interacting players in racing. For example, blocking behavior emerges naturally in leader-follower play, but to achieve this in Nash play the costs would have to be chosen specifically to trigger this behavior. In this work, we develop a novel model for competitive two-player vehicle racing, represented as an equilibrium problem, complete with simplified aerodynamic drag and drafting effects, as well as position-dependent collision-avoidance responsibility. We use our model to explore how different solution concepts affect competitiveness. We develop a solution for bilevel optimization problems, enabling a large-scale empirical study comparing bilevel strategies (either as leader or follower), Nash equilibrium strategy and a single-player constant velocity baseline. We find the choice of strategies significantly affects competitive performance and safety.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06495v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are computationally demanding to generate. Their importance for applications like ZK-Rollups has prompted some to outsource ZKP generation to a market of specialized provers. However, existing market designs either do not fit the ZKP setting or lack formal description and analysis.
  In this work, we propose a formal ZKP market model that captures the interactions between users submitting ZKP tasks and provers competing to generate proofs. Building on this model, we introduce $Proo\varphi$, an auction-based ZKP market mechanism. We prove that $Proo\varphi$ is incentive compatible for users and provers, and budget balanced. We augment $Proo\varphi$ with system-level designs to address the practical challenges of our setting, such as Sybil attacks, misreporting of prover capacity, and collusion. We analyze our system-level designs and show how they can mitigate the various security concerns.</description>

Abstract: Suppose a black box, representing multiple agents, generates decisions from a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium of a game. Assume that we can choose the input vector to the black box and this affects the utilities of the agents, but we do not know the utilities of the individual agents. By viewing the decisions from the black box, how can we steer the Nash equilibrium to a socially optimal point? This paper constructs a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for adaptively achieving this mechanism design objective. We first derive a novel multi-agent revealed preference test for Pareto optimality -- this yields necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of utility functions under which empirically observed mixed-strategy Nash equilibria are socially optimal. These conditions take the form of a testable linear program, and this result is of independent interest. We utilize this result to construct an inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) step to determine the Pareto gap, i.e., the distance of observed strategies from Pareto optimality. We pair this IRL step with an RL policy gradient algorithm and prove convergence to a mechanism which minimizes the Pareto gap, thereby inducing social optimality in equilibria strategies. We also reveal an intimate connection between our constructed loss function and several robust revealed preference metrics; this allows us to reason about algorithmic suboptimality through the lens of these well-established microeconomic principles. Finally, in the case when only finitely many i.i.d. samples from mixed-strategies (partial strategy specifications) are available, we derive concentration bounds for our algorithm's convergence, and we construct a distributionally robust RL procedure which achieves mechanism design for the fully specified strategies.</description>

      <title>How to Strategize Human Content Creation in the Era of GenAI?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) will have significant impact on content creation platforms. In this paper, we study the dynamic competition between a GenAI and a human contributor. Unlike the human, the GenAI's content only improves when more contents are created by the human over time; however, GenAI has the advantage of generating content at a lower cost. We study the algorithmic problem in this dynamic competition model about how the human contributor can maximize her utility when competing against the GenAI for content generation over a set of topics. In time-sensitive content domains (e.g., news or pop music creation) where contents' value diminishes over time, we show that there is no polynomial time algorithm for finding the human's optimal (dynamic) strategy, unless the randomized exponential time hypothesis is false. Fortunately, we are able to design a polynomial time algorithm that naturally cycles between myopically optimizing over a short time window and pausing and provably guarantees an approximation ratio of $\frac{1}{2}$. We then turn to time-insensitive content domains where contents do not lose their value (e.g., contents on history facts). Interestingly, we show that this setting permits a polynomial time algorithm that maximizes the human's utility in the long run. Finally, we conduct simulations that demonstrate the advantage of our algorithms in comparison to a collection of baselines.</description>

      <title>Committee Monotonicity and Proportional Representation for Ranked Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19689v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study committee voting rules under ranked preferences, which map the voters' preference relations to a subset of the alternatives of predefined size. In this setting, the compatibility between proportional representation and committee monotonicity is a fundamental open problem that has been mentioned in several works. We address this research question by designing a new committee voting rule called the Solid Coalition Refinement (SCR) rule that simultaneously satisfies committee monotonicity and Dummett's Proportionality for Solid Coalitions (PSC) property as well as one of its variants called inclusion PSC. This is the first rule known to satisfy both of these properties. Moreover, we show that this is effectively the best that we can hope for as other fairness notions adapted from approval voting are incompatible with committee monotonicity. For truncated preferences, we prove that the SCR rule still satisfies PSC and a property called independence of losing voter blocs, thereby refuting a conjecture of Graham-Squire et al. (2024). Finally, we discuss the consequences of our results in the context of rank aggregation.</description>

      <title>Transparent Tagging for Strategic Social Nudges on User-Generated Misinformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social network platforms (SNP) rely heavily on user-generated content to attract users, yet they have limited control over content provision, which leads to misinformation. As countermeasures, SNPs have implemented policies to notify users by tagging the content and influencing users' responses to the tagged content. The population-level response creates a social nudge to the content provider that encourages it to supply more authentic content. Yet, when designing tags to leverage social nudges, SNP must be cautious about misdetection, which impairs its ability to create social nudges. We establish a Bayesian persuaded branching process to study SNP's tagging policy design under misdetection. Misinformation circulation is modeled by a multi-type branching process, where users are persuaded through tags to give positive/negative comments that influence misinformation spread. When translated into posterior belief space, the SNP's problem is reduced to an equality-constrained optimization, the optimal condition of which is given by the Lagrangian characterization. The key finding is that SNP's optimal policy is transparent tagging, albeit misdetection, which nudges the provider not to generate misinformation.</description>

      <title>Elastic Restaking Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decentralized services for blockchains often require their validators (operators) to deposit stake (collateral), which is forfeited (slashed) if they misbehave. Restaking networks let validators secure multiple services by reusing stake, giving rise to a strategic game: Validators can coordinate to misbehave across multiple services, extracting digital assets while forfeiting their stake only once.
  Previous work focused either on preventing coordinated misbehavior or on protecting services if all other services are Byzantine and might unjustly cause slashing due to bugs or malice. The first model overlooks how a single Byzantine service can collapse the network, while the second ignores shared-stake benefits.
  To bridge the gap, we model the strategic game of coordinated misbehavior when a given fraction of services are Byzantine. We introduce elastic restaking networks, where validators can allocate portions of their stake that may cumulatively exceed their total stake, and when allocations are lost, the remaining stake stretches to cover remaining allocations. We show that elastic networks exhibit superior robustness compared to previous approaches, and demonstrate a synergistic effect where an elastic restaking network enhances its blockchain's security, contrary to community concerns of an opposite effect in existing networks. We then design incentives for tuning validators' allocations.
  Our elastic restaking system and incentive design have immediate practical implications for deployed restaking networks, which have billions of dollars in stake.</description>

      <title>Exclusion Zones of Instant Runoff Voting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent research on instant runoff voting (IRV) shows that it exhibits a striking combinatorial property in one-dimensional preference spaces: there is an "exclusion zone" around the median voter such that if a candidate from the exclusion zone is on the ballot, then the winner must come from the exclusion zone. Thus, in one dimension, IRV cannot elect an extreme candidate as long as a sufficiently moderate candidate is running. In this work, we examine the mathematical structure of exclusion zones as a broad phenomenon in more general preference spaces. We prove that with voters uniformly distributed over any $d$-dimensional hyperrectangle (for $d &gt; 1$), IRV has no nontrivial exclusion zone. However, we also show that IRV exclusion zones are not solely a one-dimensional phenomenon. For irregular higher-dimensional preference spaces with fewer symmetries than hyperrectangles, IRV can exhibit nontrivial exclusion zones. As a further exploration, we study IRV exclusion zones in graph voting, where nodes represent voters who prefer candidates closer to them in the graph. Here, we show that IRV exclusion zones present a surprising computational challenge: even checking whether a given set of positions is an IRV exclusion zone is NP-hard. We develop an efficient randomized approximation algorithm for checking and finding exclusion zones. We also report on computational experiments with exclusion zones in two directions: (i) applying our approximation algorithm to a collection of real-world school friendship networks, we find that about 60% of these networks have probable nontrivial IRV exclusion zones; and (ii) performing an exhaustive computer search of small graphs and trees, we also find nontrivial IRV exclusion zones in most graphs. While our focus is on IRV, the properties of exclusion zones we establish provide a novel method for analyzing voting systems in metric spaces more generally.</description>

      <title>A Game-Theoretic Approach for High-Resolution Automotive FMCW Radar Interference Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear frequency hopping has emerged as a promising approach for mitigating interference and enhancing range resolution in automotive FMCW radar systems. Achieving an optimal balance between high range-resolution and effective interference mitigation remains challenging, especially without centralized frequency scheduling. This paper presents a game-theoretic framework for interference avoidance, in which each radar operates as an independent player, optimizing its performance through decentralized decision-making. We examine two equilibrium concepts--Nash Equilibrium (NE) and Coarse Correlated Equilibrium (CCE)--as strategies for frequency band allocation, with CCE demonstrating particular effectiveness through regret minimization algorithms. We propose two interference avoidance algorithms: Nash Hopping, a model-based approach, and No-Regret Hopping, a model-free adaptive method. Simulation results indicate that both methods effectively reduce interference and enhance the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). Notably, No-regret Hopping further optimizes frequency spectrum utilization, achieving improved range resolution compared to Nash Hopping.</description>

      <title>A Tight Regret Analysis of Non-Parametric Repeated Contextual Brokerage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a contextual version of the repeated brokerage problem. In each interaction, two traders with private valuations for an item seek to buy or sell based on the learner's-a broker-proposed price, which is informed by some contextual information. The broker's goal is to maximize the traders' net utility-also known as the gain from trade-by minimizing regret compared to an oracle with perfect knowledge of traders' valuation distributions. We assume that traders' valuations are zero-mean perturbations of the unknown item's current market value-which can change arbitrarily from one interaction to the next-and that similar contexts will correspond to similar market prices. We analyze two feedback settings: full-feedback, where after each interaction the traders' valuations are revealed to the broker, and limited-feedback, where only transaction attempts are revealed. For both feedback types, we propose algorithms achieving tight regret bounds. We further strengthen our performance guarantees by providing a tight 1/2-approximation result showing that the oracle that knows the traders' valuation distributions achieves at least 1/2 of the gain from trade of the omniscient oracle that knows in advance the actual realized traders' valuations.</description>
