      <title>Dynamic access pricing control for fair and stable resource sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the use of pricing as a regulatory mechanism when an unknown number of autonomous agents compete for access to a scarce shared resource. In standard dynamic pricing systems, an increasing price is used to balance supply and demand for a resource in a constrained environment. A major drawback of dynamic pricing is that it is socially regressive as such systems favour price-insensitive traffic (inelastic) and control the demand at the expense of price-sensitive traffic (elastic). We tackle this challenge by describing a new form of pricing that strikes a balance between using price to manage demand for a resource and ensuring fair access to the resource for both elastic and inelastic traffic. Our system gives rise to a switched non-linear ODE model, the stability of which is equivalent to ensuring the fairness properties of the pricing system. Simulations demonstrate the efficacy of the overall design.</description>

      <title>Dispatching and Pricing in Two-Sided Spatial Queues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a dispatching and pricing problem in two-sided spatial queues with fixed supply, motivated by ride-hailing and robotaxi platforms. Idle drivers queue on one side, waiting to pick up riders, while riders queue on the other, waiting to be matched with available drivers. The platform seeks to maximize net profit, penalized by rider waiting penalties, by jointly optimizing state-dependent dispatching and pricing decisions. We formulate this problem as a Markov decision process with state-dependent service times that capture key features of spatial matching. We show that, under mild assumptions, the optimal dispatching policy admits a closed-form expression with a zigzag structure. This policy significantly improves the tractability of pricing optimization due to the resulting closed-form stationary distribution and a substantially reduced state space. Building on this insight, we propose an efficient and scalable dynamic programming heuristic to approximate the optimal zigzag policy in more general settings. Extensive numerical experiments with both the analytical model and a ride-hailing simulation demonstrate that our algorithm is both near-optimal and highly scalable.</description>

      <title>Sparse optimal control for infinite-dimensional linear systems with applications to graphon control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale networked systems typically operate under resource constraints, and it is also difficult to exactly obtain the network structure between nodes. To address these issues, this paper investigates a sparse optimal control for infinite-dimensional linear systems and its application to networked systems where the network structure is represented by a limit function called a graphon that captures the overall connection pattern. The contributions of this paper are twofold: (i) To reduce computational complexity, we derive a sufficient condition under which the sparse optimal control can be obtained by solving its corresponding L1 optimization problem. Furthermore, we introduce a class of non-convex optimal control problems such that the optimal solution always coincides with a sparse optimal control, provided that the non-convex problems admit optimal solutions. (ii) We show that the sparse optimal control for large-scale finite-dimensional networked systems can be approximated by that of the corresponding limit graphon system, provided that the underlying graph is close to the limit graphon in the cut-norm topology. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated through numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Nonconvex Optimization Framework for Group-Sparse Feedback Linear-Quadratic Optimal Control I: Penalty Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a unified nonconvex optimization framework for the design of group-sparse feedback controllers in infinite-horizon linear-quadratic (LQ) problems. We address two prominent extensions of the classical LQ problem: the distributed LQ problem with fixed communication topology (DFT-LQ) and the sparse feedback LQ problem (SF-LQ), both of which are motivated by the need for scalable and structure-aware control in large-scale systems. Unlike existing approaches that rely on convex relaxations or are limited to block-diagonal structures, we directly formulate the controller synthesis as a finite-dimensional nonconvex optimization problem with group $\ell_0$-norm regularization, capturing general sparsity patterns. We establish a connection between DFT-LQ and SF-LQ problems, showing that both can be addressed within our unified framework. Furthermore, we propose a penalty-based proximal alternating linearized minimization (PALM) algorithm and provide a rigorous convergence analysis under mild assumptions, overcoming the lack of coercivity in the objective function. The proposed method admits efficient solvers for all subproblems and guarantees global convergence to critical points. Our results fill a key gap in the literature by enabling the direct design of group-sparse feedback gains with theoretical guarantees, without resorting to convex surrogates or restrictive structural assumptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an adaptive Nesterov accelerated proximal gradient (adaNAPG) algorithm for stochastic composite optimization problems, boosting the Nesterov accelerated proximal gradient (NAPG) algorithm through the integration of an adaptive sampling strategy for gradient estimation. We provide a complexity analysis demonstrating that the new algorithm, adaNAPG, achieves both the optimal iteration complexity and the optimal sample complexity as outlined in the existing literature. Additionally, we establish a central limit theorem for the iteration sequence of the new algorithm adaNAPG, elucidating its convergence rate and efficiency.</description>

      <title>General Proximal Quasi-Newton Methods based on model functions for nonsmooth nonconvex problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we propose a general proximal quasi-Newton method tailored for nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization problems, where we do not require the sequence of the variable metric (or Hessian approximation) to be uniformly bounded as a prerequisite, instead, the variable metric is updated by a continuous matrix generator. From the respective of the algorithm, the objective function is approximated by the so-called local model function and subproblems aim to exploit the proximal point(s) of such model function, which help to achieve the sufficiently decreasing functional sequence along with the backtracking line search principle. Under mild assumptions in terms of the first-order information of the model function, every accumulation point of the generated sequence is stationary and the sequence of the variable metric is proved not to be bounded. Additionally, if the function has the Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz property at the corresponding accumulation point, we find that the whole sequence is convergent to the stationary point, and the sequence of the variable metric is proved to be uniformly bounded. Through the above results, we think that the boundedness of the sequence of the variable metric should depend on the regularity of objectives, rather than being assumed as a prior for nonsmooth optimization problems. Numerical experiments on polytope feasibility problems and (sparse) quadratic inverse problems demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model-based proximal quasi-Newton method, in comparison with the associated model-based proximal gradient method.</description>

      <title>Partial-State DADS Control for Matched Unmodeled Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the Deadzone-Adapted Disturbance Suppression (DADS) control to time-invariant systems with dynamic uncertainties that satisfy the matching condition and for which no bounds for the disturbance and the unknown parameters are known. This problem is equivalent to partial-state adaptive feedback, where the states modeling the dynamic uncertainty are unmeasured. We show that the DADS controller can bypass small-gain conditions and achieve robust regulation for systems in spite of the fact that the strength of the interconnections has no known bound. Moreover, no gain and state drift arise, regardless of the size of the disturbances and unknown parameters. Finally, the paper provides the detailed analysis of a control system where the unmeasured state (or the dynamic uncertainty) is infinite-dimensional and described by a reaction-diffusion Partial Differential Equation, where the diffusion coefficient and the reaction term are unknown. It is shown that even in the infinite-dimensional case, a DADS controller can be designed and guarantees robust regulation of the plant state.</description>

      <title>Optimal Integration Of Heat-Pump And Solar Thermal Energy In The Pre-heating Loop Of Wood And Gas Boiler Based District Heating System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of renewable sources is essential for decarbonizing heat production in district energy networks. Beyond biomass-based solutions, solar thermal energy, with or without heat pumps, presents a significant opportunity. However, system performance is highly dependent on outdoor and setpoint temperatures. This study aims to optimize system design using a multi-criteria approach that considers techno-economic and environmental (CO2) factors. A Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model is developed, incorporating temperature discretization for problem linearization and capturing key dynamic characteristics of heat generators. The model improves convergence, reducing a 19% MIP gap in 26 hours to 10% in 12 hours by dissipating 6% excess solar heat. A multi-scenario analysis under two carbon taxation levels and different CO2 emission cases revealed solar integration up to 11,932 m${}^2$ but increased gas reliance (50%) and TES losses (49%). Wood boiler inclusion reduced solar dependency, covering 45% of heat, lowered LCOH, but limited renewable penetration. Higher carbon taxes boosted solar adoption but faced storage inefficiencies, while biomass enhanced cost efficiency and system stability.</description>

      <title>Guessing sequences of eigenvectors for LMPs defining spectrahedral relaxations of Eulerian rigidly convex sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stable multivariate Eulerian polynomials were introduced by Br\"and\'en. Particularizing some variables, it is possible to extract real zero multivariate Eulerian polynomials from them. These real zero multivariate Eulerian polynomials can be fed into constructions of spectrahedral relaxations providing therefore approximations to the (Eulerian) rigidly convex sets defined by these polynomials. The accuracy of these approximations is measured through the behaviour in the diagonal, where the usual univariate Eulerian polynomials sit. In particular, in this sense, the accuracy of the global spectrahedral approximation produced by the spectrahedral relaxation can be measured in terms of bounds for the extreme roots of univariate Eulerian polynomials. The bounds thus obtained beat the previous bounds found in the literature. However, the bound explicitly studied and obtained before beat the previously known bounds by a quantity going to $0$ when $n$ goes to infinity. Here we use numerical experiments to construct a sequence of vectors providing a (linearized) bound whose difference with the previous known bounds is a growing exponential function (going therefore fast to infinity when $n$ grows). This allows us to establish a better (diagonal) measure of accuracy for the spectrahedral relaxation of the Eulerian rigidly convex sets. In particular, we will achieve this by linearizing through the sequence of vectors $\{(y,(-2^{m-i})_{i=3}^{m},(0,\frac{1}{2}),(1)_{i=1}^{m})\in\mathbb{R}^{n+1}\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ for even $n=2m$.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Constrained Minimization with Tensor $\ell_{2,p}$ Regularization for HSI Denoising and Destriping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03605v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hyperspectral images~(HSIs) are often contaminated by a mixture of noise such as Gaussian noise, dead lines, stripes, and so on. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale low-rank tensor regularized $\ell_{2,p}$ (MLTL2p) approach for HSI denoising and destriping, which consists of an orthogonal constrained minimization model and an iterative algorithm with convergence guarantees. The model of the proposed MLTL2p approach is built based on a new sparsity-enhanced Multi-scale Low-rank Tensor regularization and a tensor $\ell_{2,p}$ norm with \(p\in (0,1)\). The multi-scale low-rank regularization for HSI denoising utilizes the global and local spectral correlation as well as the spatial nonlocal self-similarity priors of HSIs. The corresponding low-rank constraints are formulated based on independent higher-order singular value decomposition with sparsity enhancement on its core tensor to prompt more low-rankness. The tensor $\ell_{2,p}$ norm for HSI destriping is extended from the matrix $\ell_{2,p}$ norm. A proximal block coordinate descent algorithm is proposed in the MLTL2p approach to solve the resulting nonconvex nonsmooth minimization with orthogonal constraints. We show any accumulation point of the sequence generated by the proposed algorithm converges to a first-order stationary point, which is defined using three equalities of substationarity, symmetry, and feasibility for orthogonal constraints. In the numerical experiments, we compare the proposed method with state-of-the-art methods including a deep learning based method, and test the methods on both simulated and real HSI datasets. Our proposed MLTL2p method demonstrates outperformance in terms of metrics such as mean peak signal-to-noise ratio as well as visual quality.</description>

      <title>Provably Convergent Plug-and-play Proximal Block Coordinate Descent Method for Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14824v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hyperspectral anomaly detection refers to identifying pixels in the hyperspectral images that have spectral characteristics significantly different from the background. In this paper, we introduce a novel model that represents the background information using a low-rank representation. We integrate an implicit proximal denoiser prior, associated with a deep learning based denoiser, within a plug-and-play (PnP) framework to effectively remove noise from the eigenimages linked to the low-rank representation. Anomalies are characterized using a generalized group sparsity measure, denoted as $\|\cdot\|_{2,\psi}$. To solve the resulting orthogonal constrained nonconvex nonsmooth optimization problem, we develop a PnP-proximal block coordinate descent (PnP-PBCD) method, where the eigenimages are updated using a proximal denoiser within the PnP framework. We prove that any accumulation point of the sequence generated by the PnP-PBCD method is a stationary point. We evaluate the effectiveness of the PnP-PBCD method on hyperspectral anomaly detection in scenarios with and without Gaussian noise contamination. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively detect anomalous objects, outperforming the competing methods that may mistakenly identify noise as anomalies or misidentify the anomalous objects due to noise interference.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies generalized semi-infinite programs (GSIPs) defined with polyhedral parameter sets. Assume these GSIPs are given by polynomials. We propose a new approach to solve them as a disjunctive program. This approach is based on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of the robust constraint and a technique called partial Lagrange multiplier expressions. We summarize a semidefinite algorithm and study its convergence properties. Numerical experiments are given to show the efficiency of our method. In addition, we checked its performance in gemstone cutting and robust control applications.</description>

Abstract: This paper considers a new nonlocal fractional differential quasi-variational inequality (NFDQVI) comprising a fractional differential equation with a nonlocal condition and a time-dependent quasi-variational inequality in Hilbert spaces. Qualitative properties of the solution for the time-dependent parameterized quasi-variational inequality are investigated, which improve some known results in the literature. Moreover, the unique existence of the solution and Hyers-Ulam stability are obtained for such a novel NFDQVI under mild conditions. Finally, the obtained abstract results for NFDQVI are applied to analyze the unique solvability and stability addressing a time-dependent multi-agent optimization problem and a time-dependent price control problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03902v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a comprehensive framework for solving constrained variational inequalities via various classes of evolution equations displaying multi-scale aspects. In an infinite-dimensional Hilbertian framework, the class of dynamical systems we propose combine Tikhonov regularization and exterior penalization terms in order to induce strong convergence of trajectories to least norm solutions in the constrained domain. Our construction thus unifies the literature on regularization methods and penalty-based dynamical systems. An extension to a full splitting formulation of the constrained domain is also provided, with associated weak convergence results involving the Attouch-Czarnecki condition.</description>

      <title>The Graph Geometric Control Condition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel concept called the Graph Geometric Control Condition (GGCC). It turns out to be a simple, geometric rewriting of many of the frameworks in which the controllability of PDEs on graphs has been studied. We prove that (GGCC) is a necessary and sufficient condition for the exact controllability of the wave equation on metric graphs with internal controls and Dirichlet boundary conditions. We then investigate the internal exact controllability of the wave equation with mixed boundary conditions and the one of the Schr\"odinger equation, as well as the internal null-controllability of the heat equation. We show that (GGCC) provides a sufficient condition for the controllability of these equations and we provide explicit examples proving that (GGCC) is not necessary in these cases.</description>

      <title>Second order optimality conditions in a new Lagrangian formulation for optimal control problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been shown recently that optimal control problems with the dynamical constraint given by a second order system admit a regular Lagrangian formulation. This implies that the optimality conditions can be obtained in a new form based on the variational approach. In this paper we extend the first order necessary optimality conditions obtained previously to second order optimality conditions. This results in a complete characterization of the optimality conditions in a new Lagrangian form.</description>

      <title>Compressed and distributed least-squares regression: convergence rates with applications to Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of compression on stochastic gradient algorithms for machine learning, a technique widely used in distributed and federated learning. We underline differences in terms of convergence rates between several unbiased compression operators, that all satisfy the same condition on their variance, thus going beyond the classical worst-case analysis. To do so, we focus on the case of least-squares regression (LSR) and analyze a general stochastic approximation algorithm for minimizing quadratic functions relying on a random field. We consider weak assumptions on the random field, tailored to the analysis (specifically, expected H\"older regularity), and on the noise covariance, enabling the analysis of various randomizing mechanisms, including compression. We then extend our results to the case of federated learning.
  More formally, we highlight the impact on the convergence of the covariance $\mathfrak{C}_{\mathrm{ania}}$ of the additive noise induced by the algorithm. We demonstrate despite the non-regularity of the stochastic field, that the limit variance term scales with $\mathrm{Tr}(\mathfrak{C}_{\mathrm{ania}} H^{-1})/K$ (where $H$ is the Hessian of the optimization problem and $K$ the number of iterations) generalizing the rate for the vanilla LSR case where it is $\sigma^2 \mathrm{Tr}(H H^{-1}) / K = \sigma^2 d / K$ (Bach and Moulines, 2013). Then, we analyze the dependency of $\mathfrak{C}_{\mathrm{ania}}$ on the compression strategy and ultimately its impact on convergence, first in the centralized case, then in two heterogeneous FL frameworks.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Numerical Function Optimization Framework for Constrained Nonlinear Robotic Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17349v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a numerical function optimization framework designed for constrained optimization problems in robotics. The tool is designed with real-time considerations and is suitable for online trajectory and control input optimization problems. The proposed framework does not require any analytical representation of the problem and works with constrained block-box optimization functions. The method combines first-order gradient-based line search algorithms with constraint prioritization through nullspace projections onto constraint Jacobian space. The tool is implemented in C++ and provided online for community use, along with some numerical and robotic example implementations presented in this paper.</description>

      <title>OR-LLM-Agent: Automating Modeling and Solving of Operations Research Optimization Problems with Reasoning LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), applying large language models (LLMs) to Operations Research (OR) problem-solving has attracted increasing attention. Most existing approaches attempt to improve OR problem-solving through prompt engineering or fine-tuning strategies for LLMs. However, these methods are fundamentally constrained by the limited capabilities of non-reasoning LLMs. To overcome these limitations, we propose OR-LLM-Agent, an AI agent built on reasoning LLMs for automated OR problem solving. The agent decomposes the task into three sequential stages: mathematical modeling, code generation, and debugging. Each task is handled by a dedicated sub-agent, which enables more targeted reasoning. We also construct BWOR, a high-quality dataset for evaluating LLM performance on OR tasks. Our analysis shows that existing benchmarks such as NL4OPT, MAMO, and IndustryOR suffer from certain issues, making them less suitable for reliably evaluating LLM performance. In contrast, BWOR provides a more consistent and discriminative assessment of model capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that OR-LLM-Agent outperforms advanced methods, including GPT-o3, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and ORLM, by at least 7% in accuracy. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of task decomposition for OR problem solving.</description>

      <title>On the Convergence of Gradient Descent on Learning Transformers with Residual Connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05249v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformer models have emerged as fundamental tools across various scientific and engineering disciplines, owing to their outstanding performance in diverse applications. Despite this empirical success, the theoretical foundations of Transformers remain relatively underdeveloped, particularly in understanding their training dynamics. Existing research predominantly examines isolated components--such as self-attention mechanisms and feedforward networks--without thoroughly investigating the interdependencies between these components, especially when residual connections are present. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by analyzing the convergence behavior of a structurally complete yet single-layer Transformer, comprising self-attention, a feedforward network, and residual connections. We demonstrate that, under appropriate initialization, gradient descent exhibits a linear convergence rate, where the convergence speed is determined by the minimum and maximum singular values of the output matrix from the attention layer. Moreover, our analysis reveals that residual connections serve to ameliorate the ill-conditioning of this output matrix, an issue stemming from the low-rank structure imposed by the softmax operation, thereby promoting enhanced optimization stability. We also extend our theoretical findings to a multi-layer Transformer architecture, confirming the linear convergence rate of gradient descent under suitable initialization. Empirical results corroborate our theoretical insights, illustrating the beneficial role of residual connections in promoting convergence stability.</description>
