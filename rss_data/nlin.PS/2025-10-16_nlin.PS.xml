      <title>Data-driven Soliton Manifold Approximations for Dark and Bright Waves: Some Prototypical 1d Case Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the investigation of solitary-wave interactions in the nonlinear Schr\"odinger model, both in the presence and absence of a parabolic trapping potential. While approximate dynamics, based on variational or similar methods, governed by a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for both bright and dark-soliton interactions have been well established in the literature based on physical expert considerations, this study focuses on a data-driven approach, the so-called Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy). Accordingly, our purpose is to use PDE time-series of select waveform diag- nostics in order to numerically reconstruct such approximate dynamics, without prior knowledge thereof. The purpose is not only to verify the robustness of the dynamical approximated ODEs, but also to shed light on the application of such a data-driven methodology in the study of soliton interactions and to formu- late a complementary approach, more reliant on the wealth of PDE data and less so on expert theoretical constructs.</description>

      <title>Dynamical breaking of inversion symmetry and strong second harmonic generation with nonlinear phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how crystalline inversion symmetry can be dynamically broken by optical phonons with generic, hardening Kerr-like non-linearities. The symmetry-broken state is reached through a parametric instability that can be accessed by driving close to half the phonon resonance. After the onset of the instability, the system settles to a steady state with inversion-symmetry breaking phonon trajectories and strong second harmonic generation. The time averaged positions of the atoms are displaced relative to equilibrium in the steady state, resulting in a rectification of the driving signal.</description>

      <title>Static and dynamical properties of quadrupolar quantum droplets in quasi-2D condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum droplets, stabilized by beyond-mean-field effects, represent a novel state of matter in quantum many-body systems. While previous studies have focused primarily on dipolar and contact-interacting systems, quadrupolar condensates remain relatively unexplored. In this work, we explore the formation, structural properties, and dynamical behaviors of quantum droplets in a two-component quadrupolar Bose-Einstein condensate confined to a quasi-two-dimensional geometry. Analytical results obtained via the Thomas-Fermi approximation predict flat-topped density profiles and linear scaling between effective area and particle number. These predictions are corroborated by numerical simulations, which also reveal the saturation of peak density and chemical potential at large norm. Furthermore, vortex quantum droplets exhibit anisotropic elliptical morphologies due to the directional nature of QQIs, with their aspect ratios significantly tunable by varying the particle number and quadrupolar interaction strength. Collision dynamics demonstrate rich behavior modulated by velocity and topology: ground-state droplets transition from inelastic merging to quasi-elastic scattering and quantum penetration, while vortex droplets exhibit phase-induced repulsion, fragmentation, and topologically protected tunneling. These findings offer a comprehensive understanding of how higher-order interactions and quantum fluctuations govern the formation and stability of quadrupolar droplets. This work lays a theoretical foundation for experimental realization and opens new directions for exploring anisotropic quantum fluids, topological excitations, and applications in quantum sensing and simulation.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear excitations in multi-dimensional nonlocal lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the formation of breathers in multi-dimensional lattices with long-range interactions. By variational methods, the exact relationship between various parameters (dimension, nonlinearity, nonlocal parameter $\alpha$) that defines positive excitation thresholds is characterized. We establish a sharp mass-threshold dichotomy: no positive threshold in the mass-subcritical regime, and a strictly positive threshold at and above the critical regime. In the anti-continuum regime, a family of unique ground states characterizes the excitation thresholds, enabling explicit computations. Analytic formulas of the excitation thresholds, determined by the ground states, are derived and corroborated with numerical simulations. We not only characterize the sharp spatial decay of ground states, which varies continuously in $\alpha$, but also identify the time decay of dispersive waves, which undergoes a discontinuous transition in $\alpha$.</description>
