      <title>Large Language Models Are Strong Audio-Visual Speech Recognition Learners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently become a focal point of research due to their formidable multimodal understanding capabilities. For example, in the audio and speech domains, an LLM can be equipped with (automatic) speech recognition (ASR) abilities by just concatenating the audio tokens, computed with an audio encoder, and the text tokens to achieve state-of-the-art results. On the contrary, tasks like visual and audio-visual speech recognition (VSR/AVSR), which also exploit noise-invariant lip movement information, have received little or no attention. To bridge this gap, we propose Llama-AVSR, a new MLLM with strong audio-visual speech recognition capabilities. It leverages pre-trained audio and video encoders to produce modality-specific tokens which, together with the text tokens, are processed by a pre-trained LLM (e.g., Llama3.1-8B) to yield the resulting response in an auto-regressive fashion. Llama-AVSR requires a small number of trainable parameters as only modality-specific projectors and LoRA modules are trained whereas the multi-modal encoders and LLM are kept frozen. We evaluate our proposed approach on LRS3, the largest public AVSR benchmark, and we achieve new state-of-the-art results for the tasks of ASR and AVSR with a WER of 0.81% and 0.77%, respectively. To bolster our results, we investigate the key factors that underpin the effectiveness of Llama-AVSR: the choice of the pre-trained encoders and LLM, the efficient integration of LoRA modules, and the optimal performance-efficiency trade-off obtained via modality-aware compression rates.</description>

      <title>Mutual Information-based Representations Disentanglement for Unaligned Multimodal Language Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The key challenge in unaligned multimodal language sequences lies in effectively integrating information from various modalities to obtain a refined multimodal joint representation. Recently, the disentangle and fuse methods have achieved the promising performance by explicitly learning modality-agnostic and modality-specific representations and then fusing them into a multimodal joint representation. However, these methods often independently learn modality-agnostic representations for each modality and utilize orthogonal constraints to reduce linear correlations between modality-agnostic and modality-specific representations, neglecting to eliminate their nonlinear correlations. As a result, the obtained multimodal joint representation usually suffers from information redundancy, leading to overfitting and poor generalization of the models. In this paper, we propose a Mutual Information-based Representations Disentanglement (MIRD) method for unaligned multimodal language sequences, in which a novel disentanglement framework is designed to jointly learn a single modality-agnostic representation. In addition, the mutual information minimization constraint is employed to ensure superior disentanglement of representations, thereby eliminating information redundancy within the multimodal joint representation. Furthermore, the challenge of estimating mutual information caused by the limited labeled data is mitigated by introducing unlabeled data. Meanwhile, the unlabeled data also help to characterize the underlying structure of multimodal data, consequently further preventing overfitting and enhancing the performance of the models. Experimental results on several widely used benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.</description>

      <title>InfiMM-WebMath-40B: Advancing Multimodal Pre-Training for Enhanced Mathematical Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pre-training on large-scale, high-quality datasets is crucial for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), especially in specialized domains such as mathematics. Despite the recognized importance, the Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) field currently lacks a comprehensive open-source pre-training dataset specifically designed for mathematical reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce InfiMM-WebMath-40B, a high-quality dataset of interleaved image-text documents. It comprises 24 million web pages, 85 million associated image URLs, and 40 billion text tokens, all meticulously extracted and filtered from CommonCrawl. We provide a detailed overview of our data collection and processing pipeline. To demonstrate the robustness of InfiMM-WebMath-40B, we conducted evaluations in both text-only and multimodal settings. Our evaluations on text-only benchmarks show that, despite utilizing only 40 billion tokens, our dataset significantly enhances the performance of our 1.3B model, delivering results comparable to DeepSeekMath-1.3B, which uses 120 billion tokens for the same model size. Nevertheless, with the introduction of our multi-modal math pre-training dataset, our models set a new state-of-the-art among open-source models on multi-modal math benchmarks such as MathVerse and We-Math. We release our data at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Infi-MM/InfiMM-WebMath-40B.</description>

      <title>LLaMA-Adapter: Efficient Fine-tuning of Language Models with Zero-init Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16199v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present LLaMA-Adapter, a lightweight adaption method to efficiently fine-tune LLaMA into an instruction-following model. Using 52K self-instruct demonstrations, LLaMA-Adapter only introduces 1.2M learnable parameters upon the frozen LLaMA 7B model, and costs less than one hour for fine-tuning on 8 A100 GPUs. Specifically, we adopt a set of learnable adaption prompts, and prepend them to the word tokens at higher transformer layers. Then, a zero-initialized attention mechanism with zero gating is proposed, which adaptively injects the new instructional cues into LLaMA, while effectively preserves its pre-trained knowledge. With our efficient training, LLaMA-Adapter can generate high-quality responses, comparable to Alpaca with fully fine-tuned 7B parameters. Besides language commands, our approach can be simply extended to multi-modal instructions for learning image-conditioned LLaMA model, which achieves superior reasoning performance on ScienceQA and COCO Caption benchmarks. Furthermore, we also evaluate the zero-initialized attention mechanism for fine-tuning other pre-trained models (ViT, RoBERTa) on traditional vision and language tasks, demonstrating the superior generalization capacity of our approach. Code is released at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/LLaMA-Adapter.</description>

      <title>Cross-Attention Fusion of Visual and Geometric Features for Large Vocabulary Arabic Lipreading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lipreading involves using visual data to recognize spoken words by analyzing the movements of the lips and surrounding area. It is a hot research topic with many potential applications, such as human-machine interaction and enhancing audio speech recognition. Recent deep-learning based works aim to integrate visual features extracted from the mouth region with landmark points on the lip contours. However, employing a simple combination method such as concatenation may not be the most effective approach to get the optimal feature vector. To address this challenge, firstly, we propose a cross-attention fusion-based approach for large lexicon Arabic vocabulary to predict spoken words in videos. Our method leverages the power of cross-attention networks to efficiently integrate visual and geometric features computed on the mouth region. Secondly, we introduce the first large-scale Lipreading in the Wild for Arabic (LRW-AR) dataset containing 20,000 videos for 100-word classes, uttered by 36 speakers. The experimental results obtained on LRW-AR and ArabicVisual databases showed the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach in recognizing Arabic words. Our work provides insights into the feasibility and effectiveness of applying lipreading techniques to the Arabic language, opening doors for further research in this field.

      <title>A Simple Baseline with Single-encoder for Referring Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Referring image segmentation (RIS) requires dense vision-language interactions between visual pixels and textual words to segment objects based on a given description. However, commonly adapted dual-encoders in RIS, e.g., Swin transformer and BERT (uni-modal encoders) or CLIP (a multi-modal dual-encoder), lack dense multi-modal interactions during pre-training, leading to a gap with a pixel-level RIS task. To bridge this gap, existing RIS methods often rely on multi-modal fusion modules that interact two encoders, but this approach leads to high computational costs. In this paper, we present a novel RIS method with a single-encoder, i.e., BEiT-3, maximizing the potential of shared self-attention across all framework components. This enables seamless interactions of two modalities from input to final prediction, producing granularly aligned multi-modal features. Furthermore, we propose lightweight yet effective decoder modules, a Shared FPN and a Shared Mask Decoder, which contribute to the high efficiency of our model. Our simple baseline with a single encoder achieves outstanding performances on the RIS benchmark datasets while maintaining computational efficiency, compared to the most recent SoTA methods based on dual-encoders.</description>
