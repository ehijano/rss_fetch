      <title>Molecular Fingerprints Are Strong Models for Peptide Function Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effectiveness of molecular fingerprints for peptide property prediction and demonstrate that domain-specific feature extraction from molecular graphs can outperform complex and computationally expensive models such as GNNs, pretrained sequence-based transformers and multimodal ensembles, even without hyperparameter tuning. To this end, we perform a thorough evaluation on 126 datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on LRGB and 5 other peptide function prediction benchmarks. We show that models based on count variants of ECFP, Topological Torsion, and RDKit molecular fingerprints and LightGBM as classification head are remarkably robust. The strong performance of molecular fingerprints, which are intrinsically very short-range feature encoders, challenges the presumed importance of long-range interactions in peptides. Our conclusion is that the use of molecular fingerprints for larger molecules, such as peptides, can be a computationally feasible, low-parameter, and versatile alternative to sophisticated deep learning models.</description>

      <title>MolGraph-xLSTM: A graph-based dual-level xLSTM framework with multi-head mixture-of-experts for enhanced molecular representation and interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting molecular properties is essential for drug discovery, and computational methods can greatly enhance this process. Molecular graphs have become a focus for representation learning, with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) widely used. However, GNNs often struggle with capturing long-range dependencies. To address this, we propose MolGraph-xLSTM, a novel graph-based xLSTM model that enhances feature extraction and effectively models molecule long-range interactions.
  Our approach processes molecular graphs at two scales: atom-level and motif-level. For atom-level graphs, a GNN-based xLSTM framework with jumping knowledge extracts local features and aggregates multilayer information to capture both local and global patterns effectively. Motif-level graphs provide complementary structural information for a broader molecular view. Embeddings from both scales are refined via a multi-head mixture of experts (MHMoE), further enhancing expressiveness and performance.
  We validate MolGraph-xLSTM on 10 molecular property prediction datasets, covering both classification and regression tasks. Our model demonstrates consistent performance across all datasets, with improvements of up to 7.03% on the BBBP dataset for classification and 7.54% on the ESOL dataset for regression compared to baselines. On average, MolGraph-xLSTM achieves an AUROC improvement of 3.18\% for classification tasks and an RMSE reduction of 3.83\% across regression datasets compared to the baseline methods. These results confirm the effectiveness of our model, offering a promising solution for molecular representation learning for drug discovery.</description>

      <title>Integrating experimental data with molecular simulations to investigate RNA structural dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.08622v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conformational dynamics is crucial for ribonucleic acid (RNA) function. Techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance, cryo-electron microscopy, small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering, chemical probing, single-molecule F\"orster resonance energy transfer or even thermal or mechanical denaturation experiments probe RNA dynamics at different time and space resolutions. Their combination with accurate atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations paves the way for quantitative and detailed studies of RNA dynamics. First, experiments provide a quantitative validation tool for MD simulations. Second, available data can be used to refine simulated structural ensembles to match experiments. Finally, comparison with experiments allows for improving MD force fields that are transferable to new systems for which data is not available. Here we review the recent literature and provide our perspective on this field.</description>
