      <title>Projections of standardised energy indices in future climate scenarios</title>

Abstract: Renewable energy is becoming an increasingly important component of energy systems. However, renewable energy production is heavily dependent on the prevailing weather conditions, which are changing as a result of climate change. It is therefore necessary to build energy systems that are robust to energy shortages caused by weather-dependent changes to energy demand and renewable energy production. To design such systems, we must monitor how changes in the climate are expected to influence future energy production and demand; this is important for policymakers to decide when, where, and by how much renewable energy installed capacities should be increased, for example. In this paper, we study the behaviour of standardised energy indices in future European climate projections, and use this to monitor how characteristics of energy production droughts in Europe are expected to change in the future. We use these results to make suggestions regarding how the energy mix should be adapted in the future to decrease the risk of energy production droughts.</description>

      <title>Local and Remote Forcing Factors of Heatwave in India -A Reanalysis and Adjoint model based study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continental heatwaves can dramatically impact ecosystems and societies, e.g., by leading to excess mortality, wildfires, and harvest failures. With a warming climate, their impacts potentially intensify globally, but the Indian subcontinent appears to be particularly vulnerable to such extreme events. In this study, we use reanalysis and the adjoint of the atmospheric model, PlaSim, to identify drivers of heatwaves occurring April and May over north-central India. Reanalysis results suggest that the existence of high temperatures in the study region is highly sensitive to the low local soil moisture which is observed weeks before a heatwave commences. Soil moisture variability in northern India is influenced by moisture transport from the west during winter--spring. Preceding dry soil moisture conditions can be associated with a `persistent jet' conditions linked to atmospheric dynamical changes in the North Atlantic region. An associated northward shift in the upper tropospheric zonal wind occurs approximately a month prior to the heatwaves, influencing the area and intensity of western disturbances embedded in the jet stream. This weakens the moisture flow from the north of the Arabian Sea, further reducing soil moisture levels and creating conditions conducive to heatwaves. An adjoint sensitivity analysis and forward model perturbation experiments confirm the causal relationships for the proposed heatwave development mechanism over north-central India, identifying the remote influence of North Atlantic sea surface temperature variability on extreme temperatures in India. Our findings highlight the complex interplay of local and remote factors in heatwave development over India.</description>

      <title>Impact of the North Atlantic Oscillation on the subtropical and subpolar gyres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is a leading mode of atmospheric variability, affecting the North Atlantic Ocean on sub-seasonal to multi-decadal timescales. The NAO changes the atmospheric forcing at the ocean's surface, including winds and surface buoyancy fluxes, both of which are known to impact large-scale gyre circulation. However, the relative role of other physical processes (such as mesoscale eddies and topography) in influencing gyre circulation under NAO variability is not fully understood. Here, we analyze a series of ocean--sea ice simulations using a barotropic vorticity budget to understand long-term response of the North Atlantic gyre circulation to NAO forcing. We find that for each standard deviation increase in the NAO index, the subtropical and subpolar gyres intensify by 0.90 Sv and 3.41 Sv (1 Sv = 10$^6$ m$^3$ s$^{-1}$) respectively. The NAO-induced wind stress anomalies drive approximately 90% of the change in the subtropical gyre's interior flow. However, in the subpolar gyre's interior, in addition to wind stress, flow-topography interactions, stratification (influenced by surface heat fluxes), and non-linear advection significantly influence the circulation. Along the western boundary the bottom pressure torque plays a key role in steering the flow, and the vorticity input by the bottom pressure torque is partly redistributed by non-linear advection. Our study highlights the importance of both atmospheric forcing and oceanic dynamical processes in driving long-term gyre circulation responses to the NAO.</description>

      <title>Tuna and billfish larval distributions in a warming ocean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tuna and billfish are charismatic pelagic fishes attracting considerable scientific attention due to their ecophysiological and socioeconomic importance. However, the knowledge of their basin-wide spawning and larval habitats, especially in a warming ocean, is limited. This knowledge gap undermines effective fishery management by introducing recruitment uncertainty, which makes population dynamics unpredictable. We fill the gap with a parsimonious geostatistical species-distribution model trained on the largest available dataset on tuna and billfish larvae in the Pacific Ocean. The model reveals (i) the basin-wide seasonal larval distributions over the reference period 1960-85, (ii) the expected impact of ongoing ocean warming on these distributions, and (iii) the biogeochemical factors, such as pH, phosphate concentration, and sea-surface height, that shape the larval habitat. Our findings make a quantum leap in understanding the ecophysiology of tuna and billfish, providing valuable information for future conservation efforts.</description>

      <title>A stable implementation of a data-driven scale-aware mesoscale parameterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ocean mesoscale eddies are often poorly represented in climate models, and therefore, their effects on the large scale circulation must be parameterized. Traditional parameterizations, which represent the bulk effect of the unresolved eddies, can be improved with new subgrid models learned directly from data. Zanna and Bolton 2020 (ZB20) applied an equation-discovery algorithm to reveal an interpretable expression parameterizing the subgrid momentum fluxes by mesoscale eddies through the components of the velocity-gradient tensor. In this work, we implement the ZB20 parameterization into the primitive-equation GFDL MOM6 ocean model and test it in two idealized configurations with significantly different dynamical regimes and topography. The original parameterization was found to generate excessive numerical noise near the grid scale. We propose two filtering approaches to avoid the numerical issues and additionally enhance the strength of large-scale energy backscatter. The filtered ZB20 parameterizations led to improved climatological mean state and energy distributions, compared to the current state-of-the-art energy backscatter parameterizations. The filtered ZB20 parameterizations are scale-aware and, consequently, can be used with a single value of the non-dimensional scaling coefficient for a range of resolutions. The successful application of the filtered ZB20 parameterizations to parameterize mesoscale eddies in two idealized configurations offers a promising opportunity to reduce long-standing biases in global ocean simulations in future studies.</description>

      <title>Scaling transformer neural networks for skillful and reliable medium-range weather forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weather forecasting is a fundamental problem for anticipating and mitigating the impacts of climate change. Recently, data-driven approaches for weather forecasting based on deep learning have shown great promise, achieving accuracies that are competitive with operational systems. However, those methods often employ complex, customized architectures without sufficient ablation analysis, making it difficult to understand what truly contributes to their success. Here we introduce Stormer, a simple transformer model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on weather forecasting with minimal changes to the standard transformer backbone. We identify the key components of Stormer through careful empirical analyses, including weather-specific embedding, randomized dynamics forecast, and pressure-weighted loss. At the core of Stormer is a randomized forecasting objective that trains the model to forecast the weather dynamics over varying time intervals. During inference, this allows us to produce multiple forecasts for a target lead time and combine them to obtain better forecast accuracy. On WeatherBench 2, Stormer performs competitively at short to medium-range forecasts and outperforms current methods beyond 7 days, while requiring orders-of-magnitude less training data and compute. Additionally, we demonstrate Stormer's favorable scaling properties, showing consistent improvements in forecast accuracy with increases in model size and training tokens. Code and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/tung-nd/stormer.</description>

      <title>XiHe: A Data-Driven Model for Global Ocean Eddy-Resolving Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02995v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The leading operational Global Ocean Forecasting Systems (GOFSs) use physics-driven numerical forecasting models that solve the partial differential equations with expensive computation. Recently, specifically in atmosphere weather forecasting, data-driven models have demonstrated significant potential for speeding up environmental forecasting by orders of magnitude, but there is still no data-driven GOFS that matches the forecasting accuracy of the numerical GOFSs. In this paper, we propose the first data-driven 1/12{\deg} resolution global ocean eddy-resolving forecasting model named XiHe, which is established from the 25-year France Mercator Ocean International's daily GLORYS12 reanalysis data. XiHe is a hierarchical transformer-based framework coupled with two special designs. One is the land-ocean mask mechanism for focusing exclusively on the global ocean circulation. The other is the ocean-specific block for effectively capturing both local ocean information and global teleconnection. Extensive experiments are conducted under satellite observations, in situ observations, and the IV-TT Class 4 evaluation framework of the world's leading operational GOFSs from January 2019 to December 2020. The results demonstrate that XiHe achieves stronger forecast performance in all testing variables than existing leading operational numerical GOFSs including Mercator Ocean Physical SYstem (PSY4), Global Ice Ocean Prediction System (GIOPS), BLUElinK OceanMAPS (BLK), and Forecast Ocean Assimilation Model (FOAM). Particularly, the accuracy of ocean current forecasting of XiHe out to 60 days is even better than that of PSY4 in just 10 days. Additionally, XiHe is able to forecast the large-scale circulation and the mesoscale eddies. Furthermore, it can make a 10-day forecast in only 0.35 seconds, which accelerates the forecast speed by thousands of times compared to the traditional numerical GOFSs.</description>

      <title>Developing a Thailand solar irradiance map using Himawari-8 satellite imageries and deep learning models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an online platform that shows Thailand's solar irradiance map every 30 minutes. It is available at https://www.cusolarforecast.com. The methodology for estimating global horizontal irradiance (GHI) across Thailand relies on cloud index extracted from Himawari-8 satellite imagery, Ineichen clear-sky model with locally-tuned Linke turbidity, and machine learning models. The methods take clear-sky irradiance, cloud index, re-analyzed GHI and temperature data from the MERRA-2 database, and date-time as inputs for GHI estimation models, including LightGBM, LSTM, Informer, and Transformer. These are benchmarked with the estimate from a commercial service X by evaluating 15-minute ground GHI data from 53 ground stations over 1.5 years from 2022-2023. The results show that the four models have competitive performances and outperform the service X. The best model is LightGBM, with an MAE of 78.58 W/sqm and RMSE of 118.97 W/sqm. Obtaining re-analyzed MERRA-2 data for Thailand is not economically feasible for deployment. When removing these features, the Informer model has a winning performance of 78.67 W/sqm in MAE. The obtained performance aligns with existing literature by taking the climate zone and time granularity of data into consideration. As the map shows an estimate of GHI over 93,000 grids with a frequent update, the paper also describes a computational framework for displaying the entire map. It tests the runtime performance of deep learning models in the GHI estimation process.</description>

      <title>Can AI weather models predict out-of-distribution gray swan tropical cyclones?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting gray swan weather extremes, which are possible but so rare that they are absent from the training dataset, is a major concern for AI weather/climate models. An important open question is whether AI models can extrapolate from weaker weather events present in the training set to stronger, unseen weather extremes. To test this, we train independent versions of the AI model FourCastNet on the 1979-2015 ERA5 dataset with all data, or with Category 3-5 tropical cyclones (TCs) removed, either globally or only over the North Atlantic or Western Pacific basin. We then test these versions of FourCastNet on 2018-2023 Category 5 TCs (gray swans). All versions yield similar accuracy for global weather, but the one trained without Category 3-5 TCs cannot accurately forecast Category 5 TCs, indicating that these models cannot extrapolate from weaker storms. The versions trained without Category 3-5 TCs in one basin show some skill forecasting Category 5 TCs in that basin, suggesting that FourCastNet can generalize across tropical basins. This is encouraging and surprising because regional information is implicitly encoded in inputs. No version satisfies gradient-wind balance, implying that enforcing such physical constraints may not improve generalizability to gray swans. Given that current state-of-the-art AI weather/climate models have similar learning strategies, we expect our findings to apply to other models and extreme events. Our work demonstrates that novel learning strategies are needed for AI weather/climate models to provide early warning or estimated statistics for the rarest, most impactful weather extremes.</description>
