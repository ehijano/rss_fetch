      <title>Multi-Cycle PWR Modeling with DRAGON and PARCS: Implications for Nuclear Data Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear data libraries serve as the foundation for all calculations in the nuclear field. Their quality directly affects the accuracy of computations. When new nuclear data libraries are released, they must undergo validation through the use of integral experimental data. This work introduces an automated simulation pipeline that converts raw nuclear data into predictions for various reactors, significantly enhancing the validation process. This pipeline allows for the assessment of potential biases in integral measurement predictions for nuclear power plants before the release of a new nuclear data library. To achieve this, an implementation of history variables in DRAGON was developed to determine the macroscopic cross sections of the nodal code PARCS. This method has been verified for seven depletion cycles across three pressurised water reactors (PWRs) against publicly available data. The errors on the predictions are in the uncertainty range attributed to variations in nuclear data. Additionally, a methodology to assess the quality of novel nuclear data libraries against experimental measurements in PWRs is presented.</description>

      <title>Lifetime of the $4^+_1$ state of $^{132}$Te</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of the collectivity of tellurium isotopes from mid-shell towards $N=82$ is currently based mainly on properties of the first excited $2^+$ states. To extend structural information in this isotopic chain, in particular with respect to the balance of microscopic, seniority-type and collective excitations, electric quadrupole transition strengths from $4^+$ states need to be considered. An experiment was performed to determine the $4_1^+$ lifetime of $^{132}$Te via the recoil-distance Doppler-shift method at the University of Cologne tandem accelerator. The isotope of interest was populated in the two neutron-transfer reaction $^{130}$Te($^{18}$O,$^{16}$O)$^{132}$Te$^*$. The $E2$ decay transition strength has been determined to be $B(E2; 4^+_1\rightarrow 2^+_1) = 9.3(10)\, \text{W.u.}$ and compares favourably to shell model calculations.</description>

      <title>r-process nucleosynthesis with ab initio nuclear masses around the N=82 shell closure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our understanding of the origin of heavy elements beyond iron relies on the rapid neutron capture process (r-process), which accounts for roughly half of their cosmic abundance. However, the extreme neutron-rich conditions required for the r-process involve many nuclei that remain experimentally inaccessible, making theoretical predictions essential. We explore the impact of nuclear masses calculated with the ab initio valence-space in-medium similarity renormalization group, focusing on the region around the N = 82 shell closure. We show that such ab initio mass calculations can refine the r-process predictions compared to global, but more phenomenological mass models. With the ab initio masses, the waiting point of the second r-process peak is strengthened, which leads to an overall slower nucleosynthesis flow, lower abundances of nuclei beyond the peak, and a stronger shift of the third r-process peak.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Constraints on Pre-Equilibrium Jet Quenching and Predictions for Oxygen Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The contrast between the as-yet unmeasurable energy-loss effects in proton-nucleus collisions and the striking magnitude of the so-called high-momentum flow coefficients challenges our understanding of jet quenching mechanisms in large nucleus-nucleus collisions when applied to smaller systems. Intermediate-sized, light ion collisions will offer key insight into the system-size dependence of the interplay between jet energy loss and jet flow effects. To make quantitative predictions, we extend a semi-analytic jet quenching framework by coupling it to state-of-the-art event-by-event hydrodynamics and, for the first time, incorporate pre-equilibrium energy loss via the hydrodynamic attractor. A Bayesian analysis shows that an early-time onset of energy loss is compatible with RHIC and LHC measurements of jet suppression and jet elliptic flow in large systems, as well as hadron suppression, with the exception of hadron elliptic flow. Using these constraints, we predict both hadron and jet quenching observables in oxygen-oxygen collisions, finding sizable energy loss that exceeds the no-quenching baseline.</description>

      <title>Abnormal dense and dilute nuclear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Researchers have long been interested in exotic states of matter. In the early 1970s, Migdal proposed the existence of metastable or stable nuclei containing a pion condensate, and Bodmer posited the existence of collapsed nuclei with a quark core. Lee and Wick proposed that compressed nuclear matter could undergo a phase transition into a scalar condensate state with effectively very light baryons. In the mid-1980s, Witten pointed out that strange quark matter may be an absolutely stable form of matter that can exist in the form of quark strangelets. These hypotheses stimulated large experimental efforts to detect these states in heavy-ion collisions and in terrestrial samples. Additionally, the cosmos is the arena for a broad search for traces of exotic matter in compact objects and other energetic phenomena. We review various approaches and arguments for the possibility of abnormal states of matter, including metastable and stable dense objects with condensates, as well as dilute nuclear objects. Among these, we discuss scalar condensate and p-wave and s-wave pion condensations in dense nuclear systems and the formation of a $\Delta$ resonance matter. Then we consider a scalar mode condensation triggered by the Pomeranchuk instability in dilute nuclear matter, and clustering. We also mention recent ideas that a relativistic rotation and a dark-matter component may stabilize abnormal nuclear systems. Finally, we list some observational anomalies that cannot yet be appropriately explained by conventional physics.</description>

      <title>Search for the chiral magnetic effect through beam energy dependence of charge separation using event shape selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-energy, heavy-ion collisions can create local domains of chirality-imbalanced quarks, reflecting the topological features of quantum chromodynamics. The chiral magnetic effect (CME) predicts an electric charge separation of quarks in such topological domains along the magnetic field ($\vec{B}$) generated by the passing of two high-$Z$ nuclei. We use a correlation observable $\Delta\gamma^{112}$ between charged meson pairs to detect the CME-induced charge separation and a novel event shape selection (ESS) method to mitigate the background effects related to elliptic flow ($v_2$). The ESS method classifies events based on the emission pattern of final-state particles and determines $\Delta\gamma^{112}_{\rm ESS}$ from the zero-flow limit. We reconstruct the $\vec{B}$ field direction from the spectator nucleons, which minimizes backgrounds unrelated to the collective motion of the system. In this work, we report the measurements of $\Delta\gamma^{112}$ and a background indicator $\Delta\gamma^{132}$ in Au+Au collisions from the RHIC Beam Energy Scan phase II and at the top RHIC energy. After background suppression, $\Delta\gamma^{132}_{\rm ESS}$ aligns with zero, and $\Delta\gamma^{112}_{\rm ESS}$ is reduced to no more than 20\% of $\Delta\gamma^{112}$. We observe a finite residual charge separation with $2.6\sigma$, $3.1\sigma$, and $3.3\sigma$ significance in the 20\%--50\% centrality range of Au+Au collisions at 11.5, 14.6, and 19.6 GeV. The results at 17.3 and 27 GeV also show positive values but with a lower significance of $1.3\sigma$ and $1.1\sigma$, respectively. The corresponding $\Delta\gamma^{112}_{\rm ESS}$ values at 7.7, 9.2, and 200 GeV are consistent with zero within uncertainties.</description>

      <title>On the High Excitation 7$\alpha$ De-exciting States in $^{28}$Si$^*$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08878v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A direct comparison and analysis of published spectra for the 7$\alpha$ disassembly of $^{28}$Si projectiles excited in collisions with $^{12}$C at 35 MeV/u reveals significant agreement in the derived excitation energies of high excitation energy resonances observed in two different experiments, in contrast to some earlier conclusions reported in the literature. Many of the observed resonances have excitation energies consistent with those arrived at in recent theoretical investigations explicitly predicting the excitation energies and spins of toroidal nuclei. An AI-assisted application of well-established statistical filtering techniques reveals identical structures in all spectra investigated. Some additional peaks are observed. The possibility that they correspond to other favored geometries is discussed.</description>

Abstract: We report on a low-cost apparatus to extend a photomultiplier tube (PMT) testing setup to operations at high humidity and/or at an elevated temperature. This setup allows a determination of whether a PMT can successfully operate for an extended period of time in a high-humidity environment, such as the waterline of a water Cherenkov detector.</description>
