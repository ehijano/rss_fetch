      <title>The braided monoidal structure of tube algebra representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the tube algebra of a spherical semisimple multitensor category $\mathcal{X}$, and construct a braided monoidal structure with twist for its representations. We further show that this category is braided tensor equivalent with the Drinfeld center of the ind-category of $\mathcal{X}$, extending the well-known linear equivalence.</description>

      <title>Macdonald Index From Refined Kontsevich-Soibelman Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a refinement of the Kontsevich-Soibelman operator for a class of ``special'' 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theories characterized by the following conditions: (1) their Coulomb branch admits a source/sink chamber, i.e., a chamber in which the BPS quiver consists of only source and sink nodes, (2) The nodes with valency greater than 2 of the BPS quiver in a source/sink chamber are either all sources or all sinks. We present strong evidence that the trace of this refined operator is related to the Macdonald index of the theory. In particular, we conjecture closed form expressions for the Macdonald indices of the $(A_1,\mathfrak{g})$ Argyres-Douglas theories for any simply-laced Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$.</description>

      <title>Deformation quantisation of exact shifted symplectic structures, with an application to vanishing cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the author's and CPTVV's correspondence between shifted symplectic and Poisson structures to establish a correspondence between exact shifted symplectic structures and non-degenerate shifted Poisson structures with formal derivation, a concept generalising constructions by De Wilde and Lecomte. Our formulation is sufficiently general to encompass derived algebraic, analytic and $\mathcal{C}^{\infty}$ stacks, as well as Lagrangians and non-commutative generalisations. We also show that non-degenerate shifted Poisson structures with formal derivation carry unique self-dual deformation quantisations in any setting where the latter can be formulated.
  One application is that for (not necessarily exact) $0$-shifted symplectic structures in analytic and $\mathcal{C}^{\infty}$ settings, it follows that the author's earlier parametrisations of quantisations are in fact independent of any choice of associator, and generalise Fedosov's parametrisation of quantisations for classical manifolds.
  Our main application is to complex $(-1)$-shifted symplectic structures, showing that our unique quantisation of the canonical exact structure, a sheaf of twisted $BD_0$-algebras with derivation, gives rise to BBDJS's perverse sheaf of vanishing cycles, equipped with its monodromy operator.</description>

      <title>XC-tangles and universal invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of decorated abstract graphs, that we call XC-tangles, that provides a very convenient framework to study quantum invariants of tangles and virtual tangles. These can be viewed as a far-reaching generalisation of rotational tangle diagrams for (virtual) upwards tangles, and constitute the topological analogue of XC-algebras, the minimum algebraic structure needed to construct an knot isotopy invariant following the construction of Lawrence and Lee. XC-tangles admit a very natural description in terms of the so-called XC-Gauss diagrams, and this equivalence lifts the well-known equivalence between virtual upwards tangles and upwards Gauss diagrams. For every XC-algebra $A$, there is a naturally defined strict monoidal full functor $Z_A: \mathcal{T}^{\mathrm{XC}} \rightarrow v\mathcal{E}(A)$ from the category of XC-tangles to the "virtual category of elements of $A$". When $A$ is the endomorphism algebra of a finite-dimensional representation of a ribbon Hopf algebra, this functor can be viewed as an extension of the corresponding Reshetikhin-Turaev functor. Lastly, we also initiate the study of a theory of finite type invariants for one-component XC-tangles that lifts that for virtual long knots.</description>

      <title>Spectral torsion of the internal noncommutative geometry of the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the nonvanishing spectral torsion functional of the internal part of the noncommutative geometry behind the Standard Model. We show that with a suitable modification of the usual differential graded calculus it matches an analogous functional constructed in terms of the connection. We study also the impact of the torsion on the other spectral fuctionals, which correspond to geometric invariants such as volume integral, metric and Einstein tensors, and scalar curvature. We discuss the impact of the SM Yukawa couplings and the Majorana mass matrix on our results.</description>

      <title>Khovanov--Rozansky matrix factorization reduction for bipartite links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Khovanov-Rozansky (KR) link polynomial is a certain $t$-deformation of Wilson loops in 3-dimensional $SU(N)$ Chern--Simons topological field theory, believed to be an observable in the refined Chern-Simons theory, probably described in terms of 4d or 5d QFT and related by a certain procedure to the triply-graded link superpolynomial. This link invariant was originally introduced by M. Khovanov and L. Rozansky through a sophisticated matrix factorization technique based on the bicomplex structure, which depends on entire link diagrams and rapidly increases in complexity with the growth of a link. However, for particular link diagrams a local reduction is possible, allowing to eliminate vertices in a regular way, and thus, simplifying the KR polynomial and making it as simple as the Khovanov polynomial in the $N=2$ case. In particular, for a distinguished family of bipartite links, matrix factorization defined on MOY diagrams reduces just to planar cycles - very similar to the original Kauffman-Khovanov construction at $N=2$ for the Jones polynomial and its $t$-deformation. In the bipartite case, this can be done for any $N$. We make a further step of simplification and reduce from cohomology factor-rings in even variables crucially depending on a MOY diagram to vector spaces spanned by odd variables, so that the initial bicomplex of matrix factorizations becomes a monocomplex of just tensor products of $N$-dimensional vector spaces. We also find the explicit form of three universal morphisms which were guessed in a recent paper on this subject. Universality means independence of the other edges of the diagram, and we explain why this works in this particular case.</description>

      <title>Some components of the moduli space of Koszul Artin-Schelter regular algebras of dimension four</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the Hochschild cohomology and the Kodaira spencer map for known families of Koszul Artin-Schelter regular algebras of dimension four. We show that when the Kodaira Spencer map at a point is a surjection, the image of the family is a component of the moduli stack of such algebras, and when the Kodaira Spencer map is a bijection, the map to the moduli stack is generically finite. We use this to identify some components of the moduli stack.</description>

      <title>Duality for action bialgebroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of linear duality on action bialgebroids (also known as smash product or scalar extension bialgebroids) and, for those bearing a quantisation nature, the effect of Drinfeld functors underlying the quantum duality principle. By means of various categorical equivalences, it is shown that any braided commutative Yetter-Drinfeld algebra over any bialgebroid is also a braided commutative Yetter-Drinfeld algebra over the respective dual bialgebroid. This implies that the action bialgebroid of the dual exists, which is then proven to be isomorphic, as a bialgebroid, to the dual of the initial action bialgebroid: in short, (linear) duality commutes with the action bialgebroid construction. Similarly, for quantum groupoids to which the Drinfeld duality functors apply and the quantum duality principle holds, these Drinfeld duality functors are shown to commute with the action bialgebroid construction as well.</description>

      <title>Kleinian orbifolds, Cohomological Hall Algebras, and Yangians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish, for each orbifold crepantly resolving a Kleinian singularity, the existence of the cohomological Hall algebra (COHA) of coherent sheaves supported on the exceptional locus and explicitly compute this COHA as a completion of some positive half of the associated affine Yangian. Tracking these categories under derived autoequivalences and the McKay correspondence, we show that (1) every point in Bridgeland's space of stability conditions on the resolution arises from a Kleinian orbifold, and (2) every positive half of the affine Yangian can be recovered from the COHA associated to some such stability condition. This provides the first example of a family of (pointwise) COHAs defined over the space of stability conditions.</description>

Abstract: We study the crystal of quantum nilpotent subalgebra of $U_q(D_n)$ associated to a maximal Levi subalgebra of type $A_{n-1}$. We show that it has an affine crystal structure of type $D_n^{(1)}$ isomorphic to a limit of perfect Kirillov-Reshetikhin crystal $B^{n,s}$ for $s\geq 1$, and give a new polytope realization of $B^{n,s}$. We show that an analogue of RSK correspondence for type $D$ due to Burge is an isomorphism of affine crystals and give a generalization of Greene's formula for type $D$.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric graphs with quantum symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04889v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an infinite sequence of finite graphs with trivial automorphism group and non-trivial quantum automorphism group. These are the first known examples of graphs with this property. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, these are the first examples of any asymmetric classical space that has nontrivial quantum symmetries.
  Our construction is based on solution groups to (binary) linear systems, as defined by Cleve, Liu and Slofstra in the context of non-local games. We first show that the dual quantum group of every solution group occurs as the quantum automorphism group of some graph, and then construct an infinite sequence of systems whose solution groups are nontrivial perfect groups. This leads to the desired sequence of graphs.
  In addition to our main result, we prove a number of related results that allow us to answer several open problems from the literature. We prove a weak quantum analog of Frucht's theorem, namely that every finite classical group $\Gamma$ occurs as the quantum automorphism group of a finite graph. Combined with our main result, this shows that, for every finite group $\Gamma$, there are graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$ that both have classical automorphism group isomorphic to $\Gamma$ but one of them has quantum symmetry and the other does not. Therefore, the quantum automorphism group of a graph is never determined by its classical automorphism group, and there do not exist any "quantum excluding groups".</description>

      <title>Generalized cluster structures related to Poisson duals of $\mathrm{SL}_n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Poisson varieties $(\mathrm{SL}_n,\pi_{\bar{\mathbf{\Gamma}}}^{\dagger})$ parameterized by Belavin--Drinfeld quadruples $\bar{\mathbf{\Gamma}}:=(\mathbf{\Gamma},r_0)$ of type $A_{n-1}$ along with generalized cluster structures $\mathcal{GC}^{\dagger}(\mathbf{\Gamma})$ in $\mathbb{C}[\mathrm{SL}_n]$ compatible with $\pi_{\bar{\mathbf{\Gamma}}}^{\dagger}$. The Poisson structure $\pi_{\bar{\mathbf{\Gamma}}}^{\dagger}$ is a pushforward of the Poisson structure $\pi_{\bar{\mathbf{\Gamma}}}^*$ of the Poisson dual $\mathrm{SL}_n^*$ of $(\mathrm{SL}_n,\pi_{\bar{\mathbf{\Gamma}}})$. We prove that the generalized upper cluster algebra of $\mathcal{GC}^{\dagger}(\mathbf{\Gamma})$ is naturally isomorphic to $\mathbb{C}[\mathrm{SL}_n]$. Moreover, for any connected reductive complex group $G$ and a BD quadruple $(\mathbf{\Gamma},r_0)$, we produce a Poisson birational map $\mathcal{Q}:(G,\pi_{(\mathbf{\Gamma}_{\text{std}},r_0)}^{\dagger})\dashrightarrow(G,\pi_{(\mathbf{\Gamma},r_0)}^{\dagger})$, and when $G \in \{\mathrm{SL}_n,\mathrm{GL}_n\}$, we show that $\mathcal{Q}$ is a birational quasi-isomorphism between $\mathcal{GC}^\dagger(\mathbf{\Gamma}_{\text{std}})$ and $\mathcal{GC}^\dagger(\mathbf{\Gamma})$. Lastly, for any pair of BD triples $\tilde{\mathbf{\Gamma}} \prec \mathbf{\Gamma}$ of type $A_{n-1}$ comparable in the natural order, we use the map $\mathcal{Q}$ to construct a birational quasi-isomorphism between $\mathcal{GC}^{\dagger}(\tilde{\mathbf{\Gamma}})$ and $\mathcal{GC}^{\dagger}(\mathbf{\Gamma})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new construction of vertex algebras using the Deligne category. This approach provides a rigorous framework for defining the so-called large $N$ vertex algebra, which has appeared in recent physics literatures. We first define the notion of a vertex algebra in a symmetric monoidal category and extend familiar constructions in ordinary vertex algebras to this broader categorical context. As an application, we consider a $\beta\gamma$ vertex algebra in the Deligne category and construct the large N vertex algebra from it. We study some simple properties of this vertex algebra and analyze a certain vertex Poisson algebra limit.</description>

Abstract: Partition algebras with non-zero parameters are cellularly stratified and thus have the features of both cellular algebras and stratified algebras. Also, partition algebras form a tower of algebras. In this paper, we provide a diagrammatic approach to study the branching rules for cell modules on a tower of the partition algebras. This also allows us to calculate the structure constants of the Grothendieck ring of the tower.</description>

      <title>On certain noncommutative geometries via categories of sheaves of PI-algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose to study noncommutative geometry using the language of categories of sheaves of algebras with polynomial identities and their properties, introducing new (graded) noncommutative geometries, which include, for example, the following algebras: superalgebras, $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-graded superalgebras, Azumaya algebras, Clifford and quaternion algebras, the algebra of upper triangular matrices, quantum groups at roots of unity, and also some NC-schemes. More precisely, fix a group $G$, a $G$-graded associative algebra $A$ over a field $F$ of characteristic 0 and a topological space $X$; we construct a locally $G$-graded ringed space structure on $X$, where the sheaf structure belongs to the $G$-graded variety $\text{G-var}(A)$ of algebras generated by $A$, which classify all geometric spaces that belong to $\text{G-var}(A)$. We study conditions to compare two geometries in a (graded) Morita context, as well as their corresponding differential calculi.</description>

      <title>Quantum Corner VOA and the Super Macdonald Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17326v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a relation between the quantum corner VOA $q\widetilde{Y}_{L,0,N}[\Psi]$, which can be regarded as a generalization of quantum $W_N$ algebra, and Sergeev-Veselov super Macdonald polynomials. We demonstrate precisely that, under a specific map, the correlation functions of the currents of $q\widetilde{Y}_{L,0,N}[\Psi]$, coincide with the Sergeev-Veselov super Macdonald polynomials.</description>

      <title>Graphical configuration spaces, Contractads and Formality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a finite simple connected graph $\Gamma$, the graphical configuration space $\mathrm{Conf}_{\Gamma}(X)$ is the space of collections of points in $X$ indexed by the vertices of $\Gamma$, where points corresponding to adjacent vertices must be distinct. When $X=\mathbb{R}^d$ and the points are replaced by small disks, the resulting spaces for all possible graphs fit together into an algebraic structure that extends the little disks operad, called the little disks contractad $\mathcal{D}_d$. In this paper, we investigate the homotopical and algebraic properties of the little disks contractad $\mathcal{D}_d$. We construct and study Fulton-MacPherson compactifications of graphical configuration spaces, which provide a convenient model for $\mathcal{D}_d$ within the class of compact manifolds with boundary. Using these and wonderful compactifications, we prove that $\mathcal{D}_d$ is formal in the category of (Hopf) contractads for $d=1$, $d=2$, and for chordal graphs for any $d$. We also identify the first obstructions to coformality in the case of cyclic graphs. In addition, we give a combinatorial description of the cell structure of $\mathcal{D}_2$ and present applications to the study of graphical configuration spaces $\mathrm{Conf}_{\Gamma}(X)$ using the language of twisted algebras.</description>

      <title>An Extension of Khovanov Homology to Immersed Surface Cobordisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that an oriented surface in $\mathbb{R}^4$ containing double point singularities induces a map between the Khovanov homology groups of its boundary links in a functorial way. As part of this work, the movie moves of Carter and Saito are extended to surfaces with double points.</description>

      <title>Coalgebraic models of Omega-groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate models of algebraic theories in the category of cocommutative coalgebras over a field. We establish some of their categorical properties, similar to those of algebraic varieties. We introduce a class of categories of coalgebraic models of algebraic theories endowed with an underlying structure of cocommutative Hopf algebra, and show that these categories are semi-abelian. We call them ``categories of Omega-Hopf algebras'', since it is possible to characterize them as coalgebraic models of algebraic theories of Omega-groups.</description>

      <title>Twists and Gorms and Antifields, oh my!</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I define topological twists of supersymmetric field theories in the case when the supercharges involved obey an ``open'' algebra. Using the Batalin-Vilkovisky field-antifield formalism, I construct twisted theories algorithmically from the supersymmetry data, and explain supersymmetric localisation in terms of anticanonical transformations. I also treat equivariant topological twists and explain how BV observables contain the equivariant cohomology of the space of histories. Some results are generalised to theories with two topological supercharges -- such as the ``balanced'' topological field theories of Dijkgraaf and Moore -- using the geometry of ``differential gorms'' of Kochan and \v{S}evera. Finally, I exhibit examples of these constructions, including a $\mathrm{U}(1)$-equivariant topological B-model.</description>

      <title>Maulik-Okounkov quantum loop groups and Drinfeld double of preprojective $K$-theoretic Hall algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we prove the following results: Given the Drinfeld double $\mathcal{A}^{ext}_{Q}$ of the localised preprojective $K$-theoretic Hall algebra $\mathcal{A}^{+}_{Q}$ of quiver type $Q$ with the Cartan elements, there is a $\mathbb{Q}(q,t_e)_{e\in E}$-Hopf algebra isomorphism between $\mathcal{A}^{ext}_{Q}$ and the localised Maulik-Okounkov quantum loop group $U^{MO}_{q}(\hat{\mathfrak{g}}_{Q})$ of quiver type $Q$. Moreover, we prove the isomorphism of $\mathbb{Z}[q^{\pm1},t_{e}^{\pm1}]_{e\in E}$-algebras between the negative half of the integral Maulik-Okounkov quantum loop group $U_{q}^{MO,-,\mathbb{Z}}(\hat{\mathfrak{g}}_{Q})$ with the opposite algebra of the integral nilpotent $K$-theoretic Hall algebra $\mathcal{A}^{+,nilp,\mathbb{Z}}_{Q}$ of the same quiver type $Q$. As a result, one can identify the universal $R$-matrix for the root subalgebra $\mathcal{B}_{\mathbf{m},w}$ of the slope subalgebra $\mathcal{B}_{\mathbf{m}}$ in $\mathcal{A}^{ext}_{Q}$ with the wall $R$-matrix of the wall subalgebra $U_{q}^{MO}(\mathfrak{g}_{w})$ in $U^{MO}_{q}(\hat{\mathfrak{g}}_{Q})$.
  Moreover, under the integrality conjecture for the integral preprojective $K$-theoretic Hall algebra $\mathcal{A}^{+,\mathbb{Z}}_{Q}$, we prove the isomorphism of $\mathbb{Z}[q^{\pm1},t_{e}^{\pm1}]_{e\in E}$-algebras between the positive half of the integral Maulik-Okounkov quantum loop group $U_{q}^{MO,+,\mathbb{Z}}(\hat{\mathfrak{g}}_{Q})$ with the integral preprojective $K$-theoretic Hall algebra $\mathcal{A}^{+,\mathbb{Z}}_{Q}$ of the same quiver type $Q$.</description>
