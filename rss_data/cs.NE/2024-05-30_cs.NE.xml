      <title>Autonomous Driving with Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous driving demands an integrated approach that encompasses perception, prediction, and planning, all while operating under strict energy constraints to enhance scalability and environmental sustainability. We present Spiking Autonomous Driving (\name{}), the first unified Spiking Neural Network (SNN) to address the energy challenges faced by autonomous driving systems through its event-driven and energy-efficient nature. SAD is trained end-to-end and consists of three main modules: perception, which processes inputs from multi-view cameras to construct a spatiotemporal bird's eye view; prediction, which utilizes a novel dual-pathway with spiking neurons to forecast future states; and planning, which generates safe trajectories considering predicted occupancy, traffic rules, and ride comfort. Evaluated on the nuScenes dataset, SAD achieves competitive performance in perception, prediction, and planning tasks, while drawing upon the energy efficiency of SNNs. This work highlights the potential of neuromorphic computing to be applied to energy-efficient autonomous driving, a critical step toward sustainable and safety-critical automotive technology.

      <title>Automatic Graph Topology-Aware Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing efforts are dedicated to designing many topologies and graph-aware strategies for the graph Transformer, which greatly improve the model's representation capabilities. However, manually determining the suitable Transformer architecture for a specific graph dataset or task requires extensive expert knowledge and laborious trials. This paper proposes an evolutionary graph Transformer architecture search framework (EGTAS) to automate the construction of strong graph Transformers. We build a comprehensive graph Transformer search space with the micro-level and macro-level designs. EGTAS evolves graph Transformer topologies at the macro level and graph-aware strategies at the micro level. Furthermore, a surrogate model based on generic architectural coding is proposed to directly predict the performance of graph Transformers, substantially reducing the evaluation cost of evolutionary search. We demonstrate the efficacy of EGTAS across a range of graph-level and node-level tasks, encompassing both small-scale and large-scale graph datasets. Experimental results and ablation studies show that EGTAS can construct high-performance architectures that rival state-of-the-art manual and automated baselines.</description>

      <title>LLaMEA: A Large Language Model Evolutionary Algorithm for Automatically Generating Metaheuristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 have demonstrated their ability to understand natural language and generate complex code snippets. This paper introduces a novel Large Language Model Evolutionary Algorithm (LLaMEA) framework, leveraging GPT models for the automated generation and refinement of algorithms. Given a set of criteria and a task definition (the search space), LLaMEA iteratively generates, mutates and selects algorithms based on performance metrics and feedback from runtime evaluations. This framework offers a unique approach to generating optimized algorithms without requiring extensive prior expertise. We show how this framework can be used to generate novel black-box metaheuristic optimization algorithms automatically. LLaMEA generates multiple algorithms that outperform state-of-the-art optimization algorithms (Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy and Differential Evolution) on the five dimensional black box optimization benchmark (BBOB). The results demonstrate the feasibility of the framework and identify future directions for automated generation and optimization of algorithms via LLMs.</description>

      <title>Resonate-and-Fire Spiking Neurons for Target Detection and Hand Gesture Recognition: A Hybrid Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hand gesture recognition using radar often relies on computationally expensive fast Fourier transforms. This paper proposes an alternative approach that bypasses fast Fourier transforms using resonate-and-fire neurons. These neurons directly detect the hand in the time-domain signal, eliminating the need for fast Fourier transforms to retrieve range information. Following detection, a simple Goertzel algorithm is employed to extract five key features, eliminating the need for a second fast Fourier transform. These features are then fed into a recurrent neural network, achieving an accuracy of 98.21% for classifying five gestures. The proposed approach demonstrates competitive performance with reduced complexity compared to traditional methods</description>

      <title>Few for Many: Tchebycheff Set Scalarization for Many-Objective Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-objective optimization can be found in many real-world applications where some conflicting objectives can not be optimized by a single solution. Existing optimization methods often focus on finding a set of Pareto solutions with different optimal trade-offs among the objectives. However, the required number of solutions to well approximate the whole Pareto optimal set could be exponentially large with respect to the number of objectives, which makes these methods unsuitable for handling many optimization objectives. In this work, instead of finding a dense set of Pareto solutions, we propose a novel Tchebycheff set scalarization method to find a few representative solutions (e.g., 5) to cover a large number of objectives (e.g., $&gt;100$) in a collaborative and complementary manner. In this way, each objective can be well addressed by at least one solution in the small solution set. In addition, we further develop a smooth Tchebycheff set scalarization approach for efficient optimization with good theoretical guarantees. Experimental studies on different problems with many optimization objectives demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Low-dimensional approximations of the conditional law of Volterra processes: a non-positive curvature approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the conditional evolution of Volterra processes with stochastic volatility is a crucial challenge in mathematical finance. While deep neural network models offer promise in approximating the conditional law of such processes, their effectiveness is hindered by the curse of dimensionality caused by the infinite dimensionality and non-smooth nature of these problems. To address this, we propose a two-step solution. Firstly, we develop a stable dimension reduction technique, projecting the law of a reasonably broad class of Volterra process onto a low-dimensional statistical manifold of non-positive sectional curvature. Next, we introduce a sequentially deep learning model tailored to the manifold's geometry, which we show can approximate the projected conditional law of the Volterra process. Our model leverages an auxiliary hypernetwork to dynamically update its internal parameters, allowing it to encode non-stationary dynamics of the Volterra process, and it can be interpreted as a gating mechanism in a mixture of expert models where each expert is specialized at a specific point in time. Our hypernetwork further allows us to achieve approximation rates that would seemingly only be possible with very large networks.</description>

      <title>A random-key GRASP for combinatorial optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a problem-independent GRASP metaheuristic using the random-key optimizer (RKO) paradigm. GRASP (greedy randomized adaptive search procedure) is a metaheuristic for combinatorial optimization that repeatedly applies a semi-greedy construction procedure followed by a local search procedure. The best solution found over all iterations is returned as the solution of the GRASP. Continuous GRASP (C-GRASP) is an extension of GRASP for continuous optimization in the unit hypercube. A random-key optimizer (RKO) uses a vector of random keys to encode a solution to a combinatorial optimization problem. It uses a decoder to evaluate a solution encoded by the vector of random keys. A random-key GRASP is a C-GRASP where points in the unit hypercube are evaluated employing a decoder. We describe random key GRASP consisting of a problem-independent component and a problem-dependent decoder. As a proof of concept, the random-key GRASP is tested on five NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems: traveling salesman problem, tree of hubs location problem, Steiner triple covering problem, node capacitated graph partitioning problem, and job sequencing and tool switching problem.</description>

      <title>Towards Information Theory-Based Discovery of Equivariances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16555v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The presence of symmetries imposes a stringent set of constraints on a system. This constrained structure allows intelligent agents interacting with such a system to drastically improve the efficiency of learning and generalization, through the internalisation of the system's symmetries into their information-processing. In parallel, principled models of complexity-constrained learning and behaviour make increasing use of information-theoretic methods. Here, we wish to marry these two perspectives and understand whether and in which form the information-theoretic lens can "see" the effect of symmetries of a system. For this purpose, we propose a novel variant of the Information Bottleneck principle, which has served as a productive basis for many principled studies of learning and information-constrained adaptive behaviour. We show (in the discrete case and under a specific technical assumption) that our approach formalises a certain duality between symmetry and information parsimony: namely, channel equivariances can be characterised by the optimal mutual information-preserving joint compression of the channel's input and output. This information-theoretic treatment furthermore suggests a principled notion of "soft" equivariance, whose "coarseness" is measured by the amount of input-output mutual information preserved by the corresponding optimal compression. This new notion offers a bridge between the field of bounded rationality and the study of symmetries in neural representations. The framework may also allow (exact and soft) equivariances to be automatically discovered.</description>

      <title>Density Descent for Diversity Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diversity optimization seeks to discover a set of solutions that elicit diverse features. Prior work has proposed Novelty Search (NS), which, given a current set of solutions, seeks to expand the set by finding points in areas of low density in the feature space. However, to estimate density, NS relies on a heuristic that considers the k-nearest neighbors of the search point in the feature space, which yields a weaker stability guarantee. We propose Density Descent Search (DDS), an algorithm that explores the feature space via CMA-ES on a continuous density estimate of the feature space that also provides a stronger stability guarantee. We experiment with DDS and two density estimation methods: kernel density estimation (KDE) and continuous normalizing flow (CNF). On several standard diversity optimization benchmarks, DDS outperforms NS, the recently proposed MAP-Annealing algorithm, and other state-of-the-art baselines. Additionally, we prove that DDS with KDE provides stronger stability guarantees than NS, making it more suitable for adaptive optimizers. Furthermore, we prove that NS is a special case of DDS that descends a KDE of the feature space.</description>

      <title>Defining Neural Network Architecture through Polytope Structures of Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current theoretical and empirical research in neural networks suggests that complex datasets require large network architectures for thorough classification, yet the precise nature of this relationship remains unclear. This paper tackles this issue by defining upper and lower bounds for neural network widths, which are informed by the polytope structure of the dataset in question. We also delve into the application of these principles to simplicial complexes and specific manifold shapes, explaining how the requirement for network width varies in accordance with the geometric complexity of the dataset. Moreover, we develop an algorithm to investigate a converse situation where the polytope structure of a dataset can be inferred from its corresponding trained neural networks. Through our algorithm, it is established that popular datasets such as MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR10 can be efficiently encapsulated using no more than two polytopes with a small number of faces.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Branched Radial Basis Network Approach to Predicting Complex Chaotic Behaviours</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a multi branched network approach to predict the dynamics of a physics attractor characterized by intricate and chaotic behavior. We introduce a unique neural network architecture comprised of Radial Basis Function (RBF) layers combined with an attention mechanism designed to effectively capture nonlinear inter-dependencies inherent in the attractor's temporal evolution. Our results demonstrate successful prediction of the attractor's trajectory across 100 predictions made using a real-world dataset of 36,700 time-series observations encompassing approximately 28 minutes of activity. To further illustrate the performance of our proposed technique, we provide comprehensive visualizations depicting the attractor's original and predicted behaviors alongside quantitative measures comparing observed versus estimated outcomes. Overall, this work showcases the potential of advanced machine learning algorithms in elucidating hidden structures in complex physical systems while offering practical applications in various domains requiring accurate short-term forecasting capabilities.</description>
