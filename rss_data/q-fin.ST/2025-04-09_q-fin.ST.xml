      <title>Financial Analysis: Intelligent Financial Data Analysis System Based on LLM-RAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the modern financial sector, the exponential growth of data has made efficient and accurate financial data analysis increasingly crucial. Traditional methods, such as statistical analysis and rule-based systems, often struggle to process and derive meaningful insights from complex financial information effectively. These conventional approaches face inherent limitations in handling unstructured data, capturing intricate market patterns, and adapting to rapidly evolving financial contexts, resulting in reduced accuracy and delayed decision-making processes. To address these challenges, this paper presents an intelligent financial data analysis system that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology. Our system incorporates three key components: a specialized preprocessing module for financial data standardization, an efficient vector-based storage and retrieval system, and a RAG-enhanced query processing module. Using the NASDAQ financial fundamentals dataset from 2010 to 2023, we conducted comprehensive experiments to evaluate system performance. Results demonstrate significant improvements across multiple metrics: the fully optimized configuration (gpt-3.5-turbo-1106+RAG) achieved 78.6% accuracy and 89.2% recall, surpassing the baseline model by 23 percentage points in accuracy while reducing response time by 34.8%. The system also showed enhanced efficiency in handling complex financial queries, though with a moderate increase in memory utilization. Our findings validate the effectiveness of integrating RAG technology with LLMs for financial analysis tasks and provide valuable insights for future developments in intelligent financial data processing systems.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Factor Models: Generating High-Dimensional Returns with Factor Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial scenario simulation is essential for risk management and portfolio optimization, yet it remains challenging especially in high-dimensional and small data settings common in finance. We propose a diffusion factor model that integrates latent factor structure into generative diffusion processes, bridging econometrics with modern generative AI to address the challenges of the curse of dimensionality and data scarcity in financial simulation. By exploiting the low-dimensional factor structure inherent in asset returns, we decompose the score function--a key component in diffusion models--using time-varying orthogonal projections, and this decomposition is incorporated into the design of neural network architectures. We derive rigorous statistical guarantees, establishing nonasymptotic error bounds for both score estimation at O(d^{5/2} n^{-2/(k+5)}) and generated distribution at O(d^{5/4} n^{-1/2(k+5)}), primarily driven by the intrinsic factor dimension k rather than the number of assets d, surpassing the dimension-dependent limits in the classical nonparametric statistics literature and making the framework viable for markets with thousands of assets. Numerical studies confirm superior performance in latent subspace recovery under small data regimes. Empirical analysis demonstrates the economic significance of our framework in constructing mean-variance optimal portfolios and factor portfolios. This work presents the first theoretical integration of factor structure with diffusion models, offering a principled approach for high-dimensional financial simulation with limited data.</description>

      <title>Polyspectral Mean based Time Series Clustering of Indian Stock Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we employ k-means clustering algorithm of polyspectral means to analyze 49 stocks in the Indian stock market. We have used spectral and bispectral information obtained from the data, by using spectral and bispectral means with different weight functions that will give us varying insights into the temporal patterns of the stocks. In particular, the higher order polyspectral means can provide significantly more information than what we can gather from power spectra, and can also unveil nonlinear trends in a time series. Through rigorous analysis, we identify five distinctive clusters, uncovering nuanced market structures. Notably, one cluster emerges as that of a conglomerate powerhouse, featuring ADANI, BIRLA, TATA, and unexpectedly, government-owned bank SBI. Another cluster spotlights the IT sector with WIPRO and TCS, while a third combines private banks, government entities, and RELIANCE. The final cluster comprises publicly traded companies with dispersed ownership. Such clustering of stocks sheds light on intricate financial relationships within the stock market, providing valuable insights for investors and analysts navigating the dynamic landscape of the Indian stock market.</description>
