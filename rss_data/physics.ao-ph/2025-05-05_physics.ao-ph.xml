      <title>Satellite-Based Seasonal Fingerprinting of Methane Emissions from Canadian Dairy Farms Using Sentinel-5P</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Methane (CH4) emissions from dairy farming are a significant but under-quantified component of agricultural greenhouse gases. This study provides a satellite-based assessment of dairy-specific methane emissions across Canada using high-resolution Sentinel-5P TROPOMI data. By integrating spatial clustering of 1,701 dairy farms and processors, a quasi-experimental design with paired non-dairy reference regions, and seasonal pattern decomposition, we analyzed national and regional spatiotemporal emission trends. Results show persistently higher methane levels in dairy regions (mean difference: 16.99 ppb), with consistent fall-winter peaks. Notably, the dairy-specific methane anomaly, defined as the concentration difference between dairy and non-dairy regions declined by 62.25% from 2019 to 2024, with a sharp drop during 2022-2023 (-41.11%). Meanwhile, national methane levels rose by 3.83%, with increasing spatial heterogeneity across provinces. An inverse relationship between baseline methane levels and growth rates suggests a convergence effect. Seasonal analysis revealed universal spring minima and fall-winter maxima, offering distinct temporal signatures for source attribution. This study demonstrates the value of satellite-based monitoring for policy-relevant methane assessments and introduces a scalable framework applicable to other regions. The observed narrowing of dairy methane anomaly indicates evolving emission dynamics, potentially reflecting rising baseline methane rather than a definitive reduction in dairy source emissions. This highlights the need for integrated satellite and ground-based approaches to enhance understanding and guide mitigation efforts.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Ocean Flows with the Scattering Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Upper-ocean flows are a multi-scale jigsaw puzzle of turbulence and waves. Characterizing these flows is essential for understanding their role in redistributing heat, carbon, and nutrients, yet power spectral analysis cannot always distinguish between types of motion. We show that the scattering transform (ST), a wavelet convolution method, can extract geometric information from flow fields, offering insights beyond the power spectrum. The ST distinguishes balanced dynamics, internal waves, and types of turbulence -- even when their power spectra are identical. Applied to sea surface height (SSH) fields from ocean models, the ST differentiates regions with distinct underlying dynamics. Our analysis offers a framework for interpreting SSH from satellite altimetry missions and for analyzing other spatial maps (e.g., from airborne and coastal radar). More generally, the ST is an appealing way to characterize complex fluid motion in a variety of geophysical contexts.</description>

      <title>A Novel Dynamic Bias-Correction Framework for Hurricane Risk Assessment under Climate Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional hurricane track generation methods typically depend on biased outputs from Global Climate Models (GCMs), which undermines their accuracy in the context of climate change. We present a novel dynamic bias correction framework that adaptively corrects biases in GCM outputs. Our approach employs machine learning to predict evolving GCM biases, allowing dynamic corrections that account for changing climate conditions. By combining dimensionality reduction with data-driven surrogate modeling, we capture the system's underlying dynamics to produce realistic spatial distributions of environmental parameters under future scenarios. Using the empirical Weibull plotting approach, we calculate return periods for wind speed and rainfall across coastal cities. Our results reveal significant differences in projected risks with and without dynamic bias correction, emphasizing the increased threat to critical infrastructure in hurricane-prone regions. This work highlights the necessity of adaptive techniques for accurately assessing future climate impacts, offering a critical advancement in hurricane risk modeling and resilience planning.</description>

      <title>A Case Study of the Tornadic Supercell in the Province of Pampanga, Philippines (27 May 2024)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20559v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study provides an integrated damage, visual, environmental, and remote sensing analysis of the tornado event that struck the suburb of Candating in Arayat, Pampanga on 27 May 2024. Satellite imagery and photographs of the damage indicate that the tornado caused EF2 damage on the Enhanced Fujita (EF) scale across a $\sim$2 km path. Videos of the tornado and its parent storm reveal a well-defined wall cloud and low-level mesocyclone, but without a sign of precipitation curtain, indicative of its low-precipitation mode. Subsequent radar analysis supports these and other tornadic supercell features. Mid- and upper-tropospheric synoptic-scale ascent was subtle, influenced by the approach of TC Ewiniar. However, a modest meridional flow aloft over the area provided sufficient deep-layer shear to support supercell development. The southwest monsoon acted as a low-level jet, promoting warm, moist advection into western Luzon. The supercell developed around mid-noon and was characterized by large-undiluted instability, attributed to steep low-level lapse rates. Although low-level shear and its associated near-surface horizontal vorticity were weak, the latter is highly streamwise allowing for efficient ingestion, tilting, and stretching into vertical vorticity, which aided in tornadogenesis. Both satellite and radar data suggest that storm interactions (i.e., nudging process) and terrain interactions with nearby Mt. Arayat may have contributed to the initiation and intensification of the supercell through lee-side convergence and enhancing vorticity. The complex tropical environment of the Candating, Arayat tornado mirrors several characteristics of well-documented North American tornadic environments. This highlights the need for more research into the atmospheric conditions conducive to tornadic activity in the Philippines.</description>
