      <title>Voter Model stability with respect to conservative noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notions of noise sensitivity and stability were recently extended for the voter model. In this model, the vertices of a graph have opinions that are updated by uniformly selecting edges. We further extend stability results to different classes of perturbations. We consider two different types of noise: in the first one, an exclusion process is performed on the edge selections, while in the second, independent Brownian motions are applied to such a sequence. In both cases, we prove stability of the consensus opinion provided the noise is run for a short amount of time, depending on the underlying graph structure. This is done by analyzing the expected size of the pivotal set, whose definition differs from the usual one in order to reflect the change associated with these noises.</description>

      <title>Convergent points for random power series on the unit circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a random power series of the form $P(z) = \sum_{n\ge 1} \varepsilon_n a_n z^{n}$ where $a_n \in \mathbb{C}$ are deterministic and $\varepsilon_n$ are chosen independently and uniformly at random from $\{\pm 1\}$. Kolmogorov's three-series theorem states that if $\sum_{n} |a_n|^2 = \infty$ then $P(z)$ almost-surely diverges at almost every $z$ with $|z| = 1$. Dvoretzky and Erd\H{o}s proved in 1959 that if $|a_n| = \Omega(1/\sqrt{n})$ then in fact $P$ almost surely diverges at every $|z| = 1$. Erd\H{o}s then asked in 1961 if this is sharp, meaning that if $|a_n| = o(1/\sqrt{n})$ then there is almost surely some convergent point $z$ with $|z| = 1$. We prove this in a strong sense and show that if $a_n = o(1/\sqrt{n})$ then in fact the set of convergent points of $P$ with $|z| = 1$ has Hausdorff dimension $1$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a model of epidemics among moving particles on any locally finite graph. At any time, each vertex is empty, occupied by a healthy particle, or occupied by an infected particle. Infected particles recover at rate $1$ and transmit the infection to healthy particles at neighboring vertices at rate $\lambda$. In addition, particles perform an interchange process with rate $\mathsf{v}$, that is, the states of adjacent vertices are swapped independently at rate $\mathsf{v}$, allowing the infection to spread also through the movement of infected particles. On $\mathbb{Z}^d$, we start with a single infected particle at the origin and with all the other vertices independently occupied by a healthy particle with probability $p$ or empty with probability $1-p$. We define $\lambda_c(\mathsf{v}, p)$ as the threshold value for $\lambda$ above which the infection persists with positive probability and analyze its asymptotic behavior as $\mathsf{v} \to \infty$ for fixed $p$.</description>

      <title>An extension of the Stein/Malliavin-Stein method to independent random variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stein's method is a powerful method for characterizing laws of random variables and deriving estimates on the distance in law between a given random variable and a target random variable. In recent work, Stein's method for normal distributions has been extended to provide a characterization of normality together with independence with respect to an auxiliary random variable. We provide here an extension of Stein's method to include independence with respect to an auxiliary random variable, for any law for which a Stein characterization does exist.</description>

      <title>An iterated $I$-projection procedure for solving the generalized minimum information checkerboard copula problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The minimum information copula principle initially suggested in \cite{MeeBed97} is a maximum entropy-like approach for finding the least informative copula, if it exists, that satisfies a certain number of expectation constraints specified either from domain knowledge or the available data. We first propose a generalization of this principle allowing the inclusion of additional constraints fixing certain higher-order margins of the copula. We next show that the associated optimization problem has a unique solution under a natural condition. As the latter problem is intractable in general we consider its version with all the probability measures involved in its formulation replaced by checkerboard approximations. This amounts to attempting to solve a so-called discrete $I$-projection linear problem. We then exploit the seminal results of \cite{Csi75} to derive an iterated procedure for solving the latter and provide theoretical guarantees for its convergence. The usefulness of the procedure is finally illustrated via numerical experiments in dimensions up to four with substantially finer discretizations than those encountered in the literature.</description>

      <title>$q$-Deformed Discrete Whittaker Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a Markov process on non-negative integer arrays of a certain shape, this shape being determined by general parameters in the model which correspond to drifts. In the case where these drifts are trivial, the arrays are reverse plane partitions. This model is closely related to the Whittaker functions of the quantum group $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_{r+1})$ and the Toda lattice. Moreover, the Markov process we introduce can be viewed as a one-parameter deformation of the discrete Whittaker processes introduced by Neil O'Connell in [11]. We show that the $q$-deformed Markov process has non-trivial Markov projections to skew shapes.</description>

      <title>Group-averaged Markov chains: mixing improvement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For Markov kernels $P$ on a general state space $\mathcal{X}$, we introduce a new class of averaged Markov kernels $P_{da}(G,\nu)$ of $P$ induced by a group $G$ that acts on $\mathcal{X}$ and a probability measure $\nu$ on $G \times G$. Notable special cases are the group-orbit average $\overline{P}$, left-average $P_{la}$, right-average $P_{ra}$ and the independent-double-average $(P_{la})_{ra}$. For $\pi$-stationary $P$ in which $\pi$ is invariant with respect to $G$, we show that in general $P_{da}$ enjoys favorable convergence properties than $P$ based on metrics such as spectral gap or asymptotic variance, and within the family of $P_{da}$ the most preferable kernel is in general $(P_{la})_{ra}$. We demonstrate that $P_{la}, P_{ra}, (P_{la})_{ra}$ are comparable in terms of mixing times, which supports the use of $P_{la}, P_{ra}$ in practice as computationally cheaper alternatives over $(P_{la})_{ra}$. These averaged kernels also admit natural geometric interpretations: they emerge as unique projections of $P$ onto specific $G$-invariant structures under the Kullback-Leibler divergence or the Hilbert-Schmidt norm and satisfy Pythagorean identities. On the other hand, in the general case if $\pi$ is not invariant with respect to $G$, we propose and study a technique that we call state-dependent averaging of Markov kernels which generalizes the earlier results to this setting. As examples and applications, this averaging perspective not only allows us to recast state-of-the-art Markov chain samplers such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo or piecewise-deterministic Markov processes as specific cases of $P_{da}$, but also enables improvements to existing samplers such as Metropolis-Hastings, achieving rapid mixing in some toy models or when $\pi$ is the discrete uniform distribution.</description>

      <title>Elephant random walks on infinite Cayley trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we initiate the study of elephant random walks on finitely generated infinite groups whose Cayley graphs are homogeneous trees of degree $d \ge 3$ (e.g., groups of the form $\mathbb{Z}^{* d_1} * \mathbb{Z}_2^{*d_2}$ with $2d_1 + d_2 \ge 3$). We show that the asymptotic speed of the walk does not depend on the memory parameter $p \in [0, 1)$ and equals $\frac{d - 2}{d}$, the asymptotic speed of simple random walk on these graphs. The rate of convergence to the limiting speed turns out to depend on the memory parameter $p$ and one encounters phase transitions akin to elephant random walks on $\mathbb{Z}^d$.</description>

      <title>Mathematical research with GPT-5: a Malliavin-Stein experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On August 20, 2025, GPT-5 was reported to have solved an open problem in convex optimization. Motivated by this episode, we conducted a controlled experiment in the Malliavin--Stein framework for central limit theorems. Our objective was to assess whether GPT-5 could go beyond known results by extending a \emph{qualitative} fourth-moment theorem to a \emph{quantitative} formulation with explicit convergence rates, both in the Gaussian and in the Poisson settings. To the best of our knowledge, the derivation of such quantitative rates had remained an open problem, in the sense that it had never been addressed in the existing literature. The present paper documents this experiment, presents the results obtained, and discusses their broader implications.</description>

      <title>Multipoint distributions of the KPZ fixed point with compactly supported initial conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The KPZ fixed point is a universal limiting space-time random field for the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class. While the joint law of the KPZ fixed point at a fixed time has been studied extensively, the multipoint distributions of the KPZ fixed point in the general space-time plane are much less well understood. More explicitly, formulas were only available for the narrow wedge initial condition JR21 [arXiv:1906.01053], Liu22 [arXiv:1907.09876] and the flat initial condition Liu22 [arXiv:1907.09876] for the multipoint distributions, and the half-Brownian and Brownian initial conditions JR22 [arXiv:2010.07357v1], Rah25 [arXiv:2504.19975]. In this paper, we obtain the first formula for the space-time joint distributions of the KPZ fixed point with general initial conditions of compact support. We also verify that the equal time degenerated version of our formula matches the path integral formula in MQR21 [arXiv:1701.00018] for the KPZ fixed point.
  The formula is obtained through taking $1:2:3$ KPZ scaling limit of the multipoint distribution formulas for the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP). A key novelty is a probabilistic representation of the kernel encoding the initial condition for TASEP, which was first defined through an implicit characterization in Liu22 [arXiv:1907.09876].</description>

      <title>Zeros Of Random Analytic Functions And Spectral Properties Of Perturbed Unitary Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spectral properties of a rank-one multiplicative perturbation of a unitary matrix, a model introduced by Fyodorov. Building upon earlier results by Forrester and Ipsen, we provide a direct proof that the eigenvalues converge to the zeros of a specific Gaussian analytic function. Our approach extends these results to other unitarily invariant models. This method enables us to address a question raised by Dubach and Reker concerning the critical timescale at which an outlier emerges.</description>

Abstract: We consider a dynamical random interface on the infinite lattice $\mathbb{N}$ evolving according to a "corner flip" dynamic above a hard wall, with an additional pinning at the origin. We study the stationary fluctuations under a diffusive scaling and prove convergence in law towards the solution of an SPDE of Nualart-Pardoux's type, namely the Reflected Stochastic Heat Equation on the half-line. We also obtain that the law of the 3-dimensional Bessel process is an invariant measure for this SPDE.</description>

      <title>Functional Limit Theorems for the range of stable random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we establish Functional Limit Theorems for the range of random walks in $\mathbb{Z}^d$ that are in the domain of attraction of a non-degenerate $\beta$-stable process in the weakly transient and recurrent regimes. These results complement the fluctuations obtained at fixed time and the functional limit Theorems obtained in the strongly transient regime. The techniques involve original ideas of Le Gall and Rosen for fluctuations and allow to show tightness in some H\"older space, thus also providing sharp regularity results about the limiting processes. The original motivation of this work is the description of functionals appearing in spatial ecology for consumption of resources induced by random motion. We apply our result to estimate the large fluctuations of energy and mortality for a simple prey predator model.</description>

      <title>A Brenier Theorem on $(\mathcal{P}_2 (\mathcal{P}_2(\mathbb{R}^d )), W_2 )$ and Applications to Adapted Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brenier's fundamental theorem characterizes optimal transport plans for measures $\mu, \nu$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$ and quadratic distance costs in terms of gradients of convex functions. In particular it guarantees the existence of optimal transport maps for measures which are absolutely continuous wrt Lebesgue measure.
  Our goal is to provide a version of this result for measures $P,Q$ on $\mathcal{P}_2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ and costs given by the squared Wasserstein distance $W_2^2(\mu, \nu)$. We characterize optimizers in terms of convexity of the Lions lift. This is based on an observation which seems to be of independent interest: the $c$-transform of a functional $\phi$, where $c(\mu, \nu)$ denotes maximal covariance of $\mu, \nu$ corresponds precisely to the Legendre transform of the Lions lift of $\phi$. Moreover we show that for typical $P \in\mathcal{P}_2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ the optimizer is unique and given by a transport map. In the absence of a canonical reference measure on $\mathcal{P}_2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ we use a topological notion to make `typical' precise. Specifically we show that the transport regular measures are of second Baire category.
  A particular motivation for our article stems from the theory of adapted transport where the adapted Wasserstein distance provides an adequate distance between stochastic processes. In contrast to other metrics, the adapted Wasserstein distance yields continuity of Doob-decomposition, optimal stopping and stochastic control problems. Based on our results for measures on $\mathcal{P}_2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ we obtain a first Brenier-type theorem for the adapted Wasserstein distance.</description>

      <title>Random field reconstruction of inhomogeneous turbulence. Part II: Numerical approximation and simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel random field model for the reconstruction of inhomogeneous turbulence from characteristic flow quantities has been recently introduced and analyzed by the authors. This article concerns the numerical approximation and implementation of the model and discusses its key features by means of numerical simulations. We present an effective discretization scheme based on a randomized quadrature method for stochastic integrals. The convergence of the scheme is verified analytically and its algorithmic implementation is described in detail. Various numerical simulation results illustrate the influence of the macroscopically varying characteristic flow quantities on the inhomogeneous turbulence field and demonstrate its spatio-temporal ergodicity properties.</description>

      <title>Scale-Adaptive Generative Flows for Multiscale Scientific Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flow-based generative models can face significant challenges when modeling scientific data with multiscale Fourier spectra, often producing large errors in fine-scale features. We address this problem within the framework of stochastic interpolants, via principled design of noise distributions and interpolation schedules. The key insight is that the noise should not be smoother than the target data distribution -- measured by Fourier spectrum decay rates -- to ensure bounded drift fields near the initial time. For Gaussian and near-Gaussian distributions whose fine-scale structure is known, we show that spectrum-matched noise improves numerical efficiency compared to standard white-noise approaches. For complex non-Gaussian distributions, we develop scale-adaptive interpolation schedules that address the numerical ill-conditioning arising from rougher-than-data noise. Numerical experiments on synthetic Gaussian random fields and solutions to the stochastic Allen-Cahn and Navier-Stokes equations validate our approach and demonstrate its ability to generate high-fidelity samples at lower computational cost than traditional approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider independently identically distributed random compositions of the Gauss and R\'enyi maps that generate random continued fractions. Using methods of ergodic theory, thermodynamic formalism and large deviations, we show that weighted cycles of this random dynamical system equidistribute with respect to the Gauss-R\'enyi measure. We present both annealed (sample-averaged) and quenched (samplewise) results.</description>

      <title>Optimal Dividend Control with Transaction Costs under Exponential Parisian Ruin for a Refracted Levy Risk Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper concerns an optimal impulse control problem associated with a refracted L\'{e}vy process, involving the reduction of reserves to a predetermined level whenever they exceed a specified threshold. The ruin time is determined by Parisian exponential delays and limited by a lower ultimate bankrupt barrier. We initially obtained the necessary and sufficient conditions for the value function and the optimal impulse control policy. Given a candidate for the optimal strategy, the corresponding expected discounted dividend function is subsequently formulated in terms of the Parisian refracted scale function, which is employed to measure the expected discounted utility of the impulse control. Then, the optimality of the proposed impulse control is verified using the HJB inequalities, and a monotonicity-based criterion is established to identify the admissible region of optimal thresholds, which serves as the basis for the numerical computation of their optimal levels. Finally, we present applications and numerical examples related to Brownian risk process and Cram\'{e}r-Lundberg process with exponential claims, demonstrating the uniqueness of the optimal impulse strategy and exploring its sensitivity to parameters.</description>

      <title>Multi-period Asset-liability Management with Reinforcement Learning in a Regime-Switching Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the mean-variance portfolio selection problem in a multi-period financial market characterized by regime-switching dynamics and uncontrollable liabilities. To address the uncertainty in the decision-making process within the financial market, we incorporate reinforcement learning (RL) techniques. Specifically, the study examines an exploratory mean-variance (EMV) framework where investors aim to minimize risk while maximizing returns under incomplete market information, influenced by shifting economic regimes. The market model includes risk-free and risky assets, with liability dynamics driven by a Markov regime-switching process. To align with real-world scenarios where financial decisions are made over discrete time periods, we adopt a multi-period dynamic model. We present an optimal portfolio strategy derived using RL techniques that adapt to these market conditions. The proposed solution addresses the inherent time inconsistency in classical mean-variance models by integrating a pre-committed strategy formulation. Furthermore, we incorporate partial market observability, employing stochastic filtering techniques to estimate unobservable market states. Numerical simulations and empirical tests on real financial data demonstrate that our method achieves superior returns, lower risk, and faster convergence compared to traditional models. These findings highlight the robustness and adaptability of our RL-based solution in dynamic and complex financial environments.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Stability and Contraction Principles for Mean-Field G-SDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study mean-field stochastic differential equations (SDEs) driven by G-Brownian motion, extending recent work on existence and uniqueness by developing a full quantitative stability framework. Our main contribution is the construction of an intrinsic stability modulus that provides explicit bounds on the sensitivity of solutions with respect to perturbations in initial data (and, indirectly, coefficients). Using Bihari-Osgood type inequalities under G-expectation, we establish sharp continuity estimates for the data-to-solution map and analyze the asymptotic properties of the stability modulus. In particular, we identify contraction behavior on short horizons, leading to a contraction principle that guarantees uniqueness and global propagation of stability. The results apply under non-Lipschitz, non-deterministic coefficients with square-integrable initial data, thereby significantly broadening the scope of mean-field G-SDEs. Beyond existence and uniqueness, our framework quantifies robustness of solutions under volatility uncertainty, opening new directions for applications in stochastic control, risk management, and mean-field models under ambiguity.</description>

      <title>Large deviations for the $q$-deformed polynuclear growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study large time large deviations for the height function $\mathfrak{h}(x,t)$ of the $q$-deformed polynuclear growth introduced in ABW22 [arXiv:2108.06018]. We show that the upper-tail deviations have speed $t$ and derive an explicit formula for the rate function $\Phi_+(\mu)$. On the other hand, we show that the lower-tail deviations have speed $t^2$ and express the corresponding rate function $\Phi_-(\mu)$ in terms of a variational problem. Our analysis relies on distributional identities between the height function $\mathfrak{h}$ and two important measures on the set of integer partitions: the Poissonized Plancherel measure and the cylindric Plancherel measure. Following a scheme developed in DT21 [arXiv:1910.09271], we analyze a Fredholm determinant representation for the $q$-Laplace transform of $\mathfrak{h}(x,t)$, from which we extract exact Lyapunov exponents and through inversion the upper-tail rate function $\Phi_+$. The proof of the lower-tail large deviation principle is more subtle and requires several novel ideas which combine classical asymptotic results for the Plancherel measure and log-concavity properties of Schur polynomials. Techniques we develop to characterize the lower-tail are rather flexible and have the potential to generalize to other solvable growth models.</description>

      <title>The Spherical model and the large-$N$ limit of the Spin $O(N)$ model via the Gaussian free field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the relation between the spherical model of Berlin-Kac and the spin $O(N)$ model in the limit $N \to \infty$, and explain how they are connected via the discrete Gaussian free field (GFF).
  Using probabilistic limit theorems and concentration of measure, we prove that the infinite-volume limit of the spherical model on a $d$-dimensional torus is a massive GFF in the high-temperature regime, a standard GFF at the critical temperature, and a standard GFF plus a Rademacher random constant in the low-temperature regime. The proof at the critical temperature appears to be new and relies on a fine analysis of the zero-average Green's function on the torus.
  We study the spin $O(N)$ model in the double limit of spin dimensionality and torus size. Sending $N \to \infty$ first, and then the torus size to infinity, we show that the different spin coordinates become i.i.d. fields, distributed as a massive GFF in the high-temperature regime, a standard GFF at the critical temperature, and a standard GFF plus a Gaussian random constant in the low-temperature regime.
  In particular, although the limiting free energies per site of the two models agree at all temperatures, their finite-dimensional laws still differ in terms of their zero modes in the low-temperature regime.</description>

Abstract: We consider a model of $d$-dimensional interacting quantum Bose gas, expressed in terms of an ensemble of interacting Brownian bridges in a large box and undergoing the influence of all the interactions between the legs of each of the Brownian bridges. We study the thermodynamic limit of the system and give an explicit formula for the limiting free energy and a necessary and sufficient criterion for the occurrence of a condensation phase transition. For $d\geq 5$ and sufficiently small interaction, we prove that the condensate phase is not empty. The ideas of proof rely on the similarity of the interaction to that of the self-repellent random walk, and build on a lace expansion method conducive to treating {\it paths} undergoing mutual repellence within each bridge.</description>

Abstract: This article investigates the existence, uniqueness, and regularity of solutions to nonlinear stochastic reaction-diffusion-advection equations (SRDAEs) with spatially homogeneous colored noises and infinitesimal generators of subordinate Brownian motions in mixed norm $L_q(L_p)$-spaces. We introduce a new condition (strongly reinforced Dalang's condition) on colored noise, which facilitates a deeper understanding of the complicated relation between nonlinearities and stochastic forces. Additionally, we establish the space-time H\"older type regularity of solutions.</description>

      <title>Non-Uniqueness Phase in Hyperbolic Marked Random Connection Models using the Spherical Transform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A non-uniqueness phase for infinite clusters is proven for a class of marked random connection models on the $d$-dimensional hyperbolic space, ${\mathbb{H}^d}$, in a high volume-scaling regime. The approach taken in this paper utilizes the spherical transform on ${\mathbb{H}^d}$ to diagonalize convolution by the adjacency function and the two-point function and bound their $L^2\to L^2$ operator norms. Under some circumstances, this spherical transform approach also provides bounds on the triangle diagram that allows for a derivation of certain mean-field critical exponents. In particular, the results are applied to some Boolean and weight-dependent hyperbolic random connection models. While most of the paper is concerned with the high volume-scaling regime, the existence of the non-uniqueness phase is also proven without this scaling for some random connection models whose resulting graphs are almost surely not locally finite.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates a diffusion process in a narrow tubular domain with reflecting boundary conditions, where the geometry serves as a singular perturbation of an underlying graph in $\mathbb{R}^2$ or $\mathbb{R}^3$. The construction incorporates distinct scaling regimes in the neighborhoods of the graph's vertices and edges. We show that, in the limit, the projected process converges weakly to a diffusion process on the graph, with gluing conditions at the vertices that depend on the relative scales of the neighborhoods. Our analysis relies on a detailed understanding of the narrow escape problem in domains with bottlenecks. In particular, we rigorously derive the asymptotic behavior of the expected escape time, establish the asymptotic exponential distribution of escape times and obtain exit place estimates, results that may be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.08056v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Probability measures on the sphere form an important class of statistical models and are used, for example, in modeling directional data or shapes. Due to their widespread use, but also as an algorithmic building block, efficient sampling of distributions on the sphere is highly desirable. We propose a shrinkage based and an idealized geodesic slice sampling Markov chain, designed to generate approximate samples from distributions on the sphere. In particular, the shrinkage-based version of the algorithm can be implemented such that it runs efficiently in any dimension and has no tuning parameters. We verify reversibility and prove that under weak regularity conditions geodesic slice sampling is uniformly ergodic. Numerical experiments show that the proposed slice samplers achieve excellent mixing on challenging targets including the Bingham distribution and mixtures of von Mises-Fisher distributions. In these settings our approach outperforms standard samplers such as random-walk Metropolis-Hastings and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00084v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a Boolean function f on the n-dimensional hypercube, and a set of variables (indexed by) $S \subset \{1,2,\ldots,n\}.$ The coalition influence of the variables S on a function f is the probability that after a random assignment of variables not in S, the value of f is undetermined. In this paper, we study a complementary notion, which we call the joint influence: the probability that, after a random assignment of variables not in S, the value of f is dependent on all variables in S.
  We show that for an arbitrary fixed d, every Boolean function f on n variables admits a d-set of joint influence at least $\tfrac{1}{10} W^{\geq d}(f) (\frac{\log n}{n})^d$, where $W^{\geq d}(f)$ is the Fourier weight of f at degrees at least d. This result is a direct generalisation of the Kahn-Kalai-Linial theorem. Further, we give an example demonstrating essential sharpness of the above bound. In our study of the joint influence we consider another notion of multi-bit influence recently introduced by Tal.</description>

      <title>Single-seed generation of Brownian paths and integrals for adaptive and high order SDE solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06464v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the success of adaptive time-stepping in ODE simulation, it has so far seen few applications for Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs). To simulate SDEs adaptively, methods such as the Virtual Brownian Tree (VBT) have been developed, which can generate Brownian motion (BM) non-chronologically. However, in most applications, knowing only the values of Brownian motion is not enough to achieve a high order of convergence; for that, we must compute time-integrals of BM such as $\int_s^t W_r \, dr$. With the aim of using high order SDE solvers adaptively, we extend the VBT to generate these integrals of BM in addition to the Brownian increments. A JAX-based implementation of our construction is included in the popular Diffrax library (https://github.com/patrick-kidger/diffrax).
  Since the entire Brownian path produced by VBT is uniquely determined by a single PRNG seed, previously generated samples need not be stored, which results in a constant memory footprint and enables experiment repeatability and strong error estimation. Based on binary search, the VBT's time complexity is logarithmic in the tolerance parameter $\varepsilon$. Unlike the original VBT algorithm, which was only precise at some dyadic times, we prove that our construction exactly matches the joint distribution of the Brownian motion and its time integrals at any query times, provided they are at least $\varepsilon$ apart.
  We present two applications of adaptive high order solvers enabled by our new VBT. Using adaptive solvers to simulate a high-volatility CIR model, we achieve more than twice the convergence order of constant stepping. We apply an adaptive third order underdamped or kinetic Langevin solver to an MCMC problem, where our approach outperforms the No U-Turn Sampler, while using only a tenth of its function evaluations.</description>

Abstract: An independent set may not contain both a vertex and one of its neighbours. This basic fact makes the uniform distribution over independent sets rather special. We consider the hard-core model, an essential generalization of the uniform distribution over independent sets. We show how its local analysis yields remarkable insights into the global structure of independent sets in the host graph, in connection with, for instance, Ramsey numbers, graph colourings, and sphere packings.</description>

Abstract: Building upon the knowledge of the distribution of the first positive position reached by a random walker starting from the origin, one can derive new results on the statistics of the gap between the largest and second-largest positions of the walk, and recover known ones in a more direct manner.</description>
