      <title>BSCodec: A Band-Split Neural Codec for High-Quality Universal Audio Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural audio codecs have recently enabled high-fidelity reconstruction at high compression rates, especially for speech. However, speech and non-speech audio exhibit fundamentally different spectral characteristics: speech energy concentrates in narrow bands around pitch harmonics (80-400 Hz), while non-speech audio requires faithful reproduction across the full spectrum, particularly preserving higher frequencies that define timbre and texture. This poses a challenge: speech-optimized neural codecs suffer degradation on music or sound. Treating the full spectrum holistically is suboptimal: frequency bands have vastly different information density and perceptual importance by content type, yet full-band approaches apply uniform capacity across frequencies without accounting for these acoustic structures. To address this gap, we propose BSCodec (Band-Split Codec), a novel neural audio codec architecture that splits the spectral dimension into separate bands and compresses each band independently. Experimental results demonstrate that BSCodec achieves superior reconstruction over baselines across sound and music, while maintaining competitive quality in the speech domain, when trained on the same combined dataset of speech, music and sound. Downstream benchmark tasks further confirm that BSCodec shows strong potential for use in downstream applications.</description>

      <title>IDMap: A Pseudo-Speaker Generator Framework Based on Speaker Identity Index to Vector Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Facilitated by the speech generation framework that disentangles speech into content, speaker, and prosody, voice anonymization is accomplished by substituting the original speaker embedding vector with that of a pseudo-speaker. In this framework, the pseudo-speaker generation forms a fundamental challenge. Current pseudo-speaker generation methods demonstrate limitations in the uniqueness of pseudo-speakers, consequently restricting their effectiveness in voice privacy protection. Besides, existing model-based methods suffer from heavy computation costs. Especially, in the large-scale scenario where a huge number of pseudo-speakers are generated, the limitations of uniqueness and computational inefficiency become more significant. To this end, this paper proposes a framework for pseudo-speaker generation, which establishes a mapping from speaker identity index to speaker vector in the feedforward architecture, termed IDMap. Specifically, the framework is specified into two models: IDMap-MLP and IDMap-Diff. Experiments were conducted on both small- and large-scale evaluation datasets. Small-scale evaluations on the LibriSpeech dataset validated the effectiveness of the proposed IDMap framework in enhancing the uniqueness of pseudo-speakers, thereby improving voice privacy protection, while at a reduced computational cost. Large-scale evaluations on the MLS and Common Voice datasets further justified the superiority of the IDMap framework regarding the stability of the voice privacy protection capability as the number of pseudo-speakers increased. Audio samples and open-source code can be found in https://github.com/VoicePrivacy/IDMap.</description>

      <title>SPUR: A Plug-and-Play Framework for Integrating Spatial Audio Understanding and Reasoning into Large Audio-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial perception is central to auditory intelligence, enabling accurate understanding of real-world acoustic scenes and advancing human-level perception of the world around us. While recent large audio-language models (LALMs) show strong reasoning over complex audios, most operate on monaural inputs and lack the ability to capture spatial cues such as direction, elevation, and distance. We introduce SPUR, a lightweight, plug-in approach that equips LALMs with spatial perception through minimal architectural changes. SPUR consists of: (i) a First-Order Ambisonics (FOA) encoder that maps (W, X, Y, Z) channels to rotation-aware, listener-centric spatial features, integrated into target LALMs via a multimodal adapter; and (ii) SPUR-Set, a spatial QA dataset combining open-source FOA recordings with controlled simulations, emphasizing relative direction, elevation, distance, and overlap for supervised spatial reasoning. Fine-tuning our model on the SPUR-Set consistently improves spatial QA and multi-speaker attribution while preserving general audio understanding. SPUR provides a simple recipe that transforms monaural LALMs into spatially aware models. Extensive ablations validate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Neural Directional Filtering Using a Compact Microphone Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beamforming with desired directivity patterns using compact microphone arrays is essential in many audio applications. Directivity patterns achievable using traditional beamformers depend on the number of microphones and the array aperture. Generally, their effectiveness degrades for compact arrays. To overcome these limitations, we propose a neural directional filtering (NDF) approach that leverages deep neural networks to enable sound capture with a predefined directivity pattern. The NDF computes a single-channel complex mask from the microphone array signals, which is then applied to a reference microphone to produce an output that approximates a virtual directional microphone with the desired directivity pattern. We introduce training strategies and propose data-dependent metrics to evaluate the directivity pattern and directivity factor. We show that the proposed method: i) achieves a frequency-invariant directivity pattern even above the spatial aliasing frequency, ii) can approximate diverse and higher-order patterns, iii) can steer the pattern in different directions, and iv) generalizes to unseen conditions. Lastly, experimental comparisons demonstrate superior performance over conventional beamforming and parametric approaches.</description>

      <title>Omni-AVSR: Towards Unified Multimodal Speech Recognition with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved impressive results in speech recognition across multiple modalities, including Auditory Speech Recognition (ASR), Visual Speech Recognition (VSR), and Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR). Despite this progress, current LLM-based approaches typically address each task independently, training separate models that raise computational and deployment resource use while missing potential cross-task synergies. They also rely on fixed-rate token compression, which restricts flexibility in balancing accuracy with efficiency. These limitations highlight the need for a unified framework that can support ASR, VSR, and AVSR while enabling elastic inference. To this end, we present Omni-AVSR, a unified audio-visual LLM that combines efficient multi-granularity training with parameter-efficient adaptation. Specifically, we adapt the matryoshka representation learning paradigm to efficiently train across multiple audio and visual granularities, reducing its inherent training resource use. Furthermore, we explore three LoRA-based strategies for adapting the backbone LLM, balancing shared and task-specific specialization. Experiments on LRS2 and LRS3 show that Omni-AVSR achieves comparable or superior accuracy to state-of-the-art baselines while training a single model at substantially lower training and deployment resource use. The model also remains robust under acoustic noise, and we analyze its scaling behavior as LLM size increases, providing insights into the trade-off between performance and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Ming-UniAudio: Speech LLM for Joint Understanding, Generation and Editing with Unified Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing speech models suffer from competing requirements on token representations by understanding and generation tasks. This discrepancy in representation prevents speech language models from performing instruction-based free-form editing. To solve this challenge, we introduce a novel framework that unifies speech understanding, generation, and editing. The core of our unified model is a unified continuous speech tokenizer MingTok-Audio, the first continuous tokenizer to effectively integrate semantic and acoustic features, which makes it suitable for both understanding and generation tasks. Based on this unified continuous audio tokenizer, we developed the speech language model Ming-UniAudio, which achieved a balance between generation and understanding capabilities. Ming-UniAudio sets new state-of-the-art (SOTA) records on 8 out of 12 metrics on the ContextASR benchmark. Notably, for Chinese voice cloning, it achieves a highly competitive Seed-TTS-WER of 0.95. Leveraging this foundational model, we further trained a dedicated speech editing model Ming-UniAudio-Edit, the first speech language model that enables universal, free-form speech editing guided solely by natural language instructions, handling both semantic and acoustic modifications without timestamp condition. To rigorously assess the editing capability and establish a foundation for future research, we introduce Ming-Freeform-Audio-Edit, the first comprehensive benchmark tailored for instruction-based free-form speech editing, featuring diverse scenarios and evaluation dimensions spanning semantic correctness, acoustic quality, and instruction alignment. We open-sourced the continuous audio tokenizer, the unified foundational model, and the free-form instruction-based editing model to facilitate the development of unified audio understanding, generation, and manipulation.</description>

      <title>Who Gets Heard? Rethinking Fairness in AI for Music Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the music research community has examined risks of AI models for music, with generative AI models in particular, raised concerns about copyright, deepfakes, and transparency. In our work, we raise concerns about cultural and genre biases in AI for music systems (music-AI systems) which affect stakeholders including creators, distributors, and listeners shaping representation in AI for music. These biases can misrepresent marginalized traditions, especially from the Global South, producing inauthentic outputs (e.g., distorted ragas) that reduces creators' trust on these systems. Such harms risk reinforcing biases, limiting creativity, and contributing to cultural erasure. To address this, we offer recommendations at dataset, model and interface level in music-AI systems.</description>

      <title>ELEGANCE: Efficient LLM Guidance for Audio-Visual Target Speech Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-visual target speaker extraction (AV-TSE) models primarily rely on visual cues from the target speaker. However, humans also leverage linguistic knowledge, such as syntactic constraints, next word prediction, and prior knowledge of conversation, to extract target speech. Inspired by this observation, we propose ELEGANCE, a novel framework that incorporates linguistic knowledge from large language models (LLMs) into AV-TSE models through three distinct guidance strategies: output linguistic constraints, intermediate linguistic prediction, and input linguistic prior. Comprehensive experiments with RoBERTa, Qwen3-0.6B, and Qwen3-4B on two AV-TSE backbones demon- strate the effectiveness of our approach. Significant improvements are observed in challenging scenarios, including visual cue impaired, unseen languages, target speaker switches, increased interfering speakers, and out-of-domain test set.

      <title>EchoMark: Perceptual Acoustic Environment Transfer with Watermark-Embedded Room Impulse Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Acoustic Environment Matching (AEM) is the task of transferring clean audio into a target acoustic environment, enabling engaging applications such as audio dubbing and auditory immersive virtual reality (VR). Recovering similar room impulse response (RIR) directly from reverberant speech offers more accessible and flexible AEM solution. However, this capability also introduces vulnerabilities of arbitrary ``relocation" if misused by malicious user, such as facilitating advanced voice spoofing attacks or undermining the authenticity of recorded evidence. To address this issue, we propose EchoMark, the first deep learning-based AEM framework that generates perceptually similar RIRs with embedded watermark. Our design tackle the challenges posed by variable RIR characteristics, such as different durations and energy decays, by operating in the latent domain. By jointly optimizing the model with a perceptual loss for RIR reconstruction and a loss for watermark detection, EchoMark achieves both high-quality environment transfer and reliable watermark recovery. Experiments on diverse datasets validate that EchoMark achieves room acoustic parameter matching performance comparable to FiNS, the state-of-the-art RIR estimator. Furthermore, a high Mean Opinion Score (MOS) of 4.22 out of 5, watermark detection accuracy exceeding 99\%, and bit error rates (BER) below 0.3\% collectively demonstrate the effectiveness of EchoMark in preserving perceptual quality while ensuring reliable watermark embedding.</description>

      <title>MedVoiceBias: A Controlled Study of Audio LLM Behavior in Clinical Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language models transition from text-based interfaces to audio interactions in clinical settings, they might introduce new vulnerabilities through paralinguistic cues in audio. We evaluated these models on 170 clinical cases, each synthesized into speech from 36 distinct voice profiles spanning variations in age, gender, and emotion. Our findings reveal a severe modality bias: surgical recommendations for audio inputs varied by as much as 35% compared to identical text-based inputs, with one model providing 80% fewer recommendations. Further analysis uncovered age disparities of up to 12% between young and elderly voices, which persisted in most models despite chain-of-thought prompting. While explicit reasoning successfully eliminated gender bias, the impact of emotion was not detected due to poor recognition performance. These results demonstrate that audio LLMs are susceptible to making clinical decisions based on a patient's voice characteristics rather than medical evidence, a flaw that risks perpetuating healthcare disparities. We conclude that bias-aware architectures are essential and urgently needed before the clinical deployment of these models.</description>

      <title>On the Joint Minimization of Regularization Loss Functions in Deep Variational Bayesian Methods for Attribute-Controlled Symbolic Music Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explicit latent variable models provide a flexible yet powerful framework for data synthesis, enabling controlled manipulation of generative factors. With latent variables drawn from a tractable probability density function that can be further constrained, these models enable continuous and semantically rich exploration of the output space by navigating their latent spaces. Structured latent representations are typically obtained through the joint minimization of regularization loss functions. In variational information bottleneck models, reconstruction loss and Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) are often linearly combined with an auxiliary Attribute-Regularization (AR) loss. However, balancing KLD and AR turns out to be a very delicate matter. When KLD dominates over AR, generative models tend to lack controllability; when AR dominates over KLD, the stochastic encoder is encouraged to violate the standard normal prior. We explore this trade-off in the context of symbolic music generation with explicit control over continuous musical attributes. We show that existing approaches struggle to jointly minimize both regularization objectives, whereas suitable attribute transformations can help achieve both controllability and regularization of the target latent dimensions.</description>

      <title>Generating Novel and Realistic Speakers for Voice Conversion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Voice conversion models modify timbre while preserving paralinguistic features, enabling applications like dubbing and identity protection. However, most VC systems require access to target utterances, limiting their use when target data is unavailable or when users desire conversion to entirely novel, unseen voices. To address this, we introduce a lightweight method SpeakerVAE to generate novel speakers for VC. Our approach uses a deep hierarchical variational autoencoder to model the speaker timbre space. By sampling from the trained model, we generate novel speaker representations for voice synthesis in a VC pipeline. The proposed method is a flexible plug-in module compatible with various VC models, without co-training or fine-tuning of the base VC system. We evaluated our approach with state-of-the-art VC models: FACodec and CosyVoice2. The results demonstrate that our method successfully generates novel, unseen speakers with quality comparable to that of the training speakers.</description>

      <title>Conditional Diffusion as Latent Constraints for Controllable Symbolic Music Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in latent diffusion models have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in high-dimensional time-series data synthesis while providing flexible control through conditioning and guidance. However, existing methodologies primarily rely on musical context or natural language as the main modality of interacting with the generative process, which may not be ideal for expert users who seek precise fader-like control over specific musical attributes. In this work, we explore the application of denoising diffusion processes as plug-and-play latent constraints for unconditional symbolic music generation models. We focus on a framework that leverages a library of small conditional diffusion models operating as implicit probabilistic priors on the latents of a frozen unconditional backbone. While previous studies have explored domain-specific use cases, this work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to demonstrate the versatility of such an approach across a diverse array of musical attributes, such as note density, pitch range, contour, and rhythm complexity. Our experiments show that diffusion-driven constraints outperform traditional attribute regularization and other latent constraints architectures, achieving significantly stronger correlations between target and generated attributes while maintaining high perceptual quality and diversity.</description>

Abstract: Although a variety of transformers have been proposed for symbolic music generation in recent years, there is still little comprehensive study on how specific design choices affect the quality of the generated music. In this work, we systematically compare different datasets, model architectures, model sizes, and training strategies for the task of symbolic piano music generation. To support model development and evaluation, we examine a range of quantitative metrics and analyze how well they correlate with human judgment collected through listening studies. Our best-performing model, a 950M-parameter transformer trained on 80K MIDI files from diverse genres, produces outputs that are often rated as human-composed in a Turing-style listening survey.</description>

Abstract: Speech technology for communication, accessing information, and services has rapidly improved in quality. It is convenient and appealing because speech is the primary mode of communication for humans. Such technology, however, also presents proven threats to privacy. Speech is a tool for communication and it will thus inherently contain private information. Importantly, it however also contains a wealth of side information, such as information related to health, emotions, affiliations, and relationships, all of which are private. Exposing such private information can lead to serious threats such as price gouging, harassment, extortion, and stalking. This paper is a tutorial on privacy issues related to speech technology, modeling their threats, approaches for protecting users' privacy, measuring the performance of privacy-protecting methods, perception of privacy as well as societal and legal consequences. In addition to a tutorial overview, it also presents lines for further development where improvements are most urgently needed.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Convolution for CNN-based Speech Enhancement Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning-based speech enhancement methods have significantly improved speech quality and intelligibility. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been proven to be essential components of many high-performance models. In this paper, we introduce adaptive convolution, an efficient and versatile convolutional module that enhances the model's capability to adaptively represent speech signals. Adaptive convolution performs frame-wise causal dynamic convolution, generating time-varying kernels for each frame by assembling multiple parallel candidate kernels. A lightweight attention mechanism is proposed for adaptive convolution, leveraging both current and historical information to assign adaptive weights to each candidate kernel. This enables the convolution operation to adapt to frame-level speech spectral features, leading to more efficient extraction and reconstruction. We integrate adaptive convolution into various CNN-based models, highlighting its generalizability. Experimental results demonstrate that adaptive convolution significantly improves the performance with negligible increases in computational complexity, especially for lightweight models. Moreover, we present an intuitive analysis revealing a strong correlation between kernel selection and signal characteristics. Furthermore, we propose the adaptive convolutional recurrent network (AdaptCRN), an ultra-lightweight model that incorporates adaptive convolution and an efficient encoder-decoder design, achieving superior performance compared to models with similar or even higher computational costs.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap between Continuous and Informative Discrete Representations by Random Product Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has become a core technique in speech processing, but the high dimensionality of its representations makes discretization essential for improving efficiency. However, existing discretization methods still suffer from significant information loss, resulting in a notable performance gap compared to continuous representations. To overcome these limitations, we propose two quantization-based discretization methods: Product Quantization (PQ) and Random Product Quantization (RPQ). PQ partitions the original feature space into multiple subspaces and independently quantizes each sub-vector, producing a fused set of discrete units that retain diverse information from different subspaces, thereby mitigating the loss associated with single-cluster quantization. RPQ further enhances representation diversity by randomly sampling a fixed proportion of feature dimensions multiple times to construct sub-vectors, thereby better capturing the variability in the data distribution. Theoretical analysis shows that RPQ reduces the correlation coefficient rho (where 0 &lt;= rho &lt;= 1) between sub-quantizers. Its quantization error is lower-bounded by the product of rho and epsilon-kms, where epsilon-kms denotes the quantization error of a single K-means quantizer. Experimental results on a combined dataset built from LibriSpeech and ML-SUPERB show that PQ and RPQ outperform standard K-means discretization, achieving relative improvements of 21.8 percent and 20.0 percent in WER on LibriSpeech, and 24.1 percent and 19.6 percent in CER on ML-SUPERB, respectively. Moreover, their performance is competitive with, and in some cases even surpasses, that of continuous SSL representations.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Pruning: In-Situ Compression of Self-Supervised Speech Models for Speaker Verification and Anti-Spoofing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although large-scale self-supervised learning (SSL) models like WavLM have achieved state-of-the-art performance in speech processing, their significant size impedes deployment on resource-constrained devices. While structured pruning is a key technique for model compression, existing methods typically separate it from task-specific fine-tuning. This multi-stage approach struggles to create optimal architectures tailored for diverse downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce a unified framework that integrates structured pruning into the downstream fine-tuning process. Our framework unifies these steps, jointly optimizing for task performance and model sparsity in a single stage. This allows the model to learn a compressed architecture specifically for the end task, eliminating the need for complex multi-stage pipelines and knowledge distillation. Our pruned models achieve up to a 70\% parameter reduction with negligible performance degradation on large-scale datasets, achieving equal error rates of 0.7\%, 0.8\%, and 1.6\% on Vox1-O, -E, and -H, respectively. Furthermore, our approach demonstrates improved generalization in low-resource scenarios, reducing overfitting and achieving a state-of-the-art 3.7\% EER on ASVspoof5.</description>

      <title>Describe Where You Are: Improving Noise-Robustness for Speech Emotion Recognition with Text Description of the Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) systems often struggle in real-world environments, where ambient noise severely degrades their performance. This paper explores a novel approach that exploits prior knowledge of testing environments to maximize SER performance under noisy conditions. To address this task, we propose a text-guided, environment-aware training where an SER model is trained with contaminated speech samples and their paired noise description. We use a pre-trained text encoder to extract the text-based environment embedding and then fuse it to a transformer-based SER model during training and inference. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through our experiment with the MSP-Podcast corpus and real-world additive noise samples collected from the Freesound and DEMAND repositories. Our experiment indicates that the text-based environment descriptions processed by a large language model (LLM) produce representations that improve the noise-robustness of the SER system. With a contrastive learning (CL)-based representation, our proposed method can be improved by jointly fine-tuning the text encoder with the emotion recognition model. Under the -5dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) level, fine-tuning the text encoder improves our CL-based representation method by 76.4% (arousal), 100.0% (dominance), and 27.7% (valence).</description>

      <title>Compositional Phoneme Approximation for L1-Grounded L2 Pronunciation Training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10927v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learners of a second language (L2) often map non-native phonemes to similar native-language (L1) phonemes, making conventional L2-focused training slow and effortful. To address this, we propose an L1-grounded pronunciation training method based on compositional phoneme approximation (CPA), a feature-based representation technique that approximates L2 sounds with sequences of L1 phonemes. Evaluations with 20 Korean non-native English speakers show that CPA-based training achieves a 76% in-box formant rate in acoustic analysis, 17.6% relative improvement in phoneme recognition accuracy, and over 80% of speech being rated as more native-like, with minimal training.

      <title>MACS: Multi-source Audio-to-image Generation with Contextual Significance and Semantic Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Propelled by the breakthrough in deep generative models, audio-to-image generation has emerged as a pivotal cross-modal task that converts complex auditory signals into rich visual representations. However, previous works only focus on single-source audio inputs for image generation, ignoring the multi-source characteristic in natural auditory scenes, thus limiting the performance in generating comprehensive visual content. To bridge this gap, we propose a method called MACS to conduct multi-source audio-to-image generation. To our best knowledge, this is the first work that explicitly separates multi-source audio to capture the rich audio components before image generation. MACS is a two-stage method. In the first stage, multi-source audio inputs are separated by a weakly supervised method, where the audio and text labels are semantically aligned by casting into a common space using the large pre-trained CLAP model. We introduce a ranking loss to consider the contextual significance of the separated audio signals. In the second stage, effective image generation is achieved by mapping the separated audio signals to the generation condition using only a trainable adapter and a MLP layer. We preprocess the LLP dataset as the first full multi-source audio-to-image generation benchmark. The experiments are conducted on multi-source, mixed-source, and single-source audio-to-image generation tasks. The proposed MACS outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods in 17 out of the 21 evaluation indexes on all tasks and delivers superior visual quality.</description>

Abstract: Multilingual speech translation (ST) and machine translation (MT) in the medical domain enhances patient care by enabling efficient communication across language barriers, alleviating specialized workforce shortages, and facilitating improved diagnosis and treatment, particularly during pandemics. In this work, we present the first systematic study on medical ST, to our best knowledge, by releasing MultiMed-ST, a large-scale ST dataset for the medical domain, spanning all translation directions in five languages: Vietnamese, English, German, French, and Simplified/Traditional Chinese, together with the models. With 290,000 samples, this is the largest medical MT dataset and the largest many-to-many multilingual ST among all domains. Secondly, we present the most comprehensive ST analysis in the field's history, to our best knowledge, including: empirical baselines, bilingual-multilingual comparative study, end-to-end vs. cascaded comparative study, task-specific vs. multi-task sequence-to-sequence comparative study, code-switch analysis, and quantitative-qualitative error analysis.

      <title>GRAM: Spatial general-purpose audio representation models for real-world applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00934v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although audio foundations models have seen great progress on a wide variety of tasks, their application in real-world acoustic environments with reverberation and noise has been less successful. Moreover, as audio foundation models are typically trained on dry, single-channel audio clips, the inherent spatial nature of real-world sound scenes is overlooked and tasks involving sound localization ruled out. To address these limitations, we propose GRAM: a General-purpose Real-world Audio Model utilizing a multi-channel masked auto-encoder approach to efficiently learn spatial audio representations from high-quality simulated real-world scenes. To evaluate the performance of GRAM and other audio foundation models in real-world sound scenes, we release Nat-HEAR: A naturalistic version of the HEAR benchmark suite comprising a simulated real-world version, as well as two new sound localization tasks. We show that the performance of GRAM surpasses all state-of-the-art self-supervised audio foundation models and speech models on both HEAR and Nat-HEAR, while using only a fraction of the training data. GRAM also showcases state-of-the-art localization performance, surpassing even supervised sound localization approaches, and can be flexibly applied either to a two-channel, binaural sound format or a four-channel, Ambisonics format. Validating GRAM's performance on real-world sound recordings demonstrates robust transfer to real-world scenes. Taken together, GRAM presents a significant advancement towards robust, spatial audio foundation models for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>DIFFA: Large Language Diffusion Models Can Listen and Understand</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18452v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across textual and multimodal domains. In parallel, diffusion-based language models have emerged as a promising alternative to the autoregressive paradigm, offering improved controllability, bidirectional context modeling, and robust generation. However, their application to the audio modality remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce \textbf{DIFFA}, the first diffusion-based large audio-language model designed to perform spoken language understanding. DIFFA integrates a frozen diffusion language model with a lightweight dual-adapter architecture that bridges speech understanding and natural language reasoning. We employ a two-stage training pipeline: first, aligning semantic representations via an ASR objective; then, learning instruction-following abilities through synthetic audio-caption pairs automatically generated by prompting LLMs. Despite being trained on only 960 hours of ASR and 127 hours of synthetic instruction data, DIFFA demonstrates competitive performance on major benchmarks, including MMSU, MMAU, and VoiceBench, outperforming several autoregressive open-source baselines. Our results reveal the potential of diffusion-based language models for efficient and scalable audio understanding, opening a new direction for speech-driven AI. Our code will be available at https://github.com/NKU-HLT/DIFFA.git.</description>

      <title>How Does a Deep Neural Network Look at Lexical Stress?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite their success in speech processing, neural networks often operate as black boxes, prompting the question: what informs their decisions, and how can we interpret them? This work examines this issue in the context of lexical stress. A dataset of English disyllabic words was automatically constructed from read and spontaneous speech. Several Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures were trained to predict stress position from a spectrographic representation of disyllabic words lacking minimal stress pairs (e.g., initial stress WAllet, final stress exTEND), achieving up to 92% accuracy on held-out test data. Layerwise Relevance Propagation (LRP), a technique for CNN interpretability analysis, revealed that predictions for held-out minimal pairs (PROtest vs. proTEST ) were most strongly influenced by information in stressed versus unstressed syllables, particularly the spectral properties of stressed vowels. However, the classifiers also attended to information throughout the word. A feature-specific relevance analysis is proposed, and its results suggest that our best-performing classifier is strongly influenced by the stressed vowel's first and second formants, with some evidence that its pitch and third formant also contribute. These results reveal deep learning's ability to acquire distributed cues to stress from naturally occurring data, extending traditional phonetic work based around highly controlled stimuli.</description>

      <title>WavJEPA: Semantic learning unlocks robust audio foundation models for raw waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23238v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning audio representations from raw waveforms overcomes key limitations of spectrogram-based audio representation learning, such as the long latency of spectrogram computation and the loss of phase information. Yet, while self-supervised speech representation learning from raw waveforms has been remarkably successful, these approaches have not achieved similar feats for general-purpose audio representation learning from waveforms. Here, we propose WavJEPA, a waveform-based version of the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture. WavJEPA leverages high-level semantic representation learning to tackle the shortcomings of representation learning at the speech unit or token level. We show that this approach substantially outperforms state-of-the-art time-domain audio foundation models across a wide variety of downstream benchmark tasks, while requiring considerably fewer computational resources. Additionally, to overcome the performance drop that time-domain models typically exhibit in noisy and reverberant real-world acoustic environments, we present WavJEPA-Nat. WavJEPA-Nat is a multi-channel extension of the WavJEPA architecture trained on simulated naturalistic scenes. We find that WavJEPA-Nat is highly robust to reverberation and noise. These results highlight the feasibility and computational efficiency of general-purpose audio representation learning from raw waveforms, showcasing the potential for low-latency, robust time-domain audio foundation models for real-world applications.</description>
