      <title>Discretization effects in finite-volume $2\to2$ scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We incorporate non-zero lattice-spacing effects into L\"uscher's finite-volume scattering formalism. The new quantization condition takes lattice energies as input and returns a version of the discretized scattering amplitude whose definition is transparent in the context of Symanzik Effective Theory. In contrast to the standard formalism, this approach uses single-hadron discretization effects to define modified versions of the finite-volume zeta functions. The new formalism requires two sets of angular-momentum indices, which encode the ultraviolet mixing of angular momentum states (due to the lattice spacing), in addition to the well-known infrared mixing (due to the finite volume).</description>

      <title>The probabilistic world II : Quantum mechanics from classical statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work discusses simple examples how quantum systems are obtained as subsystems of classical statistical systems. For a single qubit with arbitrary Hamiltonian and for the quantum particle in a harmonic potential we provide explicitly all steps how these quantum systems follow from an overall ''classical" probability distribution for events at all times. This overall probability distribution is the analogue of Feynman's functional integral for quantum mechanics or for the functional integral defining a quantum field theory. In our case the action and associated weight factor are real, however, defining a classical probabilistic system. Nevertheless, a unitary time-evolution of wave functions can be realized for suitable systems, in particular probabilistic automata. Based on these insights we discuss novel aspects for correlated computing not requiring the extreme isolation of quantum computers. A simple neuromorphic computer based on neurons in an active or quiet state within a probabilistic environment can learn the unitary transformations of an entangled two-qubit system. Our explicit constructions constitute a proof that no-go theorems for the embedding of quantum mechanics in classical statistics are circumvented. We show in detail how subsystems of classical statistical systems can explain various ``quantum mysteries". Conceptually our approach is a straightforward derivation starting from an overall probability distribution without invoking non-locality, acausality, contextuality, many worlds or other additional concepts. All quantum laws follow directly from the standard properties of classical probabilities.</description>

      <title>Interacting Dirac fields in an expanding universe: dynamical condensates and particle production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The phenomenon of particle production for quantum field theories in curved spacetimes is crucial to understand the large-scale structure of a universe from an inflationary epoch. In contrast to the free and fixed-background case, the production of particles with strong interactions and back reaction is not completely understood, especially in situations that require going beyond perturbation theory. In this work, we present advances in this direction by focusing on a self-interacting field theory of Dirac fermions in an expanding Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe. By using a Hamiltonian lattice regularization with continuous conformal time and rescaled fields, this model becomes amenable to either a cold-atom analogue-gravity quantum simulation, or a dynamical variational approach. Leveraging a family of variational fermionic Gaussian states, we investigate how dynamical mass generation and the formation of fermion condensates associated to certain broken symmetries modify some well-known results of the free field theory. In particular, we study how the non-perturbative condensates arise and, more importantly, how their real-time evolution has an impact on particle production. Depending on the Hubble expansion rate, we find an interesting interplay of interactions and particle production, including a non-trivial back reaction on the condensates and a parity-breaking spectrum of produced particles.</description>

      <title>Thermal false vacuum decay in (1+1)-dimensions: Evidence for non-equilibrium dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically study the evolution of a classical real scalar field in ${(1+1)}$ dimensions with initial conditions describing thermal fluctuations around a metastable vacuum. We track false vacuum decay in real time and compare several observables to the predictions of the standard Euclidean formalism. We find agreement for the shape of the critical bubble and the exponential suppression of the decay rate. However, the decay rate prefactor is almost an order of magnitude lower than the predicted value. We argue that this signals a breakdown of thermal equilibrium during the bubble nucleation. In addition, the inefficient thermalization in the system biases the properties of the statistical ensemble and leads to further decrease of the decay rate with time. We substantiate our interpretation with a suite of stochastic field simulations with controlled thermalization time. Varying this time we find that the predictions of the standard equilibrium formalism are recovered when it is sufficiently short. We propose an upper bound on the thermalization time that must be satisfied in order to ensure the applicability of the Euclidean rate calculation. We discuss that this bound is unavoidably violated in common single-field models, irrespective of the number of spacetime dimensions, implying that deviations from equilibrium in these models cannot be neglected. In theories with multiple fields, the bound may or may not hold, depending on the setup details. We investigate one more signature of non-equilibrium dynamics -- coherent oscillonic precursors to the critical bubble nucleation. We show that they get suppressed in the stochastic dynamical simulations when the thermalization time is reduced.</description>

      <title>The triton lifetime from nuclear lattice effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a calculation of the triton $\beta$-decay lifetime using Nuclear Lattice Effective Field Theory (NLEFT) at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order in the chiral expansion. By incorporating a non-perturbative treatment of the higher-order corrections, we achieve consistent predictions for the Fermi and Gamow-Teller matrix elements, which are crucial for determining the triton lifetime. Our results are consistent with earlier theoretical calculations, confirming the robustness of our approach. This study marks a significant advancement in the systematic application of NLEFT to nuclear $\beta$-decay processes, paving the way for future high-precision calculations in more complex nuclear systems. Additionally, we discuss potential improvements to our approach, including the explicit inclusion of two-pion exchange mechanisms and the refinement of three-nucleon forces. These developments are essential for extending the applicability of NLEFT to a broader range of nuclear phenomena, including neutrinoless double-$\beta$ decay.</description>

      <title>Convex optimization and contour deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss various formal aspects of contour deformations used to alleviate sign problems; most importantly, relating these contour deformations to a certain convex optimization problem. As a consequence of this connection we describe a general method for proving upper bounds on the average phase achievable by the contour deformation method. Using this method we show that Abelian lattice Yang-Mills in two spacetime dimensions possesses, for many values of the complex coupling, an exponential sign problem that cannot be removed via any contour deformation.</description>
