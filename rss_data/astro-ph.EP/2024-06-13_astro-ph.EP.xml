      <title>Evidence for Non-zero Turbulence in the Protoplanetary disc around IM Lup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The amount of turbulence in protoplanetary discs around young stars is critical for determining the efficiency, timeline, and outcomes of planet formation. It is also difficult to measure. Observations are still limited, but direct measurements of the non-thermal, turbulent gas motion are possible with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Using CO(2-1)/$^{13}$CO(2-1)/C$^{18}$O(2-1) ALMA observations of the disc around IM Lup at ~0.4" (~60 au) resolution we find evidence of significant turbulence, at the level of $\delta v_{\rm turb}=(0.18-0.30)$c$_s$. This result is robust against systematic uncertainties (e.g., amplitude flux calibration, midplane gas temperature, disc self-gravity). We find that gravito-turbulence as the source of the gas motion is unlikely based on the lack of an imprint on the rotation curve from a massive disc, while magneto-rotational instabilities and hydrodynamic instabilities are still possible, depending on the unknown magnetic field strength and the cooling timescale in the outer disc.</description>

      <title>Influence of Orbit and Mass Constraints on Reflected Light Characterization of Directly Imaged Rocky Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Survey strategies for upcoming exoplanet direct imaging missions have considered varying assumptions of prior knowledge. Precursor radial velocity surveys could have detected nearby exo-Earths and provided prior orbit and mass constraints. Alternatively, a direct imaging mission performing astrometry could yield constraints on orbit and phase angle of target planets. Understanding the impact of prior mass and orbit information on planetary characterization is crucial for efficiently recognizing habitable exoplanets. To address this question, we use a reflected-light retrieval tool to infer the atmospheric and bulk properties of directly imaged Earth-analogs while considering varying levels of prior information and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Because of the strong correlation between the orbit-related parameters and the planetary radius, prior information on the orbital distance and planetary phase yield tight constraints on the planetary radius: from $R_{\rm{p}}=2.95^{+2.69}_{-1.95}~R_{\oplus}$ without prior knowledge, to $R_{\rm{p}}=1.01^{+0.33}_{-0.19}~R_{\oplus}$ with prior determination of the orbit for $\rm{SNR}=20$ in the visible/near-infrared spectral range, thus allowing size determination from reflected light observations. However, additional knowledge of planet mass does not notably enhance radius ($R_{\rm{p}}=0.98^{+0.17}_{-0.14}~R_{\oplus}$) or atmospheric characterization. Also, prior knowledge of the mass alone does not yield a tight radius constraint ($R_{\rm{p}}=1.64^{+1.29}_{-0.80}~R_{\oplus}$) nor improves atmospheric composition inference. By contrast, because of its sensitivity to gas column abundance, detecting a Rayleigh scattering slope or bounding Rayleigh opacity helps to refine gas mixing ratio inferences without requiring prior mass knowledge. Overall, apart from radius determination, increasing the SNR is more beneficial than additional prior observations.</description>

      <title>Rocky planet formation in compact disks around M dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rocky planets in compact configurations are the most common ones around M dwarfs. Many disks around very low mass stars (between 0.1 and 0.5 M$_\odot$) are rather compact and small (without observable substructures and radius less than 20 au), which favours the idea of an efficient radial drift that could enhance planet formation in compact orbits. We aim to investigate the potential formation paths of the observed close-in rocky exoplanet population around M dwarfs, assuming that planet formation could take place in compact disks with an efficient dust radial drift. We developed N-body simulations that include a sample of embryos growing by pebble accretion exposed to planet-disk interactions, star-planet tidal interactions and general relativistic corrections. For a star of 0.1 M$_\odot$ we considered different gas disk viscosity and initial embryo distributions. We also explore planet formation by pebble accretion around stars of 0.3 and 0.5 M$_\odot$. Lastly, for each stellar mass, we run simulations that include a sample of embryos growing by planetesimal accretion. Our main result is that the sample of simulated planets that grow by pebble accretion in a gas disk with low viscosity ($\alpha=10^{-4}$) can reproduce the close-in low-mass exoplanet population around M dwarfs in terms of multiplicity, masses and semi-major axis. Furthermore, we found that a gas disk with high viscosity ($\alpha=10^{-3}$) can not reproduce the observed planet masses. Also, we show that planetesimal accretion favours the formation of smaller planets than the ones formed by pebble accretion. Rocky planet formation around M dwarfs can take place in compact and small dust disks driven by an efficient radial drift in a gas disk with low viscosity. This result points towards a new approach in the direction of the disk conditions needed for rocky planet formation around very low mass stars.</description>

      <title>Investigating Sulfur Chemistry in the HD 163296 disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sulfur chemistry in the formation process of low-mass stars and planets remains poorly understood. The protoplanetary disks (PPDs) are the birthplace of planets and its distinctive environment provides an intriguing platform for investigating models of sulfur chemistry. We analyzed the ALMA observations of CS 7-6 transitions in the HD 163296 disk and perform astrochemical modeling to explore its sulfur chemistry. We simulated the distribution of sulfur-containing molecules and compared it with observationally deduced fractional column densities. We have found that the simulated column density of CS is consistent with the observationally deduced fractional column densities, while the simulated column density of C$_2$S is lower than the observationally deduced upper limits on column densities. This results indicate that we have a good understanding of the chemical properties of CS and C$_2$S in the disk. We also investigated the influence of the C/O ratio on sulfur-containing molecules and found that the column densities of SO, SO$_2$, and H$_2$S near the central star are dependent on the C/O ratio. Additionally, we found that the $N$[CS]/$N$[SO] ratio can serve as a promising indicator of the disk's C/O ratio in the HD 163296. Overall, the disk of HD 163296 provides a favorable environment for the detection of sulfur-containing molecules.</description>

      <title>Temperature and composition disturbances in the southern auroral region of Jupiter revealed by JWST/MIRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jupiters south polar region was observed by JWST Mid Infrared Instrument in December 2022. We used the Medium Resolution Spectrometer mode to provide new information about Jupiters South Polar stratosphere. The southern auroral region was visible and influenced the atmosphere in several ways. 1: In the interior of the southern auroral oval, we retrieved peak temperatures at two distinct pressure levels near 0.01 and 1 mbar, with warmer temperatures with respect to non auroral regions of 12 pm 2 K and 37 pm 4 K respectively. A cold polar vortex is centered at 65S at 10 mbar. 2: We found that the homopause is elevated to 590+25-118 km above the 1-bar pressure level inside the auroral oval compared to 460+60-50 km at neighboring latitudes and with an upper altitude of 350 km in regions not affected by auroral precipitation. 3: The retrieved abundance of C2H2 shows an increase within the auroral oval, and it exhibits high abundances throughout the polar region. The retrieved abundance of C2H6 increases towards the pole, without being localized in the auroral oval, in contrast with previous analysis. We determined that the warming at 0.01 mbar and the elevated homopause might be caused by the flux of charged particles depositing their energy in the South Polar Region. The 1 mbar hotspot may arise from adiabatic heating resulting from auroral driven downwelling. The cold region at 10 mbar may be caused by radiative cooling by stratospheric aerosols. The differences in spatial distribution seem to indicate that the hydrocarbons analyzed are affected differently by auroral precipitation.</description>

      <title>Exploring the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-178b. Constraints on atmospheric chemistry and dynamics from a joint retrieval of VLT/CRIRES$^+$ and space photometric data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08166v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite recent progress in the spectroscopic characterization of individual exoplanets, the atmospheres of key ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJs) still lack comprehensive investigations. These include WASP-178b, one of the most irradiated UHJs known to date. We observed the dayside emission signal of this planet with CRIRES$^+$ in the spectral K-band. By applying the cross-correlation technique and a Bayesian retrieval framework to the high-resolution spectra, we identified the emission signature of $^{12}$CO (S/N = 8.9) and H$_2$O (S/N = 4.9), and a strong atmospheric thermal inversion. A joint retrieval with space-based secondary eclipse measurements from TESS and CHEOPS allows us to refine our results on the thermal profile and thus to constrain the atmospheric chemistry, yielding a solar to super-solar metallicity (1.4$\pm$1.6 dex) and a solar C/O ratio (0.6$\pm$0.2). We infer a significant excess of spectral line broadening and identify a slight Doppler-shift between the $^{12}$CO and H$_2$O signals. These findings provide strong evidence for a super-rotating atmospheric flow pattern and suggest the possible existence of chemical inhomogeneities across the planetary dayside hemisphere. In addition, the inclusion of photometric data in our retrieval allows us to account for stellar light reflected by the planetary atmosphere, resulting in an upper limit on the geometric albedo (0.23). The successful characterization of WASP-178b's atmosphere through a joint analysis of CRIRES$^+$, TESS, and CHEOPS observations highlights the potential of combined studies with space- and ground-based instruments and represents a promising avenue for advancing our understanding of exoplanet atmospheres.</description>

      <title>The atmospheric composition of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-178 b observed with ESPRESSO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08348v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We search for atmospheric constituents for the UHJ WASP-178 b with two ESPRESSO transits using the narrow-band and cross-correlation techniques, focusing on the detections of NaI, H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, H$\gamma$, MgI, FeI and FeII. Additionally, we show parallel photometry used to obtain updated and precise stellar, planetary and orbital parameters. We report the resolved line detections of NaI (5.5 and 5.4 $\sigma$), H$\alpha$ (13 $\sigma$), H$\beta$ (7.1 $\sigma$), and tentatively MgI (4.6 $\sigma$). In cross-correlation, we confirm the MgI detection (7.8 and 5.8 $\sigma$) and additionally report the detections of FeI (12 and 10 $\sigma$) and FeII (11 and 8.4 $\sigma$), on both nights separately. The detection of MgI remains tentative, however, due to the differing results between both nights, as well as compared with the narrow-band derived properties. None of our resolved spectral lines probing the mid- to upper atmosphere show significant shifts relative to the planetary rest frame, however H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ exhibit line broadenings of 39.6 $\pm$ 2.1 km/s and 27.6 $\pm$ 4.6 km/s, respectively, indicating the onset of possible escape. WASP-178 b differs from similar UHJ with its lack of strong atmospheric dynamics in the upper atmosphere, however the broadening seen for FeI (15.66 $\pm$ 0.58 km/s) and FeII (11.32 $\pm$ 0.52 km/s) could indicate the presence of winds in the mid-atmosphere. Future studies on the impact of the flux variability caused by the host star activity might shed more light on the subject. Previous work indicated the presence of SiO cloud-precursors in the atmosphere of WASP-178 b and a lack of MgI and FeII. However, our results suggest that a scenario where the planetary atmosphere is dominated by MgI and FeII is more likely. In light of our results, we encourage future observations to further elucidate these atmospheric properties.</description>

      <title>The unresolved mystery of dust particle swarms within the magnetosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early-generation in-situ dust detectors in near-Earth space have reported the occurrence of clusters of sub-micron dust particles that seemed unrelated to human spaceflight activities. In particular, data from the impact ionization detector onboard the HEOS-2 satellite indicate that such swarms of particles occur throughout the Earth's magnetosphere up to altitudes of 60,000 km -- far beyond regions typically used by spacecraft. Further account of high-altitude clusters has since been given by the GEO-deployed GORID detector, however, explanations for the latter have so far only been sought in GEO spaceflight activity.
  This perspective piece reviews dust cluster detections in near-Earth space, emphasizing the natural swarm creation mechanism conjectured to explain the HEOS-2 data -- that is, the electrostatic disruption of meteoroids. Highlighting this mechanism offers a novel viewpoint on more recent near-Earth dust measurements. We further show that the impact clusters observed by both HEOS-2 and GORID are correlated with increased geomagnetic activity. This consistent correlation supports the notion that both sets of observations stem from the same underlying phenomenon and aligns with the hypothesis of the electrostatic breakup origin. We conclude that the nature of these peculiar swarms remains highly uncertain, advocating for their concerted investigation by forthcoming dust science endeavours, such as the JAXA/DLR DESTINY+ mission.</description>

      <title>Detection of Moving Objects in Earth Observation Satellite Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moving objects have characteristic signatures in multi-spectral images made by Earth observation satellites that use push broom scanning. While the general concept is applicable to all satellites of this type, each satellite design has its own unique imaging system and requires unique methods to analyze the characteristic signatures. We assess the feasibility of detecting moving objects and measuring their velocities in one particular archive of satellite images made by Planet Labs Corporation with their constellation of SuperDove satellites. Planet Labs data presents a particular challenge in that the images in the archive are mosaics of individual exposures and therefore do not have unique time stamps. We explain how the timing information can be restored indirectly. Our results indicate that the movement of common transportation vehicles, airplanes, cars, and boats, can be detected and measured.</description>

      <title>ExoSpikeNet: A Light Curve Analysis Based Spiking Neural Network for Exoplanet Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exoplanets are celestial bodies orbiting stars beyond our Solar System. Although historically they posed detection challenges, Kepler's data has revolutionized our understanding. By analyzing flux values from the Kepler Mission, we investigate the intricate patterns in starlight that may indicate the presence of exoplanets. This study investigates a novel approach for exoplanet classification using Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) applied to data obtained from the NASA Kepler mission. SNNs offer a unique advantage by mimicking the spiking behavior of neurons in the brain, allowing for more nuanced and biologically inspired processing of temporal data. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed SNN architecture, excelling in various performance metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, precision, and recall.</description>

      <title>NIRPS first light and early science: breaking the 1 m/s RV precision barrier at infrared wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08304v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Near-InfraRed Planet Searcher or NIRPS is a precision radial velocity spectrograph developed through collaborative efforts among laboratories in Switzerland, Canada, Brazil, France, Portugal and Spain. NIRPS extends to the 0.98-1.8 $\mu$m domain of the pioneering HARPS instrument at the La Silla 3.6-m telescope in Chile and it has achieved unparalleled precision, measuring stellar radial velocities in the infrared with accuracy better than 1 m/s. NIRPS can be used either stand-alone or simultaneously with HARPS. Commissioned in late 2022 and early 2023, NIRPS embarked on a 5-year Guaranteed Time Observation (GTO) program in April 2023, spanning 720 observing nights. This program focuses on planetary systems around M dwarfs, encompassing both the immediate solar vicinity and transit follow-ups, alongside transit and emission spectroscopy observations. We highlight NIRPS's current performances and the insights gained during its deployment at the telescope. The lessons learned and successes achieved contribute to the ongoing advancement of precision radial velocity measurements and high spectral fidelity, further solidifying NIRPS' role in the forefront of the field of exoplanets.</description>

      <title>APPLE: An Evolution Code for Modeling Giant Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce APPLE, a novel planetary evolution code designed specifically for the study of giant exoplanet and Jovian planet evolution in the era of Galileo, Juno, and Cassini. With APPLE, state-of-the-art equations of state for hydrogen, helium, ice, and rock are integrated with advanced features to treat ice/rock cores and metals in the gaseous envelope; models for helium rain and hydrogen/helium immiscibility; detailed atmosphere boundary tables that also provide self-consistent albedos and spectra; and options to address envelope metal gradients and stably-stratified regions. Our hope is that these purpose-built features of APPLE will help catalyze the development of the next generation of giant exoplanet and Jovian planet evolutionary models.</description>

      <title>From Super-Earths to Sub-Neptunes: observational constraints and connections to theoretical models</title>

Abstract: We update the PlanetS catalog of transiting planets with precise and robust mass and radius measurements and use this comprehensive catalog to explore Mass-Radius (M-R) diagrams. On one hand, we propose new M-R relationships to separate exoplanets into three populations. On the other hand, we explore the transition in radius and density between Super-Earths and Sub-Neptunes around M-dwarfs and compare it with those orbiting K- and FG-dwarfs. Using Kernel Density Estimation method with a re-sampling technique, we estimate the normalized density and radius distributions, revealing connections between observations and theories on composition, internal structure, formation, and evolution of these exoplanets orbiting different spectral types. Firstly, the substantial 30% increase in the number of well-characterized exoplanets orbiting M-dwarfs compared with previous studies shows us that there is no clear gap in either composition or radius between Super-Earths and Sub-Neptunes. The "water-worlds" around M-dwarfs cannot correspond to a distinct population, their bulk density and equilibrium temperature can be interpreted by several different internal structures and compositions. The continuity in the fraction of volatiles in these planets suggests a formation scenario involving planetesimal or hybrid pebble-planetesimal accretion. Moreover, we find that the transition between Super-Earths and Sub-Neptunes appears to happen at different mass (and radii) depending on the spectral type of the star. The maximum mass of Super-Earths seems to be close to 10 M$_\oplus$ for all spectral types, but the minimum mass of Sub-Neptunes increases with the star's mass. This effect also contributes to the fading of the radius valley for M-planets compared to FGK-planets. While Sub-Neptunes are less common around M-dwarfs, smaller ones exhibit lower density than their equivalents around FGK-dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Angular momentum transport via gravitational instability in the Elias 2-27 disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05952</link>

Abstract: Gravitational instability is thought to be one of the main drivers of angular momentum transport in young protoplanetary discs. The disc around Elias 2-27 offers a unique example of gravitational instability at work. It is young and massive, displaying two prominent spiral arms in dust continuum emission and global non-axisymmetric kinematic signatures in molecular line data. In this work, we used archival ALMA observations of $^{13}$CO line emission to measure the efficiency of angular momentum transport in the Elias 2-27 system through the kinematic signatures generated by gravitational instability, known as 'GI wiggles'. Assuming the angular momentum is transported by the observed spiral structure and leveraging previously-derived dynamical disc mass measurements, the amount of angular momentum transport we found corresponds to an $\alpha-$viscosity of $\alpha=0.038\pm0.018$. This value implies an accretion rate onto the central star of $\log_{10}\dot{M}_\star=-6.99\pm0.17\text{M}_\odot/\text{yr, which}$ reproduces the one observed value of $\log_{10}\dot{M}_{\star,\text{obs}}=-7.2\pm0.5\text{M}_\odot/\text{yr }$ very well. The excellent agreement we have found serves as further proof that gravitational instability is the main driver of angular momentum transport acting in this system.</description>
