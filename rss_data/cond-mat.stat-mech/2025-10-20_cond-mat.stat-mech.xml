      <title>Entanglement Entropy from Correlation Functions of Scalar Fields in and out of Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that odd order R\'enyi entropies $S^{(2q+1)}$ of a system of interacting scalar fields can be calculated as the free energy of $2q+1$ replicas of the system with additional quadratic inter-replica couplings in the subsystem at the time of measurement of the entropy. These couplings replace boundary field matching conditions. This formalism works both in and out of thermal equilibrium, for closed as well as open quantum systems, and provides a general dictionary between measurable correlation functions and entanglement entropy. $S^{(2q+1)}$ can be analytically continued to calculate the von Neumann entropy $S^{\mathrm{vN}}$. We provide an exact formula relating $S^{(2q+1)}$ and $S^{\mathrm{vN}}$ with correlation functions in a non-interacting theory. For interacting theories, we provide rules for constructing all possible Feynman diagrams for $S^{(2q+1)}$. We show that the boundary matching conditions cannot be completely eliminated while calculating R\'enyi entropies of even order due to presence of zero modes in replica space.</description>

      <title>Cluster percolation and dynamical scaling in the Baxter--Wu model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the percolation behavior of Fortuin-Kasteleyn--type clusters in the spin-$1/2$ Baxter--Wu model with three-spin interactions on a triangular lattice. The considered clusters are constructed by randomly freezing one of the three sublattices, resulting in effective pairwise interactions among the remaining spins. Using Monte Carlo simulations combined with a finite-size scaling analysis, we determine the percolation temperature of these stochastic clusters and show that it coincides with the exact thermal critical point of the model. The critical exponents derived from cluster observables are consistent with those of the underlying thermal phase transition. Finally, we analyze the dynamical scaling of the multi-cluster and single-cluster algorithms resulting from the cluster construction, highlighting their efficiency and scaling behavior with system size.</description>

      <title>Finite-frequency fluctuation-response inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive an inequality relating the finite-frequency linear response and fluctuations of an observable in a physical system. The relation holds for arbitrary observables and perturbations in general Markovian dynamics, including over- and underdamped Langevin systems and jump processes, both in and out of equilibrium. As a consequence, we obtain a universal upper bound on the broad-band signal-to-noise ratio of noisy dynamics, which only depends on the damping constant and temperature. We further show that the inequality reduces to an equality for appropriately chosen observables or perturbations in linear systems, both overdamped and underdamped and both in and out of equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Coarsening kinetics in spin systems with long-range interactions: from voter to Ising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we start reviewing the main features of the one-dimensional Ising model with long-range interactions, where the spin-spin coupling decays as a power law, $J(r) \propto r^{-\alpha}$. We then discuss the key properties of the one-dimensional voter model, in which two agents (spins) at distance $r$ interact with a power-law probability with the same form of $J(r)$. The two models are compared, and the so-called $p$-voter model is presented, which provides a framework to interpolate between them. Specifically, the $p$-voter model reduces to the voter model for $p = 1$ and $p = 2$, while for $p \ge 3$ it falls into the universality class of the Ising model.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Modeling of Skyrmion Dynamics in Arbitrary 2D Spatially Dependent Pinning Potential Landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-flat energy landscapes leading to localized pinning of skyrmions pose an inherent and unavoidable challenge for studies of fundamental 2D spin structure dynamics as well as applications. Accounting for pinning is a key requirement for predictive modeling of skyrmion systems, as it impacts the systems' dynamics and introduces randomizing effects. In this article, we use magneto-optical Kerr microscopy to image skyrmions in a magnetic thin film system in real time and analyze their hopping dynamics within the non-flat energy landscape. To achieve a fully quantitative model, we utilize skyrmion diffusion and dwell times at pinning sites to extrapolate the pinning energy landscape into regions that cannot be sampled on reasonable experimental time scales. For evaluation with a coarse-grained Thiele model, we perform long-time measurements of skyrmion diffusion and then develop a two-step procedure to determine simulation parameters by comparing them to experimentally accessible behavior. This provides a direct conversion between simulation and experimental units, which is the missing key step that has previously prevented quantitative quasiparticle modeling. We demonstrate the predictive power of our approach by measuring the experimentally unexplored density dependence of skyrmion diffusion and show that it is in excellent agreement with simulation predictions. Our technique thus enables quantitative skyrmion simulations on experimental time and length scales, allowing for predictive in-silico prototyping of skyrmion devices.</description>

      <title>The Wishart--Rosenzweig--Porter random matrix ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years the Rosenzweig--Porter (RP) ensemble, obtained by adding a diagonal matrix with independent and identically distributed elements to a Gaussian random matrix, has been widely used as a minimal model for the emergence of fractal eigenstates in complex many-body systems. A key open question concerns the robustness of its phase diagram when the assumption of independent and uncorrelated entries is relaxed -- an assumption that simplifies its analysis, but is generally violated in realistic quantum systems. In this work, we take a first step in this direction by considering a deformed Wishart (rather than Gaussian) random matrix, which we dub the ``Wishart--RP'' ensemble. Using perturbation theory, as well as the cavity and replica methods and the Dyson Brownian motion approach, we characterize its phase diagram and localization properties. Remarkably, we show that the level compressibility, which quantifies spectral correlations in the fractal phase, coincides with that of the Gaussian RP model, thereby extending the universality conjectured in [SciPost Phys. 14, 110 (2023)] beyond the fully uncorrelated setting. We confirm our results with numerical tests.</description>

      <title>Open system dynamics in local Lindbladians with chaotic spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the physical consequences of having a spectrum that satisfies random matrix theory (RMT) for generic Lindbladians, and compare its consequences for spatially local and completely random Lindblad dynamics in one spatial dimension. We find that Lindbladians whose spectrum is described by RMT exhibit quasi-universal early-time dynamics for quantities non-linear in the density matrix, in the sense that for generic, highly entangled initial states, the early time evolution is independent of the choice of initial state. We numerically investigate how locality generically imposes constraints on the size-dependence of Lindblad eigenoperators. This size dependence implies that linear observables, such as expectation values of local operators, are highly sensitive to eigenmodes outside the bulk of the spectrum in the thermodynamic limit, and plays a central role in limiting operator growth in the presence of dissipation. We find that when single-site dissipation dominates, an operator's decoherence scales approximately linearly with its Pauli weight, even in the presence of 2-site jump operators. When two-site only dissipation dominates, however, this generic trend in operator size can be violated, leading to long-lived high Pauli-weight operators.</description>

      <title>Entanglement complexification transition driven by a single non-Hermitian impurity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While non-Hermitian bulk systems and their sensitivity to boundary conditions have been extensively studied, how a non-Hermitian boundary affects the entanglement structure of Hermitian critical systems remains largely unexplored. Here we present a fully analytical framework by exactly solving a Hermitian gapless chain with a single non-Hermitian impurity acting as a non-Hermitian boundary. When the entanglement cut is placed at the impurity, we uncover a sharp \emph{entanglement complexification transition}: the logarithmic entanglement entropy retains its scaling form, but the effective central charge evolves from real to complex values, accompanied by a spectral collapse of the correlation matrix. We demonstrate that the real regime follows analytic continuation from a unitary defect conformal field theory (CFT), whereas the complex regime lies entirely beyond this framework. For the latter, we derive an analytical formula in perfect agreement with numerics. Our results reveal that a single non-Hermitian impurity can drive a Hermitian critical system into a nonunitary defect-CFT phase, establishing a rare analytically solvable platform for boundary non-Hermiticity.</description>

      <title>Quantum Corrections in the Low-Temperature Fluid/Gravity Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attempts to construct a low-temperature version of the fluid/gravity correspondence have faced obstacles manifested in the form of logarithmic terms in the frequency, $\log(\omega)$, leading to non-local in time constitutive relations for the stress tensor and the charge current. These difficulties can be broadly presented as a breakdown of the hydrodynamic description due to additional infrared modes. We employ new quantum insights into the physics of near-extremal black holes, brought about in the context of Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity, as an effective description of quantum fluctuations in the throat, to revisit the fluid/gravity correspondence at very low temperatures. The quantum corrections naturally include a new length scale, $C$, and an effective action that parametrizes the breaking of near-horizon symmetries. We show that with an appropriate choice of order of limits in the derivative expansion within the low-temperature regime, the $\log(\omega)$ infrared divergence can be resolved. By quantum averaging the infrared Schwarzian modes as an effective extra contribution to the long-wavelength fluid modes, the resulting low-temperature effective fluid description is consistent. We present the dispersion relations for all the relevant hydrodynamic modes. We also revisit the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio and find that at very low temperatures the universal $\frac{1}{4\pi}$ bound is violated due to quantum correction.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation-Response Theory of Non-Equilibrium Complex Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental challenge in soft matter physics is to describe materials, such as the living cytoplasm and tissues, that are simultaneously active, chemically driven, and exhibit long-lasting memory of mechanical stresses. Here, we construct a generalized hydrodynamic framework at finite wavevectors and frequencies that can be applicable to non-equilibrium fluids with memory. Our approach is based on a non-equilibrium fluctuation-response relation in a steady state using correlation function identities. This approach provides a general formalism to derive hydrodynamic constitutive equations that is distinct from Mori-Zwanzig projection formalism. As a corollary, we obtain a generalized fluctuation-response relation in non-equilibrium steady states similar to the relation obtained by Harada-Sasa. Applying our theory to chemically driven active fluids reveals Active Viscoelastic Memory, whereby chemical reaction cycles renormalize the system's viscous response. We find that this active viscoelastic memory can produce a negative storage modulus at finite frequency, behavior absent in ordinary viscoelastic fluids. Our first-principles framework provides a general basis for understanding memory-dependent dynamics across a wide range of biological and synthetic active systems.</description>

      <title>Active matter synchronization and synergetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the collective behavior in a stochastic agent-based model of active matter. Provided a critical take-up of energy, agents produce two types of goods $x$, $y$ that follow a generalized Lotka-Volterra dynamics. For isolated agents, production would either reach a fixed point or diverge. Coupling agents' production via a mean field of $x$, however, can lead to synchronized oscillations if agents cooperate in the production of $x$. The production of $y$ supports the emergence of the synchronized dynamics by suppressing fluctuations and mitigating competition between agents, this way stabilizing the production of $x$. We find that in the synchronized state different groups of agents coexist, each following their own limit cycle. The Kuramoto order parameter is large within groups, and small across groups. The collective state is stable against shocks from agents temporarily switching between cooperation and competition. The model dynamics illustrates the principles of synergetics, i.e., the spontaneous emergence of order given a critical energy supply and cooperative interactions.</description>

      <title>Synchronization of nonlinearly coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators play a central role in the study of synchronization phenomena. Previous works have focused on linearly coupled oscillators in different configurations, such as all-to-all or generic complex networks, allowing for both reciprocal or non-reciprocal links. The emergence of synchronization can be deduced by proving the linear stability of the limit cycle solution for the Stuart-Landau model; the linear coupling assumption allows for a complete analytical treatment of the problem, mostly because the linearized system turns out to be autonomous. In this work, we analyze Stuart-Landau oscillators coupled through nonlinear functions on both undirected and directed networks; synchronization now depends on the study of a non-autonomous linear system and thus novel tools are required to tackle the problem. We provide a complete analytical description of the system for some choices of the nonlinear coupling, e.g., in the resonant case. Otherwise, we develop a semi-analytical framework based on Jacobi-Anger expansion and Floquet theory, which allows us to derive precise conditions for the emergence of complete synchronization. The obtained results extend the classical theory of coupled oscillators and pave the way for future studies of nonlinear interactions in networks of oscillators and beyond.</description>

      <title>Modeling chiral active particles: from circular motion to odd interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss microscopic models for chiral active particles, i.e., rotating active units that exhibit circular or spinning motion. While non-chiral active particles are typically governed by self-propulsion and conservative interactions, the rotating motion of chiral particles generates additional non-conservative forces that cannot be derived from a potential. These manifest as effective transverse forces, acting perpendicular to the line connecting the centres of two interacting particles, and are referred to as odd interactions, because they break the mirror symmetry of the system. Here, we demonstrate that odd interactions arise from a limiting case of a well-established model describing spinning granular objects. In addition, we show that these models for chiral active objects give rise to a novel collective phenomenon that emerges uniquely from transverse forces and, hence, chirality. Specifically, the system undergoes a transition from a homogeneous phase to an inhomogeneous one characterised by regions depleted of particles, referred to as bubbles. This collective behaviour, termed BIO (bubbles induced by odd interactions), is a general emergent phenomenon arising from chirality and odd interactions. In this work, we review theoretical approaches to this problem, including a scaling argument and predictions for spatial velocity correlations that account for the BIO phase. Finally, we outline perspectives and open challenges concerning this collective phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Subdimensional entanglement entropy: from virtual response to mixed-state holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement entropy (EE) serves as a key diagnostic of quantum phases and phase transitions through bipartitions of the full system. However, recent studies on various topological phases of matter show that EE from bipartitions alone cannot effectively distinguish geometric from topological contributions. Motivated by this limitation, we introduce the \textit{subdimensional entanglement entropy} (SEE), defined for lower-dimensional \textit{subdimensional entanglement subsystems} (SESs), as a response theory characterizing many-body systems via \textit{virtual} deformations of SES geometry and topology. Analytical calculations for cluster states, discrete Abelian gauge theories, and fracton orders reveal distinct subleading SEE terms that sharply differentiate geometric and topological responses. Viewing the reduced density matrix on an SES as a mixed state, we establish a correspondence between stabilizers and mixed-state symmetries, identifying \textit{strong} and \textit{weak} classes. For SESs with nontrivial SEE, weak symmetries act as \textit{transparent patch operators} of the strong ones, forming robust \textit{transparent composite symmetries} (TCSs) that remain invariant under finite-depth quantum circuits and yield \textit{strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking} (SW-SSB). By bridging entanglement, mixed-state and categorical symmetries, holographic principles of topological order, and geometric-topological responses, SEE provides a unified framework that invites further theoretical and numerical exploration of correlated quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Spectral statistics and energy gap-scaling in $k-$local spin Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spectral properties of all-to-all interacting spin Hamiltonians acting on exactly $k$ spins whose coupling coefficients are drawn from a normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. For the completely disordered case $\mu = 0$, we show that the universality class of level statistics depends solely on the parity of system size $L$ and locality $k$, classifying these Hamiltonians into the Gaussian Orthogonal (GOE), Unitary (GUE), or Symplectic (GSE) ensembles. For couplings with a non-zero mean, we map the Hamiltonians to deformed random matrix ensembles and analyze conditions for a energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state. We find two distinct regimes: for small locality ($k \ll \sqrt{L}$), we show that the gap closing threshold scales proportionally with the mean coupling $\sigma \sim \mu$, and for large locality ($k \gg \sqrt{L}$) a spectral gap exists as long as $\mu &gt; \sigma$. We analytically derive the expression for this energy gap in the $k \gg \sqrt{L}$ limit. Our work provides a semi-solvable toy model for understanding random matrix universality, universal energy gap scaling, and a foundation for exploring more general properties through systematic modifications and couplings.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of a hard-core active lattice gas</title>

Abstract: We present a fluctuating hydrodynamic description of an active lattice gas model with excluded volume interactions that exhibits motility-induced phase separation under appropriate conditions. For quasi-one dimension and higher, stability analysis of the noiseless hydrodynamics gives quantitative bounds on the phase boundary of the motility-induced phase separation in terms of spinodal and binodal. Inclusion of the multiplicative noise in the fluctuating hydrodynamics describes the exponentially decaying two-point correlations in the stationary-state homogeneous phase. Our hydrodynamic description and theoretical predictions based on it are in excellent agreement with our Monte Carlo simulations and pseudospectral iteration of the hydrodynamics equations. Our construction of hydrodynamics for this model is not suitable in strictly one-dimension with single-file constraints, and we argue that this breakdown is associated with micro-phase separation.</description>

      <title>Entanglement dynamics from universal low-lying modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Information-theoretic quantities such as Renyi entropies show a remarkable universality in their late-time behaviour across a variety of chaotic many-body systems. Understanding how such common features emerge from very different microscopic dynamics remains an important challenge. In this work, we address this question in a class of Brownian models with random time-dependent Hamiltonians and a variety of different microscopic couplings. In any such model, the Lorentzian time-evolution of the $n$-th Renyi entropy can be mapped to evolution by a Euclidean Hamiltonian on 2$n$ copies of the system. We provide evidence that in systems with no symmetries, the low-energy excitations of the Euclidean Hamiltonian are universally given by a gapped quasiparticle-like band. The eigenstates in this band are plane waves of locally dressed domain walls between ferromagnetic ground states associated with two permutations in the symmetric group $S_n$. These excitations give rise to the membrane picture of entanglement growth, with the membrane tension determined by their dispersion relation. We establish this structure in a variety of cases using analytical perturbative methods and numerical variational techniques, and extract the associated dispersion relations and membrane tensions for the second and third Renyi entropies. For the third Renyi entropy, we argue that phase transitions in the membrane tension as a function of velocity are needed to ensure that physical constraints on the membrane tension are satisfied. Overall, this structure provides an understanding of entanglement dynamics in terms of a universal set of gapped low-lying modes, which may also apply to systems with time-independent Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Localization and "classical entanglement'' in the Discrete Non-Linear Schr\"odinger Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a detailed numerical study of the very peculiar thermodynamic properties of the localized high-energy phase of the Discrete Non-Linear Schr\"odinger Equation (DNLSE). A numerical sampling of the microcanonical ensemble done by means of Hamiltonian dynamics reveals a new and subtle relation between the presence of the localized phase and a property of the system that we have called {\it ``classical entanglement''}. Our main finding is that a quantity defined for our classical system in perfect analogy with the entanglement entropy of quantum ones, and that we have therefore called $S_{\mathrm{ent}}$, grows with the system size $N$ in the localized phase as $S_{\mathrm{ent}}(N) \sim \log(N)$, therefore revealing the presence of subtle non-local correlations between any finite portion of the system and the rest of it. This manifestation of {\it ``classical entanglement''} beautifully captures the lack of system separability in the DNLSE localized phase, revealing how statistical correlations specific to the microcanonical ensemble and non-reproducible in the canonical one, may concur to determine a property totally analogous to the one produced by non-local quantum correlations.</description>

      <title>Shannon entropy of the measurement record at measurement-dominated criticality and RG flow: A c-theorem for effective central charge and a g-theorem for effective boundary entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present two theorems demonstrating non-perturbatively the decrease under relevant renormalization group (RG) flow of two quantities, $c_{\text{eff}}$ and $g_{\text{eff}}$ characterizing, respectively, the universal information content of the Shannon entropy of the measurement record for two different types of measurement-dominated criticality. First, we demonstrate the decrease of the "effective central charge" $c_{\text{eff}}$ of $2D$ replica field theories in the $R\rightarrow1$ replica limit that govern the long-distance physics of weakly monitored $2D$ classical critical systems (Baysian inference problems) studied recently in the literature [arXiv:2504.01264; arXiv:2504.12385; arXiv:2504.08888]. In particular, we show that $c_{\text{eff}}$ is $\textit{less}$ than the central charge $c$ of the unmeasured critical system. We refer to this result as the "$c$-effective theorem''. In addition, we present an analogous "$g$-effective theorem" demonstrating the decrease under RG flow of the effective "Affleck-Ludwig'' boundary entropy $\ln g_\text{eff}$, quantifying a corresponding contribution to the Shannon entropy for analogous $2D$ $\textit{defect}$ replica field theories in the $R\rightarrow1$ replica limit, which govern the long-distance physics in the problem of performing weak $\textit{quantum}$ measurements on one-dimensional quantum critical ground states. Lastly, we discuss a possible consequence of our theorems for classical systems with generic uncorrelated impurity-type quenched disorder, according to which, under a certain assumption, and as opposed to problems with measurement-induced randomness, the corresponding universal quantities $c_{\text{eff}}^{(R\rightarrow0)}$ and $g_{\text{eff}}^{(R\rightarrow0)}$ in the $R\rightarrow0$ replica limit would $\textit{increase}$ under RG flow.</description>

      <title>Quantum Ornstein-Zernike Theory for Two-Temperature Two-Component Plasmas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Laboratory plasma production almost always preferentially heats either the ions or electrons, leading to a two-temperature state. High-fidelity modeling of these systems can be achieved with density functional theory molecular dynamics in the two-temperature, adiabatic electron limit. Motivated by this, we construct a statistical mechanics framework for the multi-temperature system that is theoretically consistent with the ab initio calculation. We proceed to derive multi-temperature quantum Ornstein-Zernike equations for the first time. We then construct a two-temperature two-component plasma model using the average atom and compute the radial distribution function, viscosity, ion thermal conductivity, and ion self-diffusion. We verify that we recover the ionic structure and self-diffusion of density functional molecular dynamics simulations.</description>

      <title>Meta-learning of Gibbs states for many-body Hamiltonians with applications to Quantum Boltzmann Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The preparation of quantum Gibbs states is a fundamental challenge in quantum computing, essential for applications ranging from modeling open quantum systems to quantum machine learning. Building on the Meta-Variational Quantum Eigensolver framework proposed by Cervera-Lierta et al.(2021) and a problem driven ansatz design, we introduce two meta-learning algorithms: Meta-Variational Quantum Thermalizer (Meta-VQT) and Neural Network Meta-VQT (NN-Meta VQT) for efficient thermal state preparation of parametrized Hamiltonians on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. Meta-VQT utilizes a fully quantum ansatz, while NN Meta-VQT integrates a quantum classical hybrid architecture. Both leverage collective optimization over training sets to generalize Gibbs state preparation to unseen parameters. We validate our methods on upto 8-qubit Transverse Field Ising Model and the 2-qubit Heisenberg model with all field terms, demonstrating efficient thermal state generation beyond training data. For larger systems, we show that our meta-learned parameters when combined with appropriately designed ansatz serve as warm start initializations, significantly outperforming random initializations in the optimization tasks. Furthermore, a 3- qubit Kitaev ring example showcases our algorithm's effectiveness across finite-temperature crossover regimes. Finally, we apply our algorithms to train a Quantum Boltzmann Machine (QBM) on a 2-qubit Heisenberg model with all field terms, achieving enhanced training efficiency, improved Gibbs state accuracy, and a 30-fold runtime speedup over existing techniques such as variational quantum imaginary time (VarQITE)-based QBM highlighting the scalability and practicality of meta-algorithm-based QBMs.</description>

      <title>Quantum Annealing in SK Model Employing Suzuki-Kubo-deGennes Quantum Ising Mean Field Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01004v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a quantum annealing approach for estimating the ground state energy of the Sherrington-Kirpatrick mean field spin glass model using the Suzuki-Kubo-deGennes dynamics applied for individual local magnetization components. The solutions of the coupled differential equations, in discretized state, give a fast annealing algorithm (cost $N^3$) in estimating the ground state of the model: Classical ($E^0= -0.7629 \pm 0.0002$), Quantum ($E^0=-0.7623 \pm 0.0001$) and Mixed ($E^0=-0.7626 \pm 0.0001$), all of which are to be compared with the best known estimate $E^0= -0.763166726 \dots$ . We infer that the continuous nature of the magnetization variable used in the dynamics here is the reason for reaching close to the ground state quickly and also the reason for not observing the de-Almeida-Thouless line in this approach.</description>
