      <title>Conformation and dynamics of wet tangentially-driven active filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the impact of hydrodynamic interactions on the conformational and dynamical properties of wet tangentially-driven active polymers using multiparticle collision dynamics simulations. By analyzing active filaments with varying degrees of flexibility, we find that fluid-mediated interactions significantly influence both their conformation and dynamics. These interactions cause polymer conformations to shrink, especially for semiflexible polymers at high activity levels, where the average size of wet chains becomes nearly three times smaller, due to formation of helix-like structures. This hydrodynamic-induced shrinkage is a hallmark of active polymers, as fluid-mediated interactions have a minimal effect on the mean conformation of passive polymers. Furthermore, for tangentially-driven polymers where activity and conformation are coupled, hydrodynamic interactions significantly enhance the orientational and translational dynamics compared to their dry counterparts.</description>

      <title>Vulnerability of Transport through Evolving Spatial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Insight into the blockage vulnerability of evolving spatial networks is important for understanding transport resilience, robustness, and failure of a broad class of real-world structures such as porous media and utility, urban traffic, and infrastructure networks. By exhaustive search for central transport hubs on porous lattice structures, we recursively determine and block the emerging main hub until the evolving network reaches the impenetrability limit. We find that the blockage backbone is a self-similar path with a fractal dimension which is distinctly smaller than that of the universality class of optimal path crack models. The number of blocking steps versus the rescaled initial occupation fraction collapses onto a master curve for different network sizes, allowing for the prediction of the onset of impenetrability. The shortest-path length distribution broadens during the blocking process reflecting an increase of spatial correlations. We address the reliability of our predictions upon increasing the disorder or decreasing the fraction of processed structural information.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Cage Evolution in Quasi-two-dimensional Colloidal Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Employing video microscopy, we explore the cage dynamics for colloidal particles confined in quasi-two dimensions (q2D). Our experiments reveal that while ensemble-averaged dynamics of cages are isotropic in the laboratory frame, its evolution in the displacement frame of the caged particle is anisotropic and asymmetric. In turn, this leads to particles in specific regions of the cage contributing either to cage persistence or breaking, influencing the structural relaxation of the fluid. Our findings, thus, provide microscopic insights into cage evolution and dynamics for colloidal fluids in q2D, with direct potential implications for the flow of complex fluids, structural relaxation in dense suspensions, and collective motion in active matter in confined geometries.</description>

      <title>Sedimenting microrollers navigate saturated porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle sedimentation through porous media is limited by the inability of passive material to overcome surface interactions and a tortuous network of pores. This limits transport, delivery, and effectiveness of chemicals used as reactants, nutrients, pesticides, or for waste remediation. This work develops magnetically responsive microrollers that navigate the complex interstitial network of porous matter. Rather than arresting on the upward facing surfaces of the pores, particles can roll and fall further, increasing transport by orders of magnitude. This work directly investigates Janus microrollers, activated by a rotating magnetic field, rolling and sedimenting though an index-matched porous medium. The mechanism of enhanced transport is determined, and the material flux is primarily a function of microroller concentration, rotation rate, and magnetic field strength. This mechanism is most efficient using a minimum number of rotations spaced out periodically in time to reduce the required energy input to greatly enhance transport. This general mechanism of transport enhancement can be broadly applied in numerous applications because the particles delivered within the porous matrix may be comprised of a wide variety of functional materials.</description>

      <title>Correlating ultrastability with fragility and surface mobility in vapor deposited tetrahedral glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several experiments on molecular and metallic glasses have shown that the ability of vapor deposition to produce ultrastable glasses is correlated with their structural and thermodynamic properties. Here we investigate the vapor deposition of a class of tetrahedral materials (including silicon and water) via molecular dynamics simulations of the generalized Stillinger-Weber potential. By changing a single parameter that controls the local tetrahedrality, we show that the emergence of ultrastable behavior is correlated with an increase in the fragility of the model. At the same time, while the mobility of the surface compared to the bulk shows only slight changes at low temperature, with increasing the tetrahedrality, it displays a significant enhancement towards the glass transition temperature. Our results point towards a strong connection between bulk dynamics, surface dynamics and glass-ultrastability ability in this class of materials.</description>

      <title>Statistical mechanics of frustrated assemblies and incompatible graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometrically frustrated assemblies where building blocks misfit have been shown to generate intriguing phenomena from self-limited growth, fiber formation, to structural complexity. We introduce a graph theory formulation of geometrically frustrated assemblies, capturing frustrated interactions through the concept of incompatible flows, providing a direct link between structural connectivity and frustration. This theory offers a minimal yet comprehensive framework for the fundamental statistical mechanics of frustrated assemblies. Through numerical simulations, the theory reveals new characteristics of frustrated assemblies, including two distinct percolation transitions for structure and stress, a crossover between cumulative and non-cumulative frustration controlled by disorder, and a divergent length scale in their response.</description>

      <title>Experimental Data Confirm Carrier-Cascade Model for Solid-State Conductance across Proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The finding that electronic conductance across ultra-thin protein films between metallic electrodes remains nearly constant from room temperature to just a few degrees Kelvin has posed a challenge. We show that a model based on a generalized Landauer formula explains the nearly constant conductance and predicts an Arrhenius-like dependence for low temperatures. A critical aspect of the model is that the relevant activation energy for conductance is either the difference between the HOMO and HOMO-1 or the LUMO+1 and LUMO energies instead of the HOMO-LUMO gap of the proteins. Analysis of experimental data confirm the Arrhenius-like law and allows us to extract the activation energies. We then calculate the energy differences with advanced DFT methods for proteins used in the experiments. Our main result is that the experimental and theoretical activation energies for these three different proteins and three differently prepared solid-state junctions match nearly perfectly, implying the mechanism's validity.</description>

      <title>Chemically reactive and aging macromolecular mixtures II: Phase separation and coarsening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a companion paper, we put forth a thermodynamic model for complex formation via a chemical reaction involving multiple macromolecular species, which may subsequently undergo liquid-liquid phase separation and a further transition into a gel-like state. In the present work, we formulate a thermodynamically consistent kinetic framework to study the interplay between phase separation, chemical reaction and aging in spatially inhomogeneous macromolecular mixtures. A numerical algorithm is also proposed to simulate domain growth from collisions of liquid and gel domains via passive Brownian motion in both two and three spatial dimensions. Our results show that the coarsening behavior is significantly influenced by the degree of gelation and Brownian motion. The presence of a gel phase inside condensates strongly limits the diffusive transport processes, and Brownian motion coalescence controls the coarsening process in systems with high area/volume fractions of gel-like condensates, leading to formation of interconnected domains with atypical domain growth rates controlled by size-dependent translational and rotational diffusivities.</description>

      <title>A biological approach to metalworking based on chitinous colloids and composites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.01347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biological systems evolve with minimum metabolic costs and use common components, and they represent guideposts toward a paradigm of manufacturing that is centered on minimum energy, local resources, and ecological integration. Here, a new method of metalworking that uses chitosan from the arthropod cuticle to aggregate colloidal suspensions of different metals into solid ultra-low-binder-content composites is demonstrated. These composites, which can contain more than 99.5% metal, simultaneously show bonding affinity for biological components and metallic characteristics, such as electrical conductivity. This approach stands in contrast with existing metalworking methods, taking place at ambient temperature and pressure, and being driven by water exchange. Furthermore, all the nonmetallic components involved are metabolized in large amounts in every ecosystem. Under these conditions, the composites' ability to be printed and cast into functional shapes with metallic characteristics is demonstrated. The affinity of chitometallic composites for other biological components also allows them to infuse metallic characteristics into other biomaterials. The findings and robust manufacturing examples go well beyond basic demonstrations and offer a generalizable new approach to metalworking. The potential for a paradigm shift toward biomaterials based on their unique characteristics and the principles of their manufacturing methods is highlighted.</description>

      <title>Beware of CaBER: Filament thinning rheometry does not always give `the' relaxation time of polymer solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08440v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The viscoelastic relaxation time of a polymer solution is often measured using Capillary Breakup Extensional Rheometry (CaBER) where a droplet is placed between two plates which are pulled apart to form a thinning filament. For a slow plate retraction protocol, required to avoid inertio-capillary oscillations for low-viscosity liquids, we show experimentally that the CaBER relaxation time $\tau_e$ inferred from the exponential thinning regime is in fact an apparent relaxation time that may increase significantly when increasing the plate diameter and the droplet volume. Similarly, we observe that $\tau_e$ increases with the plate diameter for the classical step-strain plate separation protocol of a commercial (Haake) CaBER device and increases with the nozzle diameter for a Dripping-onto-Substrate (DoS) method. This dependence on the flow history before the formation of the viscoelastic filament is in contradiction with polymer models such as Oldroyd-B that predict a filament thinning rate $1/3\tau$ ($\tau$ being the model's relaxation time) which is a material property independent of geometrical factors. We show that this is not due to artefacts such as solvent evaporation or polymer degradation and that it can only be rationalised by finite extensibility effects (FENE-P model) for a dilute polymer solution in a viscous solvent, but not for semi-dilute solutions in a low-viscosity solvent.</description>

      <title>Jamming is a first-order transition with quenched disorder in amorphous materials sheared by cyclic quasistatic deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01834v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Jamming is an athermal transition between flowing and rigid states in amorphous systems such as granular matter, colloidal suspensions, complex fluids and cells. The jamming transition seems to display mixed aspects of a first-order transition, evidenced by a discontinuity in the coordination number, and a second-order transition, indicated by power-law scalings and diverging lengths. Here we demonstrate that jamming is a first-order transition with quenched disorder in cyclically sheared systems with quasistatic deformations, in two and three dimensions. Based on scaling analyses, we show that fluctuations of the jamming density in finite-sized systems have important consequences on the finite-size effects of various quantities, resulting in a square relationship between disconnected and connected susceptibilities, a key signature of the first-order transition with quenched disorder. This study puts the jamming transition into the category of a broad class of transitions in disordered systems where sample-to-sample fluctuations dominate over thermal fluctuations, suggesting that the nature and behavior of the jamming transition might be better understood within the developed theoretical framework of the athermally driven random-field Ising model.</description>

      <title>Closely piling up of multiple adhesive fronts in adhesive friction due to re-attachment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Friction impacts a wide range of fields, spanning engineering, geology, biomechanics, and numerous others. As a fundamental force, it influences various aspects of our daily lives and industrial processes across multiple disciplines. To understand how adhesive friction seemingly breaks the size limit dictated by the fracture theory, here we investigate the sliding of elastic solids adhered to a rigid surface via multiple adhesive springs. With the consideration of random re-attachment of detached adhesive springs, we find that the shear-off force of the interface can significantly exceed predictions made by the fracture theory, with substantial adhesive forces distributed across the entire interface. Through this observation, we identify multiple adhesive fronts closely aligning along the interface, exhibiting similar force profiles. Moreover, the number of these regions seems to generally increase with the interface size, resulting in a linear rise in the calculated shear-off force with interface size. Therefore, we conclude that the close accumulation of multiple adhesive fronts along an interface aids each other through random healing so as to erase the size effect of the fracture theory, which offers valuable insights into understanding the phenomena associated with adhesive friction along an interface in various fields.</description>

Abstract: We present a scheme for investigating arbitrary thermal observables in spatially inhomogeneous equilibrium many-body systems. Extending the grand canonical ensemble yields any given observable as an explicit hyper-density functional. Associated local fluctuation profiles follow from an exact hyper-Ornstein-Zernike equation. While the local compressibility and simple observables permit analytic treatment, complex order parameters are accessible via simulation-based supervised machine learning of neural hyper-direct correlation functionals. We exemplify efficient and accurate neural predictions for the cluster statistics of hard rods, square well rods, and hard spheres. The theory allows to treat complex observables, as is impossible in standard density functional theory.</description>

      <title>Tailoring the Morphology of Cellulose Nanocrystals via Controlled Aggregation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) are bioderived nanoparticles that can be isolated from various sources of natural cellulose via acid hydrolysis. However, the link between particle morphological characteristics and their ensemble behavior is poorly understood, partly because of the difficulties in controlling the CNC morphology during their extraction process. In this work, the impacts of common post-hydrolysis treatments on the CNC morphology are investigated. The results indicate that the centrifugation step commonly applied during CNC purification favors the formation of composite particles made of aligned crystallites, referred to as 'bundles'. Scanning nanobeam electron diffraction reveals that such bundles are associated preferentially along their hydrophobic faces. This is in stark contrast to the formation of misaligned composite particles that can be achieved with ionic treatments, where an uncontrolled aggregation occurs. The functional relevance of these morphological differences is demonstrated by their effect on the cholesteric self-organization of CNCs, with bundles found to exhibit a greater chiral enhancement, whereas the misaligned composite particles found to promote gelation. This study reveals the importance of the often-disregarded purification steps on the final morphology of CNCs and their resulting ensemble properties, thereby unlocking new routes for tailoring this promising material towards a variety of applications.</description>

      <title>2D capsid formation within an oscillatory energy landscape: orderly self-assembly depends on the interplay between a dynamic potential and intrinsic relaxation times</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiple dissipative self-assembly protocols designed to create novel structures or to reduce kinetic traps have recently emerged. Specifically, temporal oscillations of particle interactions have been shown effective at both aims, but investigations thus far have focused on systems of simple colloids or their binary mixtures. In this work, we expand our understanding of the effect of temporally oscillating interactions to a two-dimensional coarse-grained viral capsid-like model that undergoes a self-limited assembly. This model includes multiple intrinsic relaxation times due to the internal structure of the capsid subunits and, under certain interaction regimes, proceeds via a two-step nucleation mechanism. We find that oscillations much faster than the local intrinsic relaxation times can be described via a time averaged inter-particle potential across a wide range of interaction strengths, while oscillations much slower than these relaxation times result in structures that adapt to the attraction strength of the current half-cycle. Interestingly, oscillation periods similar to these relaxation times shift the interaction window over which orderly assembly occurs by enabling error correction during the half-cycles with weaker attractions. Our results provide fundamental insights to non-equilibrium self-assembly on temporally variant energy landscapes.</description>

      <title>Neural density functionals: Local learning and pair-correlation matching</title>

Abstract: Recently Dijkman et al. (arXiv:2403.15007) proposed training classical neural density functionals via bulk pair-correlation matching. We show their method to be an efficient regularizer for neural functionals based on local learning of inhomogeneous one-body direct correlations [Samm\"uller et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 120, e2312484120 (2023), 10.1073/pnas.2312484120]. While Dijkman et al. demonstrated pair-correlation matching of a global neural free energy functional, we argue in favor of local one-body learning for flexible neural modelling of the full Mermin-Evans density functional map. Using spatial localization gives access to accurate neural free energy functionals, including convolutional neural networks, that transcend the training box.</description>

      <title>Dynamical arrest in active nematic turbulence</title>

Abstract: Active fluids display spontaneous turbulent-like flows known as active turbulence. Recent work revealed that these flows have universal features, independent of the material properties and of the presence of topological defects. However, the differences between defect-laden and defect-free active turbulence remain largely unexplored. Here, by means of large-scale numerical simulations, we show that defect-free active nematic turbulence can undergo dynamical arrest. We find that flow alignment -- the tendency of nematics to reorient under shear -- enhances large-scale jets in contractile rodlike systems while promoting arrested flow patterns in extensile systems. Our results reveal a mechanism of labyrinthine pattern formation produced by an emergent topology of nematic domain walls that partially suppresses chaotic flows. Taken together, our findings call for the experimental realization of defect-free active nematics, and suggest that topological defects enable turbulence by preventing dynamical arrest.</description>

      <title>A unified analytical prediction for steady-state behavior of confined drop with interface viscosity under shear flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15019v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this Letter, we fill in the blanks in the theory of drops under shear flow by unifying analytical predictions for steady-state behavior proposed by Flumerfelt [R. W. Flumerfelt, J. Colloid Interface Sci. 76, 330 (1980)] for unconfined drops with interface viscosity with the one of Shapira &amp; Haber [M. Shapira and S. Haber, Int. J. Multiph. Flow. 16, 305 (1990)] for confined drops without interface viscosity. Our predictions for both steady-state drop deformation and inclination angle are broadly valid for situations involving confined/unconfined drops, with/without interface viscosity and viscosity ratio, thus making our model so general that it can include any of the above conditions.</description>

      <title>Poiseuille flow for a simplified pseudoplastic rheology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Poiseuille flow in cylindrical and planar geometries with a simplified, pseudoplastic (shear thinning) rheology characterized by constant viscosity plateaus above and below a transition strain rate is considered. Analytical, steady state solutions for velocity profile and volume flux are formulated. Transient flow development is addressed numerically and compared to the theory in the steady state limit. Stationary flow is approached after the momentum diffusion timescale based on the spatially dominant kinematic viscosity. For large viscosity ratio and shear thinning region confined near the domain boundary, velocity distributions are quasi-plug like with large boundary to interior strain rate ratio.</description>
