      <title>Robust MCVaR Portfolio Optimization with Ellipsoidal Support and Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space-based Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a portfolio optimization framework to minimize mixed conditional value at risk (MCVaR), incorporating a chance constraint on expected returns and limiting the number of assets via cardinality constraints. A robust MCVaR model is presented, which presumes ellipsoidal support for random returns without assuming any distribution. The model utilizes an uncertainty set grounded in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) to manage the chance constraint, resulting in a simplified second-order cone programming (SOCP) formulation. The performance of the robust model is tested on datasets from six distinct financial markets. The outcomes of comprehensive experiments indicate that the robust model surpasses the nominal model, market portfolio, and equal-weight portfolio with higher expected returns, lower risk metrics, enhanced reward-risk ratios, and a better value of Jensen's alpha in many cases. Furthermore, we aim to validate the robust models in different market phases (bullish, bearish, and neutral). The robust model shows a distinct advantage in bear markets, providing better risk protection against adverse conditions. In contrast, its performance in bullish and neutral phases is somewhat similar to that of the nominal model. The robust model appears effective in volatile markets, although further research is necessary to comprehend its performance across different market conditions.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Alpha Weighting with PPO: Enhancing Prompt-Based LLM-Generated Alphas in Quant Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a reinforcement learning framework that employs Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to dynamically optimize the weights of multiple large language model (LLM)-generated formulaic alphas for stock trading strategies. Formulaic alphas are mathematically defined trading signals derived from price, volume, sentiment, and other data. Although recent studies have shown that LLMs can generate diverse and effective alphas, a critical challenge lies in how to adaptively integrate them under varying market conditions. To address this gap, we leverage the deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b model to generate fifty alphas for five major stocks: Apple, HSBC, Pepsi, Toyota, and Tencent, and then use PPO to adjust their weights in real time. Experimental results demonstrate that the PPO-optimized strategy achieves strong returns and high Sharpe ratios across most stocks, outperforming both an equal-weighted alpha portfolio and traditional benchmarks such as the Nikkei 225, S&amp;P 500, and Hang Seng Index. The findings highlight the importance of reinforcement learning in the allocation of alpha weights and show the potential of combining LLM-generated signals with adaptive optimization for robust financial forecasting and trading.</description>

      <title>Solving dynamic portfolio selection problems via score-based diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09916v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the dynamic mean-variance portfolio selection problem in a {\it model-free} manner, based on (generative) diffusion models. We propose using data sampled from the real model $\mathbb P$ (which is unknown) with limited size to train a generative model $\mathbb Q$ (from which we can easily and adequately sample). With adaptive training and sampling methods that are tailor-made for time series data, we obtain quantification bounds between $\mathbb P$ and $\mathbb Q$ in terms of the adapted Wasserstein metric $\mathcal A W_2$. Importantly, the proposed adapted sampling method also facilitates {\it conditional sampling}. In the second part of this paper, we provide the stability of the mean-variance portfolio optimization problems in $\mathcal A W _2$. Then, combined with the error bounds and the stability result, we propose a policy gradient algorithm based on the generative environment, in which our innovative adapted sampling method provides approximate scenario generators. We illustrate the performance of our algorithm on both simulated and real data. For real data, the algorithm based on the generative environment produces portfolios that beat several important baselines, including the Markowitz portfolio, the equal weight (naive) portfolio, and S\&amp;P 500.</description>
