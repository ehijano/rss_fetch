      <title>Enhancing Adversarial Robustness in SNNs with Sparse Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have attracted great attention for their energy-efficient operations and biologically inspired structures, offering potential advantages over Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in terms of energy efficiency and interpretability. Nonetheless, similar to ANNs, the robustness of SNNs remains a challenge, especially when facing adversarial attacks. Existing techniques, whether adapted from ANNs or specifically designed for SNNs, exhibit limitations in training SNNs or defending against strong attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to enhance the robustness of SNNs through gradient sparsity regularization. We observe that SNNs exhibit greater resilience to random perturbations compared to adversarial perturbations, even at larger scales. Motivated by this, we aim to narrow the gap between SNNs under adversarial and random perturbations, thereby improving their overall robustness. To achieve this, we theoretically prove that this performance gap is upper bounded by the gradient sparsity of the probability associated with the true label concerning the input image, laying the groundwork for a practical strategy to train robust SNNs by regularizing the gradient sparsity. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on both image-based and event-based datasets. The results demonstrate notable improvements in the robustness of SNNs. Our work highlights the importance of gradient sparsity in SNNs and its role in enhancing robustness.</description>

      <title>Robust Stable Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are gaining popularity in deep learning due to their low energy budget on neuromorphic hardware. However, they still face challenges in lacking sufficient robustness to guard safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. Many studies have been conducted to defend SNNs from the threat of adversarial attacks. This paper aims to uncover the robustness of SNN through the lens of the stability of nonlinear systems. We are inspired by the fact that searching for parameters altering the leaky integrate-and-fire dynamics can enhance their robustness. Thus, we dive into the dynamics of membrane potential perturbation and simplify the formulation of the dynamics. We present that membrane potential perturbation dynamics can reliably convey the intensity of perturbation. Our theoretical analyses imply that the simplified perturbation dynamics satisfy input-output stability. Thus, we propose a training framework with modified SNN neurons and to reduce the mean square of membrane potential perturbation aiming at enhancing the robustness of SNN. Finally, we experimentally verify the effectiveness of the framework in the setting of Gaussian noise training and adversarial training on the image classification task.</description>

      <title>Expanded Gating Ranges Improve Activation Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Activation functions are core components of all deep learning architectures. Currently, the most popular activation functions are smooth ReLU variants like GELU and SiLU. These are self-gated activation functions where the range of the gating function is between zero and one. In this paper, we explore the viability of using arctan as a gating mechanism. A self-gated activation function that uses arctan as its gating function has a monotonically increasing first derivative. To make this activation function competitive, it is necessary to introduce a trainable parameter for every MLP block to expand the range of the gating function beyond zero and one. We find that this technique also improves existing self-gated activation functions. We conduct an empirical evaluation of Expanded ArcTan Linear Unit (xATLU), Expanded GELU (xGELU), and Expanded SiLU (xSiLU) and show that they outperform existing activation functions within a transformer architecture. Additionally, expanded gating ranges show promising results in improving first-order Gated Linear Units (GLU).</description>

      <title>Comparing Quantum Annealing and Spiking Neuromorphic Computing for Sampling Binary Sparse Coding QUBO Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of computing a sparse binary representation of an image. To be precise, given an image and an overcomplete, non-orthonormal basis, we aim to find a sparse binary vector indicating the minimal set of basis vectors that when added together best reconstruct the given input. We formulate this problem with an $L_2$ loss on the reconstruction error, and an $L_0$ (or, equivalently, an $L_1$) loss on the binary vector enforcing sparsity. This yields a quadratic binary optimization problem (QUBO), whose optimal solution(s) in general is NP-hard to find. The method of unsupervised and unnormalized dictionary feature learning for a desired sparsity level to best match the data is presented. Next, we solve the sparse representation QUBO by implementing it both on a D-Wave quantum annealer with Pegasus chip connectivity via minor embedding, as well as on the Intel Loihi 2 spiking neuromorphic processor. On the quantum annealer, we sample from the sparse representation QUBO using parallel quantum annealing combined with quantum evolution Monte Carlo, also known as iterated reverse annealing. On Loihi 2, we use a stochastic winner take all network of neurons. The solutions are benchmarked against simulated annealing, a classical heuristic, and the optimal solutions are computed using CPLEX. Iterated reverse quantum annealing performs similarly to simulated annealing, although simulated annealing is always able to sample the optimal solution whereas quantum annealing was not always able to. The Loihi 2 solutions that are sampled are on average more sparse than the solutions from any of the other methods. Loihi 2 outperforms a D-Wave quantum annealer standard linear-schedule anneal, while iterated reverse quantum annealing performs much better than both unmodified linear-schedule quantum annealing and iterated warm starting on Loihi 2.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Driving with Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous driving demands an integrated approach that encompasses perception, prediction, and planning, all while operating under strict energy constraints to enhance scalability and environmental sustainability. We present Spiking Autonomous Driving (SAD), the first unified Spiking Neural Network (SNN) to address the energy challenges faced by autonomous driving systems through its event-driven and energy-efficient nature. SAD is trained end-to-end and consists of three main modules: perception, which processes inputs from multi-view cameras to construct a spatiotemporal bird's eye view; prediction, which utilizes a novel dual-pathway with spiking neurons to forecast future states; and planning, which generates safe trajectories considering predicted occupancy, traffic rules, and ride comfort. Evaluated on the nuScenes dataset, SAD achieves competitive performance in perception, prediction, and planning tasks, while drawing upon the energy efficiency of SNNs. This work highlights the potential of neuromorphic computing to be applied to energy-efficient autonomous driving, a critical step toward sustainable and safety-critical automotive technology.

      <title>Methods to Estimate Cryptic Sequence Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complexity is a signature quality of interest in artificial life systems. Alongside other dimensions of assessment, it is common to quantify genome sites that contribute to fitness as a complexity measure. However, limitations to the sensitivity of fitness assays in models with implicit replication criteria involving rich biotic interactions introduce the possibility of difficult-to-detect ``cryptic'' adaptive sites, which contribute small fitness effects below the threshold of individual detectability or involve epistatic redundancies. Here, we propose three knockout-based assay procedures designed to quantify cryptic adaptive sites within digital genomes. We report initial tests of these methods on a simple genome model with explicitly configured site fitness effects. In these limited tests, estimation results reflect ground truth cryptic sequence complexities well. Presented work provides initial steps toward development of new methods and software tools that improve the resolution, rigor, and tractability of complexity analyses across alife systems, particularly those requiring expensive in situ assessments of organism fitness.</description>

      <title>Spiketrum: An FPGA-based Implementation of a Neuromorphic Cochlea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15923v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel FPGA-based neuromorphic cochlea, leveraging the general-purpose spike-coding algorithm, Spiketrum. The focus of this study is on the development and characterization of this cochlea model, which excels in transforming audio vibrations into biologically realistic auditory spike trains. These spike trains are designed to withstand neural fluctuations and spike losses while accurately encapsulating the spatial and precise temporal characteristics of audio, along with the intensity of incoming vibrations. Noteworthy features include the ability to generate real-time spike trains with minimal information loss and the capacity to reconstruct original signals. This fine-tuning capability allows users to optimize spike rates, achieving an optimal balance between output quality and power consumption. Furthermore, the integration of a feedback system into Spiketrum enables selective amplification of specific features while attenuating others, facilitating adaptive power consumption based on application requirements. The hardware implementation supports both spike-based and non-spike-based processors, making it versatile for various computing systems. The cochlea's ability to encode diverse sensory information, extending beyond sound waveforms, positions it as a promising sensory input for current and future spike-based intelligent computing systems, offering compact and real-time spike train generation.</description>

      <title>Application based Evaluation of an Efficient Spike-Encoder, "Spiketrum"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15927v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spike-based encoders represent information as sequences of spikes or pulses, which are transmitted between neurons. A prevailing consensus suggests that spike-based approaches demonstrate exceptional capabilities in capturing the temporal dynamics of neural activity and have the potential to provide energy-efficient solutions for low-power applications. The Spiketrum encoder efficiently compresses input data using spike trains or code sets (for non-spiking applications) and is adaptable to both hardware and software implementations, with lossless signal reconstruction capability. The paper proposes and assesses Spiketrum's hardware, evaluating its output under varying spike rates and its classification performance with popular spiking and non-spiking classifiers, and also assessing the quality of information compression and hardware resource utilization. The paper extensively benchmarks both Spiketrum hardware and its software counterpart against state-of-the-art, biologically-plausible encoders. The evaluations encompass benchmarking criteria, including classification accuracy, training speed, and sparsity when using encoder outputs in pattern recognition and classification with both spiking and non-spiking classifiers. Additionally, they consider encoded output entropy and hardware resource utilization and power consumption of the hardware version of the encoders. Results demonstrate Spiketrum's superiority in most benchmarking criteria, making it a promising choice for various applications. It efficiently utilizes hardware resources with low power consumption, achieving high classification accuracy. This work also emphasizes the potential of encoders in spike-based processing to improve the efficiency and performance of neural computing systems.</description>
