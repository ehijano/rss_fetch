      <title>Disentangled Interest Network for Out-of-Distribution CTR Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Click-through rate (CTR) prediction, which estimates the probability of a user clicking on a given item, is a critical task for online information services. Existing approaches often make strong assumptions that training and test data come from the same distribution. However, the data distribution varies since user interests are constantly evolving, resulting in the out-of-distribution (OOD) issue. In addition, users tend to have multiple interests, some of which evolve faster than others. Towards this end, we propose Disentangled Click-Through Rate prediction (DiseCTR), which introduces a causal perspective of recommendation and disentangles multiple aspects of user interests to alleviate the OOD issue in recommendation. We conduct a causal factorization of CTR prediction involving user interest, exposure model, and click model, based on which we develop a deep learning implementation for these three causal mechanisms. Specifically, we first design an interest encoder with sparse attention which maps raw features to user interests, and then introduce a weakly supervised interest disentangler to learn independent interest embeddings, which are further integrated by an attentive interest aggregator for prediction. Experimental results on three real-world datasets show that DiseCTR achieves the best accuracy and robustness in OOD recommendation against state-of-the-art approaches, significantly improving AUC and GAUC by over 0.02 and reducing logloss by over 13.7%. Further analyses demonstrate that DiseCTR successfully disentangles user interests, which is the key to OOD generalization for CTR prediction. We have released the code and data at https://github.com/DavyMorgan/DiseCTR/.</description>

      <title>Efficient Multilingual Search Relevance Modeling in E-Commerce via LLM Mixture-of-Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In e-commerce platforms, search relevance directly influences both user experience and merchant revenue. In multi-country deployments, diverse linguistic, cultural, and product catalog contexts introduce significant distribution shifts, posing substantial challenges to relevance modeling. Existing approaches typically enhance the reasoning or multilingual abilities of a single monolithic model, yet they remain limited by data diversity, coverage gaps, and high inference costs in heterogeneous environments. Our empirical analysis reveals that different LLM base models exhibit complementary strengths across languages and regions, motivating an expert-based architecture. We propose a scalable LLM-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that dynamically routes queries to specialized experts and fuses their embeddings through concatenation. Among rule-based, pseudo-label-based, and fully end-to-end strategies, end-to-end hard routing with concatenation offers the best balance of effectiveness and efficiency. To mitigate inference overhead, we further develop an engineering-optimized offline batch pipeline with resource-efficient scheduling, which hides memory latency, improves GPU utilization, and reduces GPU-hour consumption by up to 35% compared with synchronous execution. On datasets spanning six Southeast Asian markets, our MoE improves AUC by 0.72 percentage points over a dense baseline with the same active parameters. Meanwhile, the optimized pipeline achieves 27.6 queries per second (QPS), a 9% throughput improvement. These results demonstrate superior multilingual relevance and efficiency, delivering strong cost-effectiveness for real-world e-commerce search systems.</description>

      <title>C$^2$-Cite: Contextual-Aware Citation Generation for Attributed Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The attribution technique enhances the credibility of LLMs by adding citations to the generated sentences, enabling users to trace back to the original sources and verify the reliability of the output. However, existing instruction-tuned attributed LLMs often fail to properly interpret the contextual semantics of citation symbols (e.g., [i]) during text generation. This shortcoming arises from their insufficient awareness of the context information surrounding citation markers, which in turn leads to disjointed references and poor integration of retrieved knowledge into the generated content. To address this issue, we propose a novel \textbf{C}ontextual-aware \textbf{C}itation generation framework (\textbf{C$^2$}-\textbf{Cite}) that explicitly integrates the semantic relationships between citation markers and their referenced content. Specifically, a contextual citation alignment mechanism is adopted: it first encodes the retrieved document contexts into the symbol representation of citations, then aligns the marker numbers by decoding information from a citation router function. This mechanism enables the transformation of citation markers from generic placeholders into active knowledge pointers that link to the referenced source information. Experimental results on the ALCE benchmark across three datasets validate our framework C$^2$-Cite++: it outperforms the SOTA baseline by an average of 5.8\% in citation quality and 17.4\% in response correctness. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/BAI-LAB/c2cite</description>

      <title>AutoBool: An Reinforcement-Learning trained LLM for Effective Automated Boolean Query Generation for Systematic Reviews</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present AutoBool, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that trains large language models (LLMs) to generate effective Boolean queries for medical systematic reviews. Boolean queries are the primary mechanism for literature retrieval in this domain and must achieve high recall while maintaining reasonable precision - a challenging balance that existing prompt-based LLM approaches often struggle to achieve. A major limitation in this space is the lack of high-quality ground-truth Boolean queries for each topic, which makes supervised fine-tuning impractical. AutoBool addresses this challenge by using RL to directly optimize query generation with retrieval measures, without requiring target queries. To support this effort, we create and release the largest dataset of its kind: 65588 topics in total for training and evaluating the task of automatic Boolean query formulation. Experiments on our new dataset and two established datasets (CLEF TAR and Seed Collection) show that AutoBool significantly outperforms zero shot/few shot prompting and matches or exceeds the effectiveness of much larger GPT-based models (e.g., GPT-4o, O3) using smaller backbones. It also approaches effectiveness of expert-authored queries while retrieving 10 to 16 times fewer documents. Ablation studies reveal the critical roles of model backbone, size, decoding temperature, and prompt design. Code and data are available at https://github.com/ielab/AutoBool.</description>

      <title>FDA AI Search: Making FDA-Authorized AI Devices Searchable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over 1,200 AI-enabled medical devices have received marketing authorization from the U.S. FDA, yet identifying devices suited to specific clinical needs remains challenging because the FDA's databases contain only limited metadata and non-searchable summary PDFs. To address this gap, we developed FDA AI Search, a website that enables semantic querying of FDA-authorized AI-enabled devices. The backend includes an embedding-based retrieval system, where LLM-extracted features from authorization summaries are compared to user queries to find relevant matches. We present quantitative and qualitative evaluation that support the effectiveness of the retrieval algorithm compared to keyword-based methods. As FDA-authorized AI devices become increasingly prevalent and their use cases expand, we envision that the tool will assist healthcare providers in identifying devices aligned with their clinical needs and support developers in formulating novel AI applications.</description>

      <title>Front-Loaded or Balanced? The Mechanism through Which Review Order Affects Overall Ratings in Premium Service Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the increasingly prevalent landscape of high-quality service contexts, whether consumer evaluation interfaces adopt a rating-first or review-first sequence has become a critical factor shaping rating authenticity and feedback quality. While prior research has primarily examined review content and sentiment, systematic investigation into how evaluation order influences rating outcomes remains limited. Through exploratory analyses, we find that Letterboxd -- which employs a review-first, rating-after mechanism -- exhibits a more centralized rating distribution with fewer extreme scores, whereas Yelp -- which adopts a rating-first, review-after mechanism -- shows a pronounced bimodal distribution with more polarized ratings. Three controlled experiments further demonstrate that in high-quality service contexts, a rating-first (vs. review-first) interface significantly elevates consumers' overall ratings. Mechanism analyses indicate that cognitive effort and affective heuristics serve as dual pathways: a rating-first (vs. review-first) sequence reduces cognitive effort and heightens affective heuristics, thereby increasing rating scores. Moreover, service quality moderates this process. When service quality is low, the rating-first (vs. review-first) sequence instead leads to lower ratings. This research reveals the psychological mechanisms through which evaluation order affects consumer ratings via cognitive and affective pathways. It extends theoretical understanding of online rating formation and offers practical implications for optimizing platform interface design to enhance rating authenticity and credibility.</description>

      <title>ChunkNorris: A High-Performance and Low-Energy Approach to PDF Parsing and Chunking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Retrieval-Augmented Generation applications, the Information Retrieval part is central as it provides the contextual information that enables a Large Language Model to generate an appropriate and truthful response. High quality parsing and chunking are critical as efficient data segmentation directly impacts downstream tasks, i.e. Information Retrieval and answer generation. In this paper, we introduce ChunkNorris, a novel heuristic-based technique designed to optimise the parsing and chunking of PDF documents. Our approach does not rely on machine learning and employs a suite of simple yet effective heuristics to achieve high performance with minimal computational overhead. We demonstrate the efficiency of ChunkNorris through a comprehensive benchmark against existing parsing and chunking methods, evaluating criteria such as execution time, energy consumption, and retrieval accuracy. We propose an open-access dataset to produce our results. ChunkNorris outperforms baseline and more advanced techniques, offering a practical and efficient alternative for Information Retrieval tasks. Therefore, this research highlights the potential of heuristic-based methods for real-world, resource-constrained RAG use cases.</description>

      <title>Chained Prompting for Better Systematic Review Search Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systematic reviews require the use of rigorously designed search strategies to ensure both comprehensive retrieval and minimization of bias. Conventional manual approaches, although methodologically systematic, are resource-intensive and susceptible to subjectivity, whereas heuristic and automated techniques frequently under-perform in recall unless supplemented by extensive expert input. We introduce a Large Language Model (LLM)-based chained prompt engineering framework for the automated development of search strategies in systematic reviews. The framework replicates the procedural structure of manual search design while leveraging LLMs to decompose review objectives, extract and formalize PICO elements, generate conceptual representations, expand terminologies, and synthesize Boolean queries. In addition to query construction, the framework exhibits superior performance in generating well-structured PICO elements relative to existing methods, thereby strengthening the foundation for high-recall search strategies. Evaluation on a subset of the LEADSInstruct dataset demonstrates that the framework attains a 0.9 average recall. These results significantly exceed the performance of existing approaches. Error analysis further highlights the critical role of precise objective specification and terminological alignment in optimizing retrieval effectiveness. These findings confirm the capacity of LLM-based pipelines to yield transparent, reproducible, and high-performing search strategies, and highlight their potential as scalable instruments for supporting evidence synthesis and evidence-based practice.</description>

      <title>Linear-PAL: A Lightweight Ranker for Mitigating Shortcut Learning in Personalized, High-Bias Tabular Ranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In e-commerce ranking, implicit user feedback is systematically confounded by Position Bias -- the strong propensity of users to interact with top-ranked items regardless of relevance. While Deep Learning architectures (e.g., Two-Tower Networks) are the standard solution for de-biasing, we demonstrate that in High-Bias Regimes, state-of-the-art Deep Ensembles suffer from Shortcut Learning: they minimize training loss by overfitting to the rank signal, leading to degraded ranking quality despite high prediction accuracy. We propose Linear Position-bias Aware Learning (Linear-PAL), a lightweight framework that enforces de-biasing through structural constraints: explicit feature conjunctions and aggressive regularization. We further introduce a Vectorized Integer Hashing technique for feature generation, replacing string-based operations with $O(N)$ vectorized arithmetic. Evaluating on a large-scale dataset (4.2M samples), Linear-PAL achieves Pareto Dominance: it outperforms Deep Ensembles in de-biased ranking quality (Relevance AUC: 0.7626 vs. 0.6736) while reducing training latency by 43x (40s vs 1762s). This computational efficiency enables high-frequency retraining, allowing the system to capture user-specific emerging market trends and deliver robust, personalized ranking in near real-time.</description>

      <title>AI-assisted Protocol Information Extraction For Improved Accuracy and Efficiency in Clinical Trial Workflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increasing clinical trial protocol complexity, amendments, and challenges around knowledge management create significant burden for trial teams. Structuring protocol content into standard formats has the potential to improve efficiency, support documentation quality, and strengthen compliance. We evaluate an Artificial Intelligence (AI) system using generative LLMs with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for automated clinical trial protocol information extraction. We compare the extraction accuracy of our clinical-trial-specific RAG process against that of publicly available (standalone) LLMs. We also assess the operational impact of AI-assistance on simulated extraction CRC workflows. Our RAG process was measured as more accurate (87.8%) than standalone LLMs with fine-tuned prompts (62.6%) against expert-supported reference annotations. In the simulated extraction workflows, AI-assisted tasks were completed 40% faster, rated as less cognitively demanding and strongly preferred by users. While expert oversight remains essential, this suggests that AI-assisted extraction can enable protocol intelligence at scale, motivating the integration of similar methodologies into real world clinical workflows to further validate its impact on feasibility, study start-up, and post-activation monitoring.</description>

      <title>SPARC-RAG: Adaptive Sequential-Parallel Scaling with Context Management for Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) grounds large language model outputs in external evidence, but remains challenged on multi-hop question answering that requires long reasoning. Recent works scale RAG at inference time along two complementary dimensions: sequential depth for iterative refinement and parallel width for coverage expansion. However, naive scaling causes context contamination and scaling inefficiency, leading to diminishing or negative returns despite increased computation. To address these limitations, we propose SPARC-RAG, a multi-agent framework that coordinates sequential and parallel inference-time scaling under a unified context management mechanism. SPARC-RAG employs specialized agents that maintain a shared global context and provide explicit control over the scaling process. It generates targeted, complementary sub-queries for each branch to enable diverse parallel exploration, and explicitly regulates exiting decisions based on answer correctness and evidence grounding. To optimize scaling behavior, we further introduce a lightweight fine-tuning method with process-level verifiable preferences, which improves the efficiency of sequential scaling and effectiveness of parallel scaling. Across single- and multi-hop QA benchmarks, SPARC-RAG consistently outperforms previous RAG baselines, yielding an average +6.2 F1 improvement under lower inference cost.</description>

      <title>RAGRouter-Bench: A Dataset and Benchmark for Adaptive RAG Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a core paradigm for grounding large language models with external knowledge. Despite extensive efforts exploring diverse retrieval strategies, existing studies predominantly focus on query-side complexity or isolated method improvements, lacking a systematic understanding of how RAG paradigms behave across different query-corpus contexts and effectiveness-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce RAGRouter-Bench, the first dataset and benchmark designed for adaptive RAG routing. RAGRouter-Bench revisits retrieval from a query-corpus compatibility perspective and standardizes five representative RAG paradigms for systematic evaluation across 7,727 queries and 21,460 documents spanning diverse domains. The benchmark incorporates three canonical query types together with fine-grained semantic and structural corpus metrics, as well as a unified evaluation for both generation quality and resource consumption. Experiments with DeepSeek-V3 and LLaMA-3.1-8B demonstrate that no single RAG paradigm is universally optimal, that paradigm applicability is strongly shaped by query-corpus interactions, and that increased advanced mechanism does not necessarily yield better effectiveness-efficiency trade-offs. These findings underscore the necessity of routing-aware evaluation and establish a foundation for adaptive, interpretable, and generalizable next-generation RAG systems.</description>

      <title>Equity vs. Equality: Optimizing Ranking Fairness for Tailored Provider Needs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ranking plays a central role in connecting users and providers in Information Retrieval (IR) systems, making provider-side fairness an important challenge. While recent research has begun to address fairness in ranking, most existing approaches adopt an equality-based perspective, aiming to ensure that providers with similar content receive similar exposure. However, it overlooks the diverse needs of real-world providers, whose utility from ranking may depend not only on exposure but also on outcomes like sales or engagement. Consequently, exposure-based fairness may not accurately capture the true utility perceived by different providers with varying priorities. To this end, we introduce an equity-oriented fairness framework that explicitly models each provider's preferences over key outcomes such as exposure and sales, thus evaluating whether a ranking algorithm can fulfill these individualized goals while maintaining overall fairness across providers. Based on this framework, we develop EquityRank, a gradient-based algorithm that jointly optimizes user-side effectiveness and provider-side equity. Extensive offline and online simulations demonstrate that EquityRank offers improved trade-offs between effectiveness and fairness and adapts to heterogeneous provider needs.</description>

      <title>Towards Sample-Efficient and Stable Reinforcement Learning for LLM-based Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00632</link>

Abstract: While Long Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) reasoning has shown promise in Large Language Models (LLMs), its adoption for enhancing recommendation quality is growing rapidly. In this work, we critically examine this trend and argue that Long CoT is inherently ill-suited for the sequential recommendation domain. We attribute this misalignment to two primary factors: excessive inference latency and the lack of explicit cognitive reasoning patterns in user behavioral data. Driven by these observations, we propose pivoting away from the CoT structure to directly leverage its underlying mechanism: Reinforcement Learning (RL), to explore the item space. However, applying RL directly faces significant obstacles, notably low sample efficiency-where most actions fail to provide learning signals-and training instability. To overcome these limitations, we propose RISER, a novel Reinforced Item Space Exploration framework for Recommendation. RISER is designed to transform non-learnable trajectories into effective pairwise preference data for optimization. Furthermore, it incorporates specific strategies to ensure stability, including the prevention of redundant rollouts and the constraint of token-level update magnitudes. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that RISER significantly outperforms competitive baselines, establishing a robust paradigm for RL-enhanced LLM recommendation. Our code will be available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/RISER/.</description>

      <title>RecGOAT: Graph Optimal Adaptive Transport for LLM-Enhanced Multimodal Recommendation with Dual Semantic Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal recommendation systems typically integrates user behavior with multimodal data from items, thereby capturing more accurate user preferences. Concurrently, with the rise of large models (LMs), multimodal recommendation is increasingly leveraging their strengths in semantic understanding and contextual reasoning. However, LM representations are inherently optimized for general semantic tasks, while recommendation models rely heavily on sparse user/item unique identity (ID) features. Existing works overlook the fundamental representational divergence between large models and recommendation systems, resulting in incompatible multimodal representations and suboptimal recommendation performance. To bridge this gap, we propose RecGOAT, a novel yet simple dual semantic alignment framework for LLM-enhanced multimodal recommendation, which offers theoretically guaranteed alignment capability. RecGOAT first employs graph attention networks to enrich collaborative semantics by modeling item-item, user-item, and user-user relationships, leveraging user/item LM representations and interaction history. Furthermore, we design a dual-granularity progressive multimodality-ID alignment framework, which achieves instance-level and distribution-level semantic alignment via cross-modal contrastive learning (CMCL) and optimal adaptive transport (OAT), respectively. Theoretically, we demonstrate that the unified representations derived from our alignment framework exhibit superior semantic consistency and comprehensiveness. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks show that our RecGOAT achieves state-of-the-art performance, empirically validating our theoretical insights. Additionally, the deployment on a large-scale online advertising platform confirms the model's effectiveness and scalability in industrial recommendation scenarios.

      <title>SWGCN: Synergy Weighted Graph Convolutional Network for Multi-Behavior Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-behavior recommendation paradigms have emerged to capture diverse user activities, forecasting primary conversions (e.g., purchases) by leveraging secondary signals like browsing history. However, current graph-based methods often overlook cross-behavioral synergistic signals and fine-grained intensity of individual actions. Motivated by the need to overcome these shortcomings, we introduce Synergy Weighted Graph Convolutional Network (SWGCN). SWGCN introduces two novel components: a Target Preference Weigher, which adaptively assigns weights to user-item interactions within each behavior, and a Synergy Alignment Task, which guides its training by leveraging an Auxiliary Preference Valuator. This task prioritizes interactions from synergistic signals that more accurately reflect user preferences. The performance of our model is rigorously evaluated through comprehensive tests on three open-source datasets, specifically Taobao, IJCAI, and Beibei. On the Taobao dataset, SWGCN yields relative gains of 112.49% and 156.36% in terms of Hit Ratio (HR) and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), respectively. It also yields consistent gains on IJCAI and Beibei, confirming its robustness and generalizability across various datasets. Our implementation is open-sourced and can be accessed via https://github.com/FangdChen/SWGCN.</description>

      <title>Towards Trustworthy Multimodal Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal recommendation have demonstrated the effectiveness of incorporating visual and textual content into collaborative filtering. However, real-world deployments raise an increasingly important yet underexplored issue: trustworthiness. On modern e-commerce platforms, multimodal content can be misleading or unreliable (e.g., visually inconsistent product images or click-bait titles), injecting untrustworthy signals into multimodal representations and making existing recommenders brittle under modality corruption. In this work, we take a step towards trustworthy multimodal recommendation from both a method and an analysis perspective. First, we propose a plug-and-play modality-level rectification component that mitigates untrustworthy modality features by learning soft correspondences between items and multimodal features. Using lightweight projections and Sinkhorn-based soft matching, the rectification suppresses mismatched modality signals while preserving semantic consistency, and can be integrated into existing multimodal recommenders without architectural modifications. Second, we present two practical insights on interaction-level trustworthiness under noisy collaborative signals: (i) training-set pseudo interactions can help or hurt performance under noise depending on prior-signal alignment; and (ii) propagation-graph pseudo edges can also help or hurt robustness, as message passing may amplify misalignment. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and backbones under varying corruption levels demonstrate improved robustness from modality rectification and validate the above interaction-level observations.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Retrieval Components for a Shared Backbone via Component-Wise Multi-Stage Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in embedding-based retrieval have enabled dense retrievers to serve as core infrastructure in many industrial systems, where a single retrieval backbone is often shared across multiple downstream applications. In such settings, retrieval quality directly constrains system performance and extensibility, while coupling model selection, deployment, and rollback decisions across applications.
  In this paper, we present empirical findings and a system-level solution for optimizing retrieval components deployed as a shared backbone in production legal retrieval systems. We adopt a multi-stage optimization framework for dense retrievers and rerankers, and show that different retrieval components exhibit stage-dependent trade-offs. These observations motivate a component-wise, mixed-stage configuration rather than relying on a single uniformly optimal checkpoint. The resulting backbone is validated through end-to-end evaluation and deployed as a shared retrieval service supporting multiple industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Unifying Ranking and Generation in Query Auto-Completion via Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Multi-Objective Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Query Auto-Completion (QAC) suggests query completions as users type, helping them articulate intent and reach results more efficiently. Existing approaches face fundamental challenges: traditional retrieve-and-rank pipelines have limited long-tail coverage and require extensive feature engineering, while recent generative methods suffer from hallucination and safety risks. We present a unified framework that reformulates QAC as end-to-end list generation through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and multi-objective Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Our approach combines three key innovations: (1) reformulating QAC as end-to-end list generation with multi-objective optimization; (2) defining and deploying a suite of rule-based, model-based, and LLM-as-judge verifiers for QAC, and using them in a comprehensive methodology that combines RAG, multi-objective DPO, and iterative critique-revision for high-quality synthetic data; (3) a hybrid serving architecture enabling efficient production deployment under strict latency constraints. Evaluation on a large-scale commercial search platform demonstrates substantial improvements: offline metrics show gains across all dimensions, human evaluation yields +0.40 to +0.69 preference scores, and a controlled online experiment achieves 5.44\% reduction in keystrokes and 3.46\% increase in suggestion adoption, validating that unified generation with RAG and multi-objective alignment provides an effective solution for production QAC. This work represents a paradigm shift to end-to-end generation powered by large language models, RAG, and multi-objective alignment, establishing a production-validated framework that can benefit the broader search and recommendation industry.</description>

      <title>GRAB: An LLM-Inspired Sequence-First Click-Through Rate Prediction Modeling Paradigm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs) face increasing bottlenecks in performance and efficiency, often struggling with generalization and long-sequence modeling. Inspired by the scaling success of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose Generative Ranking for Ads at Baidu (GRAB), an end-to-end generative framework for Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction. GRAB integrates a novel Causal Action-aware Multi-channel Attention (CamA) mechanism to effectively capture temporal dynamics and specific action signals within user behavior sequences. Full-scale online deployment demonstrates that GRAB significantly outperforms established DLRMs, delivering a 3.05% increase in revenue and a 3.49% rise in CTR. Furthermore, the model demonstrates desirable scaling behavior: its expressive power shows a monotonic and approximately linear improvement as longer interaction sequences are utilized.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Quality-Diversity Trade-offs for Large-Scale Batch Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A core research question in recommender systems is to propose batches of highly relevant and diverse items, that is, items personalized to the user's preferences, but which also might get the user out of their comfort zone. This diversity might induce properties of serendipidity and novelty which might increase user engagement or revenue. However, many real-life problems arise in that case: e.g., avoiding to recommend distinct but too similar items to reduce the churn risk, and computational cost for large item libraries, up to millions of items. First, we consider the case when the user feedback model is perfectly observed and known in advance, and introduce an efficient algorithm called B-DivRec combining determinantal point processes and a fuzzy denuding procedure to adjust the degree of item diversity. This helps enforcing a quality-diversity trade-off throughout the user history. Second, we propose an approach to adaptively tailor the quality-diversity trade-off to the user, so that diversity in recommendations can be enhanced if it leads to positive feedback, and vice-versa. Finally, we illustrate the performance and versatility of B-DivRec in the two settings on synthetic and real-life data sets on movie recommendation and drug repurposing.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Generative Recommender Tokenizer: Recsys-Native Encoding and Semantic Quantization Beyond LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic ID (SID)-based recommendation is a promising paradigm for scaling sequential recommender systems, but existing methods largely follow a semantic-centric pipeline: item embeddings are learned from foundation models and discretized using generic quantization schemes. This design is misaligned with generative recommendation objectives: semantic embeddings are weakly coupled with collaborative prediction, and generic quantization is inefficient at reducing sequential uncertainty for autoregressive modeling. To address these, we propose ReSID, a recommendation-native, principled SID framework that rethinks representation learning and quantization from the perspective of information preservation and sequential predictability, without relying on LLMs. ReSID consists of two components: (i) Field-Aware Masked Auto-Encoding (FAMAE), which learns predictive-sufficient item representations from structured features, and (ii) Globally Aligned Orthogonal Quantization (GAOQ), which produces compact and predictable SID sequences by jointly reducing semantic ambiguity and prefix-conditional uncertainty. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments across ten datasets show the effectiveness of ReSID. ReSID consistently outperforms strong sequential and SID-based generative baselines by an average of over 10%, while reducing tokenization cost by up to 122x.

      <title>RANKVIDEO: Reasoning Reranking for Text-to-Video Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reranking is a critical component of modern retrieval systems, which typically pair an efficient first-stage retriever with a more expressive model to refine results. While large reasoning models have driven rapid progress in text-centric reranking, reasoning-based reranking for video retrieval remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce RANKVIDEO, a reasoning-based reranker for video retrieval that explicitly reasons over query-video pairs using video content to assess relevance. RANKVIDEO is trained using a two-stage curriculum consisting of perception-grounded supervised fine-tuning followed by reranking training that combines pointwise, pairwise, and teacher confidence distillation objectives, and is supported by a data synthesis pipeline for constructing reasoning-intensive query-video pairs. Experiments on the large-scale MultiVENT 2.0 benchmark demonstrate that RANKVIDEO consistently improves retrieval performance within a two-stage framework, yielding an average improvement of 31% on nDCG@10 and outperforming text-only and vision-language reranking alternatives, while more efficient.</description>

      <title>Culinary Crossroads: A RAG Framework for Enhancing Diversity in Cross-Cultural Recipe Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In cross-cultural recipe adaptation, the goal is not only to ensure cultural appropriateness and retain the original dish's essence, but also to provide diverse options for various dietary needs and preferences. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a promising approach, combining the retrieval of real recipes from the target cuisine for cultural adaptability with large language models (LLMs) for relevance. However, it remains unclear whether RAG can generate diverse adaptation results. Our analysis shows that RAG tends to overly rely on a limited portion of the context across generations, failing to produce diverse outputs even when provided with varied contextual inputs. This reveals a key limitation of RAG in creative tasks with multiple valid answers: it fails to leverage contextual diversity for generating varied responses. To address this issue, we propose CARRIAGE, a plug-and-play RAG framework for cross-cultural recipe adaptation that enhances diversity in both retrieval and context organization. To our knowledge, this is the first RAG framework that explicitly aims to generate highly diverse outputs to accommodate multiple user preferences. Our experiments show that CARRIAGE achieves Pareto efficiency in terms of diversity and quality of recipe adaptation compared to closed-book LLMs.</description>

      <title>PPoGA: Predictive Plan-on-Graph with Action for Knowledge Graph Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) augmented with Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have advanced complex question answering, yet they often remain susceptible to failure when their initial high-level reasoning plan is flawed. This limitation, analogous to cognitive functional fixedness, prevents agents from restructuring their approach, leading them to pursue unworkable solutions. To address this, we propose PPoGA (Predictive Plan-on-Graph with Action), a novel KGQA framework inspired by human cognitive control and problem-solving. PPoGA incorporates a Planner-Executor architecture to separate high-level strategy from low-level execution and leverages a Predictive Processing mechanism to anticipate outcomes. The core innovation of our work is a self-correction mechanism that empowers the agent to perform not only Path Correction for local execution errors but also Plan Correction by identifying, discarding, and reformulating the entire plan when it proves ineffective. We conduct extensive experiments on three challenging multi-hop KGQA benchmarks: GrailQA, CWQ, and WebQSP. The results demonstrate that PPoGA achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing methods. Our work highlights the critical importance of metacognitive abilities like problem restructuring for building more robust and flexible AI reasoning systems.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Electronic Health Records: A Hybrid Graph RAG Approach to Safe Clinical AI for Patient QA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic health record (EHR) systems present clinicians with vast repositories of clinical information, creating a significant cognitive burden where critical details are easily overlooked. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer transformative potential for data processing, they face significant limitations in clinical settings, particularly regarding context grounding and hallucinations. Current solutions typically isolate retrieval methods focusing either on structured data (SQL/Cypher) or unstructured semantic search but fail to integrate both simultaneously. This work presents MediGRAF (Medical Graph Retrieval Augmented Framework), a novel hybrid Graph RAG system that bridges this gap. By uniquely combining Neo4j Text2Cypher capabilities for structured relationship traversal with vector embeddings for unstructured narrative retrieval, MediGRAF enables natural language querying of the complete patient journey. Using 10 patients from the MIMIC-IV dataset (generating 5,973 nodes and 5,963 relationships), we generated enough nodes and data for patient level question answering (QA), and we evaluated this architecture across varying query complexities. The system demonstrated 100\% recall for factual queries which means all relevant information was retrieved and in the output, while complex inference tasks achieved a mean expert quality score of 4.25/5 with zero safety violations. These results demonstrate that hybrid graph-grounding significantly advances clinical information retrieval, offering a safer, more comprehensive alternative to standard LLM deployments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present OGD4All, a transparent, auditable, and reproducible framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance citizens' interaction with geospatial Open Government Data (OGD). The system combines semantic data retrieval, agentic reasoning for iterative code generation, and secure sandboxed execution that produces verifiable multimodal outputs. Evaluated on a 199-question benchmark covering both factual and unanswerable questions, across 430 City-of-Zurich datasets and 11 LLMs, OGD4All reaches 98% analytical correctness and 94% recall while reliably rejecting questions unsupported by available data, which minimizes hallucination risks. Statistical robustness tests, as well as expert feedback, show reliability and social relevance. The proposed approach shows how LLMs can provide explainable, multimodal access to public data, advancing trustworthy AI for open governance.</description>

      <title>First Steps, Lasting Impact: Platform-Aware Forensics for the Next Generation of Analysts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reliability of cyber forensic evidence acquisition is strongly influenced by the underlying operating systems, Windows, macOS, and Linux - due to inherent variations in file system structures, encryption protocols, and forensic tool compatibility. Disk forensics, one of the most widely used techniques in digital investigations, faces distinct obstacles on each platform. Windows, with its predominantly NTFS and FAT file systems, typically supports reliable disk imaging and analysis through established tools such as FTK Imager and Autopsy/Sleuth Kit. However, encryption features frequently pose challenges to evidence acquisition. Conversely, Linux environments, which rely on file systems like ext4 and XFS, generally offer greater transparency, yet the transient nature of log retention often complicates forensic analysis. In instances where anti-forensic strategies such as encryption and compression render traditional disk forensics insufficient, memory forensics becomes crucial. While memory forensic methodologies demonstrate robustness across Windows and Linux platforms forms through frameworks like Volatility, platform-specific difficulties persist. Memory analysis on Linux systems benefits from tools like LiME, snapshot utilities, and dd for memory acquisition; nevertheless, live memory acquisition on Linux can still present challenges. This research systematically assesses both disk and memory forensic acquisition techniques across samples representing Windows and Linux systems. By identifying effective combinations of forensic tools and configurations tailored to each operating system, the study aims to improve the accuracy and reliability of evidence collection. It further evaluates current forensic tools and highlights a persistent gap: consistently assuring forensic input reliability and footprint integrity.</description>

      <title>Audio-to-Image Bird Species Retrieval without Audio-Image Pairs via Text Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-to-image retrieval offers an interpretable alternative to audio-only classification for bioacoustic species recognition, but learning aligned audio-image representations is challenging due to the scarcity of paired audio-image data. We propose a simple and data-efficient approach that enables audio-to-image retrieval without any audio-image supervision. Our proposed method uses text as a semantic intermediary: we distill the text embedding space of a pretrained image-text model (BioCLIP-2), which encodes rich visual and taxonomic structure, into a pretrained audio-text model (BioLingual) by fine-tuning its audio encoder with a contrastive objective. This distillation transfers visually grounded semantics into the audio representation, inducing emergent alignment between audio and image embeddings without using images during training. We evaluate the resulting model on multiple bioacoustic benchmarks. The distilled audio encoder preserves audio discriminative power while substantially improving audio-text alignment on focal recordings and soundscape datasets. Most importantly, on the SSW60 benchmark, the proposed approach achieves strong audio-to-image retrieval performance exceeding baselines based on zero-shot model combinations or learned mappings between text embeddings, despite not training on paired audio-image data. These results demonstrate that indirect semantic transfer through text is sufficient to induce meaningful audio-image alignment, providing a practical solution for visually grounded species recognition in data-scarce bioacoustic settings.</description>

      <title>From Prompt to Graph: Comparing LLM-Based Information Extraction Strategies in Domain-Specific Ontology Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ontologies are essential for structuring domain knowledge, improving accessibility, sharing, and reuse. However, traditional ontology construction relies on manual annotation and conventional natural language processing (NLP) techniques, making the process labour-intensive and costly, especially in specialised fields like casting manufacturing. The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers new possibilities for automating knowledge extraction. This study investigates three LLM-based approaches, including pre-trained LLM-driven method, in-context learning (ICL) method and fine-tuning method to extract terms and relations from domain-specific texts using limited data. We compare their performances and use the best-performing method to build a casting ontology that validated by domian expert.</description>

      <title>Temporal Leakage in Search-Engine Date-Filtered Web Retrieval: A Case Study from Retrospective Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Search-engine date filters are widely used to enforce pre-cutoff retrieval in retrospective evaluations of search-augmented forecasters. We show this approach is unreliable: auditing Google Search with a before: filter, 71% of questions return at least one page containing strong post-cutoff leakage, and for 41%, at least one page directly reveals the answer. Using a large language model (LLM), gpt-oss-120b, to forecast with these leaky documents, we demonstrate an inflated prediction accuracy (Brier score 0.108 vs. 0.242 with leak-free documents). We characterize common leakage mechanisms, including updated articles, related-content modules, unreliable metadata/timestamps, and absence-based signals, and argue that date-restricted search is insufficient for temporal evaluation. We recommend stronger retrieval safeguards or evaluation on frozen, time-stamped web snapshots to ensure credible retrospective forecasting.</description>

      <title>SpeechLess: Micro-utterance with Personalized Spatial Memory-aware Assistant in Everyday Augmented Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speaking aloud to a wearable AR assistant in public can be socially awkward, and re-articulating the same requests every day creates unnecessary effort. We present SpeechLess, a wearable AR assistant that introduces a speech-based intent granularity control paradigm grounded in personalized spatial memory. SpeechLess helps users "speak less," while still obtaining the information they need, and supports gradual explicitation of intent when more complex expression is required. SpeechLess binds prior interactions to multimodal personal context-space, time, activity, and referents-to form spatial memories, and leverages them to extrapolate missing intent dimensions from under-specified user queries. This enables users to dynamically adjust how explicitly they express their informational needs, from full-utterance to micro/zero-utterance interaction. We motivate our design through a week-long formative study using a commercial smart glasses platform, revealing discomfort with public voice use, frustration with repetitive speech, and hardware constraints. Building on these insights, we design SpeechLess, and evaluate it through controlled lab and in-the-wild studies. Our results indicate that regulated speech-based interaction, can improve everyday information access, reduce articulation effort, and support socially acceptable use without substantially degrading perceived usability or intent resolution accuracy across diverse everyday environments.</description>

      <title>Unifying Adversarial Robustness and Training Across Text Scoring Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research on adversarial robustness in language models is currently fragmented across applications and attacks, obscuring shared vulnerabilities. In this work, we propose unifying the study of adversarial robustness in text scoring models spanning dense retrievers, rerankers, and reward models. This motivates adapting both attacks and adversarial training methods across model roles. Unlike open-ended generation, text scoring failures are directly testable: an attack succeeds when an irrelevant or rejected text outscores a relevant or chosen one. Using this principled lens of text scoring, we demonstrate that current adversarial training formulations for language models are often short-sighted, failing to effectively generalize across attacks. To address this, we introduce multiple adversarial training methods for text scoring models and show that combining complementary training methods can yield strong robustness while also improving task effectiveness. We also highlight the practical value of our approach for RLHF, showing that our adversarially trained reward models mitigate reward hacking and support the training of better-aligned LLMs. We provide our code and models for further study.</description>

      <title>Domain-Adaptive and Scalable Dense Retrieval for Content-Based Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: E-commerce recommendation and search commonly rely on sparse keyword matching (e.g., BM25), which breaks down under vocabulary mismatch when user intent has limited lexical overlap with product metadata. We cast content-based recommendation as recommendation-as-retrieval: given a natural-language intent signal (a query or review), retrieve the top-K most relevant items from a large catalog via semantic similarity.
  We present a scalable dense retrieval system based on a two-tower bi-encoder, fine-tuned on the Amazon Reviews 2023 (Fashion) subset using supervised contrastive learning with Multiple Negatives Ranking Loss. We construct training pairs from review text (as a query proxy) and item metadata (as the positive document) and fine-tune on 50,000 sampled interactions with a maximum sequence length of 500 tokens.
  For efficient serving, we combine FAISS HNSW indexing with an ONNX Runtime inference pipeline using INT8 dynamic quantization. On a review-to-title benchmark over 826,402 catalog items, our approach improves Recall@10 from 0.26 (BM25) to 0.66, while meeting practical latency and model-size constraints: 6.1 ms median CPU inference latency (batch size 1) and a 4x reduction in model size.
  Overall, we provide an end-to-end, reproducible blueprint for taking domain-adapted dense retrieval from offline training to CPU-efficient serving at catalog scale.</description>

      <title>Inferential Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite extensive research on a wide range of question answering (QA) systems, most existing work focuses on answer containment-i.e., assuming that answers can be directly extracted and/or generated from documents in the corpus. However, some questions require inference, i.e., deriving answers that are not explicitly stated but can be inferred from the available information. We introduce Inferential QA -- a new task that challenges models to infer answers from answer-supporting passages which provide only clues. To study this problem, we construct QUIT (QUestions requiring Inference from Texts) dataset, comprising 7,401 questions and 2.4M passages built from high-convergence human- and machine-authored hints, labeled across three relevance levels using LLM-based answerability and human verification. Through comprehensive evaluation of retrievers, rerankers, and LLM-based readers, we show that methods effective on traditional QA tasks struggle in inferential QA: retrievers underperform, rerankers offer limited gains, and fine-tuning provides inconsistent improvements. Even reasoning-oriented LLMs fail to outperform smaller general-purpose models. These findings reveal that current QA pipelines are not yet ready for inference-based reasoning. Inferential QA thus establishes a new class of QA tasks that move towards understanding and reasoning from indirect textual evidence.</description>

      <title>PARSE: An Open-Domain Reasoning Question Answering Benchmark for Persian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reasoning-focused Question Answering (QA) has advanced rapidly with Large Language Models (LLMs), yet high-quality benchmarks for low-resource languages remain scarce. Persian, spoken by roughly 130 million people, lacks a comprehensive open-domain resource for evaluating reasoning-capable QA systems. We introduce PARSE, the first open-domain Persian reasoning QA benchmark, containing 10,800 questions across Boolean, multiple-choice, and factoid formats, with diverse reasoning types, difficulty levels, and answer structures. The benchmark is built via a controlled LLM-based generation pipeline and validated through human evaluation. We also ensure linguistic and factual quality through multi-stage filtering, annotation, and consistency checks. We benchmark multilingual and Persian LLMs under multiple prompting strategies and show that Persian prompts and structured prompting (CoT for Boolean/multiple-choice; few-shot for factoid) improve performance. Fine-tuning further boosts results, especially for Persian-specialized models. These findings highlight how PARSE supports both fair comparison and practical model adaptation. PARSE fills a critical gap in Persian QA research and provides a strong foundation for developing and evaluating reasoning-capable LLMs in low-resource settings.</description>

      <title>The Algorithmic Self-Portrait: Deconstructing Memory in ChatGPT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To enable personalized and context-aware interactions, conversational AI systems have introduced a new mechanism: Memory. Memory creates what we refer to as the Algorithmic Self-portrait - a new form of personalization derived from users' self-disclosed information divulged within private conversations. While memory enables more coherent exchanges, the underlying processes of memory creation remain opaque, raising critical questions about data sensitivity, user agency, and the fidelity of the resulting portrait.
  To bridge this research gap, we analyze 2,050 memory entries from 80 real-world ChatGPT users. Our analyses reveal three key findings: (1) A striking 96% of memories in our dataset are created unilaterally by the conversational system, potentially shifting agency away from the user; (2) Memories, in our dataset, contain a rich mix of GDPR-defined personal data (in 28% memories) along with psychological insights about participants (in 52% memories); and (3)~A significant majority of the memories (84%) are directly grounded in user context, indicating faithful representation of the conversations. Finally, we introduce a framework-Attribution Shield-that anticipates these inferences, alerts about potentially sensitive memory inferences, and suggests query reformulations to protect personal information without sacrificing utility.</description>

      <title>LLM-based Embeddings: Attention Values Encode Sentence Semantics Better Than Hidden States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sentence representations are foundational to many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications. While recent methods leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to derive sentence representations, most rely on final-layer hidden states, which are optimized for next-token prediction and thus often fail to capture global, sentence-level semantics. This paper introduces a novel perspective, demonstrating that attention value vectors capture sentence semantics more effectively than hidden states. We propose Value Aggregation (VA), a simple method that pools token values across multiple layers and token indices. In a training-free setting, VA outperforms other LLM-based embeddings, even matches or surpasses the ensemble-based MetaEOL. Furthermore, we demonstrate that when paired with suitable prompts, the layer attention outputs can be interpreted as aligned weighted value vectors. Specifically, the attention scores of the last token function as the weights, while the output projection matrix ($W_O$) aligns these weighted value vectors with the common space of the LLM residual stream. This refined method, termed Aligned Weighted VA (AlignedWVA), achieves state-of-the-art performance among training-free LLM-based embeddings, outperforming the high-cost MetaEOL by a substantial margin. Finally, we highlight the potential of obtaining strong LLM embedding models through fine-tuning Value Aggregation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional bibliography databases require users to navigate search forms and manually copy citation data. Language models offer an alternative: a natural-language interface where researchers write text with informal citation fragments, which are automatically resolved to proper references. However, language models are not reliable for scholarly work as they generate fabricated (hallucinated) citations at substantial rates.
  We present an architectural approach that combines the natural-language interface of LLM chatbots with the accuracy of direct database access, implemented through the Model Context Protocol. Our system enables language models to search bibliographic databases, perform fuzzy matching, and export verified entries, all through conversational interaction.
  A key architectural principle bypasses the language model during final data export: entries are fetched directly from authoritative sources, with timeout protection, to guarantee accuracy. We demonstrate this approach with MCP-DBLP, a server providing access to the DBLP computer science bibliography. The system transforms form-based bibliographic services into conversational assistants that maintain scholarly integrity. This architecture is adaptable to other bibliographic databases and academic data sources.</description>

Abstract: This scientometric study analyzes Avian Influenza research from 2014 to 2023 using bibliographic data from the Web of Science database. We examined publication trends, sources, authorship, collaborative networks, document types, and geographical distribution to gain insights into the global research landscape. Results reveal a steady increase in publications, with high contributions from Chinese and American institutions. Journals such as PLoS One and the Journal of Virology published the highest number of studies, indicating their influence in this field. The most prolific institutions include the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the University of Hong Kong, while the College of Veterinary Medicine at South China Agricultural University emerged as the most productive department. China and the USA lead in publication volume, though developed nations like the United Kingdom and Germany exhibit a higher rate of international collaboration. "Articles" are the most common document type, constituting 84.6% of the total, while "Reviews" account for 7.6%. This study provides a comprehensive view of global trends in Avian Influenza research, emphasizing the need for collaborative efforts across borders.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Hierarchical Decomposition for Structure-Aware Table Understanding with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex tables with multi-level headers, merged cells and heterogeneous layouts pose persistent challenges for LLMs in both understanding and reasoning. Existing approaches typically rely on table linearization or normalized grid modeling. However, these representations struggle to explicitly capture hierarchical structures and cross-dimensional dependencies, which can lead to misalignment between structural semantics and textual representations for non-standard tables. To address this issue, we propose an Orthogonal Hierarchical Decomposition (OHD) framework that constructs structure-preserving input representations of complex tables for LLMs. OHD introduces an Orthogonal Tree Induction (OTI) method based on spatial--semantic co-constraints, which decomposes irregular tables into a column tree and a row tree to capture vertical and horizontal hierarchical dependencies, respectively. Building on this representation, we design a dual-pathway association protocol to symmetrically reconstruct semantic lineage of each cell, and incorporate an LLM as a semantic arbitrator to align multi-level semantic information. We evaluate OHD framework on two complex table question answering benchmarks, AITQA and HiTab. Experimental results show that OHD consistently outperforms existing representation paradigms across multiple evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>Deep learning enables urban change profiling through alignment of historical maps</title>

Abstract: Prior to modern Earth observation technologies, historical maps provide a unique record of long-term urban transformation and offer a lens on the evolving identity of cities. However, extracting consistent and fine-grained change information from historical map series remains challenging due to spatial misalignment, cartographic variation, and degrading document quality, limiting most analyses to small-scale or qualitative approaches. We propose a fully automated, deep learning-based framework for fine-grained urban change analysis from large collections of historical maps, built on a modular design that integrates dense map alignment, multi-temporal object detection, and change profiling. This framework shifts the analysis of historical maps from ad hoc visual comparison toward systematic, quantitative characterization of urban change. Experiments demonstrate the robust performance of the proposed alignment and object detection methods. Applied to Paris between 1868 and 1937, the framework reveals the spatial and temporal heterogeneity in urban transformation, highlighting its relevance for research in the social sciences and humanities. The modular design of our framework further supports adaptation to diverse cartographic contexts and downstream applications.</description>

      <title>Towards AI Evaluation in Domain-Specific RAG Systems: The AgriHubi Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models show promise for knowledge-intensive domains, yet their use in agriculture is constrained by weak grounding, English-centric training data, and limited real-world evaluation. These issues are amplified for low-resource languages, where high-quality domain documentation exists but remains difficult to access through general-purpose models. This paper presents AgriHubi, a domain-adapted retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system for Finnish-language agricultural decision support. AgriHubi integrates Finnish agricultural documents with open PORO family models and combines explicit source grounding with user feedback to support iterative refinement. Developed over eight iterations and evaluated through two user studies, the system shows clear gains in answer completeness, linguistic accuracy, and perceived reliability. The results also reveal practical trade-offs between response quality and latency when deploying larger models. This study provides empirical guidance for designing and evaluating domain-specific RAG systems in low-resource language settings.</description>

      <title>Why Steering Works: Toward a Unified View of Language Model Parameter Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Methods for controlling large language models (LLMs), including local weight fine-tuning, LoRA-based adaptation, and activation-based interventions, are often studied in isolation, obscuring their connections and making comparison difficult. In this work, we present a unified view that frames these interventions as dynamic weight updates induced by a control signal, placing them within a single conceptual framework. Building on this view, we propose a unified preference-utility analysis that separates control effects into preference, defined as the tendency toward a target concept, and utility, defined as coherent and task-valid generation, and measures both on a shared log-odds scale using polarity-paired contrastive examples. Across methods, we observe a consistent trade-off between preference and utility: stronger control increases preference while predictably reducing utility. We further explain this behavior through an activation manifold perspective, in which control shifts representations along target-concept directions to enhance preference, while utility declines primarily when interventions push representations off the model's valid-generation manifold. Finally, we introduce a new steering approach SPLIT guided by this analysis that improves preference while better preserving utility. Code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyEdit/blob/main/examples/SPLIT.md.</description>

      <title>Trust by Design: Skill Profiles for Transparent, Cost-Aware LLM Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How should Large Language Model (LLM) practitioners select the right model for a task without wasting money? We introduce BELLA (Budget-Efficient LLM Selection via Automated skill-profiling), a framework that recommends optimal LLM selection for tasks through interpretable skill-based model selection. Standard benchmarks report aggregate metrics that obscure which specific capabilities a task requires and whether a cheaper model could suffice. BELLA addresses this gap through three stages: (1) decomposing LLM outputs and extract the granular skills required by using critic-based profiling, (2) clustering skills into structured capability matrices, and (3) multi-objective optimization to select the right models to maximize performance while respecting budget constraints. BELLA provides natural-language rationale for recommendations, providing transparency that current black-box routing systems lack. We describe the framework architecture, situate it within the landscape of LLM routing and evaluation, and discuss its application to financial reasoning as a representative domain exhibiting diverse skill requirements and cost-variation across models. Our framework enables practitioners to make principled and cost-performance trade-offs for deploying LLMs.</description>

      <title>Clarifying the Path to User Satisfaction: An Investigation into Clarification Usefulness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Clarifying questions are an integral component of modern information retrieval systems, directly impacting user satisfaction and overall system performance. Poorly formulated questions can lead to user frustration and confusion, negatively affecting the system's performance. This research addresses the urgent need to identify and leverage key features that contribute to the classification of clarifying questions, enhancing user satisfaction. To gain deeper insights into how different features influence user satisfaction, we conduct a comprehensive analysis, considering a broad spectrum of lexical, semantic, and statistical features, such as question length and sentiment polarity. Our empirical results provide three main insights into the qualities of effective query clarification: (1) specific questions are more effective than generic ones; (2) the subjectivity and emotional tone of a question play a role; and (3) shorter and more ambiguous queries benefit significantly from clarification. Based on these insights, we implement feature-integrated user satisfaction prediction using various classifiers, both traditional and neural-based, including random forest, BERT, and large language models. Our experiments show a consistent and significant improvement, particularly in traditional classifiers, with a minimum performance boost of 45\%. This study presents invaluable guidelines for refining the formulation of clarifying questions and enhancing both user satisfaction and system performance.</description>

      <title>Towards Next-Generation Recommender Systems: A Benchmark for Personalized Recommendation Assistant with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recommender systems (RecSys) are widely used across various modern digital platforms and have garnered significant attention. Traditional recommender systems usually focus only on fixed and simple recommendation scenarios, making it difficult to generalize to new and unseen recommendation tasks in an interactive paradigm. Recently, the advancement of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the foundational architecture of RecSys, driving their evolution into more intelligent and interactive personalized recommendation assistants. However, most existing studies rely on fixed task-specific prompt templates to generate recommendations and evaluate the performance of personalized assistants, which limits the comprehensive assessments of their capabilities. This is because commonly used datasets lack high-quality textual user queries that reflect real-world recommendation scenarios, making them unsuitable for evaluating LLM-based personalized recommendation assistants. To address this gap, we introduce RecBench+, a new dataset benchmark designed to access LLMs' ability to handle intricate user recommendation needs in the era of LLMs. RecBench+ encompasses a diverse set of queries that span both hard conditions and soft preferences, with varying difficulty levels. We evaluated commonly used LLMs on RecBench+ and uncovered below findings: 1) LLMs demonstrate preliminary abilities to act as recommendation assistants, 2) LLMs are better at handling queries with explicitly stated conditions, while facing challenges with queries that require reasoning or contain misleading information. Our dataset has been released at https://github.com/jiani-huang/RecBench.git.</description>

      <title>Curriculum Approximate Unlearning for Session-based Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Approximate unlearning for session-based recommendation refers to eliminating the influence of specific training samples from the recommender without retraining of (sub-)models. Gradient ascent (GA) is a representative method to conduct approximate unlearning. However, there still exist dual challenges to apply GA for session-based recommendation. On the one hand, naive applying of GA could lead to degradation of recommendation performance. On the other hand, existing studies fail to consider the ordering of unlearning samples when simultaneously processing multiple unlearning requests, leading to sub-optimal recommendation performance and unlearning effect. To address the above challenges, we introduce CAU, a curriculum approximate unlearning framework tailored to session-based recommendation. CAU handles the unlearning task with a GA term on unlearning samples. Specifically, to address the first challenge, CAU formulates the overall optimization task as a multi-objective optimization problem, where the GA term for unlearning samples is combined with retaining terms for preserving performance. The multi-objective optimization problem is solved through seeking the Pareto-Optimal solution, which achieves effective unlearning with trivial sacrifice on recommendation performance. To tackle the second challenge, CAU adopts a curriculum-based sequence to conduct unlearning on batches of unlearning samples. The key motivation is to perform unlearning from easy samples to harder ones. To this end, CAU first introduces two metrics to measure the unlearning difficulty, including gradient unlearning difficulty and embedding unlearning difficulty. Then, two strategies, hard-sampling and soft-sampling, are proposed to select unlearning samples according to difficulty scores.</description>

      <title>Towards Context-aware Reasoning-enhanced Generative Searching in E-commerce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16925v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Search-based recommendation is one of the most critical application scenarios in e-commerce platforms. Users' complex search contexts--such as spatiotemporal factors, historical interactions, and current query's information--constitute an essential part of their decision-making, reflecting implicit preferences that complement explicit query terms. Modeling such rich contextual signals and their intricate associations with candidate items remains a key challenge. Although numerous efforts have been devoted to building more effective search methods, existing approaches still show limitations in integrating contextual information, which hinders their ability to fully capture user intent.
  To address these challenges, we propose a context-aware reasoning-enhanced generative search framework for better \textbf{understanding the complicated context}. Specifically, the framework first unifies heterogeneous user and item contexts into textual representations or text-based semantic identifiers and aligns them. To overcome the lack of explicit reasoning trajectories, we introduce a self-evolving post-training paradigm that iteratively combines supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to progressively enhance the model's reasoning capability. In addition, we identify potential biases in existing RL algorithms when applied to search scenarios and present a debiased variant of GRPO to improve ranking performance. Extensive experiments on search log data collected from a real-world e-commerce platform demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance compared with strong baselines, validating its effectiveness for search-based recommendation.</description>

      <title>OneTrans: Unified Feature Interaction and Sequence Modeling with One Transformer in Industrial Recommender</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26104v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recommendation systems, scaling up feature-interaction modules (e.g., Wukong, RankMixer) or user-behavior sequence modules (e.g., LONGER) has achieved notable success. However, these efforts typically proceed on separate tracks, which not only hinders bidirectional information exchange but also prevents unified optimization and scaling. In this paper, we propose OneTrans, a unified Transformer backbone that simultaneously performs user-behavior sequence modeling and feature interaction. OneTrans employs a unified tokenizer to convert both sequential and non-sequential attributes into a single token sequence. The stacked OneTrans blocks share parameters across similar sequential tokens while assigning token-specific parameters to non-sequential tokens. Through causal attention and cross-request KV caching, OneTrans enables precomputation and caching of intermediate representations, significantly reducing computational costs during both training and inference. Experimental results on industrial-scale datasets demonstrate that OneTrans scales efficiently with increasing parameters, consistently outperforms strong baselines, and yields a 5.68% lift in per-user GMV in online A/B tests.</description>

      <title>MixLM: High-Throughput and Effective LLM Ranking via Text-Embedding Mix-Interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at capturing semantic nuances and therefore show impressive relevance ranking performance in modern recommendation and search systems. However, they suffer from high computational overhead under industrial latency and throughput requirements. In particular, cross-encoder ranking systems often create long context prefill-heavy workloads, as the model has to be presented with the user, query and item information. To this end, we propose MixLM, a novel LLM-based ranking framework, which significantly improves the system throughput via reducing the input context length, while preserving the semantic strength of cross-encoder rankers. In contrast to a standard ranking system where the context is presented to the model as pure text, we propose to use mix-interaction, a mixture of text and embedding tokens to represent the input. Specifically, MixLM encodes all items in the catalog into a few embedding tokens and stores in a nearline cache. The encoded item descriptions are used during online inference, effectively reducing the item length from a few thousand text tokens to a few embedding tokens. We share insights from deploying our MixLM framework to a real-world search application at LinkedIn, including a detailed discussion of our training pipelines, as well as a thorough analysis of our online serving infrastructure optimization. With the same latency budget and on-par relevance metrics, MixLM increased throughput by 10.0x comparing with strong baselines, 75.9x over full-text LLM rerankers. The efficiency gains delivered by MixLM enabled full-traffic deployment of LLM-powered search, which resulted in a significant 0.47\% increase in Daily Active Users (DAU) in online A/B tests.</description>

      <title>Evaluation on Entity Matching in Recommender Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entity matching is a crucial component in various recommender systems, including conversational recommender systems (CRS) and knowledge-based recommender systems. However, the lack of rigorous evaluation frameworks for cross-dataset entity matching impedes progress in areas such as LLM-driven conversational recommendations and knowledge-grounded dataset construction.
  In this paper, we introduce Reddit-Amazon-EM, a novel dataset comprising naturally occurring items from Reddit and the Amazon '23 dataset. Through careful manual annotation, we identify corresponding movies across Reddit-Movies and Amazon'23, two existing recommender system datasets with inherently overlapping catalogs. Leveraging Reddit-Amazon-EM, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art entity matching methods, including rule-based, graph-based, lexical-based, embedding-based, and LLM-based approaches.
  For reproducible research, we release our manually annotated entity matching gold set and provide the mapping between the two datasets using the best-performing method from our experiments. This serves as a valuable resource for advancing future work on entity matching in recommender systems.Data and Code are accessible at: https://github.com/huang-zihan/Reddit-Amazon-Entity-Matching.</description>

      <title>Towards Fair Large Language Model-based Recommender Systems without Costly Retraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Recommender Systems (RS) through advanced generative user modeling. However, LLM-based RS (LLM-RS) often inadvertently perpetuates bias present in the training data, leading to severe fairness issues. Addressing these fairness problems in LLM-RS faces two significant challenges. 1) Existing debiasing methods, designed for specific bias types, lack the generality to handle diverse or emerging biases in real-world applications. 2) Debiasing methods relying on retraining are computationally infeasible given the massive parameter scale of LLMs. To overcome these challenges, we propose FUDLR (Fast Unified Debiasing for LLM-RS). The core idea is to reformulate the debiasing problem as an efficient machine unlearning task with two stages. First, FUDLR identifies bias-inducing samples to unlearn through a novel bias-agnostic mask, optimized to balance fairness improvement with accuracy preservation. Its bias-agnostic design allows adaptability to various or co-existing biases simply by incorporating different fairness metrics. Second, FUDLR performs efficient debiasing by estimating and removing the influence of identified samples on model parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FUDLR effectively and efficiently improves fairness while preserving recommendation accuracy, offering a practical path toward socially responsible LLM-RS. The code and data are available at https://github.com/JinLi-i/FUDLR.</description>

      <title>S$^2$GR: Stepwise Semantic-Guided Reasoning in Latent Space for Generative Recommendation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative Recommendation (GR) has emerged as a transformative paradigm with its end-to-end generation advantages. However, existing GR methods primarily focus on direct Semantic ID (SID) generation from interaction sequences, failing to activate deeper reasoning capabilities analogous to those in large language models and thus limiting performance potential. We identify two critical limitations in current reasoning-enhanced GR approaches: (1) Strict sequential separation between reasoning and generation steps creates imbalanced computational focus across hierarchical SID codes, degrading quality for SID codes; (2) Generated reasoning vectors lack interpretable semantics, while reasoning paths suffer from unverifiable supervision. In this paper, we propose stepwise semantic-guided reasoning in latent space (S$^2$GR), a novel reasoning enhanced GR framework. First, we establish a robust semantic foundation via codebook optimization, integrating item co-occurrence relationship to capture behavioral patterns, and load balancing and uniformity objectives that maximize codebook utilization while reinforcing coarse-to-fine semantic hierarchies. Our core innovation introduces the stepwise reasoning mechanism inserting thinking tokens before each SID generation step, where each token explicitly represents coarse-grained semantics supervised via contrastive learning against ground-truth codebook cluster distributions ensuring physically grounded reasoning paths and balanced computational focus across all SID codes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of S$^2$GR, and online A/B test confirms efficacy on large-scale industrial short video platform.</description>

      <title>OneMall: One Architecture, More Scenarios -- End-to-End Generative Recommender Family at Kuaishou E-Commerce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the wave of generative recommendation, we present OneMall, an end-to-end generative recommendation framework tailored for e-commerce services at Kuaishou. Our OneMall systematically unifies the e-commerce's multiple item distribution scenarios, such as Product-card, short-video and live-streaming. Specifically, it comprises three key components, aligning the entire model training pipeline to the LLM's pre-training/post-training: (1) E-commerce Semantic Tokenizer: we provide a tokenizer solution that captures both real-world semantics and business-specific item relations across different scenarios; (2) Transformer-based Architecture: we largely utilize Transformer as our model backbone, e.g., employing Query-Former for long sequence compression, Cross-Attention for multi-behavior sequence fusion, and Sparse MoE for scalable auto-regressive generation; (3) Reinforcement Learning Pipeline: we further connect retrieval and ranking models via RL, enabling the ranking model to serve as a reward signal for end-to-end policy retrieval model optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OneMall achieves consistent improvements across all e-commerce scenarios: +13.01\% GMV in product-card, +15.32\% Orders in Short-Video, and +2.78\% Orders in Live-Streaming. OneMall has been deployed, serving over 400 million daily active users at Kuaishou.</description>

      <title>Automated Archival Descriptions with Federated Intelligence of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enforcing archival standards requires specialized expertise, and manually creating metadata descriptions for archival materials is a tedious and error-prone task. This work aims at exploring the potential of agentic AI and large language models (LLMs) in addressing the challenges of implementing a standardized archival description process. To this end, we introduce an agentic AI-driven system for automated generation of high-quality metadata descriptions of archival materials. We develop a federated optimization approach that unites the intelligence of multiple LLMs to construct optimal archival metadata. We also suggest methods to overcome the challenges associated with using LLMs for consistent metadata generation. To evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of our techniques, we conducted extensive experiments using a real-world dataset of archival materials, which covers a variety of document types and formats. The evaluation results demonstrate the feasibility of our techniques and highlight the superior performance of the federated optimization approach compared to single-model solutions in metadata quality and reliability.</description>

      <title>Free Access to World News: Reconstructing Full-Text Articles from GDELT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: News data have become essential resources across various disciplines. Still, access to full-text news corpora remains challenging due to high costs and the limited availability of free alternatives. This paper presents a novel Python package (gdeltnews) that reconstructs full-text newspaper articles at near-zero cost by leveraging the Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT) Web News NGrams 3.0 dataset. Our method merges overlapping n-grams extracted from global online news to rebuild complete articles. We validate the approach on a benchmark set of 2211 articles from major U.S. news outlets, achieving up to 95% text similarity against original articles based on Levenshtein and SequenceMatcher metrics. Our tool facilitates economic forecasting, computational social science, information science, and natural language processing applications by enabling free and large-scale access to full-text news data.</description>

      <title>LLM-Based Multi-Agent Blackboard System for Information Discovery in Data Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advances in large language models (LLMs) have created new opportunities in data science, but their deployment is often limited by the challenge of finding relevant data in large data lakes. Existing methods struggle with this: both single- and multi-agent systems are quickly overwhelmed by large, heterogeneous files, and master-slave multi-agent systems rely on a rigid central controller that requires precise knowledge of each sub-agent's capabilities, which is not possible in large-scale settings where the main agent lacks full observability over sub-agents' knowledge and competencies. We propose a novel multi-agent paradigm inspired by the blackboard architecture for traditional AI models. In our framework, a central agent posts requests to a shared blackboard, and autonomous subordinate agents - either responsible for a partition of the data lake or retrieval from the web - volunteer to respond based on their capabilities. This design improves scalability and flexibility by removing the need for a central coordinator to know each agent's expertise or internal knowledge. We evaluate the approach on three benchmarks that require data discovery: KramaBench and modified versions of DSBench and DA-Code. Results show that the blackboard architecture substantially outperforms strong baselines, achieving 13%-57% relative improvements in end-to-end success and up to a 9% relative gain in data discovery F1 over the best baseline.</description>

      <title>TabRAG: Improving Tabular Document Question Answering for Retrieval Augmented Generation via Structured Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Incorporating external knowledge bases in traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) relies on parsing the document, followed by querying a language model with the parsed information via in-context learning. While effective for text-based documents, question answering on tabular documents often fails to generate plausible responses. Standard parsing techniques lose the two-dimensional structural semantics critical for cell interpretation. In this work, we present TabRAG, a parsing-based RAG framework designed to improve tabular document question answering via structured representations. Our framework consists of layout segmentation that decomposes the document inputs into a series of components, enabling fine-grained extraction. Subsequently, a vision language model parses and extracts the document tables into a hierarchically structured representation. In order to cater various table styles and formats, we integrate a self-generated in-context learning module that guides the table extraction process. Experimental results demonstrate that TabRAG outperforms existing popular parsing techniques across a broad suite of evaluation and ablation benchmarks.

      <title>UMM-RM: An Upcycle-and-Merge MoE Reward Model for Mitigating Reward Hacking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are a critical component of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, conventional dense RMs are susceptible to exploitation by policy models through biases or spurious correlations, resulting in reward hacking: RM scores increase during training while alignment with human preferences deteriorates, a problem that is further exacerbated under distribution shift.To address this issue, we propose UMM-RM (Upcycle-and-Merge MoE Reward Model). UMM-RM first upscales the feed-forward layers of a dense backbone into a mixture-of-experts (MoE) reward model with shared experts. The shared experts are always activated to capture instruction-agnostic preference signals, while the remaining experts model fine-grained preferences across instructions or task regimes. After training, the experts are consolidated into a single dense RM via learnable merging weights.This design retains the robustness and exploitation resistance provided by expert diversity while avoiding the inference overhead of MoE architectures or explicit ensembles. Experiments across multiple base models and preference datasets show that, compared with standard dense RMs, UMM-RM improves accuracy on preference data, reduces reward hacking during PPO training, and yields more stable preference alignment.</description>

      <title>Memento: Towards Proactive Visualization of Everyday Memories with Personal Wearable AR Assistant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17622v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Memento, a conversational AR assistant that permanently captures and memorizes user's verbal queries alongside their spatiotemporal and activity contexts. By storing these "memories," Memento discovers connections between users' recurring interests and the contexts that trigger them. Upon detection of similar or identical spatiotemporal activity, Memento proactively recalls user interests and delivers up-to-date responses through AR, seamlessly integrating AR experience into their daily routine. Unlike prior work, each interaction in Memento is not a transient event, but a connected series of interactions with coherent long--term perspective, tailored to the user's broader multimodal (visual, spatial, temporal, and embodied) context. We conduct a preliminary evaluation through user feedbacks with participants of diverse expertise in immersive apps, and explore the value of proactive context-aware AR assistant in everyday settings. We share our findings and challenges in designing a proactive, context-aware AR system.</description>

      <title>A Scalable Inter-edge Correlation Modeling in CopulaGNN for Link Sign Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19175v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Link sign prediction on a signed graph is a task to determine whether the relationship represented by an edge is positive or negative. Since the presence of negative edges violates the graph homophily assumption that adjacent nodes are similar, regular graph methods have not been applicable without auxiliary structures to handle them. We aim to directly model the latent statistical dependency among edges with the Gaussian copula and its corresponding correlation matrix, extending CopulaGNN (Ma et al., 2021). However, a naive modeling of edge-edge relations is computationally intractable even for a graph with moderate scale. To address this, we propose to 1) represent the correlation matrix as a Gramian of edge embeddings, significantly reducing the number of parameters, and 2) reformulate the conditional probability distribution to dramatically reduce the inference cost. We theoretically verify scalability of our method by proving its linear convergence. Also, our extensive experiments demonstrate that it achieves significantly faster convergence than baselines, maintaining competitive prediction performance to the state-of-the-art models.</description>
