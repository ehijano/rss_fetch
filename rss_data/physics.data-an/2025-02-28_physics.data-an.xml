      <title>Dynamics on Lie groups with applications to attitude estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of filtering - propagation of probability densities through stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and association of measurement data using Bayesian inference - of objects whose state space forms a Lie group is considered. Particular emphasis is given to concentrated Gaussians (CGs) as a parametric family of probability distributions to capture the uncertainty associated with an estimated group element. The so-called group-affine property of the vector field governing the state time evolution is shown to be a necessary and sufficient condition for the linearity of the dynamics expressed in terms of exponential coordinates, in turn implying the family of CGs is invariant under such evolution. A physically-motivated SDE on the group is then reformulated as an SDE on the associated Lie algebra via exponential coordinates. The vector space structure of the Lie algebra together with the notion of a CG enables the leveraging of techniques from conventional Gaussian-based Kalman filtering in an approach called the tangent space filter (TSF). We provide example calculations for several Lie groups that arise in the problem of estimating position, velocity, and orientation of a rigid body from a noisy, potentially biased inertial measurement unit (IMU). For the specific problem of attitude estimation, it is shown through numerical experiments that TSF-based approaches are more accurate and robust than another widely used attitude filtering technique.</description>

      <title>A New Method for High-Resolution Dating of Radiocarbon Data: The Example of the First Three Centuries B.C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiocarbon dating poses a challenge in many archaeological contexts due to the limited precision of conventional calibration methods. In this study, we introduce a novel approach to fine-dating that is based on the repeated application of OxCal's R_Simulate function. By constructing extensive reference tables and aggregating measures of central tendency (means and medians), uncalibrated 14C measurements are directly mapped to calendar dates. The method is validated through comprehensive simulations and comparisons with dendrochronologically dated tree rings. Despite challenges in segments of the calibration curve with low gradients, the approach demonstrates that a significant improvement in dating precision is achievable. Limitations and potential avenues for further methodological optimisation are discussed.</description>

      <title>Solving Crystal Structures by Carrying Out the Calculation of the Single-Atom R1 Method in a Lottery Mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As originally designed [Zhang &amp; Donahue (2024), Acta Cryst. A80, 2370248.], after one cycle of calculation, the single-atom R1 (sR1) method required a user to intelligently determine a partial structure to start the next cycle. In this paper, a lottery scheme has been designed to randomly split a parent model into two child models. This allows the calculation to be carried out in care-free manner. By chance, one child model may have higher amounts of "good" atoms than the parent model. Thus, its expansion in the next cycle favors an improved model. These "lucky" results are carried onto the next cycles. while "unlucky" results in which no improvements occur are discarded. Furthermore, unchanged models are carried onto the next cycles in those "unlucky" occasions. On average a child model has the same fraction of "good" atoms as the parent. Only a substantial statistical fluctuation results in appreciable deviation. This lottery scheme works because such fluctuations do happen. Indeed, test applications with the computing power accessibly by the author have demonstrated that the designed scheme can drive an sR1 calculation to or close to reaching a correct structure solution.</description>

      <title>Isolating Unisolated Upsilons with Anomaly Detection in CMS Open Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first study of anti-isolated Upsilon decays to two muons ($\Upsilon \to \mu^+ \mu^-$) in proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. Using a machine learning (ML)-based anomaly detection strategy, we "rediscover" the $\Upsilon$ in 13 TeV CMS Open Data from 2016, despite overwhelming anti-isolated backgrounds. We elevate the signal significance to $6.4 \sigma$ using these methods, starting from $1.6 \sigma$ using the dimuon mass spectrum alone. Moreover, we demonstrate improved sensitivity from using an ML-based estimate of the multi-feature likelihood compared to traditional "cut-and-count" methods. Our work demonstrates that it is possible and practical to find real signals in experimental collider data using ML-based anomaly detection, and we distill a readily-accessible benchmark dataset from the CMS Open Data to facilitate future anomaly detection developments.</description>

      <title>Ultimate Sensitivity in X-ray Diffraction: Angular Moments vs. Shot Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The sensitivity of x-ray diffraction experiments towards Bragg peak parameters constitutes a crucial performance attribute of experimental setups. Frequently, diffraction peaks are characterized by model-free angular moment analysis, which offers a greater versatility compared to traditional model-based peak fitting. Here, we have determined the ultimate sensitivity of angular moments for diffraction data that is limited by photon shot noise. We report experimentally achieved sensitivities of the first moment below $1/1000$th of a detector pixel and below $1\mu$rad. We have demonstrated the validity of our theoretical predictions by an excellent agreement with experimental results from three different setups. The provided formulas for the uncertainties of angular moments allow for the rapid determination of experimentally achieved sensitivities from single diffraction frames.</description>
