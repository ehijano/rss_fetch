      <title>Endogenous Identity in a Social Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interaction with individuals from other socioeconomic classes has been shown to be a main driver for social mobility. We employ tools of social identity theory and network analysis to show how exposure to individuals of different social identities can lead to interactions with them, and an adoption of their identity, creating social mobility. We find that even if all individuals have the same ability, they may endogenously choose different identities, leading to different classes and actions. In particular, we derive a sufficient condition for such an equilibrium to exist, which equates to a novel measure of cohesion. Furthermore, we show that the most socially mobile individuals (changing their identity) are those who either have few connections or a more heterogeneous mix of identities in their connections. Finally, we show that upward social mobility increases action levels in society, but not necessarily welfare.</description>

      <title>Endogenous Attention and the Spread of False News</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the impact of endogenous attention in a dynamic model of social media sharing. Each period, a distinct user randomly draws a story from the pool of stories on the platform and decides whether or not to share it. Users want to share stories that are true and interesting, but differentiating true stories from false ones requires attention. Before deciding whether to share a story, users choose their level of attention based on how interesting the story is and the platform's current proportions of true and false stories. We characterize the limit behavior of the share of true stories using stochastic approximation techniques. For some parameter specifications, the system has a unique limit. For others, the limit is random -- starting from the same initial conditions, the platform may end up with very different proportions of true and false stories and different user sharing behavior. We present various comparative statics for the limit. Endogenous attention leads to a counterbalancing force to changes in the credibility of false stories but can intensify the effects of changes in false stories' production rate.</description>

      <title>Unanimity of two selves in decision making</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new model of incomplete preferences under uncertainty, which we call unanimous dual-self preferences. Act f is considered more desirable than act g when, and only when, both the evaluation of an optimistic self, computed as the welfare level attained in a best-case scenario, and that of a pessimistic self, computed as the welfare level attained in a worst-case scenario, rank f above g. Our comparison criterion involves multiple priors, as best and worst cases are determined among sets of probability distributions, and is, generically, less conservative than Bewley preferences and twofold multi-prior preferences, the two ambiguity models that are closest to ours</description>

      <title>Optimal Robust Contract Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the robust contract design problem when the principal only has limited information about the actions the agent can take. The principal evaluates a contract according to its worst-case performance caused by the uncertain action space. Carroll (AER 2015) showed that a linear contract is optimal among deterministic contracts. Recently, Kambhampati (JET 2023) showed that the principal's payoff can be strictly increased via randomization over linear contracts. In this paper, we characterize the optimal randomized contract, which remains linear and admits a closed form of its cumulative density function. The advantage of randomized contracts over deterministic contracts can be arbitrarily large even when the principal knows only one non-trivial action of the agent. Furthermore, our result generalizes to the model of contracting with teams, by Dai and Toikka (Econometrica 2022).</description>

      <title>Moral Hazard with Network Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I study a moral hazard problem between a principal and multiple agents who experience positive peer effects represented by a (weighted) network. Under the optimal linear contract, the principal provides high-powered incentives to central agents in the network in order to exploit the larger incentive spillovers such agents create. The analysis reveals a novel measure of network centrality that captures rich channels of direct and indirect incentive spillovers and characterizes the optimal contract and its induced equilibrium efforts. The notion of centrality relevant for incentive spillovers in the model emphasizes the role of pairs of agents who link to common neighbors in the network. This characterization leads to a measure of marginal network effects and identifies the agents whom the principal targets with stronger incentives in response to the addition (or strengthening) of a link. When the principal can position agents with heterogeneous costs of effort in the network, the principal prefers to place low-cost agents in central positions. The results shed light on how firms can increase productivity through corporate culture, office layout, and social interactions.</description>

      <title>Incentive Contracts and Peer Effects in the Workplace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Risk-averse workers in a team exert effort to produce joint output. Workers' incentives are connected via chains of productivity spillovers, represented by a network of peer-effects. We study the problem of a principal offering wage contracts that simultaneously incentivize and insure agents. We solve for the optimal linear contract for any network and show that optimal incentives are loaded more heavily on workers that are more central in a specific way. We conveniently link firm profits to network structure via the networks spectral properties. When firms can't personalize contracts, better connected workers extract rents. In this case, a group composition result follows: large within-group differences in centrality can decrease firm's profits. Finally, we find that modular production has important implications for how peer structures distribute incentives.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Evidence Disclosure: Delay the Good to Accelerate the Bad</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the dynamic tradeoff between the generation and the disclosure of evidence. Agents are tempted to delay investing in a new technology in order to learn from information generated by the experiences of others. This informational free-riding is collectively harmful as it slows down innovation adoption. A welfare-maximizing designer can delay the disclosure of previously generated information in order to speed up adoption. The optimal policy transparently discloses bad news and delays good news. This finding resonates with regulation demanding that fatal breakdowns be reported promptly. Remarkably, the designer's intervention makes all agents better off.</description>

      <title>Robust Price Discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16942v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a model of third-degree price discrimination where the seller's product valuation is unknown to the market designer, who aims to maximize buyer surplus by revealing buyer valuation information. Our main result shows that the regret is bounded by a $\frac{1}{e}$-fraction of the optimal buyer surplus when the seller has zero valuation for the product. This bound is attained by randomly drawing a seller valuation and applying the segmentation of Bergemann et al. (2015) with respect to the drawn valuation. We show that this bound is tight in the case of binary buyer valuation.</description>

      <title>The Limits of Price Discrimination Under Privacy Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08223v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a producer's problem of selling a product to a continuum of privacy-conscious consumers, where the producer can implement third-degree price discrimination, offering different prices to different market segments. We consider a privacy mechanism that provides a degree of protection by probabilistically masking each market segment. We establish that the resultant set of all consumer-producer utilities forms a convex polygon, characterized explicitly as a linear mapping of a certain high-dimensional convex polytope into $\mathbb{R}^2$. This characterization enables us to investigate the impact of the privacy mechanism on both producer and consumer utilities. In particular, we establish that the privacy constraint always hurts the producer by reducing both the maximum and minimum utility achievable. From the consumer's perspective, although the privacy mechanism ensures an increase in the minimum utility compared to the non-private scenario, interestingly, it may reduce the maximum utility. Finally, we demonstrate that increasing the privacy level does not necessarily intensify these effects. For instance, the maximum utility for the producer or the minimum utility for the consumer may exhibit nonmonotonic behavior in response to an increase of the privacy level.</description>

      <title>Mechanism Design for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate auction mechanisms for AI-generated content, focusing on applications like ad creative generation. In our model, agents' preferences over stochastically generated content are encoded as large language models (LLMs). We propose an auction format that operates on a token-by-token basis, and allows LLM agents to influence content creation through single dimensional bids. We formulate two desirable incentive properties and prove their equivalence to a monotonicity condition on output aggregation. This equivalence enables a second-price rule design, even absent explicit agent valuation functions. Our design is supported by demonstrations on a publicly available LLM.</description>

      <title>Fair Allocation in Dynamic Mechanism Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a dynamic mechanism design problem where an auctioneer sells an indivisible good to two groups of buyers in every round, for a total of $T$ rounds. The auctioneer aims to maximize their discounted overall revenue while adhering to a fairness constraint that guarantees a minimum average allocation for each group. We begin by studying the static case ($T=1$) and establish that the optimal mechanism involves two types of subsidization: one that increases the overall probability of allocation to all buyers, and another that favors the group which otherwise has a lower probability of winning the item. We then extend our results to the dynamic case by characterizing a set of recursive functions that determine the optimal allocation and payments in each round. Notably, our results establish that in the dynamic case, the seller, on the one hand, commits to a participation reward to incentivize truth-telling, and on the other hand, charges an entry fee for every round. Moreover, the optimal allocation once more involves subsidization in favor of one group, where the extent of subsidization depends on the difference in future utilities for both the seller and buyers when allocating the item to one group versus the other. Finally, we present an approximation scheme to solve the recursive equations and determine an approximately optimal and fair allocation efficiently.</description>
