      <title>Topological Data Analysis of Monopoles in $U(1)$ Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In $4$-dimensional pure compact $U(1)$ lattice gauge theory, we analyse topological aspects of the dynamics of monopoles across the deconfinement phase transition. We do this using tools from Topological Data Analysis (TDA). We demonstrate that observables constructed from the zeroth and first homology groups of monopole current networks may be used to quantitatively and robustly locate the critical inverse coupling $\beta_{c}$ through finite-size scaling. Our method provides a mathematically robust framework for the characterisation of topological invariants related to monopole currents, putting on firmer ground earlier investigations. Moreover, our approach can be generalised to the study of Abelian monopoles in non-Abelian gauge theories.</description>

      <title>QCD Equation of State at nonzero baryon density in external magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of QCD equation of state in external magnetic field and nonzero baryon density. Our study is carried out by means of lattice simulation with 2+1 dynamical staggered quarks at the physical masses. The simulation is conducted at imaginary baryon chemical potential what allowed us to overcome the sign problem. We expand the pressure in the baryon imaginary chemical potential and study three leading nonzero coefficients in this expansion. These coefficients were calculated for the following values of magnetic field: $eB=0.3$, $0.6$, $1.2$ GeV$^2$ with the lattice sizes $8\times32^3$, $10\times40^3$, $12\times48^3$. Using these data we take continuum limit for the coefficients. Our results indicate considerable enhancement of the expansion coefficients by the magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Phases and Duality in Fundamental Kazakov-Migdal Model on the Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the fundamental Kazakov-Migdal (FKM) model on a generic graph, whose partition function is represented by the Ihara zeta function weighted by unitary matrices. The FKM model becomes unstable in the critical strip of the Ihara zeta function. We discover a duality between small and large couplings, associated with the functional equation of the Ihara zeta function for regular graphs. Although the duality is not precise for irregular graphs, we show that the effective action in the large coupling region can be represented by a summation of all possible Wilson loops on the graph similar to that in the small coupling region. We estimate the phase structure of the FKM model both in the small and large coupling regions by comparing it with the Gross-Witten-Wadia (GWW) model. We further validate the theoretical analysis through detailed numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Localization of Dirac modes in the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ Higgs model at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03542v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the connection between localization of low-lying Dirac modes and Polyakov-loop ordering in the lattice $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ Higgs model at finite temperature, probed with the staggered Dirac operator. After mapping out the phase diagram of the model at a fixed temporal extension in lattice units, we study the localization properties of the low-lying modes of the staggered Dirac operator, how these properties change across the various transitions, and how these modes correlate with the gauge and Higgs fields. We find localized low modes in the deconfined and in the Higgs phase, where the Polyakov loop is strongly ordered, but in both cases they disappear as one crosses over to the confined phase. Our findings confirm the general expectations of the "sea/islands" picture, and the more detailed expectations of its refined version concerning the favorable locations of localized modes, also in the presence of dynamical scalar matter.</description>

      <title>Continuum limit of the mobility edge and taste-degeneracy effects in high-temperature lattice QCD with staggered quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effects of taste degeneracy on the continuum scaling of the localization properties of the staggered Dirac operator in high-temperature QCD using numerical simulations on the lattice, focusing in particular on the position of the mobility edge separating localized and delocalized modes at the low end of the spectrum. We find that, if the continuum limit is approached at fixed spatial volume, the restoration of taste symmetry leads to sizeable systematic effects on estimates for the mobility edge obtained from spectral statistics, which become larger and larger as the lattice spacing is decreased. Such systematics, however, are found to decrease if the volume is increased at fixed lattice spacing. We argue that spectral statistics estimate correctly the position of the mobility edge in the thermodynamic limit at fixed spacing, and support this with an independent numerical analysis based directly on the properties of the Dirac eigenvectors, that are unaffected by taste degeneracy. We then provide a theoretical argument justifying the exchange of the thermodynamic and continuum limits when studying localization. This allows us to use spectral statistics to determine the position of the mobility edge, and to obtain a controlled continuum extrapolation of the mobility edge for the first time.</description>

      <title>Heavy axial-vector structures $bb\overline{c}\overline{c}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fully heavy axial-vector diquark-antidiquark structures $bb\overline{c} \overline{c}$ are explored by means of the QCD sum rule method. They are modeled as four-quark mesons $T_{\mathrm{1}}$ and $T_{\mathrm{2}}$ composed of $b^{T}C\sigma _{\mu \nu }\gamma _{5}b$, $\overline{c}\gamma ^{\nu }C \overline{c}^{T}$ and $b^{T}C\gamma _{\mu }\gamma _{5}b$, $\overline{c}C \overline{c}^{T}$ diquarks, respectively. The spectroscopic parameters of the tetraquarks $T_{\mathrm{1}}$ and $T_{\mathrm{2}}$ are determined in the context of the QCD two-point sum rule method. Results obtained for masses of these states $m_{1} =(12715\pm 86)~\mathrm{MeV}$ and $m_{2}=(13383\pm 92)~ \mathrm{MeV}$ are used to fix their strong decay channels. The full width $ \Gamma (T_{\mathrm{1}})$ of the diquark-antidiquark state $T_{\mathrm{1}}$ is estimated by considering the processes $T_{\mathrm{1}} \to B_{c}^{-}B_{c}^{\ast -}$ and $T_{\mathrm{1}} \to B_{c}^{\ast -}B_{c}^{\ast -} $. The decays to mesons $B_{c}^{-}B_{c}^{\ast -}$, $B_{c}^{-}(2S)B_{c}^{ \ast -}$ and $B_{c}^{\ast -}B_{c}^{\ast -}$ are employed to evaluate $\Gamma (T_{\mathrm{2}})$. Results obtained for the widths $\Gamma (T_{\mathrm{1} })=(44.3\pm 8.8)~\mathrm{MeV}$ and $\Gamma (T_{\mathrm{2}})=(82.5\pm 13.7)~ \mathrm{MeV}$ of these tetraquarks in conjunction with their masses are useful for future experimental studies of fully heavy resonances.</description>

      <title>A discrete formulation for three-dimensional winding number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a smooth map $g\colon X \to U(N)$, where $X$ is a three-dimensional, oriented, and closed manifold, the winding number or the map's degree is defined by $W_3 = \frac{1}{24\pi^2} \int_{X} \mathrm{Tr}\left[(g^{-1}dg)^3\right]$. We introduce a method to compute $W_3$ using a discrete approximation of $X$ so that the result is manifestly quantized.</description>
