      <title>Cryogen-free variable-temperature Kelvin probe force microscopy for probing local chemical potential in a graphene heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the development of a variable-temperature Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) system capable of stable and highly sensitive operation over a wide temperature range based on a GM-cooler-based cryogen-free cryostat. The system incorporates a custom-designed phase-locked loop and automatic gain control, along with passive vibration isolation, enabling precise measurements of local chemical potential even under cryogenic conditions. We demonstrate the performance of this setup by measuring hBN encapsulated monolayer graphene (MLG), revealing spatially resolved electronic inhomogeneities and charge puddles. Our measurements clearly capture temperature-dependent variations in the chemical potential near the charge neutrality point (CNP), consistent with the linear band dispersion of MLG and interaction-driven renormalization of Fermi velocity. This work highlights the robust sensitivity and stability of our system, making it a versatile local probe of quantum phases in van der Waals heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Spin injection in Si-based ferromagnetic tunnel junctions with MgO/MgAl2O4 barriers:Experimental and theoretical investigation of barrier thickness-dependent spin tunneling efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have experimentally and theoretically investigated the spin transport in Fe/Mg/MgO/MgAl2O4/n+-Si(001) ferromagnetic tunnel junctions on a Si substrate, by systematically varying the thickness combination of amorphous MgO and MgAl2O4 tunnel barrier layers with a sliding shutter between the evaporation sources and substrate during electron-beam evaporation. A technical advantage of MgAl2O4 is that a continuous and flat thin film is realized on a Si substrate even when the MgAl2O4 thickness is as thin as 0.5 nm, unlike MgO, which enables us to examine the spin transport in a thinner range of the tunnel barrier thickness. Our distinct finding is as follows: When the Fe/Mg/MgO interface is used on the top side, the spin polarization PS of tunneling electrons increases at 10 K as the total MgO/MgAl2O4 tunnel barrier thickness (tox = 0.47 - 1.4 nm) is increased, regardless of different thickness combinations, and PS shows saturation-like behavior when tox is above 1.1 nm. Since this feature cannot be explained by the well-known conductivity mismatch in semiconductor-based ferromagnetic tunnel junctions, we propose a simple phenomenological tunneling model based on two different direct tunneling paths, which have higher/lower spin polarizations with longer/shorter decay lengths. Our numerical calculation reproduces the relationship between the spin polarization PS and total tunnel barrier thickness tox in the experiments, indicating that the dominant mechanism is an increasing contribution of the lower spin polarization path as tox is decreased. We discuss possible origins for this phenomenon including intrinsic and extrinsic tunneling mechanisms. Our analysis method provides an insight into the detailed spin transport physics in semiconductor-based ferromagnetic junctions, particularly, with a very thin tunnel barrier layer.</description>

      <title>Fast-Response Variable-Frequency Series-Capacitor Buck VRM Through Integrated Control Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast-response voltage regulation is essential for data-center Voltage Regulation Modules (VRMs) powering Artificial Intelligence (AI) workloads, which exhibit both small-amplitude fluctuations and abrupt full-load steps. This paper introduces a control scheme that integrates a linear controller and a nonlinear controller for variable-frequency Series-Capacitor Buck (SCB) converters. First, an accurate small-signal model is derived via a Switching-Synchronized Sampled State-Space (5S) framework, yielding discrete-time transfer functions and root-locus insights for direct digital design. A critical concern for SCB converters is series-capacitor oscillation during heavy load steps if the strict switching sequence is not maintained. To accelerate large-signal transients, a time-optimal control strategy based on Pontryagins Maximum Principle (PMP) relaxes the switching constraints to compute time-optimal switching sequences. A transition logic is then proposed to integrate the high-bandwidth small-signal controller and the large-signal controller. Simulations demonstrate a rapid output voltage recovery under a heavy load step-up, over ten times faster than a linear controller-only design. Preliminary hardware tests indicate a stable rejection to heavy load disturbances with zero steady-state error.</description>

      <title>Static and dynamic ordering of magnetic repelling particles under confinement: disks vs bars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explored experimentally the self-organization at rest and the compression dynamics of a two-dimensional array of magnetic repelling particles, using two particle geometries, namely, disks and rectangular bars. Despite the non-contact interaction, typical static features of granular materials are observed for both particle shapes: pile formation with an angle of repose and pressure saturation (Janssen-like effect), which can be explained by considering the magnetically-induced torques that generate friction between particles and confining walls. Particle shape effects are mainly observed during compression: while disks rearrange increasing the hexagonal ordering, bars augment their orientational ordering forming larger non-contact force chains; however, in both cases, the resistance to compression rises continuously, in contrast with the fluctuating compression dynamics (stick-slip motion or periodic oscillations) that characterizes granular systems with inter-particle contacts. The continuous response to compression, and the reduction of particle wear due to non-contact interactions, are desirable features in designing magnetic granular dampers.</description>

      <title>Spin current generation driven by skyrmion dynamics under magnetic anisotropy and polarized microwaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have investigated the spin-current pumped by the skyrmion-host material with the lack of inversion symmetry through the microwave resonance process. The effects of magnetic anisotropy and polarized microwaves are examined by micromagnetic simulations. Our results reveal two distinct skyrmion phases, designated as SkX type-I and II, which emerge at low ($K_z&lt;0.1$ meV) and high ($K_z&gt;0.1$ meV) magnetic anisotropy constants, respectively, having different characteristics of spin excitations. The SkX type-I exhibits spin dynamics where the resonant frequency of the breathing mode is lying in between the clockwise and counterclockwise gyration modes of Bloch-type skyrmion at a very low anisotropy, and is crossing over the counterclockwise mode at $K_z \sim 0.04$ meV. Meanwhile, the SkX type-II exhibits distinct spin excitations in which the clockwise mode is notably absent, while the counterclockwise modes exist at both low and high resonant frequencies. This suggests that the magnetic anisotropy plays an essential role in the spin dynamics. Furthermore, the resulting spin excitations induce spin currents with exotic features under the polarized microwaves. The spin currents induced, for instance, by low-lying in-plane excitations are strongly enhanced under the left-handed circularly polarized microwaves, but quenched by the right-handed circularly polarized microwaves regardless of the sign of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. These results may pave the way for understanding the non-trivial interplay between magnetic anisotropy and polarized microwaves in the generation of spin currents by a resonant process.</description>

      <title>Microscopic origin of shear bands in 2D amorphous solids from topological defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of shear bands in amorphous solids such as glasses has remained an open question in our understanding of condensed matter and amorphous materials. Unlike in crystals, well-defined topological defects such as dislocations have been elusive due to the lack of a periodic ordered background at the atomic level. Recently, topological defects have been identified in the displacement field and in the eigenvectors of amorphous solids. Recent work has suggested that shear bands in amorphous solids coincide with an alignment of vortex-antivortex dipoles, with alternating topological charge +1/-1. Here we numerically confirm this hypothesis by means of well-controlled simulations in 2D. Surprisingly, we show that a chain of topological defects (TDs) pre-exists the shear band and is visible already in the non-affine displacement field of the elastic regime. This chain is activated into a flow band concomitantly with the disappearance and possibly annihilation of a dipole at a distance from the TDs chain. The possible underlying mechanism is reminiscent of a soliton-like rarefaction pulse remotely activated by dipole annihilation as observed in superfluid Bose-Einstein condensates.</description>

      <title>Electric-Field-Induced Second-Harmonic Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Second-harmonic generation (SHG) is a fundamental nonlinear optical process widely used in photonics; however, it is strictly forbidden in the bulk of centrosymmetric materials due to their inversion symmetry. Nevertheless, applying an external electric field breaks this inversion symmetry. It induces an effective second-order nonlinear response known as the electric-field-induced second-harmonic generation (EFISH) effect. This mechanism enables SHG even in centrosymmetric media and provides a powerful tool for dynamic and electrically tunable nonlinear nanophotonics. This review presents a comprehensive overview of the EFISH effect, covering the fundamentals, various material platforms (including bulk semiconductor crystals, ferroelectrics, van der Waals materials, and polymers), as well as diverse strategies for electric field engineering. It further distinguishs EFISH from related effects such as current-induced SHG and the quantum-confined Stark effect, and highlight emerging applications of EFISH in tunable photonic devices, carrier dynamics probing, and nonlinear optical modulation across optical, electronic, and THz regimes. Finally, key challenges and perspectives for the future development of electrically controlled nonlinear optical systems are outlined.</description>

      <title>Correlating synthesis, structure and thermal stability of CuBi nanowires for spintronic applications by electron microscopy and in situ scattering methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bi-doped copper (Cu1-xBix) nanowires (NWs), promising candidates for spintronic applications due to their potential for a giant spin Hall effect (SHE), were synthesized and their structural properties and thermal stability were investigated. Using template-assisted electrodeposition, Cu1-xBix nanowires with varying bismuth (Bi) content (x=0, 2, 4, and 7%) and different crystalline domain sizes were fabricated. Structural analysis by advanced electron microscopy and X-ray scattering techniques revealed the influence of synthesis conditions on the resulting NW crystal structure and microstructure, including Bi localization (within the lattice or in the grain boundaries), crystallite domain dimensions, and lattice distortions. While NWs with larger crystalline domains allow homogeneous Bi incorporation into the Cu lattice, NWs with smaller crystalline domains exhibit noticeable Bi accumulation at grain boundaries. The thermal stability of the NWs was examined using variable temperature X-ray diffraction and total scattering. Upon heating, lattice distortions consistent with Bi diffusion out of the Cu lattice were observed, with subsequent crystallization of rhombohedral metallic Bi upon cooling. These findings establish a foundation for optimizing the SHE performance of Cu1-xBix nanowires for spintronic devices by correlating synthesis parameters with microstructural features and thermal behavior.</description>

      <title>How to Fix Silver for Plasmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silver (Ag) is considered an ideal material for plasmonic applications in the visible wavelength regime due to its superior optical properties, but its use is limited by the poor chemical stability and structural quality of thermally evaporated thin films and resulting nanostructures. In this study, we present a simple approach to enhance the structural and optical quality as well as the chemical stability of Ag thin films by alloying with gold (Au) through thermal co-evaporation. We investigate Ag$_{100-x}$Au$_x$ thin films with Au contents ranging from 5 to 20 at% analyzing their surface morphology, crystallite structure, optical properties, and chemical stability. Our results show that low Au concentrations significantly reduce the roughness of co-evaporated thin films (down to 0.4 nm RMS), and significantly enhance the resistance to oxidation, while maintaining a defined crystallite growth. Importantly, these improvements are achieved without the need for template stripping, metallic wetting layers, or epitaxial substrates, enabling direct deposition on glass. Among the compositions studied, Ag$_{95}$Au$_5$ thin films exhibit the highest chemical stability, lowest optical losses in the visible spectral range, and excellent plasmonic properties even outcompeting pure Ag. As a proof-of-concept, we fabricate high-quality Ag$_{95}$Au$_5$ optical antennas that exhibit long-term durability under ambient conditions. Our approach provides a practical solution to overcome the limitations of Ag for plasmonic device applications.</description>

      <title>Observation of Quantum Coulomb Blockade Facilitated by P-Donor Molecules in Silicon Nano-Transistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-donor architecture developed on the base of silicon technology holds significant potential towards room-temperature qubit and other single-electron tunneling (SET) functionalities. However, within such architecture, the overlap of multiple donor wave-functions results in a complex internal electronic configuration with discrete energy levels. Probing these discrete states, observed as multiple conductance peaks, is essential for understanding inter-donor coupling and exchange interactions towards coherent electron transfer. In this direction, we have experimentally demonstrated one-by-one electron filling within multiple-donor molecules with the fundamental analysis of clear and sustained quantum Coulomb blockade (QCB) effect. Moreover, the underlying physics of molecular orbitals, where the increasing energy leads to a larger spatial extent of the corresponding orbital, has been reflected by the systematic decrement of the respective charging-energies. The molecular energy levels, resulting from the orbital hybridization of individual donors, are also confirmed through first-principles simulations using density functional theory (DFT). Furthermore, Monte Carlo simulations based on the orthodox theory of Coulomb blockade support the observed QCB characteristics.</description>

      <title>Surface scattering of atoms for high-sensitivity spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-sensitivity laser spectroscopy is integral to applications like atomic clocks, quantum computers, and chemical sensing. Lowering atomic temperature decreases spectral Doppler broadening and increases transit time across the excitation laser. We find that a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) coated surface can cool iron atoms from ~1400 K to room temperature by surface scattering. It is also apparent that a single scattering event is enough for atoms to equilibrate with the PDMS surface temperature. Further, we show the very low adsorption of iron and ytterbium atoms on PDMS, an effect that persists to surface temperatures of 200 K. Through numerical simulation, we demonstrate the potential use of surface scattering in making a room temperature source of collimated atoms with enhanced flux and reduced velocity compared to that without surface scattering.</description>

      <title>Precision Thermometry of Flat Flames Using Spatially Resolved Multi-Color Laser Absorption Spectroscopy of Carbon Dioxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work developed an accurate and robust absorption-based method for spatially resolved measurements of gas temperatures in flames and reacting flows, with typical single-measurement uncertainties on the order of 1\%. This method exploits narrow-linewidth laser absorption of hot CO$_2$ molecules, which can be generated from combustion or artificially seeded into the flow. A collinear dual-laser setup allowed for periodic scans over tens of CO$_2$ absorption transitions near the $\nu_3$ bandhead every 100 $\mu s$, from which gas temperatures (as well as CO$_2$ concentrations) were determined with high sensitivity and robustness. Spatially resolved measurements were achieved using an electrically driven high-speed beam scanning system consisting of a 2-D galvo scanner and a pair of off-axis parabolic mirrors. An effective spatial resolution of 1 mm was achieved at a planar field measurement speed of 200 Hz and a volumetric field measurement speed of 2 Hz, with further improvements in speed anticipated by another order of magnitude. A physically constrained nonlinear inference framework was also developed for the quantitative analysis of the measurement data. Proof-of-concept experiments were performed on axisymmetric flames stabilized on a Mckenna burner at various equivalence ratios and flow rates, and the results agreed asymptotically with the theoretical value of the adiabatic flame temperature. An additional experiment on a flame of complex geometry demonstrated an excellent level of resolution, precision, and contrast achieved by the current thermometry method. This method promises to provide good utility in future combustion studies due to its high performance metrics and relative ease of use.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inkjet-printed liquid crystal (LC) droplets exhibit an intricate spatially-varying birefringence due to their complex internal director configuration. While such anisotropy is often viewed as a drawback when LC droplets are used as microlenses, here we leverage this remarkable birefringence property to generate complex structured light. Through a selection of the alignment layer, and by varying the chiral pitch, we create three distinct droplet types with tailored intrinsic director configurations, each exhibiting a unique birefringence distribution for structured light beam generation. We show that these printed LC droplets can generate beams that exhibit skyrmionic structures carrying two units of orbital angular momentum, beams that contain azimuthal/radial polarized fields, and beams with polarization singularities. Our method enables new possibilities for using LC droplet technology to engineer sophisticated optical beam patterns.</description>

      <title>Bulk spin-orbit torque-driven spin Hall nano-oscillators using PtBi alloys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-orbit-torque-driven auto-oscillations in spin Hall nano-oscillators (SHNOs) offer a transformative pathway toward energy-efficient, nanoscale microwave devices for next-generation neuromorphic computing and high-frequency technologies. A key requirement for achieving robust, sustained oscillations is reducing the threshold current ($I_{\text{th}}$), strongly governed by spin Hall efficiency ($\theta_{\text{SH}}$). However, conventional strategies to enhance $\theta_{\text{SH}}$ face trade-offs, including high longitudinal resistivity, interfacial effects, and symmetry-breaking torques that limit performance. Here, we demonstrate a substantial enhancement of the bulk spin Hall effect in PtBi alloys, achieving over a threefold increase in $\theta_{\text{SH}}$, from 0.07 in pure Pt to 0.24 in Pt$_{94.0}$Bi$_{6.0}$ and 0.19 in Pt$_{91.3}$Bi$_{8.7}$, as extracted from DC-bias spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance. The enhanced $\theta_{\text{SH}}$ originates from bulk-dominated, extrinsic side-jump scattering across all PtBi compositions. Correspondingly, we observe a 42\% and 32\% reduction in $I_{\text{th}}$ in 100 nm SHNOs based on Co$_{40}$Fe$_{40}$B$_{20}$(3 nm)/Pt$_{94.0}$Bi$_{6.0}$(4 nm) and Co$_{40}$Fe$_{40}$B$_{20}$(3 nm)/Pt$_{91.3}$Bi$_{8.7}$(4 nm), respectively. Structural characterization reveals reduced Pt crystallinity, along with emergence of preferred crystallographic orientations upon introducing higher Bi concentrations. Together, these results position PtBi alloys as a compelling alternative to conventional 5$d$ transition metals, enabling enhanced $\theta_{\text{SH}}$ and significantly lower $I_{\text{th}}$, thus opening new avenues for energy-efficient neuromorphic computing and magnetic random access memory.</description>

      <title>High efficiency, high quality factor active membrane metasurfaces with extended Kerker effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10260v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient, low-power, and highly integrated optoelectronic devices remain a critical yet challenging goal.Here, we introduce the extended Kerker effect paradigm that synergizes Kerker's condition with quasi-bound states in the continuum (q-BICs) to overcome these limitations. By engineering dual-mode dispersion, we achieve a high efficiency beam deflector using a membrane metasurface, simultaneously realizing robust parameter tolerance and narrow-linewidth resonances-two typically conflicting properties.Our experiment demonstrates an absolute beam deflection efficiency exceeding 92%, with exceptional spectral and spatial selectivity, including a 4 GHz linewidth, a 2.8o divergence angle, and a quality factor of 114. Additionally, it enables 94% transmission intensity modulation at a pump intensity as low as 0.5 W/cm2 in experiments. The extended Kerker effect provides a scalable platform for energy-efficient and integrable optoelectronic devices, paving the way for transformative advancements in next-generation wireless communications and LiDAR.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous integration of silicon nitride and amorphous silicon carbide photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC) has emerged as a compelling candidate for applications in integrated photonics, known for its high refractive index, high optical quality, high thermo-optic coefficient, and strong third-order nonlinearities. Furthermore, a-SiC can be easily deposited via CMOS-compatible chemical vapor deposition (CVD) techniques, allowing for precise thickness control and adjustable material properties on arbitrary substrates. Silicon nitride (SiN) is an industrial well-established and well-matured platform, which exhibits ultra-low propagation loss, but it is suboptimal for high-density reconfigurable photonics due to the large minimum bending radius and constrained tunability. In this work, we monolithically combine a-SiC with SiN photonics, leveraging the merits of both platforms, and achieve the a-SiC/SiN heterogeneous integration with an on-chip interconnection loss of 0.32$\pm$0.10 dB, and integration density increment exceeding 4,444-fold. By implementing active devices on a-SiC, we achieve 27 times higher thermo-optic tuning efficiency, with respect to the SiN photonic platform. In addition, the a-SiC/SiN platform gives the flexibility to choose the optimal fiber-to-chip coupling strategy depending on the interfacing platform, with efficient side-coupling on SiN and grating-coupling on a-SiC platform. The proposed a-SiC/SiN photonic platform can foster versatile applications in programmable and quantum photonics, nonlinear optics, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Phase mask fabrication for multi-plane light conversion using grayscale lithography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct writing laser (DWL) grayscale lithography is introduced as a novel fabrication technique for multi-plane light conversion (MPLC) phase masks, enabling direct transfer of precise depth profiles onto substrates via reactive ion etching and subsequent reflective coating. An MPLC system employing these masks achieves 92% fidelity in converting a Gaussian (TEM (0,0)) input to a Laguerre-Gaussian (LG(0,0)) mode. The fabricated masks exhibit sub-10 nm vertical resolution, surface roughness below 3 nm, and an R-squared value of 0.976. This method provides a scalable alternative to conventional multi-step lithographic fabrication for advanced photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Order in disorder: increased carrier mobility of downscaled amorphous semiconductors for high-speed thin film transistors in flexible electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Amorphous semiconductors are important channel semiconductors in thin film transistors (TFTs) which serve not only active-matrix displays, but also flexible electronics for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Nevertheless, a great limitation of amorphous semiconductors is their low carrier mobilities relative to their monocrystalline counterparts. Based on a recently established band fluctuation framework [Y. Luo and A. Flewitt, Phys. Rev. B 109, 104203 (2024)], this paper shows that the intrinsic carrier mobility of amorphous semiconductors can significantly increase simply through device downscaling, without any material-level optimizations. Specifically, it is revealed that the intrinsic electron mobility of hydrogenated amorphous silicon in a 10-nm long gap can increase by around 12 times, and does not compromise device-to-device uniformity. This mobility improvement is a result of reduced localized band tail states due to the ultra-short gap length relative to the band fluctuation length scale before downscaling; the latter is determined by the short- and medium-range structural order of the amorphous semiconductor.</description>

      <title>Photolithography-Compatible Three-Terminal Superconducting Switch for Driving CMOS Loads</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting devices have enabled breakthrough performance in quantum sensing and ultra-low-power computing. Nevertheless, the need for a cryo-electronics platform that can interface superconductor electronics with Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) devices has become increasingly evident in many cutting-edge applications. In this work, we present a three-terminal superconducting switch, fabricated using photolithography, that can directly interface with CMOS electronics. We investigate the switching characteristics of the micrometer-width superconducting wire-based cryotron (wTron) for different channel and gate dimensions by sweeping its terminal bias currents. The wTron exhibits an output impedance exceeding 1 k$\Omega$ and demonstrates reduced sensitivity to ambient magnetic noise, similar to its nanoscale predecessor, the nanocryotron. In addition, its micrometer-width wires have switching currents in the mA range, making wTrons well-suited for driving current-hungry resistive loads and highly capacitive CMOS loads. We demonstrate this capability of the wTron by driving room-temperature CMOS electronics, including an LED and a MOSFET with a gate capacitance of 500 pF. We also discuss design considerations for optimizing wTron device parameters to drive CMOS loads, such as MOSFETs, HEMTs, and electro-optic modulators. To demonstrate the foundry readiness of the wTron, we fabricated and characterized wTron devices using MIT Lincoln Laboratory's SFQ5ee superconducting fabrication process. Our work shows that wTron will facilitate the interface between superconductor electronics and CMOS, thereby paving the way for the development of foundry-compatible cryo-electronic ecosystems to advance next-generation computing and quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Strongly inhomogeneous spin dynamics induced by ultrashort laser pulses with a gradient intensity profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The optical pump-probe technique is a common tool for investigation of ultrafast spin dynamics, which usually utilizes single-diode detection averaging the dynamics over the pumped area. Using ultrafast imaging technique, we show experimentally that a femtosecond laser pulse with a gradient distribution of intensity efficiently excites strongly inhomogeneous spin dynamics on spatial scales much smaller than the pump spot size. The mechanism responsible for the inhomogeneous distribution is based on temperature gradients and corresponds to a sign change of the torque derivative in different areas of the pump. We argue that the observed phenomenon is general for the systems with competitive magnetic anisotropies. Overlooking this effect in the majority of pump-probe experiments may result in a dramatic underestimation of the live time and amplitude of the laser-induced spin dynamics.</description>

      <title>Ion Track Formation via Electric-Field-Enhanced Energy Deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12884v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-energy ion irradiation deposits extreme energy in a narrow range (1-10 nm) along ion trajectories in solid through electronic energy loss, producing unique irradiation effects such as ion tracks. However, intrinsic velocity effects impose an upper limit on electronic energy loss that cannot be overcome by adjusting irradiation parameters. We introduce a method using electric fields during irradiation to enhance nanoscale energy deposition by accelerating ion-excited electrons within sub-picosecond timescales.Our extended thermal spike model quantitatively describes this enhancement and predicts a significant reduction in the electronic energy loss required for ion track formation in amorphous SiO2, which is in excellent agreement with experimental observations. This work provides a new approach to control energy deposition during irradiation and boosts the wide application of ion tracks in material modification and nanoengineering to much broader extents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09453v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate nonreciprocal scattering within the modes of a microwave frequency comb. Adjusting the pump frequencies, amplitudes, and phases of a Josephson parametric oscillator, we control constructive interference for the $m \longrightarrow \ell$ scattering processes, while concurrently achieving destructive interference for the inverse process $\ell \longrightarrow m$. We outline the methodology for realizing nonreciprocity in the context of two-mode isolation and a three-mode circulation, which we extend to multiple modes. We find good agreement between the experiments and a linearized theoretical model. Nonreciprocal scattering expands the toolset for parametric control, with the potential to engineer alternative quantum correlations.</description>

      <title>Ferroelastic Altermagnetism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synergizing altermagnetism and other ferroic orders, such as ferroelectric switchable altermagnetism [Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 106801 (2025) and ibid. 106802 (2025)], offers an effective route to achieve nonvolatile switching of altermagnetic spin splitting. In this work, by synergizing altermagnetism and ferroelasticity, we propose the concept of ferroelastic altermagnets in which the ferroelastic crystal reorientation can drive multistate nonvolatile switching of the altermagnetic spin splitting via altermagnetoelastic effect. Using monolayers RuF4 and CuF2 as material candidates, we demonstrate 2-state and 3-state altermagnetic spin splitting switching as driven by ferroelastic strain states. Transport calculation shows that multistate spin conductivities can be ferroelastically encoded in an ferroelastic altermagnet, thus suggesting the potential of ferroelastic altermagnetic as nonvolatile nanomechanical spin switches. The proposed concept of ferroelastic altermagnetism enriches the emerging landscape of multiferroic altermagnetism, paving a way towards altermagnetic-based straintronic device applications.</description>
