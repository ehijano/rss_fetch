      <title>Sharp phase transition in the grand canonical $\Phi^3$ measure at critical chemical potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the phase transition and critical phenomenon for the grand canonical $\Phi^3$ measure in two-dimensional Euclidean quantum field theory. The study of this measure was initiated by Jaffe, Bourgain, and Carlen--Fr\"ohlich--Lebowitz, primarily in regimes far from criticality. We identify a critical chemical potential and show that the measure exhibits a sharp phase transition at this critical threshold. At the critical threshold, the analysis is based on establishing the correlation decay of the Gaussian fluctuations in the partition function, combined with a coarse-graining argument to show divergence of the maximum of an approximating Gaussian process.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity Criterion for One-Sided, One-Dimensional IPS with a Long-Lived State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study one-dimensional, one-sided, nearest-neighbor Interacting Particle Systems (IPS) with positive rates and identify a criterion for ergodicity based on the presence of a long lived state a site can occupy. The criterion is that the IPS admits a state with a ratio of rates of exiting to entering below~$\sqrt{2}$. The main idea is that under the canonical coupling, it is possible to identify large blocks in spacetime where two coupled trajectories must agree to share the special state, which inhibits the spread of disagreement. The result covers much of the parameter region left open by earlier work on the Positive Rates Conjecture (PRC) for simple IPS, narrowing the unresolved IPS to noisy versions of the East model.</description>

      <title>A note on small probabilities for spherical random fields at a critical regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider time-dependent space isotropic and time stationary spherical Gaussian random fields. We establish Chung's law of the iterated logarithm and solve the small probabilities problem. Our results depend on the high-frequency behaviour of the angular power spectrum: the speed of decay of the small ball probability is faster as either the memory parameter or the space-parameter decreases.</description>

      <title>Large Deviation Asymptotics for the Supermarket Model with Growing Choices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Markovian supermarket model with growing choices, where jobs arrive at rate $n\lambda_n$ and each of $n$ parallel servers processes jobs in its queue at rate $1$. Each incoming job joins the shortest among $d_n \in \{1,\dotsc,n\}$ randomly selected queues. Under the assumption $d_n \to \infty$ and $\lambda_n \to \lambda \in (0,\infty)$ as $n\to \infty$, a large deviation principle (LDP) for the occupancy process is established in a suitable infinite-dimensional path space, and it is shown that the rate function is invariant with respect to the manner in which $d_n \to \infty$. The LDP gives information on the rate of decay of probabilities of various types of rare events associated with the system. We illustrate this by establishing explicit exponential decay rates for probabilities of large total number of jobs in the system. As a corollary, we also show that probabilities of certain rare events can indeed depend on the rate of $d_n \to \infty$.</description>

      <title>Ballistic aggregation displays self-organized criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the convex hull of a collection of disjoint open discs with radii $1/2$. The boundary of the convex hull consists of a finite number of line segments and arcs. Randomly choose a point in one of the arcs in the boundary so that the density of its distribution is proportional to the arc measure. Attach a new disc at the chosen point so that it is outside of the convex hull and tangential to its boundary. Replace the original convex hull with the convex hull of all preexisting discs and the new disc. Continue in the same manner. Simulations show that disc clusters form long, straight, or slightly curved filaments with small side branches and occasional macroscopic side branches. The shape of the convex hull is either an equilateral triangle or a quadrangle. Side branches play the role analogous to avalanches in sandpile models, one of the best-known examples of self-organized criticality (SOC). Our results indicate that the size of a branch obeys a power law, as expected of avalanches in sandpile models and similar ``catastrophies'' in other SOC models.</description>

      <title>The fluctuations of the mod p rank of triangular matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider random lower triangular matrices such that the entries on and below the diagonal are i.i.d. copies of some $\mathbb{Z}$-valued random variable. We prove that the Sylow $p$-subgroups of the cokernels of these matrices have the same constant order fluctuations as that of the matrix products studied by Nguyen and Van Peski.
  As a special case, we can describe the limiting fluctuations of the rank of lower triangular matrices over $\mathbb{F}_p$ with i.i.d. random entries on and below the diagonal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scientific process is a means for turning the results of experiments into knowledge about the world in which we live. Much research effort has been directed toward automating this process. To do this, one needs to formulate the scientific process in a precise mathematical language. This paper outlines one such language. What is presented here is hardly new. The material leans much on great thinkers of times past as well as more modern contributions. The novel contributions of this paper are: A new, general data processing inequality, a bias variance decomposition for canonical losses, Streamlined proofs of the Blackwell-Sherman-Stein and Randomization Theorems, and Means to calculate deficiency via linear programming.</description>

      <title>Epidemic Spreading with Co-infection on Long-Range Random Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a discrete-time co-infection epidemic model on spatial networks incorporating both random and long-range interactions. Using numerical analysis, we investigate how the co-infection recovery rate ($\mu$), the interaction distance decay exponent ($\alpha$), and network connectivity parameters affect epidemic persistence. Our results show that lower values of ($\mu$) facilitate long-term survival, and that the presence of long-range connections ($\alpha &gt; 0$) robustly enhances persistence, often outweighing the effects of co-infection dynamics and local connectivity. These findings highlight nontrivial threshold behavior and the critical role of long-range structure in heterogeneous, nonlocal epidemic systems.</description>

      <title>The 2R-Conjecture for the Hegselmann--Krause Model: A Proof in Expectation and New Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hegselmann--Krause models are localized, distributed averaging dynamics on spatial data. A key aspect of these dynamics is that they lead to cluster formation, which has important applications in geographic information systems, dynamic clustering algorithms, opinion dynamics, and social networks. For these models, the key questions are whether a fixed point exists and, if so, characterizing it. In this work, we establish new results towards the "2R-Conjecture" for the Hegselmann--Krause model, for which no meaningful progress, or even any precise statement, has been made since its introduction in 2007. This conjecture relates to the structure of the fixed point when there are a large number of agents per unit space. We provide, among other results, a proof in expectation and a statement of a stronger result that is supported by simulation. The key methodological contribution is to consider the dynamics as an infinite-dimensional problem on the space of point processes, rather than on finitely many points. This enables us to leverage stationarity, shift invariance, and certain other symmetries to obtain the results. These techniques do not have finite-dimensional analogs.</description>

      <title>An abstract criterion on the existence and global stability of stationary solutions for random dynamical systems and its applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a concise and easily verifiable criterion on the existence and global stability of stationary solutions for random dynamical systems (RDSs). As a consequence, we can show that the $\omega$-limit sets of all pullback trajectories of semilnear/nonlinear stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with additive/multiplicative white noise are composed of nontrivial random equilibria. The proof is different from the classical RDS scheme, which was established in \cite{CKS}. Furthermore, in the applications of stability analysis for SDEs, our conditions are not only sufficient but indeed sharp.</description>

      <title>Control-affine Schr\"odinger Bridge and Generalized Bohm Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The control-affine Schr\"odinger bridge concerns with a stochastic optimal control problem. Its solution is a controlled evolution of joint state probability density subject to a control-affine It\^o diffusion with a given deadline connecting a given pair of initial and terminal densities. In this work, we recast the necessary conditions of optimality for the control-affine Schr\"odinger bridge problem as a two point boundary value problem for a quantum mechanical Schr\"odinger PDE with complex potential. This complex-valued potential is a generalization of the real-valued Bohm potential in quantum mechanics. Our derived potential is akin to the optical potential in nuclear physics where the real part of the potential encodes elastic scattering (transmission of wave function), and the imaginary part encodes inelastic scattering (absorption of wave function). The key takeaway is that the process noise that drives the evolution of probability densities induces an absorbing medium in the evolution of wave function. These results make new connections between control theory and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics through the lens of quantum mechanics.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be an acylindrically hyperbolic group. We prove that Bernoulli bond percolation on every Cayley graph of $G$ has a nonuniqueness phase, in which there are infinitely many infinite clusters. This generalizes Hutchcroft's result for Gromov hyperbolic graphs to relatively hyperbolic groups, mapping class groups and rank-1 CAT(0) groups for example.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the classical theorems of Khintchine and Schmidt in metric Diophantine approximation to the context of self-similar measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$. For this, we establish effective equidistribution of associated random walks on $\text{SL}_{d+1}(\mathbb{R})/\text{SL}_{d+1}(\mathbb{Z})$.
  This generalizes our previous work which requires $d=1$ and restricts Schmidt-type counting estimates to approximation functions which decay fast enough.
  Novel techniques include a bootstrap scheme for the associated random walks despite algebraic obstructions, and a refined treatment of Dani's correspondence. We also establish non-concentration properties of self-similar measures near algebraic subvarieties of $\mathbb{R}^d$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2008.03052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize all multi-dimensional real self-similar Gaussian Markov processes. Three types of covariance matrix functions occur: white-noise type functions, covariances that can be expressed by continuous matrix semigroups, and covariances based on non-continuous solutions of Cauchy's functional equation. Characterizing the latter requires us to develop some results on the representation theory of non-continuous matrix semigroups, which are presented in a companion paper. In dimension one, besides white noise, the self-similar Gaussian Markov processes reduce to a two-parameter family of time-changed Brownian motions. This observation simplifies several proofs of non-Markovianity of concrete processes found in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a general formulation of the classical two-player Dynkin game in a discrete time Markovian setting. We identify an appropriate class of mixed strategies -- \textit{Markovian randomized stopping times} -- in which players stop at any given state with a state-dependent probability. One main result is an explicit characterization of Wald-Bellman-type for Nash equilibria based on this notion of randomization. In particular, we derive a novel characterization of randomized equilibria in zero-sum Dynkin games, which we use to (i) establish the existence and explicit construction of Markovian randomized equilibria, (ii) provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the non-existence of pure strategy equilibria, and (iii) construct an example that admits a unique randomized equilibrium but no pure one. We also provide existence and characterization results in the symmetric version of our game. Finally, we establish existence of a characterizable equilibrium in Markovian randomized stopping times for the general game formulation under the assumption that the state space is countable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04720v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a spiked random matrix model obtained by applying a function entrywise to a signal-plus-noise symmetric data matrix. We prove that the largest eigenvalue of this model, which we call a transformed spiked Wigner matrix, exhibits Baik-Ben Arous--P\'ech\'e (BBP) type phase transition. We show that the law of the fluctuation converges to the Gaussian distribution when the effective signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is above the critical number, and to the GOE Tracy-Widom distribution when the effective SNR is below the critical number. We provide precise formulas for the limiting distributions and also concentration estimates for the largest eigenvalues, both in the supercritical and the subcritical regimes.</description>

      <title>Dichotomy in the small-time asymptotics of spectral heat content for L\'evy processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08110v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a dichotomy in the small-time asymptotic behavior of the spectral heat content (SHC) for symmetric, but not necessarily isotropic, L\'evy processes whose L\'evy density satisfies a weak lower scaling condition near zero. This dichotomy is governed by whether the process has unbounded or bounded variation. In the unbounded variation case, the leading asymptotic behavior of the SHC is determined by the expected supremum of the process projected in the normal direction near the boundary. In contrast, for processes with bounded variation, the SHC decays linearly in time. Our main result, Theorem \ref{thm:main}, extends and unifies key results from \cite{GPS19}, \cite{KP24}, and \cite{PS22}, covering a broader class of non-isotropic L\'evy processes and offering a streamlined proof.</description>

      <title>Law of the Iterated Logarithm for Markov Semigroups with Exponential Mixing in the Wasserstein Distance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the law of the iterated logarithm for a wide class of non-stationary, continuous-time Markov processes evolving on Polish spaces. Specifically, our result applies to certain additive functionals of processes governed by stochastically continuous Markov-Feller semigroups that exhibit exponential mixing and non-expansiveness in the Wasserstein distance, provided that a suitable moment condition involving the initial distribution is satisfied. Furthermore, we outline the application of this result to a Markov process arising as the solution of an infinite-dimensional stochastic differential equation with dissipative drift and additive noise.</description>

      <title>Stability of randomly switching stochastic reaction networks with asymptotically linear transition rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic reaction networks are mathematical models frequently used in, but not limited to, biochemistry. These models are continuous-time Markov chains whose transition rates depend on certain parameters called rate constants, which despite the name may not be constant in real-world applications. In this paper we study how random switching between different stochastic reaction networks with asymptotically linear rate functions affects the stability of the process. We give matrix conditions for both positive recurrence (indeed, exponentially ergodicity) and transience (indeed, evanescence) in both the regime with high switching rates and the regime with low switching rates. We then make use of these conditions to provide examples of processes whose stability behavior changes as the switching rate varies. We also explore what happens in the middle regime where the switching rates are neither high nor low and our theorems do not apply. Specifically, we show by examples that there can be arbitrarily many phase transitions between exponentially ergodicity and evanescence as the switching rate increases.</description>

      <title>Large prime gaps and probabilistic models</title>

      <description>arXiv:1908.08613v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new probabilistic model of the primes consisting of integers that survive the sieving process when a random residue class is selected for every prime modulus below a specific bound. From a rigorous analysis of this model, we obtain heuristic upper and lower bounds for the size of the largest prime gap in the interval $[1,x]$. Our results are stated in terms of the extremal bounds in the interval sieve problem. The same methods also allow us to rigorously relate the validity of the Hardy-Littlewood conjectures for an arbitrary set (such as the actual primes) to lower bounds for the largest gaps within that set.</description>

      <title>The degree-restricted random process is far from uniform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.00835v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The degree-restricted random process is a natural algorithmic model for generating graphs with degree sequence D_n=(d_1, \ldots, d_n): starting with an empty n-vertex graph, it sequentially adds new random edges so that the degree of each vertex v_i remains at most d_i. Wormald conjectured in 1999 that, for d-regular degree sequences D_n, the final graph of this process is similar to a uniform random d-regular graph.
  In this paper we show that, for degree sequences D_n that are not nearly regular, the final graph of the degree-restricted random process differs substantially from a uniform random graph with degree sequence D_n. The combinatorial proof technique is our main conceptual contribution: we adapt the switching method to the degree-restricted process, demonstrating that this enumeration technique can also be used to analyze stochastic processes (rather than just uniform random models, as before).</description>

      <title>Sharp Thresholds for Factors in Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a graph on $r$ vertices and let $G$ be a graph on $n$ vertices. Then an $F$-factor in $G$ is a subgraph of $G$ composed of $n/r$ vertex-disjoint copies of $F$, if $r$ divides $n$. In other words, an $F$-factor yields a partition of the $n$ vertices of $G$. The study of such $F$-factors in the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph dates back to Erd\H{o}s himself. Decades later, in 2008, Johansson, Kahn and Vu established the thresholds for the existence of an $F$-factor for strictly 1-balanced $F$ -- up to the leading constant. The sharp thresholds, meaning the leading constants, were obtained only recently by Riordan and Heckel, but only for complete graphs $F=K_r$ and for so-called nice graphs. Their results rely on sophisticated couplings that utilize the recent, celebrated solution of Shamir's problem by Kahn.
  We extend the couplings by Riordan and Heckel to any strictly 1-balanced $F$ and thereby obtain the sharp threshold for the existence of an $F$-factor. In particular, we confirm the thirty year old conjecture by Ruc\'inski that this sharp threshold indeed coincides with the sharp threshold for the disappearance of the last vertices which are not contained in a copy of $F$.</description>

      <title>Optimal low-rank posterior mean and distribution approximation in linear Gaussian inverse problems on Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24209v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we construct optimal low-rank approximations for the Gaussian posterior distribution in linear Gaussian inverse problems with possibly infinite-dimensional separable Hilbert parameter spaces and finite-dimensional data spaces. We consider different approximation families for the posterior. We first consider approximate posteriors in which the means vary among a class of either structure-preserving or structure-ignoring low-rank transformations of the data, and in which the posterior covariance is kept fixed. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for these approximating posteriors to be equivalent to the exact posterior, for all possible realisations of the data simultaneously. For such approximations, we measure approximation error with the Kullback-Leibler, R\'enyi and Amari $\alpha$-divergences for $\alpha\in(0,1)$, and with the Hellinger distance, all averaged over the data distribution. With these losses, we find the optimal approximations and formulate an equivalent condition for their uniqueness, extending the work in finite dimensions of Spantini et al. (SIAM J. Sci. Comput. 2015). We then consider joint low-rank approximation of the mean and covariance. For the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence, we show that the separate optimal approximations of the mean and of the covariance can be combined to yield an optimal joint approximation of the mean and covariance. In addition, we interpret the joint approximation with the optimal structure-ignoring approximate mean in terms of an optimal projector in parameter space, showing this approximation amounts to solving a Bayesian inverse problem with projected forward model.</description>

      <title>Nested importance sampling for Bayesian inference: error bounds and the role of dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many Bayesian inference problems involve high dimensional models for which only a subset of the model variables are of actual interest. All other variables are just nuisance parameters that one would ideally like to integrate out analytically. Unfortunately, such integration is often impossible. There are several computational methods that have been proposed over the past 15 years that replace intractable analytical marginalization by numerical integration, typically using different flavours of importance sampling (IS). Such methods include particle Markov chain Monte Carlo, sequential Monte Carlo squared (SMC$^2$), IS$^2$, nested particle filters, and others. In this paper, we investigate the role of the dimension of the nuisance variables in the error bounds achieved by nested IS methods in Bayesian inference. We prove that, under suitable regularity assumptions on the model, the approximation errors increase at a polynomial (rather than exponential) rate w.r.t. the dimension of the nuisance variables. Our analysis relies on tools from functional analysis and measure theory, and it includes the case of polynomials of degree zero, where the approximation error remains uniformly bounded, even as the dimension of the nuisance variables grows without bound. We also show how the general analysis can be applied to specific classes of models, including linear and Gaussian settings, models with bounded observation functions, and others. These findings improve the current understanding of how the performance of IS techniques scales with dimension in Bayesian inference problems.</description>
