      <title>StrNim: a variant of Nim played on strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16781v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a variant of Nim, named StrNim. Whereas a position in Nim is a tuple of non-negative integers, that in StrNim is a string, a sequence of characters. In every turn, each player shrinks the string, by removing a substring repeating the same character. As a first study on this new game, we present some sufficient conditions for the positions to be P-positions.</description>

      <title>Reallocating Wasted Votes in Proportional Parliamentary Elections with Thresholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many proportional parliamentary elections, electoral thresholds (typically 3-5%) are used to promote stability and governability by preventing the election of parties with very small representation. However, these thresholds often result in a significant number of "wasted votes" cast for parties that fail to meet the threshold, which reduces representativeness. One proposal is to allow voters to specify replacement votes, by either indicating a second choice party or by ranking a subset of the parties, but there are several ways of deciding on the scores of the parties (and thus the composition of the parliament) given those votes. We introduce a formal model of party voting with thresholds, and compare a variety of party selection rules axiomatically, and experimentally using a dataset we collected during the 2024 European election in France. We identify three particularly attractive rules, called Direct Winners Only (DO), Single Transferable Vote (STV) and Greedy Plurality (GP).</description>

      <title>Cycle Patterns and Mean Payoff Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of a \emph{cycle pattern} for directed graphs as functions from the set of cycles to the set $\{-,0,+\}$. The key example for such a pattern is derived from a weight function, giving rise to the sign of the total weight of the edges for each cycle. Hence, cycle patterns describe a fundamental structure of a weighted digraph, and they arise naturally in games on graphs, in particular parity games, mean payoff games, and energy games.
  Our contribution is threefold: we analyze the structure and derive hardness results for the realization of cycle patterns by weight functions. Then we use them to show hardness of solving games given the limited information of a cycle pattern. Finally, we identify a novel geometric hardness measure for solving mean payoff games (MPG) using the framework of linear decision trees, and use cycle patterns to derive lower bounds with respect to this measure, for large classes of algorithms for MPGs.</description>

      <title>Federated Digital Twin Construction via Distributed Sensing: A Game-Theoretic Online Optimization with Overlapping Coalitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel federated framework for constructing the digital twin (DT) model, referring to a living and self-evolving visualization model empowered by artificial intelligence, enabled by distributed sensing under edge-cloud collaboration. In this framework, the DT model to be built at the cloud is regarded as a global one being split into and integrating from multiple functional components, i.e., partial-DTs, created at various edge servers (ESs) using feature data collected by associated sensors. Considering time-varying DT evolutions and heterogeneities among partial-DTs, we formulate an online problem that jointly and dynamically optimizes partial-DT assignments from the cloud to ESs, ES-sensor associations for partial-DT creation, and as well as computation and communication resource allocations for global-DT integration. The problem aims to maximize the constructed DT's model quality while minimizing all induced costs, including energy consumption and configuration costs, in long runs. To this end, we first transform the original problem into an equivalent hierarchical game with an upper-layer two-sided matching game and a lower-layer overlapping coalition formation game. After analyzing these games in detail, we apply the Gale-Shapley algorithm and particularly develop a switch rules-based overlapping coalition formation algorithm to obtain short-term equilibria of upper-layer and lower-layer subgames, respectively. Then, we design a deep reinforcement learning-based solution, called DMO, to extend the result into a long-term equilibrium of the hierarchical game, thereby producing the solution to the original problem. Simulations show the effectiveness of the introduced framework, and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed solution over counterparts.</description>

      <title>Verifying Equilibria in Finite-Horizon Probabilistic Concurrent Game Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14690v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finite-horizon probabilistic multiagent concurrent game systems, also known as finite multiplayer stochastic games, are a well-studied model in computer science due to their ability to represent a wide range of real-world scenarios involving strategic interactions among agents over a finite amount of iterations (given by the finite-horizon). The analysis of these games typically focuses on evaluating (verifying) and computing (synthesizing/realizing) which strategy profiles (functions that represent the behavior of each agent) qualify as equilibria. The two most prominent equilibrium concepts are the Nash equilibrium and the subgame perfect equilibrium, with the latter considered a conceptual refinement of the former. However, computing these equilibria from scratch is often computationally infeasible. Therefore, recent attention has shifted to the verification problem, where a given strategy profile must be evaluated to determine whether it satisfies equilibrium conditions. In this paper, we demonstrate that the verification problem for subgame perfect equilibria lies in PSPACE, while for Nash equilibria, it is EXPTIME-complete. This is a highly counterintuitive result since subgame perfect equilibria are often seen as a strict strengthening of Nash equilibria and are intuitively seen as more complicated.</description>

      <title>Should the Timing of Inspections be Predictable?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01385v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A principal hires an agent to work on a long-term project that culminates in a breakthrough or a breakdown. At each time, the agent privately chooses to work or shirk. Working increases the arrival rate of breakthroughs and decreases the arrival rate of breakdowns. To motivate the agent to work, the principal conducts costly inspections. She fires the agent if shirking is detected. We characterize the principal's optimal inspection policy. Predictable inspections are optimal if work primarily generates breakthroughs. Random inspections are optimal if work primarily prevents breakdowns. Crucially, the agent's actions determine his risk attitude over the timing of punishments.</description>
