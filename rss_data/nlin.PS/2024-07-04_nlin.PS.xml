      <title>Dissipation-driven emergence of a soliton condensate in a nonlinear electrical transmission line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an experimental study on the perturbed evolution of Korteweg-deVries soliton gases in a weakly dissipative nonlinear electrical transmission line. The system's dynamics reveal that an initially dense, fully randomized, soliton gas evolves into a coherent macroscopic state identified as a soliton condensate through nonlinear spectral analysis. The emergence of the soliton condensate is driven by the spatial rearrangement of the systems's eigenmodes and by the proliferation of new solitonic states due to nonadiabatic effects, a phenomenon not accounted for by the existing hydrodynamic theories.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal patterns in the active cyclic Potts model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nonequilibrium dynamics of a cycling three state Potts model is studied on a square lattice using Monte Carlo simulations and continuum theory. This model is relevant to chemical reactions on a catalytic surface and to molecular transport across a membrane. Several characteristic modes are formed depending on the flipping energies between successive states and the contact energies between neighboring sites. Under cyclic symmetry conditions, cycling homogeneous phases and spiral waves form at low and high flipping energies, respectively. In the intermediate flipping energy regime, these two modes coexist temporally in small systems and/or at low contact energies. Under asymmetric conditions, we observed small biphasic domains exhibiting amoeba-like locomotion and temporal coexistence of spiral waves and a dominant non-cyclic one-state phase. An increase in the flipping energy between two successive states, say state 0 and state 1, while keeping the other flipping energies constant, induces the formation of the third phase (state 2), owing to the suppression of the nucleation of state 0 domains. Under asymmetric conditions regarding the contact energies, two different modes can appear depending on the initial state, due to a hysteresis phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Influence of density-dependent diffusion on pattern formation in a bounded habitat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.11638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Considering a nonlocal version of the Fisher-KPP equation, we explore the impact of heterogeneous diffusion on pattern formation within a bounded region (refuge). Under homogeneous diffusion, it is established that, nonlocality can lead to spontaneous pattern formation under certain parameter conditions, otherwise, when the homogeneous state is stable, spatial perturbations such as the existence of a refuge (high quality region within a hostile environment) can induce patterns. To understand how density-dependent diffusivity influences these forms of pattern formation, we examine diffusivity reactions to both rarefaction or overcrowding. Additionally, for comparison, we investigate the scenario where diffusivity levels vary spatially, inside and outside the refuge. We find that state-dependent diffusivity affects the shape and stability of patterns, potentially triggering either explosive growth or fragmentation of the population distribution, depending on how diffusion responses to density changes.</description>

      <title>A framework to identify supercritical and subcritical Turing bifurcations: Case study of a system sustaining cubic and quadratic autocatalysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we focus on an autocatalytic reaction-diffusion model and carry out multiple scale weakly nonlinear analysis. A cubic and a quadratic autocatalytic reaction system is analysed. We develop a framework to identify the critical surfaces in parameter space across which the nature of the Turing bifurcation changes from supercritical to subcritical. These are verified by direct numerical simulations of the system. Using weakly nonlinear analysis, we derive equations up to the fifth order that governs the amplitude of the spatial patterns. The limit point of the bifurcating solution is captured accurately by extending the analysis to the fifth order for the case of subcritical bifurcation. The numerical solutions are in good agreement with the predictions of the weakly nonlinear analysis for supercritical bifurcations. We show that when multiple steady states arise Turing patterns can coexist with another spatially uniform steady states. Furthermore, we show that our framework can be extended to get different patterns like squares and hexagons in a two-dimensional domain. We show that the shape of Turing patterns is influenced by the domain size. This shows that the geometry can influence the kind of patterns formed in natural systems. This study will aid the experimentalist identify operating conditions where Turing patterns can be obtained.</description>
