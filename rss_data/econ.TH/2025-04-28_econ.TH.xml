      <title>Hua-Chen New Theory of Economic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Between 1957-1985, Chinese mathematician Loo-Keng Hua pioneered economic optimization theory through three key contributions: establishing economic stability's fundamental theorem, proving the uniqueness of equilibrium solutions in economic systems, and developing a consumption-integrated model 50 days before his death. Since 1988, Mu-Fa Chen has been working on Hua's theory. He introduced stochastics, namely Markov chains, to economic optimization theory. He updated and developed Hua's model and came up with a new model (Chen's model) which has become the starting point of a new economic optimization theory. Chen's theory can be applied to economic stability test, bankruptcy prediction, product ranking and classification, economic prediction and adjustment, economic structure optimization. Chen's theory can also provide efficient algorithms that are programmable and intelligent. {Stochastics} is the cornerstone of Chen's theory. There is no overlap between Chen's theory, and the existing mathematical economy theory and the economics developments that were awarded Nobel Prizes in Economics between 1969 and 2024. The distinguished features of Chen's theory from the existing theories are quantitative, calculable, predictable, optimizable, programmable and can be intelligent. This survey provides a theoretical overview of the newly published monograph \cite{5rw24}. Specifically, the invariant of the economic structure matrix, also known as the Chen's invariant, was first published in this survey.</description>

      <title>Positively Homogeneous Saddle-Functions and Euler's Theorem in Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Connections are made between solution concepts for games in characteristic function form and Euler's Theorem underlying the neo-classical theory of distribution in which the total output produced is imputed to the marginal products of the inputs producing it. The assumptions for Euler's Theorem are constant returns (positive homogeneity) and differentiability of the production function. Representing characteristic functions in a vector space setting, marginal products of commodity inputs are translated as marginal products of individuals. Marginal products for discrete (resp. infinitesimal) individuals are defined by discrete (resp. infinitesimal) directional derivates. Additivity of directional derivatives underlies the definition of differentiability in both discrete and infinitesimal settings. A key distinction is between characteristic functions defined by von Neumann and Morgenstern (vNM) which do not necessarily exhibit concavity and characteristic function that do. A modification of the definition, interpreted as introducing ``property rights,'' implies concavity. The Shapley value is a redefinition of an individual's marginal product for a (vNM) characteristic function. Concave characteristic functions do not require such redefinition. Concave characteristic functions imply the existence of positively homogeneous saddle-function functions whose saddle-points represent equilbria of the game. The saddle-point property applies to games with populations consisting of any number of individuals each type. When there is a small integer number of each type, the saddle-point property is often, but not always, inconsistent with the Euler condition, that each individual receives its marginal contribution. Conversely, the saddle-point condition is typically, but not always, consistent with the Euler condition when there are a large number of each type.</description>

      <title>Rediscovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model search in settings where decision makers know what can be found but not where to find it. A searcher faces a set of choices arranged by an observable attribute. Each period, she either selects a choice and pays a cost to learn about its quality, or she concludes search to take her best discovery to date. She knows that similar choices have similar qualities and uses this to guide her search. We identify robustly optimal search policies with a simple structure. Search is directional, recall is never invoked, there is a threshold stopping rule, and the policy at each history depends only on a simple index.</description>

      <title>Preference Evolution under Partner Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11504v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a model that investigates preference evolution with endogenous matching. In the short run, individuals' subjective preferences influence partner selection and behavior in strategic interactions, which affect their material payoffs. These payoffs, in turn, determine how preferences evolve in the long run. To properly model the "match-to-interact" process, we combine stable matching and equilibrium concepts. Our analysis shows that endogenous matching gives rise to the evolutionary stability of a class of preferences that exhibit both affinity bias and efficient play. Such preferences stand out in the evolutionary process because they are able to force positive assortative matching and joint payoff maximization. Under incomplete information, a strong form of affinity bias, parochialism, is necessary for a preference to prevail in evolution, because stronger incentives are required to engage in self-sorting with information friction.</description>

      <title>An extension of May's Theorem to three alternatives: axiomatizing Minimax voting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14256v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: May's Theorem [K. O. May, Econometrica 20 (1952) 680-684] characterizes majority voting on two alternatives as the unique preferential voting method satisfying several simple axioms. Here we show that by adding some desirable axioms to May's axioms, we can uniquely determine how to vote on three alternatives (setting aside tiebreaking). In particular, we add two axioms stating that the voting method should mitigate spoiler effects and avoid the so-called strong no show paradox. We prove a theorem stating that any preferential voting method satisfying our enlarged set of axioms, which includes some weak homogeneity and preservation axioms, must choose from among the Minimax winners in all three-alternative elections. When applied to more than three alternatives, our axioms also distinguish Minimax from other known voting methods that coincide with or refine Minimax for three alternatives.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous elections in a polarized society make single-party sweeps more likely</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a country with many elections, it may prove economically expedient to hold multiple elections simultaneously on a common polling date. We show that in a polarized society, in which each voter has a preferred party, an increase in the simultaneity of polling will increase the likelihood of a single-party sweep, namely, it will become more likely that a single party wins all the elections.
  In fact we show that the sweep probability goes up for \emph{every} party. Thus the phenomenon we describe is independent of the ``coattail'' or ``down-ballot'' effect of a popular leader. It is a \emph{systemic} and \emph{persistent} macroscopic political change, effected by a combination of political polarization and simultaneity of polling.
  Our result holds under fairly general conditions and is applicable to many common real-world electoral systems, including \emph{first-past-the-post} (most voters) and \emph{party list proportional representation} (most countries). In the course of our proof, we obtain a generalization of the well-known Harris correlation inequality.</description>
