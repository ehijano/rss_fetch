      <title>Study of isoscalar scalar $bc\bar u\bar d$ tetraquark $T_{bc}$ from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a lattice QCD study of the elastic $S$-wave $D\bar{B}$ scattering in search of tetraquark candidates with explicitly exotic flavor content $bc\bar u\bar d$ in the isospin $I\!=\!0$ and $J^P=0^+$ channel. We use four lattice QCD ensembles with dynamical $u/d$, $s$, and $c$ quark fields generated by the MILC Collaboration. A non-relativistic QCD Hamiltonian, including improvement coefficients up to $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_sv^4)$, is utilized for the bottom quarks. For the rest of the valence quarks we employ a relativistic overlap action. Five different valence quark masses are utilized to study the light quark mass dependence of the $D\bar{B}$ scattering amplitude. The finite volume energy spectra are extracted following a variational approach. The elastic $D\bar{B}$ scattering amplitudes are extracted employing L\"{u}scher's prescription. The light quark mass dependence of the continuum extrapolated amplitudes suggests an attractive interaction between the $\bar B$ and $D$ mesons. At the physical pseudoscalar meson mass ($M_{ps}=M_{\pi}$) the $D\bar{B}$ scattering amplitude has a sub-threshold pole corresponding to a binding energy of $-39(^{+4}_{-6})(^{~+8}_{-18}) \mbox{~MeV}$ with respect to the $D\bar{B}$ threshold. The critical $M_{ps}$ at which the $D\bar{B}$ scattering length diverges and the system becomes unbound corresponds to $M^*_{ps}=2.94(15)(5) \mbox{~GeV}$. This result can hold significant experimental relevance in the search for a bound scalar $T_{bc}$ tetraquark, which could well be the next "doubly heavy" bound tetraquark to be discovered with only weak decay modes.</description>

      <title>Primary and Secondary Order Parameters in the Fully Frustrated Transverse Field Ising Model on the Square Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using quantum Monte Carlo simulations and field-theory arguments, we study the fully frustrated (Villain) transverse-field Ising model on the square lattice. We consider a "primary" spin order parameter and a "secondary" dimer order parameter, which both lead to the same phase diagram but detect $Z_8$ and $Z_4$ symmetry, respectively. The spin order scales with conventional exponents, both in the finite temperature critical phase and at the $T = 0$ quantum critical point. The scaling of the dimer order requires more detailed investigations of the applicable low-energy theories; the height model at $T &gt; 0$ and the $O(2)$ model in 2+1 dimensions at $T = 0$. Relating the order parameters to operators in these effective models, we predict the secondary critical exponents and confirm them numerically. The relationships between the primary and secondary order parameters have not been previously discussed in this context and provide insight more broadly for Ising models whose low-energy physics involves dimer degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Analytic and numerical bootstrap for the long-range Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02742v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We combine perturbation theory with analytic and numerical bootstrap techniques to study the critical point of the long-range Ising (LRI) model in two and three dimensions. This model interpolates between short-range Ising (SRI) and mean-field behaviour. We use the Lorentzian inversion formula to compute infinitely many three-loop corrections in the two-dimensional LRI near the mean-field end. We further exploit the exact OPE relations that follow from bulk locality of the LRI to compute infinitely many two-loop corrections near the mean-field end, as well as some one-loop corrections near SRI. By including such exact OPE relations in the crossing equations for LRI we set up a very constrained bootstrap problem, which we solve numerically using SDPB. We find a family of sharp kinks for two- and three-dimensional theories which compare favourably to perturbative predictions, as well as some Monte Carlo simulations for the two-dimensional LRI.</description>

      <title>Investigations of $\Lambda$ states with spin-parity $\frac{3}{2}^{\pm}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00134v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present study provides spectroscopic investigations of spin-$\frac{3}{2}$ $\Lambda$ baryons with both positive and negative parities. The analysis mainly focuses on three states, namely $1P$, $2P$, and $2S$, and corresponding masses are calculated using the QCD sum rule method. To implement the method, we apply two types of interpolating currents with octet and singlet quantum numbers and compare the corresponding results with the reported masses of experimentally observed states. From the comparisons, it is extracted that the results of interpolating current with octet quantum numbers are in good agreement with the experimentally measured masses. The masses obtained with this interpolating current are $m=1513.64\pm 8.76$ MeV for $1P$ state with $J^P=\frac{3}{2}^-$, $m'=1687.91\pm 0.31$ MeV for $2P$ state with $J^P=\frac{3}{2}^-$ and $\tilde{m}=1882.37 \pm 11.95$ MeV for $2S$ state with $J^P=\frac{3}{2}^+$ and they are consistent with the experimental masses of $\Lambda(1520)$, $\Lambda(1690)$ and $\Lambda(1890)$, respectively, which confirm their spin-parity quantum numbers. Besides, we calculate the corresponding current coupling constants, which are utilized as inputs in the calculations of different form factors defining the widths of the states under study.</description>
