      <title>On the modification and revocation of open source licences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Historically, open source commitments have been deemed irrevocable once materials are released under open source licenses. In this paper, the authors argue for the creation of a subset of rights that allows open source contributors to force users to (i) update to the most recent version of a model, (ii) accept new use case restrictions, or even (iii) cease using the software entirely. While this would be a departure from the traditional open source approach, the legal, reputational and moral risks related to open-sourcing AI models could justify contributors having more control over downstream uses. Recent legislative changes have also opened the door to liability of open source contributors in certain cases. The authors believe that contributors would welcome the ability to ensure that downstream users are implementing updates that address issues like bias, guardrail workarounds or adversarial attacks on their contributions. Finally, this paper addresses how this license category would interplay with RAIL licenses, and how it should be operationalized and adopted by key stakeholders such as OSS platforms and scanning tools.</description>

      <title>Identifying Research Hotspots and Future Development Trends in Current Psychology: A Bibliometric Analysis of the Past Decade's Publications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By conducting a bibliometric analysis on 4,869 publications in Current Psychology from 2013 to 2022, this paper examined the annual publications and annual citations, as well as the leading institutions, countries, and keywords. CiteSpace, VOSviewer and SCImago Graphica were utilized for visualization analysis. On one hand, this paper analyzed the academic influence of Current Psychology over the past decade. On the other hand, it explored the research hotspots and future development trends within the field of international psychology. The results revealed that the three main research areas covered in the publications of Current Psychology were: the psychological well-being of young people, the negative emotions of adults, and self-awareness and management. The latest research hotspots highlighted in the journal include negative emotions, personality, and mental health. The three main development trends of Current Psychology are: 1) exploring the personality psychology of both adolescents and adults, 2) promoting the interdisciplinary research to study social psychological issues through the use of diversified research methods, and 3) emphasizing the emotional psychology of individuals and their interaction with social reality, from a people-oriented perspective.</description>

      <title>Historical Ink: 19th Century Latin American Spanish Newspaper Corpus with LLM OCR Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents two significant contributions: first, a novel dataset of 19th-century Latin American press texts, which addresses the lack of specialized corpora for historical and linguistic analysis in this region. Second, it introduces a framework for OCR error correction and linguistic surface form detection in digitized corpora, utilizing a Large Language Model. This framework is adaptable to various contexts and, in this paper, is specifically applied to the newly created dataset.</description>

      <title>Automated Peer Reviewing in Paper SEA: Standardization, Evaluation, and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the rapid increase in scientific papers has overwhelmed traditional review mechanisms, resulting in varying quality of publications. Although existing methods have explored the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated scientific reviewing, their generated contents are often generic or partial. To address the issues above, we introduce an automated paper reviewing framework SEA. It comprises of three modules: Standardization, Evaluation, and Analysis, which are represented by models SEA-S, SEA-E, and SEA-A, respectively. Initially, SEA-S distills data standardization capabilities of GPT-4 for integrating multiple reviews for a paper. Then, SEA-E utilizes standardized data for fine-tuning, enabling it to generate constructive reviews. Finally, SEA-A introduces a new evaluation metric called mismatch score to assess the consistency between paper contents and reviews. Moreover, we design a self-correction strategy to enhance the consistency. Extensive experimental results on datasets collected from eight venues show that SEA can generate valuable insights for authors to improve their papers.</description>
