      <title>Development of Advanced FEM Simulation Technology for Pre-Operative Surgical Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intracorporeal needle-based therapeutic ultrasound (NBTU) offers a minimally invasive approach for the thermal ablation of malignant brain tumors, including both primary and metastatic cancers. NBTU utilizes a high-frequency alternating electric field to excite a piezoelectric transducer, generating acoustic waves that cause localized heating and tumor cell ablation, and it provides a more precise ablation by delivering lower acoustic power doses directly to targeted tumors while sparing surrounding healthy tissue. Building on our previous work, this study introduces a database for optimizing pre-operative surgical planning by simulating ablation effects in varied tissue environments and develops an extended simulation model incorporating various tumor types and sizes to evaluate thermal damage under trans-tissue conditions. A comprehensive database is created from these simulations, detailing critical parameters such as CEM43 isodose maps, temperature changes, thermal dose areas, and maximum ablation distances for four directional probes. This database serves as a valuable resource for future studies, aiding in complex trajectory planning and parameter optimization for NBTU procedures. Moreover, a novel probe selection method is proposed to enhance pre-surgical planning, providing a strategic approach to selecting probes that maximize therapeutic efficiency and minimize ablation time. By avoiding unnecessary thermal propagation and optimizing probe angles, this method has the potential to improve patient outcomes and streamline surgical procedures. Overall, the findings of this study contribute significantly to the field of NBTU, offering a robust framework for enhancing treatment precision and efficacy in clinical settings.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the circularly-oriented macular pigment using spatiotemporal sensitivity to structured light entoptic phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The macular pigment (MP) in the radially-oriented Henle fibers that surround the foveola enables the ability to perceive the orientation of polarized blue light through an entoptic phenomena known as the Haidinger's brush. The MP has been linked to eye diseases and central field dysfunctions, most notably age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a globally leading cause of irreversible blindness. Recent integration of structured light techniques into vision science has allowed for the development of more selective and versatile entoptic probes of eye health that provide interpretable thresholds. For example, it enabled the use of variable spatial frequencies and arbitrary obstructions in the presented stimuli. Additionally, it expanded the 2{\deg} retinal eccentricity extent of the Haidinger's brush to 5{\deg} for a similar class of fringe-based stimuli. In this work, we develop a spatiotemporal sensitivity model that maps perceptual thresholds of entoptic phenomenon to the underlying MP structure that supports its perception. We therefore selectively characterize the circularly-oriented macular pigment optical density (coMPOD) rather than total MPOD as typically measured, providing an additional quantification of macular health. A study was performed where the retinal eccentricity thresholds were measured for five structured light stimuli with unique spatiotemporal frequencies. The results from fifteen healthy young participants indicate that the coMPOD is inversely proportional to retinal eccentricity in the range of 1.5{\deg} to 5.5{\deg}. Good agreement between the model and the collected data is found with a Pearson $\chi^2$ fit statistic of 0.06. The presented techniques can be applied in novel early diagnostic tests for a variety of diseases related to macular degeneration such as AMD, macular telangiectasia, and pathological myopia.</description>
