      <title>Commissioning, characterization and first high dose rate irradiations at a compact X-ray tube for microbeam and minibeam radiation therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Minibeam and microbeam radiation therapy promise improved treatment outcomes through reduced normal tissue toxicity at better tumor control rates. The lack of suitable compact radiation sources limits the clinical application of minibeams to superficial tumors and renders it impossible for microbeams. We developed and constructed the first prototype of a compact line-focus X-ray tube (LFXT) with technology potentially suitable for clinical translation of minibeams and microbeams. We give an overview of the commissioning process preceding the first operation, present optical and radiological focal spot characterization methods, and dosimetric measurements. Additionally, we report on first preclinical in vitro cell and in vivo mouse brain irradiations conducted with the LFXT prototype. The focal spot characterization resulted in a strongly eccentric electron distribution with a width of 72.3 $\mu$m. Dosimetry showed sharp microbeam dose profiles with steep lateral penumbras and a peak-to-valley dose ratio above 10 throughout a 70 mm thick PMMA phantom. An open-field dose rate of 4.3 Gy/s was measured at an acceleration voltage of 150 kV and a beam current of 17.4 mA at 150 mm distance from the focal spot. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated the feasibility of the LFXT for minibeam and microbeam applications with field sizes of 1.5-2 cm. The mice displayed no observable side effects throughout the follow-up period after whole-brain 260 $\mu$m-minibeam irradiation. We successfully constructed and commissioned the first proof-of-concept LFXT prototype. Dosimetric characterizations of the achieved microbeam field showed the superiority of the LFXT compared to conventional X-ray tubes in terms of beam quality. In future developments, the remaining limitations of the prototype will be addressed for improved minibeam and first ever microbeam radiation therapy in a clinical setting.</description>

      <title>Automatic Treatment Planning using Reinforcement Learning for High-dose-rate Prostate Brachytherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: In high-dose-rate (HDR) prostate brachytherapy procedures, the pattern of needle placement solely relies on physician experience. We investigated the feasibility of using reinforcement learning (RL) to provide needle positions and dwell times based on patient anatomy during pre-planning stage. This approach would reduce procedure time and ensure consistent plan quality. Materials and Methods: We train a RL agent to adjust the position of one selected needle and all the dwell times on it to maximize a pre-defined reward function after observing the environment. After adjusting, the RL agent then moves on to the next needle, until all needles are adjusted. Multiple rounds are played by the agent until the maximum number of rounds is reached. Plan data from 11 prostate HDR boost patients (1 for training, and 10 for testing) treated in our clinic were included in this study. The dosimetric metrics and the number of used needles of RL plan were compared to those of the clinical results (ground truth). Results: On average, RL plans and clinical plans have very similar prostate coverage (Prostate V100) and Rectum D2cc (no statistical significance), while RL plans have less prostate hotspot (Prostate V150) and Urethra D20% plans with statistical significance. Moreover, RL plans use 2 less needles than clinical plan on average. Conclusion: We present the first study demonstrating the feasibility of using reinforcement learning to autonomously generate clinically practical HDR prostate brachytherapy plans. This RL-based method achieved equal or improved plan quality compared to conventional clinical approaches while requiring fewer needles. With minimal data requirements and strong generalizability, this approach has substantial potential to standardize brachytherapy planning, reduce clinical variability, and enhance patient outcomes.</description>

      <title>An analytical model for gold nanoparticle radiosensitisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive a variance-driven Local-Effect-Model ($\sigma$-LEM) to predict radiosensitization due to gold nanoparticles (AuNP). Assuming that the number of Au photo-ionisations scales strictly with particle volume $V_{\mathrm{NP}} \propto R^{3}$ and that the cascade energy deposition is log-normally distributed, the enhanced dose in each target voxel can be written as $D_{\text{enh}} = D_{0} \exp(\sigma Z)$ with $Z \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$ and width $\sigma = \sqrt{2 \ln(1 + Kc)}$.
  By assuming a linear-quadratic (LQ) dose response, a relation between survival and dose can be derived for each voxel. Although there is no closed form for the log-normal distribution, averaging over the entire domain using first and second order moments leads to three possible closed forms: a variance-only one, a mixed-term one, where simultaneous hits from enhancement and baseline can occur, and a second-order model, accurate to $\mathcal{O}(\sigma^{3})$. These three variants adapt well to low-concentration, mid-concentration, and high-concentration regimes.
  The model was tested for Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) results, irradiated with a 100 kVp x-ray beam, taken from a Local Effect Model (LEM) and experimental values. The model shows good agreement with the experimental data, with deviations within acceptable limits, but presents significant changes to the results obtained with the LEM. In particular, results seem to indicate that dose enhancement is mostly $\alpha$-driven. These findings are further developed in the manuscript.
  The theoretical framework presented here collapses radiobiological outcomes to two experimentally controllable variables, beam quality, in the term $K_c$, and intracellular concentration $c$, while retaining mechanistic fidelity. Additional tests should be made to further confirm the validity of the model.</description>

      <title>Plug-and-play superiorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The superiorization methodology (SM) is an optimization heuristic in which an iterative algorithm, which aims to solve a particular problem, is ``superiorized'' to promote solutions that are improved with respect to some secondary criterion. This superiorization is achieved by perturbing iterates of the algorithm in nonascending directions of a prescribed function that penalizes undesirable characteristics in the solution; the solution produced by the superiorized algorithm should therefore be improved with respect to the value of this function. In this paper, we broaden the SM to allow for the perturbations to be introduced by an arbitrary procedure instead, using a plug-and-play approach. This allows for operations such as image denoisers or deep neural networks, which have applications to a broad class of problems, to be incorporated within the superiorization methodology. As proof of concept, we perform numerical simulations involving low-dose and sparse-view computed tomography image reconstruction, comparing the plug-and-play approach to two conventionally superiorized algorithms, as well as a post-processing approach. The plug-and-play approach provides comparable or better image quality in most cases, while also providing advantages in terms of computing time, and data fidelity of the solutions.</description>
