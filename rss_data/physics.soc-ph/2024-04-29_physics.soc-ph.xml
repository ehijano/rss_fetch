      <title>Impact of Topography and Climate on Post-fire Vegetation Recovery Across Different Burn Severity and Land Cover Types through Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wildfire significantly disturb ecosystems by altering forest structure, vegetation ecophysiology, and soil properties. Understanding the complex interactions between topographic and climatic conditions in post-wildfire recovery is crucial. This study investigates the interplay between topography, climate, burn severity, and years after fire on vegetation recovery across dominant land cover types (evergreen forest, shrubs, and grassland) in the Pacific Northwest region. Using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data, we estimated vegetation recovery by calculating the incremental enhanced vegetation index (EVI) change during post-fire years. A machine learning technique, random forest (RF), was employed to map relationships between the input features (elevation, slope, aspect, precipitation, temperature, burn severity, and years after fire) and the target (incremental EVI recovery) for each land cover type. Variable importance analysis and partial dependence plots were generated to understand the influence of individual features. The observed and predicted incremental EVI values showed good matches, with R2 values of 0.99 for training and between 0.89 and 0.945 for testing. The study found that climate variables, specifically precipitation and temperature, were the most important features overall, while elevation played the most significant role among the topographic factors. Partial dependence plots revealed that lower precipitation tended to cause a reduction in vegetation recovery for varying temperature ranges across land cover types. These findings can aid in developing targeted strategies for post-wildfire forest management, considering the varying responses of different land cover types to topographic, climatic, and burn severity factors.</description>

      <title>Edge Importance in Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex networks are made up of vertices and edges. The latter connect the vertices. There are several ways to measure the importance of the vertices, e.g., by counting the number of edges that start or end at each vertex, or by using the subgraph centrality of the vertices. It is more difficult to assess the importance of the edges. One approach is to consider the line graph associated with the given network and determine the importance of the vertices of the line graph, but this is fairly complicated except for small networks. This paper compares two approaches to estimate the importance of edges of medium-sized to large networks. One approach computes partial derivatives of the total communicability of the weights of the edges, where a partial derivative of large magnitude indicates that the corresponding edge may be important. Our second approach computes the Perron sensitivity of the edges. A high sensitivity signals that the edge may be important. The performance of these methods and some computational aspects are discussed. Applications of interest include to determine whether a network can be replaced by a network with fewer edges with about the same communicability.</description>

      <title>Efficient Strategies on Supply Chain Network Optimization for Industrial Carbon Emission Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the efficient strategies for supply chain network optimization, specifically aimed at reducing industrial carbon emissions. Amidst escalating concerns about global climate change, industry sectors are motivated to counteract the negative environmental implications of their supply chain networks. This paper introduces a novel framework for optimizing these networks via strategic approaches which lead to a definitive decrease in carbon emissions. We introduce Adaptive Carbon Emissions Indexing (ACEI), utilizing real-time carbon emissions data to drive instantaneous adjustments in supply chain operations. This adaptability predicates on evolving environmental regulations, fluctuating market trends and emerging technological advancements. The empirical validations demonstrate our strategy's effectiveness in various industrial sectors, indicating a significant reduction in carbon emissions and an increase in operational efficiency. This method also evidences resilience in the face of sudden disruptions and crises, reflecting its robustness.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Mahjong on Marital Relationships</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the national treasures, Mahjong, is a strategic card game originating from China, played competitively by constructing and optimizing card hands among four players. In the game, players aim to achieve specific combinations of cards, known as "winning hands," through actions such as drawing, discarding, pung, and kong. Mahjong not only tests memory and strategy but also integrates probability and chance, embodying profound cultural significance and social attributes. However, as Mahjong becomes a widely popular social activity, its impact on personal life has gradually become apparent. In this paper, I delve into the analysis of the effects of playing Mahjong on marital relationships, particularly the three negative effects it brings to women:
  Time Displacement: The uncertainty of Mahjong playing time leads to a reduction in shared time between spouses. Women may feel neglected due to the lack of companionship, leading to "Mahjong Panic Syndrome."
  Emotional Conflict: Mahjong playing can result in losses, and men may harbor "resentment from defeat" at the Mahjong table, which could be brought into the household and spark marital disputes.
  Social Isolation: Women may feel excluded from their partner's social circle if they do not participate in Mahjong activities, experiencing "marginalization at the card table."
  This study not only reveals the potential negative impact of late-night Mahjong returns on marital relationships but also provides new insights into communication and empathy between spouses from the perspectives of decision trees, time series analysis, and game theory. It also finds the optimal solution through Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of globalization and digital networks, the so-called ''minored'' or ''endangered'' languages are facing a twofold dilemma: either succeed in their digital modernity by accepting a ''painful'' linguistic management or slide towards a slow extinction in front of hegemonic and ''predatory'' languages which dominate the digital networks.Oral languages and minored not-Romanized writings are the most concerned by the protective measures of the cultural and linguistic diversity on the Internet. Digital broadcasting and the Unicode multi-writing encoding system are providing them with innovative, consensual, and standardized alternatives to survive. Then, it depends on the synergy that their communities of practice will generate to place them at the heart of the debate on the digital divide.</description>

      <title>Access to Emergency Services: A New York City Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emergency services play a crucial role in safeguarding human life and property within society. In this paper, we propose a network-based methodology for calculating transportation access between emergency services and the broader community. Using New York City as a case study, this study identifies 'emergency service deserts' based on the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) guidelines, where accessibility to Fire, Emergency Medical Services, Police, and Hospitals are compromised. The results show that while 95% of NYC residents are well-served by emergency services, the residents of Staten Island are disproportionately underserved. By quantifying the relationship between first responder travel time, Emergency Services Sector (ESS) site density, and population density, we discovered a negative power law relationship between travel time and ESS site density. This relationship can be used directly by policymakers to determine which parts of a community would benefit the most from providing new ESS locations. Furthermore, this methodology can be used to quantify the resilience of emergency service infrastructure by observing changes in accessibility in communities facing threats.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary game dynamics with environmental feedback in a network with two communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments of eco-evolutionary models have shown that evolving feedbacks between behavioral strategies and the environment of game interactions, leading to changes in the underlying payoff matrix, can impact the underlying population dynamics in various manners. We propose and analyze an eco-evolutionary game dynamics model on a network with two communities such that players interact with other players in the same community and those in the opposite community at different rates. In our model, we consider two-person matrix games with pairwise interactions occurring on individual edges and assume that the environmental state depends on edges rather than on nodes or being globally shared in the population. We analytically determine the equilibria and their stability under a symmetric population structure assumption, and we also numerically study the replicator dynamics of the general model. The model shows rich dynamical behavior, such as multiple transcritical bifurcations, multistability, and anti-synchronous oscillations. Our work offers insights into understanding how the presence of community structure impacts the eco-evolutionary dynamics within and between niches.</description>

      <title>Network shell structure based on hub and non-hub nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shell structure holds significant importance in various domains such as information dissemination, supply chain management, and transportation. This study focuses on investigating the shell structure of hub and non-hub nodes, which play important roles in these domains. Our framework explores the topology of Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi (ER) and Scale-Free (SF) networks, considering source node selection strategies dependent on the nodes' degrees. We define the shell $l$ in a network as the set of nodes at a distance $l$ from a given node and represent $r_l$ as the fraction of nodes outside shell $l$. Statistical properties of the shells are examined for a selected node, taking into account the node's degree. For a network with a given degree distribution, we analytically derive the degree distribution and average degree of nodes outside shell $l$ as functions of $r_l$. Moreover, we discover that $r_l$ follows an iterative functional form $r_l = \phi(r_{l-1})$, where $\phi$ is expressed in terms of the generating function of the original degree distribution of the network.</description>

      <title>Cycling into the workshop: predictive maintenance for Barcelona's bike-sharing system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bike-sharing systems have emerged as a significant element of urban mobility, providing an environmentally friendly transportation alternative. With the increasing integration of electric bikes alongside mechanical bikes, it is crucial to illuminate distinct usage patterns and their impact on maintenance. Accordingly, this research aims to develop a comprehensive understanding of mobility dynamics, distinguishing between different mobility modes, and introducing a novel predictive maintenance system tailored for bikes. By utilising a combination of trip information and maintenance data from Barcelona's bike-sharing system, Bicing, this study conducts an extensive analysis of mobility patterns and their relationship to failures of bike components. To accurately predict maintenance needs for essential bike parts, this research delves into various mobility metrics and applies statistical and machine learning survival models, including deep learning models. Due to their complexity, and with the objective of bolstering confidence in the system's predictions, interpretability techniques explain the main predictors of maintenance needs. The analysis reveals marked differences in the usage patterns of mechanical bikes and electric bikes, with a growing user preference for the latter despite their extra costs. These differences in mobility were found to have a considerable impact on the maintenance needs within the bike-sharing system. Moreover, the predictive maintenance models proved effective in forecasting these maintenance needs, capable of operating across an entire bike fleet. Despite challenges such as approximated bike usage metrics and data imbalances, the study successfully showcases the feasibility of an accurate predictive maintenance system capable of improving operational costs, bike availability, and security.</description>

      <title>An optimal control study for a two-strain SEIR epidemic model with saturated incidence rates and treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work will study an optimal control problem describing the two-strain SEIR epidemic model. The studied model is in the form of six nonlinear differential equations illustrating the dynamics of the susceptibles and the exposed, the infected, and the recovered individuals. The exposed and the infected compartments are each divided into two sub-classes representing the first and the second strain. The model includes two saturated rates and two treatments for each strain. We begin our study by showing the well-posedness of our problem. The basic reproduction number is calculated and depends mainly on the reproduction numbers of the first and second strains. The global stability of the disease-free equilibrium is fulfilled. The optimal control study is achieved by using the Pontryagin minimum principle. Numerical simulations have shown the importance of therapy in minimizing the infection's effect. By administrating suitable therapies, the disease's severity decreases considerably. The estimation of parameters as well as a comparison study with COVID-19 clinical data are fulfilled. It was shown that the mathematical model results fits well the clinical data.</description>

      <title>Attraction by pairwise coherence explains the emergence of ideological sorting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.12559v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Political polarization has become a growing concern in democratic societies, as it drives tribal alignments and erodes civic deliberation among citizens. Given its prevalence across different countries, previous research has sought to understand the conditions under which people tend to endorse extreme opinions. However, in polarized contexts, citizens not only adopt more extreme views but also become correlated across issues which are, a priori, seemingly unrelated. This phenomenon, known as 'ideological sorting', has been receiving greater attention in recent years but the micro-level mechanisms underlying its emergence remain poorly understood. Here, we study the conditions under which a social dynamic system is expected to become ideologically sorted as a function of the mechanisms of interaction between its individuals. To this end, we developed and analyzed a multidimensional agent-based model that incorporates two mechanisms: homophily (where people tend to interact with those holding similar opinions) and pairwise-coherence favoritism (where people tend to interact with ingroups holding politically coherent opinions). We numerically integrated the model's master equations that perfectly describe the system's dynamics and found that ideological sorting only emerges in models that include pairwise-coherence favoritism. We then compared the model's outcomes with empirical data proceeding from 24,035 opinions across 67 topics, and found that pairwise-coherence favoritism is significantly present in datasets that measure political attitudes, but absent across topics not considered related to politics. Overall, this work combines theoretical approaches from system dynamics with model-based analyses of empirical data to uncover a potential mechanism underlying the pervasiveness of ideological sorting.</description>

      <title>From Qubits to Opinions: Operator and Error Syndrome Measurement in Quantum-Inspired Social Simulations on Transversal Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper delves into the history and integration of quantum theory into areas such as opinion dynamics, decision theory, and game theory, offering a novel framework for social simulations. It introduces a quantum perspective for analyzing information transfer and decision-making complexity within social systems, employing a toric code-based method for error discrimination.Central to this research is the use of toric codes, originally for quantum error correction, to detect and correct errors in social simulations, representing uncertainty in opinion formation and decision-making processes. Operator and error syndrome measurement, vital in quantum computation, help identify and analyze errors and uncertainty in social simulations. The paper also discusses fault-tolerant computation employing transversal gates, which protect against errors during quantum computation. In social simulations, transversal gates model protection from external interference and misinformation, enhancing the fidelity of decision-making and strategy formation processes.</description>

      <title>Approach to Toric Code Anyon Excitation, Indirect Effects of Kitaev Spin in Local Social Opinion Models</title>

Abstract: The study of Opinion Dynamics, which explores how individual opinions and beliefs evolve and how societal consensus is formed, has been examined across social science, physics, and mathematics. Historically based on statistical physics models like the Ising model, recent research integrates quantum information theory concepts, such as Graph States, Stabilizer States, and Toric Codes. These quantum approaches offer fresh perspectives for analyzing complex relationships and interactions in opinion formation, such as modeling local interactions, using topological features for error resistance, and applying quantum mechanics for deeper insights into opinion polarization and entanglement. However, these applications face challenges in complexity, interpretation, and empirical validation. Quantum concepts are abstract and not easily translated into social science contexts, and direct observation of social opinion processes differs significantly from quantum experiments, leading to a gap between theoretical models and real-world applicability. Despite its potential, the practical use of the Toric Code Hamiltonian in Opinion Dynamics requires further exploration and research.</description>

      <title>Pathfinding of Digital False Information Diffusion by Conformal Field Theory and Feynman's Green's Function: Multiple Analysis Considering Stress Energy Tensor and Symmetry of Virasoro Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study delves into the application of Conformal Field Theory (CFT) to understand information diffusion within digital media and its broader social implications. Focusing on the digital native generation, vulnerable to misinformation and data privacy issues, the research highlights the urgency of addressing psychological health in the digital realm. By leveraging CFT's analytical power, particularly in tracing information flows and assessing the impact of misinformation, the study offers novel insights into the dynamics of digital communication. It proposes a model for predicting and analyzing the spread of biased content, emphasizing the need for improved information literacy and personal data protection. This paper explores the concept of infinitesimal conformal transformations using the Virasoro operator, forming a conformal transformation group. In the examination of multiple analytical methods, the approach to quantitatively analyze cases that are likely to expose the risk of spreading filter bubbles such as negative information, rumors, and fake news is to incorporate a two-dimensional conformal field theory approach using the Ward-Takahashi identity and path integral with trace anomalies and metric are introduced. Trace anomalies and metrics were introduced. A trace anomaly refers to the spread of information in an unexpected way, usually indicating anomalous behavior or hidden dynamics in the system. Metric variation hypothesized and analyzed how diffusion characteristics, such as the rate and pattern of information diffusion, vary over time.</description>

Abstract: The extensive data generated on social media platforms allow us to gain insights over trending topics and public opinions. Additionally, it offers a window into user behavior, including their content engagement and news sharing habits. In this study, we analyze the relationship between users' political ideologies and the news they share during Argentina's 2019 election period. Our findings reveal that users predominantly share news that aligns with their political beliefs, despite accessing media outlets with diverse political leanings. Moreover, we observe a consistent pattern of users sharing articles related to topics biased to their preferred candidates, highlighting a deeper level of political alignment in online discussions. We believe that this systematic analysis framework can be applied to similar scenarios in different countries, especially those marked by significant political polarization, akin to Argentina.</description>

Abstract: Quantum walks have emerged as a transformative paradigm in quantum information processing and can be applied to various graph problems. This study explores discrete-time quantum walks on simplicial complexes, a higher-order generalization of graph structures. Simplicial complexes, encoding higher-order interactions through simplices, offer a richer topological representation of complex systems. Since the conventional classical random walk cannot directly detect community structures, we present a quantum walk algorithm to detect higher-order community structures called simplicial communities. We utilize the Fourier coin to produce entangled translation states among adjacent simplices in a simplicial complex. The potential of our quantum algorithm is tested on Zachary's karate club network. This study may contribute to understanding complex systems at the intersection of algebraic topology and quantum walk algorithms.</description>
