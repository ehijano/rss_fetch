      <title>Stress index strategy enhanced with financial news sentiment analysis for the equity markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new risk-on risk-off strategy for the stock market, which combines a financial stress indicator with a sentiment analysis done by ChatGPT reading and interpreting Bloomberg daily market summaries. Forecasts of market stress derived from volatility and credit spreads are enhanced when combined with the financial news sentiment derived from GPT-4. As a result, the strategy shows improved performance, evidenced by higher Sharpe ratio and reduced maximum drawdowns. The improved performance is consistent across the NASDAQ, the S&amp;P 500 and the six major equity markets, indicating that the method generalises across equities markets.</description>

      <title>Antinetwork among China A-shares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The correlation-based financial networks, constructed with the correlation relationships among the time series of fluctuations of daily logarithmic prices of stocks, are intensively studied. However, these studies ignore the importance of negative correlations. This paper is the first time to consider the negative and positive correlations separately, and accordingly to construct weighted temporal antinetwork and network among stocks listed in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges. For (anti)networks during the first 24 years of the 21st century, the node's degree and strength, the assortativity coefficient, the average local clustering coefficient, and the average shortest path length are analyzed systematically. This paper unveils some essential differences in these topological measurements between antinetwork and network. The findings of the differences between antinetwork and network have an important role in understanding the dynamics of a financial complex system. The observation of antinetwork is of great importance in optimizing investment portfolios and risk management. More importantly, this paper proposes a new direction for studying complex systems, namely the correlation-based antinetwork.</description>

      <title>Investigating Similarities Across Decentralized Financial (DeFi) Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the adoption of graph representation learning (GRL) algorithms to investigate similarities across services offered by Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols. Following existing literature, we use Ethereum transaction data to identify the DeFi building blocks. These are sets of protocol-specific smart contracts that are utilized in combination within single transactions and encapsulate the logic to conduct specific financial services such as swapping or lending cryptoassets. We propose a method to categorize these blocks into clusters based on their smart contract attributes and the graph structure of their smart contract calls. We employ GRL to create embedding vectors from building blocks and agglomerative models for clustering them. To evaluate whether they are effectively grouped in clusters of similar functionalities, we associate them with eight financial functionality categories and use this information as the target label. We find that in the best-case scenario purity reaches .888. We use additional information to associate the building blocks with protocol-specific target labels, obtaining comparable purity (.864) but higher V-Measure (.571); we discuss plausible explanations for this difference. In summary, this method helps categorize existing financial products offered by DeFi protocols, and can effectively automatize the detection of similar DeFi services, especially within protocols.</description>

      <title>Temporal Graph Networks for Graph Anomaly Detection in Financial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the utilization of Temporal Graph Networks (TGN) for financial anomaly detection, a pressing need in the era of fintech and digitized financial transactions. We present a comprehensive framework that leverages TGN, capable of capturing dynamic changes in edges within financial networks, for fraud detection. Our study compares TGN's performance against static Graph Neural Network (GNN) baselines, as well as cutting-edge hypergraph neural network baselines using DGraph dataset for a realistic financial context. Our results demonstrate that TGN significantly outperforms other models in terms of AUC metrics. This superior performance underlines TGN's potential as an effective tool for detecting financial fraud, showcasing its ability to adapt to the dynamic and complex nature of modern financial systems. We also experimented with various graph embedding modules within the TGN framework and compared the effectiveness of each module. In conclusion, we demonstrated that, even with variations within TGN, it is possible to achieve good performance in the anomaly detection task.</description>

      <title>Missing Data Imputation With Granular Semantics and AI-driven Pipeline for Bankruptcy Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on designing a pipeline for the prediction of bankruptcy. The presence of missing values, high dimensional data, and highly class-imbalance databases are the major challenges in the said task. A new method for missing data imputation with granular semantics has been introduced here. The merits of granular computing have been explored here to define this method. The missing values have been predicted using the feature semantics and reliable observations in a low-dimensional space, in the granular space. The granules are formed around every missing entry, considering a few of the highly correlated features and most reliable closest observations to preserve the relevance and reliability, the context, of the database against the missing entries. An intergranular prediction is then carried out for the imputation within those contextual granules. That is, the contextual granules enable a small relevant fraction of the huge database to be used for imputation and overcome the need to access the entire database repetitively for each missing value. This method is then implemented and tested for the prediction of bankruptcy with the Polish Bankruptcy dataset. It provides an efficient solution for big and high-dimensional datasets even with large imputation rates. Then an AI-driven pipeline for bankruptcy prediction has been designed using the proposed granular semantic-based data filling method followed by the solutions to the issues like high dimensional dataset and high class-imbalance in the dataset. The rest of the pipeline consists of feature selection with the random forest for reducing dimensionality, data balancing with SMOTE, and prediction with six different popular classifiers including deep NN. All methods defined here have been experimentally verified with suitable comparative studies and proven to be effective on all the data sets captured over the five years.</description>

      <title>Empowering Credit Scoring Systems with Quantum-Enhanced Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Kernels are projected to provide early-stage usefulness for quantum machine learning. However, highly sophisticated classical models are hard to surpass without losing interpretability, particularly when vast datasets can be exploited. Nonetheless, classical models struggle once data is scarce and skewed. Quantum feature spaces are projected to find better links between data features and the target class to be predicted even in such challenging scenarios and most importantly, enhanced generalization capabilities. In this work, we propose a novel approach called Systemic Quantum Score (SQS) and provide preliminary results indicating potential advantage over purely classical models in a production grade use case for the Finance sector. SQS shows in our specific study an increased capacity to extract patterns out of fewer data points as well as improved performance over data-hungry algorithms such as XGBoost, providing advantage in a competitive market as it is the FinTech and Neobank regime.</description>

      <title>Time-aware Metapath Feature Augmentation for Ponzi Detection in Ethereum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.16863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the development of Web 3.0 which emphasizes decentralization, blockchain technology ushers in its revolution and also brings numerous challenges, particularly in the field of cryptocurrency. Recently, a large number of criminal behaviors continuously emerge on blockchain, such as Ponzi schemes and phishing scams, which severely endanger decentralized finance. Existing graph-based abnormal behavior detection methods on blockchain usually focus on constructing homogeneous transaction graphs without distinguishing the heterogeneity of nodes and edges, resulting in partial loss of transaction pattern information. Although existing heterogeneous modeling methods can depict richer information through metapaths, the extracted metapaths generally neglect temporal dependencies between entities and do not reflect real behavior. In this paper, we introduce Time-aware Metapath Feature Augmentation (TMFAug) as a plug-and-play module to capture the real metapath-based transaction patterns during Ponzi scheme detection on Ethereum. The proposed module can be adaptively combined with existing graph-based Ponzi detection methods. Extensive experimental results show that our TMFAug can help existing Ponzi detection methods achieve significant performance improvements on the Ethereum dataset, indicating the effectiveness of heterogeneous temporal information for Ponzi scheme detection.</description>
