      <title>Laser cooling Rydberg molecules -- a detailed study of the helium dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The helium dimer in its metastable triplet state is a promising candidate to be the first laser-cooled homonuclear molecule. An ultracold gas of He$_2^*$ would enable a new generation of precision measurements to test quantum electrodynamics for three- and four-electron molecules through Rydberg spectroscopy. Nearly diagonal Franck-Condon factors are obtained because the electron employed for optical cycling occupies a Rydberg orbital that does not take part in the chemical bond. Three possible laser cooling transitions are identified and the spin-rovibronic energy-level structure of the relevant states as well as electronic transition moments, linestrengths, and lifetimes are determined. The production of He$_2^*$ molecules in a supersonic beam is discussed, and a laser slowing scheme to load a magneto-optical trap under such conditions is simulated using a rate equation approach. Various repumping schemes involving one or two upper electronic states are compared to maximize the radiative force. Loss mechanisms such as spin-forbidden transitions, predissociation, and ionization processes are studied and found to not introduce significant challenges for laser cooling and trapping He$_2^*$. The sensitivity of the vibrational levels of He$_2^+$ with respect to the static polarizability of atomic helium is determined and its implications for a new quantum pressure standard are discussed.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Laboratory Benchmark of K-shell Dielectronic Satellites of Fe XXV-XXI Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on comprehensive laboratory studies of the K-shell dielectronic recombination (DR) resonances of Fe XXV - XXI ions that prominently contribute to the hard X-ray spectrum of hot astrophysical plasmas. By scanning a monoenergetic electron beam to resonantly excite trapped Fe ions in an electron beam ion trap, and achieving a high electron-ion collision energy resolution of ~7 eV, we resolve their respective KL$n$ satellites up to n'=11. By normalization to known radiative recombination cross sections we also determine their excitation cross sections and that of the continuum with uncertainties below 15%, and verify our results with an independent normalization based on previous measurements. Our experimental data excellently confirm the accuracy and suitability of distorted-wave calculations obtained with the Flexible Atomic Code (FAC) for modeling astrophysical and fusion plasmas.</description>

      <title>$\textit{Ab initio}$ multiconfigurational calculations of experimentally significant energy levels and transition rates in Lr I $\left( Z=103 \right)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale multiconfigurational calculations are conducted on experimentally significant transitions in Lr I and its lanthanide homologue Lu I, exhibiting good agreement with recent theoretical and experimental results. A single reference calculation is performed, allowing for substitutions from the core within a sufficiently large active set to effectively capture the influence of the core on the valence shells, improving upon previous multiconfigurational calculations. An additional calculation utilising a multireference set is performed to account for static correlation effects which contribute to the wavefunction. Reported energies for the two selected transitions are 20716$\pm$550 $\text{cm}^{-1}$ and 28587$\pm$650 $\text{cm}^{-1}$ for $7\!s^2 8s~^{2} \! {S}_{1\!/\!2}$ $\rightarrow$ $7\!s^2 7\!p ~^{2} \! {P}^{o}_{1\!/\!2 }$ and $7\!s^2 7\!d ~^{2} \! {D}_{3\!/\!2 }$ $\rightarrow$ $7\!s^2 7\!p ~^{2} \! {P}^{o}_{1\!/\!2 }$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Robustness of Atom Interferometer Using Super-Gaussian Pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser frequency drifts and atomic thermal motion can lead to errors in pulse duration and detuning in cold atom interferometry, thereby reducing measurement stability and fringe contrast. To address this issue, we investigate the use of super-Gaussian pulses, which are characterized by smooth temporal profiles and centralized energy distribution, in the beam-splitting and reflection stages of an atom interferometer. Through numerical simulations, we compare the performance of rectangular, Gaussian, and 2nd- to 10th-order super-Gaussian pulses subject to deviations in pulse duration and detuning. Our results show that super-Gaussian pulses significantly enhance interference fringe contrast and robustness, with 4th-order pulses achieving up to a 90% improvement in contrast over rectangular pulses under realistic conditions. These findings demonstrate the potential of super-Gaussian pulse shaping to enhance the sensitivity and robustness of atom interferometric measurements.</description>

      <title>Reduction in nuclear size and quadrupole deformation of high-spin isomers of 127,129In</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employed laser spectroscopy of atomic transitions to measure the nuclear charge radii and electromagnetic properties of the high-spin isomeric states in neutron-rich indium isotopes (Z = 49) near the closed proton and neutron shells at Z = 50 and N = 82. Our data reveal a reduction in the nuclear charge radius and intrinsic quadrupole moment when protons and neutrons are fully aligned in 129In(N = 80), to form the high spin isomer. Such a reduction is not observed in 127In(N = 78), where more complex configurations can be formed by the existence of four neutron-holes. These observations are not consistently described by nuclear theory.</description>

      <title>Fast and robust detection of single Rydberg excitations in mesoscopic ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel non-destructive method for the detection of single Rydberg excitations in a mesoscopic ensemble. The protocol achieves high fidelities on a microsecond timescale and is robust against changes in the probe laser frequency. The technique relies on optical pumping in Autler Townes configuration, whose efficiency is controlled by the presence/absence of a Rydberg excitation. Taking rubidium atoms as an example, we give realistic estimates for the achievable fidelities and parameters. However, our protocol can be transferred to any other atomic species which features multiple stable states. Our protocol is applicable in quantum simulation and quantum information processing with mesoscopic ensembles requiring fast and high fidelity Rydberg state detection.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Messenger Search for Exotic Field Emission with a Global Magnetometer Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum sensor networks in combination with traditional astronomical observations are emerging as a novel modality for multi-messenger astronomy. Here we develop a generic analysis framework that uses a data-driven approach to model the sensitivity of a quantum sensor network to astrophysical signals as a consequence of beyond-the-Standard Model (BSM) physics. The analysis method evaluates correlations between sensors to search for BSM signals coincident with astrophysical triggers such as black hole mergers, supernovae, or fast radio bursts. Complementary to astroparticle approaches that search for particlelike signals (e.g. WIMPs), quantum sensors are sensitive to wavelike signals from exotic quantum fields. This analysis method can be applied to networks of different types of quantum sensors, such as atomic clocks, matter-wave interferometers, and nuclear clocks, which can probe many types of interactions between BSM fields and standard model particles.
  We use this analysis method to carry out the first direct search utilizing a terrestrial network of precision quantum sensors for BSM fields emitted during a black hole merger. Specifically we use the Global Network of Optical Magnetometers for Exotic physics (GNOME) to perform a search for exotic low-mass field (ELF) bursts generated in coincidence with a gravitational wave signal from a binary black hole merger (GW200311 115853) detected by LIGO/Virgo on the 11th of March 2020. The associated gravitational wave heralds the arrival of the ELF burst that interacts with the spins of fermions in the magnetometers. This enables GNOME to serve as a tool for multi-messenger astronomy. Our search found no significant events, and consequently we place the first lab-based limits on combinations of ELF production and coupling parameters.</description>
