      <title>Bad approximability, bounded ratios and Diophantine exponents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a real $m\times n$ matrix $\pmb{\xi}$, we consider its sequence of best Diophantine approximation vectors $ \pmb{x}_i \in \mathbb{Z}^n, \, i =1,2,3, ... $, the sequences of its norms $X_i = \|\pmb{x}_i\|$ and the norms of remainders $L_i = \|\pmb{\xi}\pmb{x}_i\|$. It is known that, in the cases $m=1$, bad approximability of $\pmb{\xi}$ is equivalent to the boundedness of ratios $\frac{X_{i+1}}{X_i}$, while for $n=1$ bad approximability of $\pmb{\xi}$ is equivalent to the boundedness of ratios $ \frac{L_i}{L_{i+1}}$. Moreover, carefully constructed example show that in the cases $m=1$ and $n=1$ boundedness of ratios $ \frac{L_i}{L_{i+1}}$ and $\frac{X_{i+1}}{X_i}$ respectively (the order of ratios changed), does not imply bad approximability of $\pmb{\xi}$. In the present paper, we study the impact of the boundedness of ratios on Diophantine properties of $\pmb{\xi}$, in particular, what restrictions it gives for Diophantine exponents $\omega(\pmb{\xi})$ and $\hat{\omega}(\pmb{\xi})$. One of our particular results deals with the case $m=n=2$. We prove that for $2\times 2 $ matrices $\pmb{\xi}$ boundedness of both ratios $ \frac{X_{i+1}}{X_i}, \frac{L_i}{L_{i+1}} $ implies inequality $\hat{\omega}(\pmb{\xi})\le \frac{4}{3}$ and that this result is optimal. Our methods combine parametric geometry of numbers as well as more classical tools.</description>

      <title>Sums and differences of sets (improvement over AlphaEvolve)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On May 14, 2025, DeepMind announced that AlphaEvolve, a large language model applied to a set of mathematical problems, had matched or exceeded the best known bounds on several problems. In the case of the sum and difference of sets problem, AlphaEvolve, using a set of $54265$ integers, improved the known lower bound of $\theta=1.14465$ to $\theta=1.1584$. In this paper, we present an improved bound $\theta=1.173050$ using an explicit construction of a U set that contains more than $10^{43546}$ elements. For fast integer and floating-point arithmetic, we used the (free) GMP library.</description>

      <title>On Quotients of a More General Theorem of Wilson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The basis of this work is a simple, extended corollary of Wilson's theorem. This corollary generates many more quotients than those already generated by Wilson's theorem, and it was of interest to derive how they relate to each other and build on the established properties of the original quotients. The most important results that were found were expressions for sums of these quotients, modular congruences that extended the results of Lehmer, and generating functions.</description>

      <title>Explicit and Mixed Estimates for Thue inequalities with few coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $F(x,y)$ be an irreducible form of degree $r\geq 3$ and having $s+1$ non-zero coefficients. Let $h\geq 1$ be an integer and consider the Thue inequality $$|F(x,y)|\leq h.$$ Following the seminal work of Thue in 1909, several papers were written giving an upper bound for the number of solutions of the above inequality as $\ll c(r,s,h)$ where $c(r,s,h)$ is an explicit function of $r,s$ and $h.$ Invariably, the absolute constant involved in $\ll$ has been left undetermined. In this paper, following Bombieri, Schmidt and Mueller, we give three different upper bounds which are explicit in every aspect.</description>

      <title>Modular forms of CM type mod $\ell$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We say that a normalized modular form without complex multiplication is of CM type modulo $\ell$ by an imaginary quadratic field $K$ if its Fourier coefficients $a_p$ are $0$ modulo a prime ideal dividing $\ell$ for every prime $p$ inert in $K$.
  In this paper, we address the following problem: Given a weight 2 cuspidal Hecke eigenform $f$ without CM which is of CM type modulo $\ell$ by an imaginary quadratic field $K$, does there exist a congruence modulo $\ell$ between $f$ and a genuine CM modular form of weight 2? We conjecture that the answer is yes, and prove this conjecture in most cases.
  We study three situations: the case of modular forms attached to abelian surfaces with quaternionic multiplication, the case of $\mathbb{Q}$-curves completely defined over an imaginary quadratic field, and the case of elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ with modular-maximal cyclic group of order $16$ as $5$-torsion Galois module. In all these situations, at some specific primes $\ell$, it can be shown that the residual representation is monomial by a quadratic imaginary field $K$ (or even more than one), and we can conclude that in most of these cases there is a congruence with a CM modular form. Finally, we present some of the numerical evidence that initially led us to formulate the conjecture.</description>

      <title>Quantitative bounds in a popular polynomial Szemer\'{e}di theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain polylogarithmic bounds in the polynomial Szemer\'{e}di theorem when the polynomials have distinct degrees and zero constant terms. Specifically, let $P_1, \dots, P_m \in \mathbb Z[y]$ be polynomials with distinct degrees, each having zero constant term. Then there exists a constant $c = c(P_1,\dots,P_m) &gt; 0$ such that any subset $A \subset \{1,2,\dots,N\}$ of density at least $(\log N)^{-c}$ contains a nontrivial polynomial progression of the form $x, x+P_1(y), \dots, x+P_m(y)$. In addition, we prove an effective ``popular'' version, showing that every dense subset $A$ has some non-zero $y$ such that the number of polynomial progressions in $A$ with this difference $y$ is almost optimal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any quadratic extension $L/K$ of number fields, we prove that there are infinitely many elliptic curves $E$ over $K$ so that the abelian groups $E(K)$ and $E(L)$ both have rank $1$. In particular, there are infinitely many elliptic curves of rank $1$ over any number field. This result generalizes theorems of Koymans-Pagano and Alp\"oge-Bhargava-Ho-Shnidman which were used to independently show that Hilbert's tenth problem over the ring of integers of any number field has a negative answer. Our approach differs since we are obtaining our elliptic curves by specializing a nonisotrivial rank $1$ family of elliptic curves and we compute all the ranks involved.</description>

      <title>On parameters of Hecke algebras for $p$-adic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a non-archimedean local field with residue characteristic $p$ and $G$ be a connected reductive group defined over $F$. In earlier joint works with Jeffrey D. Adler, Jessica Fintzen, and Manish Mishra, we proved that the Hecke algebras attached to types constructed by Kim and Yu are isomorphic to the Hecke algebras attached to depth-zero types. Note that if $G$ splits over a tamely ramified extension of $F$ and $p$ does not divide the order of the absolute Weyl group of $G$, such Hecke algebras cover the Hecke algebras attached to arbitrary Bernstein blocks. We also proved that for a depth-zero type $(K, \rho)$, the corresponding Hecke algebra $\mathcal{H}(G(F), (K, \rho))$ has an explicit description as a semi-direct product of an affine Hecke algebra $\mathcal{H}(W(\rho_M)_{\mathrm{aff}}, q)$ with a twisted group algebra $\mathbb{C}[\Omega(\rho_{M}), \mu]$, generalizing prior work of Morris.
  In this paper, we show that the affine Hecke algebra $\mathcal{H}(W(\rho_M)_{\mathrm{aff}}, q)$ appearing in the description of the Hecke algebra $\mathcal{H}(G(F), (K, \rho))$ attached to a depth-zero type $(K, \rho)$ is isomorphic to the one attached to a unipotent type for a connected reductive group splitting over an unramified extension of $F$. This makes it possible to calculate the parameters of the affine Hecke algebras for depth-zero types and types constructed by Kim and Yu explicitly. In particular, we prove a version of Lusztig's conjecture that the parameters of the Hecke algebra attached to an arbitrary Bernstein block agree with those of a unipotent Bernstein block under the assumption that $G$ splits over a tamely ramified extension of $F$ and $p$ does not divide the order of the absolute Weyl group of $G$.</description>

      <title>Maps between circle bundles: Fiber-preserving, Finiteness and Realization of mapping degree sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $E_i$ be an oriented circle bundle over a closed oriented aspherical $n$-manifold $M_i$ with Euler class $e_i\in H^2(M_i;\mathbb{Z})$, $i=1,2$. We prove the following:
  (i) If every finite-index subgroup of $\pi_1(M_2)$ has trivial center, then any non-zero degree map from $E_1$ to $E_2$ is homotopic to a fiber-preserving map.
  (ii) The mapping degree set of fiber-preserving maps from $E_1$ to $E_2$ is given by $$\{0\} \cup\{k\cdot \mathrm{deg}(f) \ | \, k\ne 0, \ f\colon M_1\to M_2 \, \text{with} \, \mathrm{deg}(f)\ne 0 \ \text{such that}\, f^\#(e_2)=ke_1\},$$ where $f^\# \colon H^2(M_2;\mathbb{Z})\to H^2(M_1;\mathbb{Z})$ is the induced homomorphism.
  As applications of (i) and (ii), we obtain the following results with respect to the finiteness and the realization problems for mapping degree sets:
  ($\mathcal F$) The mapping degree set $D(E_1, E_2)$ is finite if $M_2$ is hyperbolic and $e_2$ is not torsion.
  ($\mathcal R$) For any finite set $A$ of integers containing $0$ and each $n&gt;2$, $A$ is the mapping degree set $D(M,N)$ for some closed oriented $n$-manifolds $M$ and $N$.
  Items (i) and ($\mathcal F$) extend in all dimensions $\geq 3$ the previously known $3$-dimensional case (i.e., for maps between circle bundles over hyperbolic surfaces). Item ($\mathcal R$) gives a complete answer to the realization problem for finite sets (containing $0$) in any dimension, establishing in particular the previously unknown cases in dimensions $n= 4, 5$.</description>

      <title>A Formal Proof of Complexity Bounds on Diophantine Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a universal construction of Diophantine equations with bounded complexity in Isabelle/HOL. This is a formalization of our own work in number theory.
  Hilbert's Tenth Problem was answered negatively by Yuri Matiyasevich, who showed that there is no general algorithm to decide whether an arbitrary Diophantine equation has a solution. However, the problem remains open when generalized to the field of rational numbers, or contrarily, when restricted to Diophantine equations with bounded complexity, characterized by the number of variables $\nu$ and the degree $\delta$. If every Diophantine set can be represented within the bounds $(\nu, \delta)$, we say that this pair is universal, and it follows that the corresponding class of equations is undecidable. In a separate mathematics article, we have determined the first non-trivial universal pair for the case of integer unknowns.
  In this paper, we contribute a formal verification of the main construction required to establish said universal pair. In doing so, we markedly extend the Isabelle AFP entry on multivariate polynomials, formalize parts of a number theory textbook, and develop classical theory on Diophantine equations in Isabelle. Additionally, our work includes metaprogramming infrastructure designed to efficiently handle complex definitions of multivariate polynomials. Our mathematical draft has been formalized while the mathematical research was ongoing, and benefitted largely from the help of the theorem prover. We reflect how the close collaboration between mathematician and computer is an uncommon but promising modus operandi.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.12080v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove an explicit upper bound on the number of real quadratic fields that admit a universal quadratic form of a given rank, thus establishing a density zero statement. More generally, we obtain such a result for totally positive definite quadratic lattices that represent all the multiples of a given rational integer. Our main tools are short vectors in quadratic lattices combined with an estimate for the number of periodic continued fractions with bounded coefficients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study arithmetic properties of certain determinants involving powers of $i^2+cij+dj^2$, where $c$ and $d$ are integers. For example, for any odd integer $n&gt;1$ with $(\frac dn)=-1$ we prove that $\det [ (\frac{i^2+cij+dj^2}{n})]_{0\le i,j\le n-1}$ is divisible by $\varphi(n)^2$, where $(\frac{\cdot}{n})$ is the Jacobi symbol and $\varphi$ is Euler's totient function. This confirms a previous conjecture of the second author.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04159v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For each prime number $\ell$ and for each imaginary quadratic order of class number one or two, we determine all the possible $\ell$-adic Galois representations that occur for any elliptic curve with complex multiplication by such an order over its minimal field of definition, and then we determine all the isomorphism classes of elliptic curves that have a prescribed $\ell$-adic Galois representation.</description>

      <title>Waring and Waring-Goldbach subbases with prescribed representation function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study $r_{A,h}(n)$, the number of representations of integers $n$ as sums of $h$ elements from subsets $A$ of $k$-th powers $\mathbb{N}^k$ and $k$-th powers of primes $\mathbb{P}^k$ for $k \geq 1$. Extending work by Vu, Wooley, and others, we show that for $h \geq h_k = O(8^k k^2)$, if $F$ is a regularly varying function satisfying $\lim_{n\to\infty} F(n)/\log n = \infty$, then there exists $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}^k$ such that
  \[ r_{A,h}(n) \sim \mathfrak{S}_{k,h}(n)F(n), \]
  where $\mathfrak{S}_{k,h}(n)$ is the singular series from Waring's problem.
  For $h \geq 2k^2(2\log k + \log\log k + O(1))$, we show the existence of $A \subseteq \mathbb{P}^k$ with
  \[ r_{A,h}(n) \sim \mathfrak{S}^*_{k,h}(n) c n^\kappa \]
  for $0 &lt; \kappa &lt; h/k - 1$ and $c &gt; 0$, where $\mathfrak{S}^*_{k,h}(n)$ is the singular series from Waring--Goldbach's problem. Additionally, for $0 \leq \kappa \leq h/k - 1$ and functions $\psi$ satisfying $\psi(x) \asymp_{\lambda} \psi(x^{\lambda})$ for every $\lambda&gt;0$, if $\log x \ll x^{\kappa} \psi(x) \ll x^{h/k-1}/(\log x)^h$, then there exists $A \subseteq \mathbb{P}^k$ with $r_{A,h}(n) \asymp n^\kappa \psi(n)$ for $n$ satisfying certain congruence conditions, producing thin subbases of prime powers when $\kappa = 0$, $\psi = \log$.</description>

      <title>First moments of ${\rm{GL}} (3) \times {\rm{GL}} (2)$ and ${\rm{GL}} (2)$ $L$-functions and their applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15886v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a self-dual Hecke-Maa\ss\ form for ${\rm{GL}}(3)$ underlying the symmetric square lift of a ${\rm{GL}}(2)$-newform of square-free level and trivial nebentypus. In this paper, we are interested in the first moments of the central values of ${\rm{GL}}(3) \times {\rm{GL}}(2)$ $L$-functions and ${\rm{GL}}(2)$ $L$-functions. As a result, we obtain an estimate for the first moment for $L(1/2, F\otimes f)$ over a family, where $F$ is of the level $q^2$, and $f\in \mathcal{B}^\ast_k(M)$ for any primes $q,M\ge 2$ such that $(q,M)=1$. We prove the subconvex bound for $L(1/2, F\otimes f)$ involving the levels aspects simultaneously in the range $M^{13/64+\varepsilon }\le q \le M^{11/40-\varepsilon}$ and $M&gt; q^\delta$ for any $\varepsilon, \delta&gt;0$ for the first time. Moreover, we further investigate the first moments of these $L$-functions in the weight $k$ aspect over $K\le k\le 2K$, with $K$ being a large number. As the results, we obtain a Lindel\"of average bound for the first moment of $L(1/2, f)L(1/2, F\otimes f)$ of degree 8 and an asymptotic formula for the first moment of $L(1/2, F\otimes f)$ with an error term of $O(K^{-1/4+\varepsilon})$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Supersingular curves via the Shimura--Taniyama method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a curve which admits an abelian cover of the projective line branched at three points, we study when its reduction to positive characteristic is supersingular. Using the method of Shimura and Taniyama, we give a complete classification when the genus of the curve is at most 10. The natural density of the set of primes for which this construction yields a supersingular curve is larger than expected.</description>

      <title>Root numbers for twisted Fermat quotient curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\ell$ be an odd prime, $N \geq 1$ be an integer, and $\delta \geq 1$ be a $\ell^N$-th power free integer such that ${\rm ord}_{\ell}(\delta) = 0$ or $\ell \nmid {\rm ord}_{\ell}(\delta)$. In this paper, we give an explicit formula for the root number of the Hecke character associated with a certain quotient curve of the twisted Fermat curve $X^{\ell^N} + Y^{\ell^N} = \delta$. This result gives a generalization of Stoll (2002) and Shu (2021).</description>

      <title>A family of polynomials and related congruences and series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02767v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study a family of polynomials $$S_n^{(m)}(x):=\sum_{i,j=0}^n\binom ni^m\binom nj^m\binom{i+j}ix^{i+j}\ \ (m,n=0,1,2,\ldots).$$ For example, we show that $$\sum_{k=0}^{p-1}S_k^{(0)}(x)\equiv\frac x{2x-1}\left(1+\left(\frac{1-4x^2}p\right)\right)\pmod p $$ for any odd prime $p$ and integer $x\not\equiv1/2\pmod p$, where $(\frac{\cdot}p)$ denotes the Legendre symbol. We also formulate some open conjectures on related congruences and series for $1/\pi$. For example, we conjecture that $$\sum_{k=0}^\infty(7k+1)\frac{S_k^{(2)}(1/11)}{9^k}=\frac{5445}{104\sqrt{39}\,\pi}$$ and $$\sum_{k=0}^\infty(1365k+181)\frac{S_k^{(2)}(1/18)}{16^k}=\frac{1377}{\sqrt2\,\pi}.$$</description>

      <title>On near superperfect numbers, the Goormaghtigh conjecture, and Mertens' theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\sigma(n)$ be the sum of the divisors of $n$. Kalita and Saikia defined a number $n$ to be near superperfect if $2n+d=\sigma(\sigma(n))$ for some positive divisor $d$ of $n$. We extend some of their results about near superperfect numbers and connect these results to the Goormaghtigh conjecture and to certain products of primes similar to those which appear in Mertens' theorem. We also define type II near superperfect numbers, which are those $n$ which satisfy $2n+d=\sigma(\sigma(n))$ for some positive divisor $d$ of $\sigma(n)$, and prove analogous results about these numbers.</description>

      <title>An obstruction to the local lifting problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.08377v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We are investigating the lifting problem for local actions involving semidirect products of a cyclic $p$-group with a cyclic group prime to $p$, where $p$ represents the characteristic of the special fiber. We establish a criterion based on the Harbater-Katz-Gabber compactification of local actions, enabling us to determine whether a given local action can be lifted or not. Specifically, in the case of the dihedral group, we present an example of a local dihedral action that cannot be lifted. This instance provides a more potent obstruction than the KGB obstruction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine the maximal dimension of compact subvarieties of $\mathcal{A}_g$, the moduli space of complex principally polarized abelian varieties of dimension $g$, and the maximal dimension of a compact subvariety through a very general point of $\mathcal{A}_g$. This also allows us to draw some conclusions for compact subvarieties of the moduli space of complex curves of compact type.</description>

      <title>Abelian surfaces over finite fields containing no curves of genus $3$ or less</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02493v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study abelian surfaces defined over finite fields which do not contain any possibly singular curve of genus less than or equal to $3$. Firstly, we complete and expand the characterisation of isogeny classes of abelian surfaces with no curves of genus up to $2$ initiated by the first author \emph{et al.~}in previous work. Secondly, we show that, for simple abelian surfaces, containing a curve of genus $3$ is equivalent to admitting a polarisation of degree $4$. Thanks to this result, we can use existing algorithms to check which isomorphism classes in the isogeny classes containing no genus $2$ curves have a polarisation of degree $4$. Thirdly, we characterise isogeny classes of abelian surfaces with no curves of genus $\leq 2$, containing no abelian surface with a polarisation of degree $4$. Finally, we describe the absolutely irreducible genus $3$ curves lying on abelian surfaces containing no curves of genus less than or equal to $2$, and show that their number of rational points is far from the Serre--Weil bound.</description>
