      <title>Fixed-point-free involutions on the boundaries of Right-angled Coxeter Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: About 20 years ago, Bogdan Nica conjectured that the boundary of any word-hyperbolic group admits admits a fixed-point-free involution. In this very short article, we prove a variation of the conjecture, replacing word-hyperbolic groups with Right-angled coxeter groups. This is not a solution to Nica's conjecture, but hopefully the techniques will shed some light regarding possible approaches to the problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By imposing conditions upon the index of a self-centralizing subgroup of a group, and upon the index of the center of the group, we are able to classify the Chermak-Delgado lattice of the group. This is our main result. We use this result to classify the Chermak-Delgado lattices of dicyclic groups and of metabelian $p$-groups of maximal class.</description>

Abstract: A group $G$ is said to have dense ${\cal CD}$-subgroups if each non-empty open interval of the subgroup lattice $L(G)$ contains a subgroup in the Chermak--Delgado lattice ${\cal CD}(G)$. In this note, we study finite groups satisfying this property.</description>

      <title>A permutation group acting transitively on certain collections of models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown, from $\sigma$-centered Martin's Axiom, that there exists a proper dense subgroup of the symmetric group on a countably infinite set whose natural action on sufficiently flexible relational structures is transitive. This allows us to give consistent positive answers to some questions of Peter M. Neumann from the 1980s.</description>

Abstract: We examine positive and negative results for the Gromov-Lawson-Rosenberg Conjecture within the class of crystallographic groups. We give necessary conditions within the class of split extensions of free abelian by cyclic groups to satisfy the unstable Gromov-Lawson-Rosenberg Conjecture. We also give necessary conditions within the same class of groups, producing an infinite number of counterexamples for the conjecture.</description>

      <title>Solenoids of Split Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solenoids induced by split sequences are introduced, as the inverse limit object of a sequence of fold maps. The topology of a solenoid is explored, and it is established that solenoids have naturally arising singular foliated structures. Our main purpose is to answer the question: "When is a solenoid minimal, both in a topological sense, and a measure theoretic sense?" To aid this, we introduce the notions of leaves, partial leaves and transversals of a solenoid and explore their properties. A combinatorial criterion for topological minimality of a solenoid, is constructed. When a given solenoid X doesn't contain finite partial leaves, the space of transverse measures of X, is proven to be equal to the inverse limit of a certain sequence of linear maps on convex cones. We conclude with providing a combinatorial criterion called "Semi-Normality" that allows us to recognize a wide class of uniquely ergodic solenoids.</description>

      <title>Cocompact Fuchsian groups with a modular embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Fuchsian group $\Gamma$ has a modular embedding if its adjoint trace field is a totally real number field and every unbounded Galois conjugate $\Gamma^\sigma$ comes equipped with a holomorphic (or conjugate holomorphic) map ${\phi^\sigma : \mathbb{B}^1 \to \mathbb{B}^1}$ intertwining the actions of $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma^\sigma$ on the Poincar\'e disk $\mathbb{B}^1$. This paper provides the first cocompact nonarithmetic Fuchsian groups with a modular embedding that are not commensurable with a triangle group. The main result, proved using period domains, is that any immersed totally geodesic complex curve on a complex hyperbolic $2$-orbifold has a modular embedding. Another consequence is that there are infinitely many signatures for which no finite-volume quotient of $\mathbb{B}^1$ with that signature can be an immersed totally geodesic curve on a complex hyperbolic $2$-orbifold.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Adversarial Attacks on Explainability Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical adversarial attacks are phrased as a constrained optimisation problem. Despite the efficacy of a constrained optimisation approach to adversarial attacks, one cannot trace how an adversarial point was generated. In this work, we propose an algebraic approach to adversarial attacks and study the conditions under which one can generate adversarial examples for post-hoc explainability models. Phrasing neural networks in the framework of geometric deep learning, algebraic adversarial attacks are constructed through analysis of the symmetry groups of neural networks. Algebraic adversarial examples provide a mathematically tractable approach to adversarial examples. We validate our approach of algebraic adversarial examples on two well-known and one real-world dataset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a flexible technique to estimate the characters of symmetric groups, via the Murnaghan--Nakayama rule, the Larsen--Shalev character bounds, the Naruse hook length formula, and appropriate diagram slicings. This allows us to prove sharp character bounds as well as asymptotic equivalents for characters of low-level representations. We also prove an optimal uniform character bound. As a result, we prove under a mild condition on the support size that random walks on symmetric groups generated by a conjugacy class exhibit a total variation and $L^2$ cutoff and find their cutoff profiles.</description>

      <title>Structural properties of reduced $C^*$-algebras associated with higher-rank lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first examples of higher-rank lattices whose reduced $C^{*}$-algebras satisfy strict comparison, stable rank one, selflessness, uniqueness of embeddings of the Jiang--Su algebra, and allow explicit computations of the Cuntz semigroup. This resolves a question raised in recent groundbreaking work of Amrutam, Gao, Kunnawalkam Elayavalli, and Patchell, in which they exhibited a large class of finitely generated non-amenable groups satisfying these properties. Our proof relies on quantitative estimates in projective dynamics, crucially using the exponential mixing for diagonalizable flows. As a result, we obtain an effective mixed-identity-freeness property, which, combined with V. Lafforgue's rapid decay theorem, yields the desired conclusions.</description>

      <title>J-braid groups are torus necklace groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a family of links we call torus necklaces for which the link groups are precisely the braid groups of generalised $J$-reflection groups. Moreover, this correspondence exhibits the meridians of the aforementioned link groups as braid reflections. In particular, this construction generalises to all irreducible rank two complex reflection groups a well-known correspondence between some rank two complex braid groups and some torus knot groups. In addition, as abstract groups, we show that the family of link groups associated to Seifert links coincides with the family of circular groups. This shows that every time a link group has a non-trivial center, it is a Garside group.</description>

Abstract: We give a characterization of toral relatively hyperbolic virtually special groups in terms of the profinite completion. We also prove a Tits alternative for subgroups of the profinite completion $\hat G$ of a relatively hyperbolic virtually compact special group $G$ and completely describe finitely generated pro-$p$ subgroups of $\hat G$. This applies to the profinite completion of the fundamental group of a hyperbolic arithmetic manifold. We deduce that all finitely generated pro-$p$ subgroups of the congruence kernel of a standard arithmetic lattice of $SO(n,1)$ are free pro-$p$.</description>

      <title>Rank type conditions on commutators in finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a subgroup $S$ of a group $G$, let $I_G(S)$ denote the set of commutators $[g,s]=g^{-1}g^s$, where $g\in G$ and $s\in S$, so that $[G,S]$ is the subgroup generated by $I_G(S)$. We prove that if $G$ is a $p$-soluble finite group with a Sylow $p$-subgroup $P$ such that any subgroup generated by a subset of $I_G(P)$ is $r$-generated, then $[G,P]$ has $r$-bounded rank. We produce examples showing that such a result does not hold without the assumption of $p$-solubility. Instead, we prove that if a finite group $G$ has a Sylow $p$-subgroup $P$ such that (a) any subgroup generated by a subset of $I_G(P)$ is $r$-generated, and (b) for any $x\in I_G(P)$, any subgroup generated by a subset of $I_G(x)$ is $r$-generated, then $[G,P]$ has $r$-bounded rank. We also prove that if $G$ is a finite group such that for every prime $p$ dividing $|G|$ for any Sylow $p$-subgroup $P$, any subgroup generated by a subset of $I_G(P)$ can be generated by $r$ elements, then the derived subgroup $G'$ has $r$-bounded rank. As an important tool in the proofs, we prove the following result, which is also of independent interest: if a finite group $G$ admits a group of coprime automorphisms $A$ such that any subgroup generated by a subset of $I_G(A)$ is $r$-generated, then the rank of $[G,A]$ is $r$-bounded.</description>

      <title>On acylindrical tree actions and outer automorphism group of Baumslag-Solitar groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores acylindrical actions on trees, building on previous works related to the mapping class group and projection complexes. We demonstrate that the quotient action of a $1$-acylindrical action of a group on a tree by an equivariant family of subgroups remains $1$-acylindrical. We establish criteria for ensuring that this quotient action is non-elementary acylindrical, thus preserving acylindrical hyperbolicity of the group. Additionally, we show that the fundamental group of a graph of groups admits the largest acylindrical action on its Bass-Serre tree under certain conditions. As an application, we analyze the outer automorphism group of non-solvable Baumslag-Solitar groups, we prove its acylindrical hyperbolicity, highlighting the differences between various tree actions and identifying the largest acylindrical action.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1108.2147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a natural pseudometric on the space of actions of d-generated groups. In this pseudometric, the zero classes correspond to the weak equivalence classes defined by Kechris, and the metric identification is compact. We achieve this by employing symbolic dynamics and an ultraproduct construction which also facilitates the extension of our results to unitary representations. As a byproduct, we show that the weak equivalence class of every free non-amenable action contains an action that satisfies the measurable von Neumann problem.</description>

      <title>Tree-like graphings, wallings, and median graphings of equivalence relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13010v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove several results showing that every locally finite Borel graph whose large-scale geometry is "tree-like" induces a treeable equivalence relation. In particular, our hypotheses hold if each component of the original graph either has bounded tree-width or is quasi-isometric to a tree, answering a question of Tucker-Drob. In the latter case, we moreover show that there exists a Borel quasi-isometry to a Borel forest, under the additional assumption of (componentwise) bounded degree. We also extend these results on quasi-treeings to Borel proper metric spaces. In fact, our most general result shows treeability of countable Borel equivalence relations equipped with an abstract wallspace structure on each class obeying some local finiteness conditions, which we call a proper walling. The proof is based on the Stone duality between proper wallings and median graphs, i.e., CAT(0) cube complexes. Finally, we strengthen the conclusion of treeability in these results to hyperfiniteness in the case where the original graph has one (selected) end per component, generalizing the same result for trees due to Dougherty--Jackson--Kechris.</description>

      <title>On a Rice theorem for dynamical properties of SFTs on groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10347v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a group with undecidable domino problem, such as $\mathbb{Z}^2$. We prove that all nontrivial dynamical properties for sofic $G$-subshifts are undecidable, that this is not true for $G$-SFTs, and an undecidability result for dynamical properties of $G$-SFTs similar to the Adian-Rabin theorem. Furthermore we prove a Rice-like result for dynamical invariants asserting that every computable real-valued invariant for $G$-SFTs that is monotone by disjoint unions and products is constant.</description>

      <title>Convex cocompact groups in real hyperbolic spaces with limit set a Pontryagin sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We exhibit two examples of convex cocompact subgroups of the isometry groups of real hyperbolic spaces with limit set a Pontryagin sphere: one generated by $50$ reflections of $\mathbb{H}^4$, and the other by a rotation of order $21$ and a reflection of $\mathbb{H}^6$. For each of them, we also locate convex cocompact subgroups with limit set a Menger curve.</description>

      <title>On smooth-group actions on reductive groups and spherical buildings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a field, and suppose that $\Gamma$ is a smooth $k$-group that acts on a connected, reductive $k$-group $\widetilde G$. Let $G$ denote the maximal smooth, connected subgroup of the group of $\Gamma$-fixed points in $\widetilde G$. Under fairly general conditions, we show that $G$ is a reductive $k$-group, and that the image of the functorial embedding $\mathscr{S}(G) \longrightarrow \mathscr{S}(\widetilde G)$ of spherical buildings is the set of ``$\Gamma$-fixed points in $\mathscr{S}(\widetilde G)$'', in a suitable sense. In particular, we do not need to assume that $\Gamma$ has order relatively prime to the characteristic of $k$ (nor even that $\Gamma$ is finite), nor that the action of $\Gamma$ preserves a Borel-torus pair in $\widetilde G$.</description>
