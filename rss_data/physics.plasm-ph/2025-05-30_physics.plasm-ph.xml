      <title>Electron-positron pair annihilation in kinetic plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The process of electron positron pair annihilation, driven by strong fields (Inverse Schwinger mechanism) and high-frequency waves, is studied using the Dirac Heisenberg Wigner formalism. In an electron positron plasma, the presence of a strong field leads to both pair creation and annihilation. Depending on plasma properties such as non-degeneracy and the momentum distribution, pair annihilation can dominate over pair creation. The energy released from annihilated pairs can lead to an enhancement of the field energy, provided that the plasma effectively blocks the creation of new pairs. Additionally, pair annihilation induced by high-frequency waves is shown to occur when the photon energy matches the energy of the pairs in the plasma.</description>

      <title>Wideband Glide-Symmetric Slow-Wave Structure for Millimeter-Wave Sheet Beam TWTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a slow-wave structure (SWS) for a millimeter-wave sheet-beam traveling-wave tube (TWT) with wide bandwidth. The wideband and stable operation is enabled through the topological properties associated with glide-symmetry that close the bandgap at the $3\pi$-point and also make the on-axis interaction impedance negligible for the backward wave. This space harmonic structure is designed to operate in the $V$-band over 55-68 GHz with synchronism to a 5.2 kV, 11 mA sheet electron beam that will be produced by a diamond field-emitter array.</description>

      <title>Measurements of Fusion Yield on the Centrifugal Mirror Fusion Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Centrifugal Mirror Fusion Experiment (CMFX) at the University of Maryland, College Park is a rotating mirror device that utilizes a central cathode to generate a radial electric field which induces a strongly sheared azimuthal $E\times B$ flow to improve plasma confinement and stability. The fusion yield of CMFX plasmas is assessed by diagnosis of neutron emission for the first time. The total neutron yield is measured with two xylene (EJ-301) and deuterated-xylene (EJ-301D) liquid scintillator detectors absolutely calibrated with an in silico method. A larger xylene scintillator was cross-calibrated and used to measure the time dynamics of the fusion rate under various experimental conditions. A permanently installed $^3$He gas tube detector was independently calibrated with a Cf-252 neutron source to make total yield measurements and provide an independent validation of the scintillator calibration. An interpretive modeling framework was developed using the 0D code MCTrans++ (Schwartz et al 2024 JPP) to infer undiagnosed plasma parameters such as density, temperature, and confinement time. A peak neutron emission rate of 8.4$\times 10^{6}$ $\pm$ 7.0$\times 10^{5}$ was measured (neglecting modeling uncertainties), with an inferred triple product of 1.9~$\times~10^{17}$ $\mathrm{m^{-3}}$ keV s from 0D modeling.</description>

      <title>Landau Damping, Schr\"odinger equation, and Fluctuation Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A linearized Vlasov-Poisson system of equations is transformed into a Schr\"odinger equation, which is used to demonstrate that the fluctuation theorem holds for the relative stochastic entropy, defined in terms of the probability density functional of the particle velocity distribution function in the Landau damping process. The difference between the energy perturbation, normalized by the equilibrium temperature, and the entropy perturbation constitutes a time-independent invariant of the system. This invariant takes the quadratic form of the perturbed velocity distribution function and corresponds to the squared amplitude of the state vector that satisfies the Schr\"odinger equation. Exact solutions, constructed from a discrete set of Hamiltonian eigenvectors, are employed to formulate and numerically validate the fluctuation theorem for the Landau damping process. The results offer new insights into the formulations of collisionless plasma processes within the framework of nonequilibirium statistical mechanics.</description>

      <title>On miniature ultra-high-field commercial stellarator reactors with breeding external to resistive coils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The working parameters and challenges of transposed (breeding external to resistive coils) ultra-high-field pulsed commercial stellarator reactors of small plasma volume are studied. They may allow production of commercial heat and electricity in a tiny and simple device, and contribute to the knowledge on burning plasmas. The concept is based on the previous works (V. Queral et al.) performed for the high-field experimental fusion reactor i-ASTER (J. Fus. Energy 37 2018) and the recent Distributed Divertor concept (non-resonant divertor on the full toroid; J. Fus. Energy 44 2025). The present proposal is driven by the limitation on the minimum size of typical commercial stellarator reactors due to the space needed for internal breeding and shielding of superconducting coils. This limit is about 400 m3, as deduced from e.g. ARIES-CS, ASTER-CP-(IEEE Trans. Plasma Sci. 52 2024) and Stellaris reactors. This fact, together with the accuracy and complexity of the systems, hinders quick iterations for the fast development of stellarator reactors, and also tokamaks. The concept is based on a pulsed high-beta large-aspect-ratio stellarator of small plasma volume (2-4 m3) and ultra-high magnetic field (~ 10-20 T), structured alike i-ASTER and UST_3 stellarators (external monolithic support and internal resistive coils), thermally-adiabatic aluminium conductors for neutron transparency, a low-recycling Distributed Divertor to extract the huge short-pulsed heat power from ionized particles (pulse ~ 5 {\tau}E), low pulsed duty cycle of 1-5%, and liquid or solid breeding material around and externally to the reactor core. Different cases and operating points are studied. The main elements, e.g. heat power on the Distributed Divertor, mechanical stresses in the coil support, radiation lifetime, and the prospect of net electricity production are evaluated. The involved challenges are assessed.</description>

      <title>Conservative velocity mappings for discontinuous Galerkin kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuum computational kinetic plasma models evolve the distribution function of a plasma species $f_s$ on a phase-space grid over time. In many problems of interest the distribution function has limited extent in velocity space, hence using a highly refined mesh everywhere would be costly and slow. Nonuniform velocity grids can reduce the computational cost by placing more degrees of freedom where $f_s$ is appreciable and fewer where it is not. In this work we introduce a first-of-its kind discontinuous Galerkin approach to nonuniform velocity-space discretization using mapped velocity coordinates. This new method is presented in the context of a gyrokinetic model used to study magnetized plasmas. We create discretizations of collisionless and collisional terms using mappings in a way that exactly conserves particles and energy. Numerical tests of such properties are presented, and we show that this new discretization can reproduce earlier gyrokinetic simulations using grids with up to 48 times fewer cells.</description>

      <title>Forced 3D reconnection in an exponentially separating magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a solvable scenario for 3D reconnection in a sheared magnetic field. We consider a localized external force that is applied slowly to a flux tube and then maintained, generating an Alfv\'{e}nic perturbation that spreads along the field lines. Separation of the sheared field lines reduces the scale of the perturbation across the field, enhancing magnetic diffusion. For a fusion-motivated equilibrium with exponential field-line separation, we find a reconnection timescale proportional to $S/\ln S$ under magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and to $S^{1/3}$ for semicollisional electron-only reconnection, where $S$ is the Lundquist number of the perturbed flux tube. We generalize these results to arbitrary magnetic geometries, showing that the semicollisional case is geometry independent. Interestingly, we find that slower field-line separation yields an increased reconnection rate in MHD.</description>

      <title>Nystr\"om Type Exponential Integrators for Strongly Magnetized Charged Particle Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00288v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Calculating the dynamics of charged particles in electromagnetic fields (i.e. the particle pushing problem) is one of the most computationally intensive components of particle-in-cell (PIC) methods for plasma physics simulations. This task is especially challenging when the plasma is strongly magnetized, since in this case the particle motion consists of a wide range of temporal scales from highly oscillatory fast gyromotion to slow macroscopic behavior and the resulting numerical model is very stiff. Current state-of-the-art time integrators used to simulate particle motion have limitations given the severe numerical stiffness of the problem and more efficient methods are of interest. Recently, exponential integrators have been proposed as a promising new approach for these simulations and shown to offer computational advantages over commonly used schemes. Exponential methods can solve linear problems exactly and are $A$-stable. In this paper, the standard exponential algorithms framework is extended to derive Nystr\"om-type exponential methods that integrate the Newtonian equations of motion as a second-order differential equation. Specific Nystr\"om-type schemes of second and third orders are derived and applied to strongly magnetized particle pushing problems. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate that the Nystr\"om-type exponential integrators can provide significant improvement in computational efficiency over the standard exponential methods.</description>
