      <title>Bidding Games with Charging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph games lie at the algorithmic core of many automated design problems in computer science. These are games usually played between two players on a given graph, where the players keep moving a token along the edges according to pre-determined rules, and the winner is decided based on the infinite path traversed by the token from a given initial position. In bidding games, the players initially get some monetary budgets which they need to use to bid for the privilege of moving the token at each step. Each round of bidding affects the players' available budgets, which is the only form of update that the budgets experience. We introduce bidding games with charging where the players can additionally improve their budgets during the game by collecting vertex-dependent charges. Unlike traditional bidding games (where all charges are zero), bidding games with charging allow non-trivial recurrent behaviors. We show that the central property of traditional bidding games generalizes to bidding games with charging: For each vertex there exists a threshold ratio, which is the necessary and sufficient fraction of the total budget for winning the game from that vertex. While the thresholds of traditional bidding games correspond to unique fixed points of linear systems of equations, in games with charging, these fixed points are no longer unique. This significantly complicates the proof of existence and the algorithmic computation of thresholds for infinite-duration objectives. We also provide the lower complexity bounds for computing thresholds for Rabin and Streett objectives, which are the first known lower bounds in any form of bidding games (with or without charging), and we solve the following repair problem for safety and reachability games that have unsatisfiable objectives: Can we distribute a given amount of charge to the players in a way such that the objective can be satisfied?</description>

      <title>The k-Facility Location Problem Via Optimal Transport: A Bayesian Study of the Percentile Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the $k$-Facility Location Problem ($k$-FLP) within the Bayesian Mechanism Design framework, in which agents' preferences are samples of a probability distributed on a line. Our primary contribution is characterising the asymptotic behavior of percentile mechanisms, which varies according to the distribution governing the agents' types. To achieve this, we connect the $k$-FLP and projection problems in the Wasserstein space. Owing to this relation, we show that the ratio between the expected cost of a percentile mechanism and the expected optimal cost is asymptotically bounded. Furthermore, we characterize the limit of this ratio and analyze its convergence speed. Our asymptotic study is complemented by deriving an upper bound on the Bayesian approximation ratio, applicable when the number of agents $n$ exceeds the number of facilities $k$. We also characterize the optimal percentile mechanism for a given agent's distribution through a system of $k$ equations. Finally, we estimate the optimality loss incurred when the optimal percentile mechanism is derived using an approximation of the agents' distribution rather than the actual distribution.</description>

      <title>Hidden-Role Games: Equilibrium Concepts and Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16017v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the class of games known as hidden-role games in which players are assigned privately to teams and are faced with the challenge of recognizing and cooperating with teammates. This model includes both popular recreational games such as the Mafia/Werewolf family and The Resistance (Avalon) and many real-world settings, such as distributed systems where nodes need to work together to accomplish a goal in the face of possible corruptions. There has been little to no formal mathematical grounding of such settings in the literature, and it was previously not even clear what the right solution concepts (notions of equilibria) should be. A suitable notion of equilibrium should take into account the communication channels available to the players (e.g., can they communicate? Can they communicate in private?). Defining such suitable notions turns out to be a nontrivial task with several surprising consequences. In this paper, we provide the first rigorous definition of equilibrium for hidden-role games, which overcomes serious limitations of other solution concepts not designed for hidden-role games. We then show that in certain cases, including the above recreational games, optimal equilibria can be computed efficiently. In most other cases, we show that computing an optimal equilibrium is at least NP-hard or coNP-hard. Lastly, we experimentally validate our approach by computing exact equilibria for complete 5- and 6-player Avalon instances whose size in terms of number of information sets is larger than $10^{56}$.</description>

      <title>Equilibria in Two-Stage Facility Location with Atomic Clients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider competitive facility location as a two-stage multi-agent system with two types of clients. For a given host graph with weighted clients on the vertices, first facility agents strategically select vertices for opening their facilities. Then, the clients strategically select which of the opened facilities in their neighborhood to patronize. Facilities want to attract as much client weight as possible, clients want to minimize congestion on the chosen facility.
  All recently studied versions of this model assume that clients can split their weight strategically. We consider clients with unsplittable weights but allow mixed strategies. So clients may randomize over which facility to patronize. Besides modeling a natural client behavior, this subtle change yields drastic changes, e.g., for a given facility placement, qualitatively different client equilibria are possible.
  As our main result, we show that pure subgame perfect equilibria always exist if all client weights are identical. For this, we use a novel potential function argument, employing a hierarchical classification of the clients and sophisticated rounding in each step. In contrast, for non-identical clients, we show that deciding the existence of even approximately stable states is computationally intractable. On the positive side, we give a tight bound of $2$ on the price of anarchy which implies high social welfare of equilibria, if they exist.</description>

      <title>Equitable Pricing in Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How does auction design affect the division of surplus among buyers in auctions? We propose a parsimonious measure for equity and apply it to multi-unit auctions, in which unit demand buyers with private-common values pay mixtures of uniform and pay-as-bid pricing. We show that uniform pricing is equity-optimal if and only if buyers have a pure common value. Surprisingly, however, with pure private values, pay-as-bid pricing may not be optimal, and uniform pricing can achieve higher surplus equity. We turn to the class of log-concave signal distributions and provide bounds on the equity-optimal pricing rule.</description>

      <title>Consistent Conjectures in Dynamic Matching Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a framework to study stability notions for two-sided dynamic matching markets in which matching is one-to-one and irreversible. The framework gives centerstage to the set of matchings an agent anticipates would ensue should they remain unmatched, which we refer to as the agent's conjectures. A collection of conjectures, together with a pairwise stability and individual rationality requirement given the conjectures, defines a solution concept for the economy. We identify a sufficient condition--consistency--for a family of conjectures to lead to a nonempty solution (cf. Hafalir, 2008). As an application, we introduce two families of consistent conjectures and their corresponding solution concepts: continuation-value-respecting dynamic stability, and the extension to dynamic markets of the solution concept in Hafalir (2008), sophisticated dynamic stability.</description>
