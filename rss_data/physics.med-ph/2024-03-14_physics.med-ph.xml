      <title>Generating Synthetic Computed Tomography for Radiotherapy: SynthRAD2023 Challenge Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiation therapy plays a crucial role in cancer treatment, necessitating precise delivery of radiation to tumors while sparing healthy tissues over multiple days. Computed tomography (CT) is integral for treatment planning, offering electron density data crucial for accurate dose calculations. However, accurately representing patient anatomy is challenging, especially in adaptive radiotherapy, where CT is not acquired daily. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides superior soft-tissue contrast. Still, it lacks electron density information while cone beam CT (CBCT) lacks direct electron density calibration and is mainly used for patient positioning. Adopting MRI-only or CBCT-based adaptive radiotherapy eliminates the need for CT planning but presents challenges. Synthetic CT (sCT) generation techniques aim to address these challenges by using image synthesis to bridge the gap between MRI, CBCT, and CT. The SynthRAD2023 challenge was organized to compare synthetic CT generation methods using multi-center ground truth data from 1080 patients, divided into two tasks: 1) MRI-to-CT and 2) CBCT-to-CT. The evaluation included image similarity and dose-based metrics from proton and photon plans. The challenge attracted significant participation, with 617 registrations and 22/17 valid submissions for tasks 1/2. Top-performing teams achieved high structural similarity indices (&gt;0.87/0.90) and gamma pass rates for photon (&gt;98.1%/99.0%) and proton (&gt;99.0%/97.3%) plans. However, no significant correlation was found between image similarity metrics and dose accuracy, emphasizing the need for dose evaluation when assessing the clinical applicability of sCT. SynthRAD2023 facilitated the investigation and benchmarking of sCT generation techniques, providing insights for developing MRI-only and CBCT-based adaptive radiotherapy.</description>

      <title>Protocol Optimization for Functional Cardiac CT Imaging Using Noise Emulation in the Raw Data Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Four-dimensional (4D) wide coverage computed tomography (CT) is an effective imaging modality for measuring the mechanical function of the myocardium. However, repeated CT measurement across several heartbeats is still a concern. A projection-domain noise emulation method is presented to generate accurate low-dose (mA modulated) 4D cardiac CT scans from high-dose scans, enabling protocol optimization to deliver sufficient image quality for functional cardiac analysis while using a dose level that is as low as reasonably achievable. Given a targeted low-dose mA modulation curve, the proposed noise emulation method injects both quantum and electronic noise of proper magnitude and correlation to the high-dose data in projection domain. A spatially varying detector gain term as well as its calibration method were proposed to further improve the noise emulation accuracy. To determine the low dose threshold, a projection domain image quality (IQ) metric was proposed that is based on the number of projection rays that do not fall under the non-linear region of the detector. Experiments were performed to validate the noise emulation method with both phantom and clinical data. For both phantom and clinical data, the low-dose emulated images exhibited similar noise magnitude, artifacts, and texture to that of the real low-dose images. The proposed channel-dependent detector gain term resulted in additional increase in emulation accuracy. Using the proposed IQ metric, recommended kVp and mA settings were calculated for low dose 4D Cardiac CT acquisitions for patients of different sizes. In conclusion, a detailed method to estimate system-dependent parameters for a raw-data based low dose emulation framework was described. The proposed low-dose emulation method can be used to prospectively select patient-specific minimal-dose protocols for functional cardiac CT.</description>

      <title>Microdosimetry of a clinical carbon-ion pencil beam at MedAustron -- Part 1: experimental characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper characterizes the microdosimetric spectra of a single-energy carbon-ion pencil beam at MedAustron using a miniature solid-state silicon microdosimeter to estimate the impact of the lateral distribution of the different fragments on the microdosimetric spectra. The microdosimeter was fixed at one depth and then laterally moved away from the central beam axis in steps of approximately 2 mm. The measurements were taken in both horizontal and vertical direction in a water phantom at different depths. In a position on the distal dose fall-off beyond the Bragg peak, the frequency-mean and the dose-mean lineal energies were derived using either the entire range of y-values, or a sub-range of y values, presumingly corresponding mainly to contributions from primary particles. The measured microdosimetric spectra do not exhibit a significant change up to 4 mm away from the beam central axis. For lateral positions more than 4 mm away from the central axis, the relative contribution of the lower lineal-energy part of the spectrum increases with lateral distance due to the increased partial dose from secondary fragments. The average values yF and yD are almost constant for each partial contribution. However, when all particles are considered together, the average value of yF and yD varies with distance from the axis due to the changing dose fractions of these two components varying by 30 % and 10 % respectively up to the most off axis vertical position. Characteristic features in the microdosimetric spectra providing strong indications of the presence of helium and boron fragments have been observed downstream of the distal part of the Bragg peak. We were able to investigate the radiation quality as function of off-axis position. These measurements emphasize variation of the radiation quality within the beam and this has implications in terms of relative biological effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Pulse-echo ultrasound attenuation tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first fully two-dimensional attenuation imaging technique developed for pulse-echo ultrasound systems. Unlike state-of-the-art techniques, which use line-by-line acquisitions, our method uses steered emissions to constrain attenuation values at each location with multiple crossing wave paths, essential to resolve the spatial variations of this tissue property. At every location, we compute normalized cross-correlations between the beamformed images that are obtained from emissions at different steering angles. We demonstrate that their log-amplitudes provide the changes between attenuation-induced amplitude losses undergone by the different incident waves. This allows us to formulate a linear tomographic problem, which we efficiently solve via a Tikhonov-regularized least-squares approach. The performance of our tomography technique is first validated in numerical examples and then experimentally demonstrated in custom-made tissue-mimicking phantoms with inclusions of varying size, echogenicity, and attenuation. We show that this technique is particularly good at resolving lateral variations in tissue attenuation and remains accurate in media with varying echogenicity. Based on a similar principle, this method can be easily combined with computed ultrasound tomography in echo mode (CUTE) for speed-of-sound imaging, paving the way towards a multi-modal ultrasound tomography framework characterizing multiple acoustic tissue properties simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Pre-examinations Improve Automated Metastases Detection on Cranial MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Materials and methods: First, a dual-time approach was assessed, for which the CNN was provided sequences of the MRI that initially depicted new MM (diagnosis MRI) as well as of a prediagnosis MRI: inclusion of only contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images (CNNdual_ce) was compared with inclusion of also the native T1-weighted images, T2-weighted images, and FLAIR sequences of both time points (CNNdual_all).Second, results were compared with the corresponding single time approaches, in which the CNN was provided exclusively the respective sequences of the diagnosis MRI.Casewise diagnostic performance parameters were calculated from 5-fold cross-validation.
  Results: In total, 94 cases with 494 MMs were included. Overall, the highest diagnostic performance was achieved by inclusion of only the contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images of the diagnosis and of a prediagnosis MRI (CNNdual_ce, sensitivity = 73%, PPV = 25%, F1-score = 36%). Using exclusively contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images as input resulted in significantly less false-positives (FPs) compared with inclusion of further sequences beyond contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images (FPs = 5/7 for CNNdual_ce/CNNdual_all, P &lt; 1e-5). Comparison of contrast-enhanced dual and mono time approaches revealed that exclusion of prediagnosis MRI significantly increased FPs (FPs = 5/10 for CNNdual_ce/CNNce, P &lt; 1e-9).Approaches with only native sequences were clearly inferior to CNNs that were provided contrast-enhanced sequences.
  Conclusions: Automated MM detection on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images performed with high sensitivity. Frequent FPs due to artifacts and vessels were significantly reduced by additional inclusion of prediagnosis MRI, but not by inclusion of further sequences beyond contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images. Future studies might investigate different change detection architectures for computer-aided detection.</description>

      <title>MD-Dose: A Diffusion Model based on the Mamba for Radiotherapy Dose Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiation therapy is crucial in cancer treatment. Experienced experts typically iteratively generate high-quality dose distribution maps, forming the basis for excellent radiation therapy plans. Therefore, automated prediction of dose distribution maps is significant in expediting the treatment process and providing a better starting point for developing radiation therapy plans. With the remarkable results of diffusion models in predicting high-frequency regions of dose distribution maps, dose prediction methods based on diffusion models have been extensively studied. However, existing methods mainly utilize CNNs or Transformers as denoising networks. CNNs lack the capture of global receptive fields, resulting in suboptimal prediction performance. Transformers excel in global modeling but face quadratic complexity with image size, resulting in significant computational overhead. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel diffusion model, MD-Dose, based on the Mamba architecture for predicting radiation therapy dose distribution in thoracic cancer patients. In the forward process, MD-Dose adds Gaussian noise to dose distribution maps to obtain pure noise images. In the backward process, MD-Dose utilizes a noise predictor based on the Mamba to predict the noise, ultimately outputting the dose distribution maps. Furthermore, We develop a Mamba encoder to extract structural information and integrate it into the noise predictor for localizing dose regions in the planning target volume (PTV) and organs at risk (OARs). Through extensive experiments on a dataset of 300 thoracic tumor patients, we showcase the superiority of MD-Dose in various metrics and time consumption.</description>
