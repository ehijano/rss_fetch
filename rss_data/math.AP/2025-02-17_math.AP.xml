      <title>Sharp energy decay rates for the damped wave equation on the torus via non-polynomial derivative bound conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the damped wave equation on the torus, when some geodesics never meet the positive set of the damping, energy decay rates are known to depend on derivative bounds and growth properties of the damping near the boundary of its support, as well as the geometry of the support of the damping. In this paper we obtain, sometimes sharp, energy decay rates for damping which satisfy more general non-polynomial derivative bounds and growth properties. We also show how these rates can depend on the geometry of the support of the damping. We prove general results and apply them to examples of damping growing exponentially slowly, polynomial-logarithmically, or logarithmically. The decay rates found for these examples interpolate between known sharp rates for purely polynomial damping. The proof relies on estimating the solution at very fine, non-poynomial, semiclassical scales to obtain resolvent estimates, which are then converted to energy decay rates via semigroup theory.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent bounds method for dissipative PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the method of self-consistent bounds for dissipative PDEs with periodic boundary conditions. We prove convergence theorems for a class of dissipative PDEs, which constitute a theoretical basis of a general framework for construction of an algorithm that computes bounds for the solutions of the underlying PDE and its dependence on initial conditions.
  We also show, that the classical examples of parabolic PDEs including Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation and the Navier-Stokes on the torus fit into this framework.</description>

      <title>On periodic traveling wave solutions with or without phase transition to the Navier-Stokes-Korteweg and the Euler-Korteweg equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Navier-Stokes-Korteweg and the Euler-Korteweg equations are considered in isothermal setting. These are diffuse interface models of two-phase flow. For the Navier-Stokes-Korteweg equations, we show that there is no periodic traveling wave solution with phase transition although there exists a non-constant periodic traveling wave solution with no phase transition. For the Euler-Korteweg equations, we show that there always exists a periodic traveling wave solution with phase transition for any period if the Korteweg relaxation parameter is small compared with the period provided that the available energy is double-well type. We also show that such a periodic traveling wave solution tends to a monotone traveling wave solution as the period tends to infinity under suitable spatial translation. Our numerical experiment suggests that there is periodic traveling wave with phase transition which is stable under periodic perturbation for small viscosity but it seems that this is a transition pattern.</description>

      <title>The N-link model for slender rods in a viscous fluid: well-posedness and convergence to classical elastohydrodynamics equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flexible fibers at the microscopic scale, such as flagella and cilia, play essential roles in biological and synthetic systems. The dynamics of these slender filaments in viscous flows involve intricate interactions between their mechanical properties and hydrodynamic drag. In this paper, considering a 1D, planar, inextensible Euler-Bernoulli rod in a viscous fluid modeled by Resistive Force Theory, we establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions for the $N$-link model, a mechanical model, designed to approximate the continuous filament with rigid segments. Then, we prove the convergence of the $N$-link model's solutions towards the solutions to classical elastohydrodynamics equations of a flexible slender rod. This provides an existence result for the limit model, comparable to those by Mori and Ohm [Nonlinearity, 2023], in a different functional context and with different methods. Due to its mechanical foundation, the discrete system satisfies an energy dissipation law, which serves as one of the main ingredients in our proofs. Our results provide mathematical validation for the discretization strategy that consists in approximating a continuous filament by the mechanical $N$-link model, which does not correspond to a classical approximation of the underlying PDE.</description>

      <title>On Self-Propulsion by Oscillations in a Viscous Liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose that a body $\mathscr B$ can move by translatory motion with velocity $\boldsymbol{\gamma}$ in an otherwise quiescent Navier-Stokes liquid, $\mathscr L$, filling the entire space outside $\mathscr B$. Denote by $\Omega = \Omega(t)$, $t\in\mathbb{R}$, the one-parameter family of bounded, sufficiently smooth domains of $\mathbb{R}^3$, each one representing the configuration of $\mathscr B$ at time $t$ with respect to a frame with the origin at the center of mass $G$ and axes parallel to those of an inertial frame. We assume that there are no external forces acting on the coupled system $\mathscr S := \mathscr B +\mathscr L$ and that the only driving mechanism is a prescribed change in shape of $\Omega$ with time. The self-propulsion problem that we would like to address can be thus qualitatively formulated as follows. Suppose that $\mathscr B$ changes its shape in a given time-periodic fashion, namely, $\Omega(t+T) = \Omega(t)$, for some $T &gt; 0$ and all $t \in \mathbb{R}$. Then, find necessary and sufficient conditions on the map $t\mapsto \Omega(t)$ securing that $\mathscr B$ self-propels, that is, $G$ covers any given finite distance in a finite time. We show that this problem is solvable, in a suitable function class, provided the amplitude of the oscillations is below a given constant. Moreover, we provide examples where the propelling velocity of $\mathscr B$ is explicitly evaluated in terms of the physical parameters and the frequency of oscillations.</description>

      <title>Geometric blow-up criteria for the non-homogeneous incompressible Euler equations in 2-D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns the study of the incompressible Euler equations with variable density, in the case of space dimension $d=2$. Contrarily to their homogeneous (constant density) counterpart, those equations are not known to be well-posed globally in time. A classical blow-up/continuation criterion for smooth solutions relies on the control of the Lipschitz norm of the velocity field $u$. Here we show that, for establishing blow-up or continuation of solutions, it is enough to determine a control of $\nabla u$ only along the direction $X=\nabla^\perp\rho$, where $\rho$ represents the density of the fluid. Our results deal with both the subcritical regularity and critical regularity frameworks. They rely on a novel approach to study regularity of solutions for the density-dependent incompressible Euler equations. Besides, they allow to recover the global well-posedness for $\rho\equiv {\rm cst}$ as a particular case.</description>

      <title>Wavefront Solutions for Reaction-diffusion-convection Models with Accumulation Term and Aggregative Movements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we analyze the wavefront solutions of parabolic partial differential equations of the type \[ g(u)u_{\tau}+f(u)u_{x}=\left(D(u)u_{x}\right)_{x}+\rho(u),\quad u\left(\tau,x\right)\in[0,1] \] where the reaction term $\rho$ is of monostable-type. We allow the diffusivity $D$ and the accumulation term $g$ to have a finite number of changes of sign.
  We provide an existence result of travelling wave solutions (t.w.s.) together with an estimate of the threshold wave speed. Finally, we classify the t.w.s. between classical and sharp ones.</description>

      <title>Intermittency and Dissipation Regularity in Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We lay down a geometric-analytic framework to capture properties of energy dissipation within weak solutions to the incompressible Euler equations. For solutions with spatial Besov regularity, it is proved that the Duchon-Robert distribution has improved regularity in a negative Besov space and, in the case it is a Radon measure, it is absolutely continuous with respect to a suitable Hausdorff measure. This imposes quantitative constraints on the dimension of the, possibly fractal, dissipative set and the admissible structure functions exponents, relating to the phenomenon of "intermittency" in turbulence. As a by-product of the approach, we also recover many known "Onsager singularity" type results.</description>

      <title>On the zero capillarity limit for the Euler-Korteweg system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Euler-Korteweg equations with a weak capillarity tensor. It formally converges to the Euler equations in the zero capillarity limit. Our aim is two-fold : first we prove rigorously this limit in R d , d $\ge$ 1, and obtain a more precise BKW expansion of the solution, second we initiate the study of the problem on the half space. In this case we obtain a priori estimates for the solutions that degenerate as the capillary coefficient converges to zero, and we explain this degeneracy with the construction of a (formal) BKW expansion that exhibits boundary layers. The results on the full space extend and improve a classical result of Grenier (1998) on the semi-classical limit of nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equations. The analysis on the half space is restricted to the case of quantum fluids with irrotational velocity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper deals with the solvability of the following doubly singular boundary value problem \[\begin{cases} \dot z = c g(u)-f(u) -\dfrac{h(u)}{z^\alpha}\\ z(0^+)=0, z(1^-)=0, \ z(u)&gt;0 \text{ in } (0,1)\end{cases}\] naturally arising in the study of the existence and properties of travelling waves for reaction-diffusion-convection equations governed by the $p-$Laplacian operator.
  Here $c,\alpha$ are real parameters, with $\alpha&gt;0$, and $f,g,h$ are continuous functions in $[0,1]$, with \[ h(0)=h(1), \quad h(u)&gt;0 \text{ in } (0,1).\]</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the degenerate/singular fully nonlinear dead-core systems coupled with strong absorption terms. Several properties, such as improved regularity for viscosity solutions along the free boundary, non-degeneracy, a measure estimate of free boundary, some Liouville-type results, and the behavior of blow-up solution, are proved. We also investigate sharp and improved regularity estimates for viscosity solutions to Hardy-H\'{e}non-type equations with possibly singular weight and strong absorption ruled by degenerate/singular fully nonlinear operator. Our findings are new even for the model equations, involving a degenerate/singular Laplacian operator.</description>

Abstract: We prove well posedness and stability in $\mathbf{L}^1$ for a class of mixed hyperbolic-parabolic non linear and non local equations in a bounded domain with no flow along the boundary. While the treatment of boundary conditions for the hyperbolic equation is standard, the extension to $\mathbf{L}^1$ of classical results about parabolic equations with Neumann conditions is here achieved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove non-uniqueness of weak solutions to the forced $\alpha$-SQG equation with Sobolev regularity $W^{s,p}$ in the supercritical regime $s &lt; \alpha + \frac{2}{p}$, covering the 2D Euler equation ($\alpha = 0$), the Surface Quasi-Geostrophic equation ($\alpha = 1$), and the intermediate cases. A key step is the construction of smooth, compactly supported vortices that exhibit non-linear instability. As a by-product, we show existence of global smooth solutions to the (unforced) $\alpha$-SQG equation that are neither rotating nor traveling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a free energy functional defined on probability densities on the unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^d$, and investigate its global minimizers. The energy consists of two components: an entropy and a nonlocal interaction energy, which favour spreading and aggregation behaviour, respectively. We find a threshold value for the size of the attractive interactions, and establish the global energy minimizers in each case. The bifurcation at this threshold value is investigated. We also generalize the results to spaces consisting of an arbitrary number of spheres (e.g., the flat torus $\mathbb{S}^1 \times \mathbb{S}^1$).</description>

      <title>Energy release and Griffith's criterion for phase-field fracture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase field evolutions are obtained by means of time discrete schemes, providing (or selecting) at each time step an equilibrium configuration of the system, which is usually computed by descent methods for the free energy (e.g.staggered and monolithic schemes) under a suitable irreversibility constraint on the phase-field parameter. We study in detail the time continuous limits of these evolutions considering monotonicity as irreversibility constraint and providing a general result, which holds independently of the scheme employed in the incremental problem. In particular, we show that in the steady state regime the limit evolution is simultaneous (in displacement and phase field parameter) and satisfies Griffith's criterion in terms of toughness and phase field energy release rate. In the unsteady regime the limit evolution may instead depend on the adopted scheme and Griffith's criterion may not hold. We prove also the thermodynamical consistency of the monotonicity constraint over the whole evolution, and we study the system of PDEs (actually, a weak variational inequality) in the steady state regime. Technically, the proof employs a suitable reparametrization of the time discrete points, whose Kuratowski limit characterizes the set of steady state propagation. The study of the quasi-static time continuous limit relies on the strong convergence of the phase field function together with the convergence of the power identity.</description>

Abstract: We show that a complete contractible 3-manifold with positive scalar curvature and bounded geometry must be $\mathbb R^3$. We also show that an open handlebody of genus larger than 1 does not admit complete metrics with positive scalar curvature and bounded geometry.

      <title>An atomic decomposition of one-dimensional metric currents without boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proves an atomic decomposition of the space of $1$-dimensional metric currents without boundary, in which the atoms are specified by closed Lipschitz curves with uniform control on their Morrey norms. Our argument relies on a geometric construction which states that for any $\epsilon&gt;0$ one can express a piecewise-geodesic closed curve as the sum of piecewise-geodesic closed curves whose total length is at most $(1+\epsilon)$ times the original length and whose Morrey norms are each bounded by a universal constant times $\epsilon^{-2}$. In Euclidean space, our results refine the state of the art, providing an approximation of divergence free measures by limits of sums of closed polygonal paths whose total length can be made arbitrarily close to the norm of the approximated measure.</description>

      <title>Construction of $p$-energy measures associated with strongly local $p$-energy forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct canonical p-energy measures associated with $p$-energy forms without any self-similarity, where $p$-energy forms are $L^p$ variations of Dirichlet forms, which have recently been studied mainly on fractals. Furthermore, we prove that the measures satisfy suitable chain rules and that the uniqueness of such a "good" energy measures. As an application, we also prove the p-energy version of Mosco's domination principle.</description>

      <title>An intrinsically hydrodynamic approach to multidimensional QHD systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.05448</link>
      <description>arXiv:1912.05448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the multi-dimensional Quantum Hydrodynamics (QHD) system, by adopting an intrinsically hydrodynamic approach. The present work continues the analysis initiated in [6] where the one dimensional case was studied. Here we extend the analysis to the multi-dimensional problem, in particular by considering two physically relevant classes of solutions. First of all we consider two-dimensional initial data endowed with point vortices; by assuming the continuity of the mass density and a quantization rule for the vorticity we are able to study the Cauchy problem and provide global finite energy weak solutions. The same result can be obtained also by considering spherically symmetric initial data in the multi-dimensional setting. For rough solutions with finite energy, we are able to provide suitable dispersive estimates, which also apply to a more general class of Euler-Korteweg equations. Moreover we are also able to show the sequential stability of weak solutions with positive density. Analogously to the one dimensional case this is achieved through the a priori bounds given by a new functional first introduced in [6].</description>

      <title>Relativistic perfect fluids near Kasner singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.03435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.03435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the existence of a stable family of solutions to the Euler equations on Kasner backgrounds near the singularity with the full expected asymptotic data degrees of freedom and no symmetry or isotropy restrictions. Existence is achieved through transforming the Euler equations into the form of a symmetric hyperbolic Fuchsian system followed by an application of a new existence theory for the singular initial value problem. Stability is shown to follow from the existence theory for the (regular) global initial value problem for Fuchsian systems that was developed in arXiv:1907.04071. In fact, for each solution in the family, we prove the existence of an open set of nearby solutions with the same qualitative asymptotics and show that any such perturbed solution agrees again with another solution of the singular initial value problem. All our results hold in the regime where the speed of sound of the fluid is large in comparison to all Kasner exponents. This is interpreted as the regime of stable fluid asymptotics near Kasner big bang singularities.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen-like Schr\"odinger Operators at Low Energies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.08355v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a Schr\"odinger operator on an asymptotically Euclidean manifold $X$ of dimension at least two, and suppose that the potential is of attractive Coulomb-like type. Using Vasy's second 2nd-microlocal approach, "the Lagrangian approach," we analyze -- uniformly, all the way down to $E=0$ -- the output of the limiting resolvent $R(E\pm i 0) = \lim_{\epsilon \to 0^+} R(E\pm i \epsilon)$. The Coulomb potential causes the output of the low-energy resolvent to possess oscillatory asymptotics which differ substantially from the sorts of asymptotics observed in the short-range case by Guillarmou, Hassell, Sikora, and (more recently) Hintz and Vasy. Specifically, the compound asymptotics at low energy and large spatial scales are more delicate, and the resolvent output is smooth all the way down to $E=0$. In fact, we will construct a compactification of $(0,1]_E\times X$ on which the resolvent output is given by a specified (and relatively complicated) function that oscillates as $r\to\infty$ times something polyhomogeneous. As a corollary, we get complete and compatible asymptotic expansions for solutions to the scattering problem as functions of both position and energy, with a transitional regime.</description>

      <title>Riesz transforms and Sobolev spaces associated to the partial harmonic oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.10461v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, our goal is to establish the Sobolev space associated to the partial harmonic oscillator. Based on its heat kernel estimate, we firstly give the definition of the fractional powers of the partial harmonic oscillator $$\AH=-\partial_{\rho}^2-\Delta_x+|x|^2,$$ and show that its negative powers are well defined on $L^p(\mathbb R^{d+1})$ for $p\in [1,\infty]$. We then define associated Riesz transforms and show that they are bounded on classical Sobolev spaces by the calculus of symbols.
  Secondly, by a factorization of the operator $\AH$, we define two families of Sobolev spaces with positive integer indices, and show the equivalence between them by the boundedness of Riesz transforms. Moreover, the adapted symbolic calculus also implies the boundedness of Riesz type transforms on the Sobolev spaces associated to the partial harmonic oscillator $\AH$.
  Lastly, as applications of our results, we obtain the revised Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality, the Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev inequality, and Hardy's inequality in the potential space $L_{\AH}^{\alpha, p}$.</description>

      <title>Stationary solutions for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.10393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct stationary statistical solutions of a deterministic unforced nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, by perturbing it by a linear damping $\gamma u$ and a stochastic force whose intensity is proportional to $\sqrt \gamma$, and then letting $\gamma\to 0^+$. We prove indeed that the family of stationary solutions $\{U_\gamma\}_{\gamma&gt;0}$ of the perturbed equation possesses an accumulation point for any vanishing sequence $\gamma_j\to 0^+$ and this stationary limit solves the deterministic unforced nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation and is not the trivial zero solution. This technique has been introduced in [KS04], using a different dissipation. However considering a linear damping of zero order and weaker solutions we can deal with larger ranges of the nonlinearity and of the spatial dimension; moreover we consider the focusing equation and the defocusing equation as well.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies an inverse problem for a multipopulation mean field game (MFG) system where the objective is to reconstruct the running and terminal cost functions of the system that couples the dynamics of different populations. We derive uniqueness results for the inverse problem with different types of available data. In particular, we show that it is possible to uniquely reconstruct some simplified forms of the cost functions from data measured only on a single population component under mild additional assumptions on the coupling mechanism. The proofs are based on the standard multilinearization technique that allows us to reduce the inverse problems into simplified forms.</description>

Abstract: We present a stability result for ground states of a Schrodinger-Poisson system in $(2+1)$ dimension, modelling the propagation of a light beam through a liquid crystal with nonlocal nonlinear response. A new estimate for perturbations of the medium configuration allows to explicitly prove strict positivity of the second derivative of the action on a ground state. In addition we prove existence of a ground state with frequency $\sigma$ for any $\sigma \in (0,1)$ as a minimal point over an appropriate Nehari manifold</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17043v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the nonlinear periodic Westervelt equation with excitations located within a bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^d$, where $d \in \{2,3\}$, subject to Robin boundary conditions. This problem is of particular interest for advancing imaging techniques %in invasive ultrasound, such as intravascular ultrasound imaging. that exploit nonlinearity of the acoustic propagation. We establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions in both the linear and the nonlinear setting, thereby allowing for spatially varying coefficients as relevant in quantitative imaging. %, highlighting the crucial role of small excitations in ensuring existence and uniqueness in the nonlinear setting. Derivation of a multiharmonic formulation enables us to show the generation of higher harmonics (that is, responses at multiples of the fundamental frequency) due nonlinear wave propagation. An iterative scheme for solving the resulting system is proposed that relies on successive resolution of these higher harmonics, and its convergence under smallness conditions on the excitation is proven. Furthermore, we investigate the numerical solution of the resulting system of Helmholtz equations, employing a conforming finite element method for its discretization. Through an implementation of the proposed methodology, we illustrate how acoustic waves propagate in nonlinear media. This study aims to enhance our understanding of ultrasound propagation dynamics, which is essential for obtaining high-quality images from limited in vivo and boundary measurements.</description>

      <title>The Least Action Admissibility Principle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07191v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides a new admissibility criterion for choosing physically relevant weak solutions of the equations of Lagrangian and continuum mechanics when non-uniqueness of solutions to the initial value problem occurs. The criterion is motivated by the classical least action principle but is now applied to initial value problems which exhibit non-unique solutions. Examples are provided to Lagrangian mechanics and the Euler equations of barotropic fluid mechanics. In particular, we show the least action admissibility principle prefers the classical two shock solution to the Riemann initial value problem to certain solutions generated by convex integration. On the other hand, Dafermos's entropy criterion prefers convex integration solutions to the two shock solutions. Furthermore, when the pressure is given by $p(\rho)=\rho^2$, we show that the two shock solution is always preferred whenever the convex integration solutions are defined for the same initial data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coupling between evolutionary and ecological changes (eco-evolutionary dynamics) has been shown to be relevant among diverse species, and is also of interest outside of ecology, i.e. in cancer evolution. These dynamics play an important role in determining survival in response to climate change, motivating the need for mathematical models to capture this often complex interplay. Models incorporating eco-evolutionary dynamics often sacrifice analytical tractability to capture the complexity of real systems, do not explicitly consider the effect of population heterogeneity, or focus on long-term behaviour. In order to capture population heterogeneity, both transient, and long-term dynamics, while retaining tractability, we generalise a moment-based method applicable in the regime of small segregational variance to the case of time-dependent mortality and birth. These results are applied to a predator-prey model, where ecological parameters such as the contact rate between species are trait-structured. The trait-distribution of the prey species is shown to be approximately Gaussian with constant variance centered on the mean trait, which is asymptotically governed by an autonomous ODE. In this way, we make explicit the impact of eco-evolutionary dynamics on the transient behaviour and long-term fate of the prey species.</description>

Abstract: We study optimal control problems governed by abstract infinite dimensional stochastic differential equations using the dynamic programming approach. In the first part, we prove Lipschitz continuity, semiconcavity and semiconvexity of the value function under several sets of assumptions, and thus derive its $C^{1,1}$ regularity in the space variable. Based on this regularity result, we construct optimal feedback controls using the notion of the $B$-continuous viscosity solutions for the associated Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equation. This is done in the case when the noise coefficient is independent of the control variable. We also discuss applications of our results to optimal control problems governed by stochastic reaction-diffusion equations and, under economic motivations, stochastic delay differential equations.</description>

Abstract: The CR Paneitz operator is closely related to some important problems in CR geometry. In this paper, we consider this operator on a non-embeddable CR manifold. This operator is essentially self-adjoint and its spectrum is discrete except zero. Moreover, the eigenspace corresponding to each non-zero eigenvalue is a finite dimensional subspace of the space of smooth functions. Furthermore, we show that the CR Paneitz operator on the Rossi sphere, an example of non-embeddable CR manifolds, has infinitely many negative eigenvalues, which is significantly different from the embeddable case.</description>

      <title>A note on spontaneous symmetry breaking in the mean-field Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the homogeneous mean-field Bose gas at positive temperature. We show that spontaneous $U(1)$ symmetry breaking occurs if and only if the system displays Bose-Einstein condensation in the sense that the one-particle density matrix of the Gibbs state has a macroscopic eigenvalue.</description>
