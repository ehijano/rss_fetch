      <title>On complete generators of certain Lie algebras on Danielewski surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Lie algebra of polynomial vector fields on a smooth Danielewski surface of the form $x y = p(z)$. We provide explicitly given generators to show that: 1. The Lie algebra of polynomial vector fields is generated by $6$ complete vector fields. 2. The Lie algebra of volume-preserving polynomial vector fields is generated by finitely many vector fields, whose number depends on the degree of the Danielewski surface. 3. There exists a Lie sub-algebra generated by $4$ LNDs whose flows generate a group that acts infinitely transitively on the Danielewski surface.</description>

      <title>On the classification of Inoue surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that any Inoue surface admits a unique holomorphic connection. Using this result we show that two Inoue surfaces $S=H\times\mathbb{C}/G$, $S'=H\times\mathbb{C}/G'$ are biholomorphic if and only if $G$, $G'$ are conjugate in the group of affine transformations of $H\times\mathbb{C}$. This result allows us to prove explicit classification theorems for Inoue surfaces: Let $\mathcal{M}$ be the set of ${\rm SL}(3,\mathbb{Z})$-matrices $M$ with a real eigenvalue $\alpha&gt;1$ and two non-real eigenvalues, and $\mathcal{N}^\pm $ the set of ${\rm GL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$-matrices $N$ with a real eigenvalue $\alpha&gt;1$ and $\det(N)=\pm 1$.
  We prove that:
  For any ${\rm GL}(3,\mathbb{Z})$-similarity class $\mathfrak{M}\in \mathcal{M}/\sim$, there exists exactly two biholomorphism classes of type I Inoue surfaces.
  For any ${\rm GL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ similarity class $\mathfrak{N}=[N]\in \mathcal{N}^+/\sim$ and positive integer $r\in\mathbb{N}^*$, we have a finite set of deformation classes of type II Inoue surfaces. This set is parameterised by the quotient of $\mathbb{Z}^2/(I_2-N)\mathbb{Z}^2+r\mathbb{Z}^2$ by an action of the ``positive centraliser" $Z^+_{{\rm GL}(2,\mathbb{Z})}(N)$ of $N$ in ${\rm GL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$. The set of biholomorphism types corresponding to a deformation class, endowed with its natural topology, can be identified with either $\mathbb{C}^*$ or $\mathbb{C}$.
  For any ${\rm GL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$-similarity class $\mathfrak{N}=[N]\in \mathcal{N}^-/\sim$ and positive integer $r\in\mathbb{N}^*$, we have a finite set of biholomorphism classes of type III Inoue surfaces. This set is parameterised by the quotient of $\mathbb{Z}^2/(I_2+N)\mathbb{Z}^2+r\mathbb{Z}^2$ by an action of $Z^+_{{\rm GL}(2,\mathbb{Z})}(N)$. 
  In both cases the group $Z^+_{{\rm GL}(2,\mathbb{Z})}(N)$ is infinite cyclic (see section 5).</description>

      <title>Visibility property in one and several variables and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we report our investigations on visibility with respect to the Kobayashi distance and its applications, with a special focus on planar domains. We prove that totally disconnected subsets of the boundary are removable in the context of visibility. We also show that a domain in $\mathbb{C}^n$ is a local weak visibility domain if and only if it is a weak visibility domain. The above holds also for visibility. Along the way, we prove an intrinsic localization result for the Kobayashi distance. Moreover, we observe some interesting consequences of weak visibility; for example, weak visibility implies compactness of the end topology of the closure of the domain. For planar domains: (i) We provide examples of visibility domains that are not locally Goldilocks at any boundary point. (ii) We provide certain general conditions on planar domains that yield the continuous extension of conformal maps, generalizing the Carath\'{e}odory extension theorem. Our conditions are quite general and assume very little regularity of the boundary. We demonstrate this through examples. (iii) We also provide conditions for the homeomorphic extension of biholomorphic maps up to the boundary. (iv) We prove that a hyperbolic, simply connected domain possesses the visibility property if and only if its boundary is locally connected. This leads us to reformulate the MLC conjecture in terms of visibility. (v) We provide a characterization of visibility for a large class of planar domains including certain uncountably connected domains.</description>

      <title>On a Bers theorem for $\textrm{SL}(3,\mathbb{C})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For $S$ a closed surface of genus at least $2$, let $\mathrm{Hit}_3(S)$ be the Hitchin component of representations to $\mathrm{SL}(3,\mathbb{R}),$ equipped with the Labourie-Loftin complex structure. We construct a mapping class group equivariant holomorphic map from a large open subset of $\mathrm{Hit}_3(S)\times \overline{\mathrm{Hit}_3(S)}$ to the $\mathrm{SL}(3,\mathbb{C})$-character variety that restricts to the identity on the diagonal and to Bers' simultaneous uniformization on $\mathcal{T}(S)\times \overline{\mathcal{T}(S)}$. The open subset contains $\mathrm{Hit}_3(S)\times \overline{\mathcal{T}(S)}$ and $\mathcal{T}(S)\times \overline{\mathrm{Hit}_3(S)}$, and the image includes the holonomies of $\mathrm{SL}(3,\mathbb{C})$-opers.
  The map is realized by associating pairs of Hitchin representations to immersions into $\mathbb{C}^3$ that we call complex affine spheres, which are equivalent to certain conformal harmonic maps into $\mathrm{SL}(3,\mathbb{C})/\mathrm{SO}(3,\mathbb{C})$ and to new objects called bi-Higgs bundles. Complex affine spheres are obtained by solving a second-order complex elliptic PDE that resembles both the Beltrami and Tzitz\'eica equations. To study this equation we establish analytic results that should be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic bundles framed along a real hypersurface and the Riemann-Hilbert problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a connected, compact complex manifold and $S\subset X$ a separating real hypersurface, so that $X$ decomposes as a union of compact complex manifolds with boundary $\bar X^\pm$. Let $\mathcal{M}$ be the moduli space of $S$-framed holomorphic bundles, i.e. of pairs $(E,\theta)$ of fixed topological type consisting of a holomorphic bundle $E$ on $X$ and a trivialization $\theta$ - belonging to a fixed H\"older regularity class $\mathcal{C}^{\kappa+1}$ - of its restriction to $S$.
  The restrictions to $\bar X^\pm$ of an $S$-framed holomorphic bundle $(E,\theta)$ are boundary framed formally holomorphic bundles $(E^\pm,\theta^\pm)$ which induce, via $\theta^\pm$, the same tangential Cauchy-Riemann operators on the trivial bundle on $S$, so one obtains a natural map from $\mathcal{M}$ into the fiber product $\mathcal{M}^-\times_\mathcal{C}\mathcal{M}^+$ over the space $\mathcal{C}$ of Cauchy-Riemann operators on the trivial bundle on $S$. Our main result states: this map is a homeomorphism for $\kappa\in (0,\infty]\setminus\mathbb{N}$.
  The proof is based on a gluing principle for formally holomorphic bundles along a real hypersurface. This principle can also be used to give a complex geometric interpretation of the space of solutions of a large class of Riemann-Hilbert type problems. The results generalize in two directions: first one can replace the decomposition associated with a separating hypersurface by the the manifold with boundary $\widehat X_S$ obtained by cutting $X$ along any oriented hypersurface $S$. Second one can consider principal $G$ bundles for an arbitrary complex Lie group $G$. We give explicit examples of moduli spaces of (boundary) framed holomorphic bundles and explicit formulae for the homeomorphisms provided by the general results.</description>

      <title>On semiample vector bundles and parallelizable compact complex manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a characterization of parallelizable compact complex manifolds and their quotients using holomorphic symmetric differentials. In particular we show that compact complex manifolds of Kodaira dimension 0 having strongly semiample cotangent bundle are parallelizable manifolds, while compact complex manifolds of Kodaira dimension 0 having weakly semiample cotangent bundle are quotients of parallelizable manifolds. The main constructions used involve considerations about semiampleness of vector bundles, which are themselves of interest. As a byproduct we prove that compact manifolds having Kodaira dimension 0 and weakly sermiample cotangent bundle have infinite fundamental group, and we conjecture that this should be the case for all compact complex manifolds not of general type with weakly semiample cotangent bundle.</description>
