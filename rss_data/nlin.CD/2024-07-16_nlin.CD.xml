      <title>Taming Cluster Synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchronization is a widespread phenomenon observed across natural and artificial networked systems. It often manifests itself by clusters of units exhibiting coincident dynamics. These clusters are a direct consequence of the organization of the Laplacian matrix eigenvalues into spectral localized blocks. We show how the concept of spectral blocks can be leveraged to design straightforward yet powerful controllers able to fully manipulate cluster synchronization of a generic network, thus shaping at will its parallel functioning. Specifically, we demonstrate how to induce the formation of spectral blocks in networks where such structures would not exist, and how to achieve precise mastering over the synchronizability of individual clusters by dictating the sequence in which each of them enters or exits the synchronization stability region as the coupling strength varies. Our results underscore the pivotal role of cluster synchronization control in shaping the parallel operation of networked systems, thereby enhancing their efficiency and adaptability across diverse applications.</description>

      <title>Designing Chaotic Attractors: A Semi-supervised Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chaotic dynamics are ubiquitous in nature and useful in engineering, but their geometric design can be challenging. Here, we propose a method using reservoir computing to generate chaos with a desired shape by providing a periodic orbit as a template, called a skeleton. We exploit a bifurcation of the reservoir to intentionally induce unsuccessful training of the skeleton, revealing inherent chaos. The emergence of this untrained attractor, resulting from the interaction between the skeleton and the reservoir's intrinsic dynamics, offers a novel semi-supervised framework for designing chaos.</description>

      <title>Wave Turbulence and thermalization in one-dimensional chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One-dimensional chains are used as a fundamental model of condensed matter, and have constituted the starting point for key developments in nonlinear physics and complex systems. The pioneering work in this field was proposed by Fermi, Pasta, Ulam and Tsingou in the 50s in Los Alamos. An intense and fruitful mathematical and physical research followed during these last 70 years. Recently, a fresh look at the mechanisms of thermalization in such systems has been provided through the lens of the Wave Turbulence approach. In this review, we give a critical summary of the results obtained in this framework. We also present a series of open problems and challenges that future work needs to address.</description>

      <title>Impenetrable Barriers in the Phase Space of a Particle Moving Around a Kerr Rotating Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the phase space of a particle moving in the gravitational field of a rotating black hole described by the Kerr metric from a geometrical perspective. In particular, we show the construction of a multidimensional generalization of the unstable periodic orbits, known as Normally Hyperbolic Invariant Manifold, and its stable and unstable invariant manifolds that direct the dynamics in the phase space. Those stable and unstable invariant manifolds divide the phase space and are robust under perturbations. To visualize the multidimensional invariant sets under the flow in the phase space, we use a method based on the arclength of the trajectories in phase space known as Lagrangian descriptors in the literature.</description>
