      <title>A feasibility study for a Doppler Reflectometer System in the JT-60SA tokamak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we present a study on the viability and practicality of installing a Doppler reflectometer (DR) system in the JT-60SA advanced tokamak. First, we discuss its scientific scope in the context of the JT-60SA research plan. We identify a number of fields in which a DR would be very relevant for the accomplishment of said plan and outline a scientific program for the diagnostic. Then, starting from a number of design hypothesis, we use a ray tracing code to carry out a feasibility study for a number of relevant scenarios and identify a geometric solution for the installation of a DR such that both core and edge can be probed in the prescribed wave number range, thus achieving the proposed scientific objectives. Finally, we perform a preliminary discussion on the different possibilities for a conceptual design (including a minimum viable system and a baseline system) and their requirements in terms of components and space. We conclude that a viable conceptual design could be carried out using a small fraction of a horizontal port, leaving room for additional diagnostic systems.</description>

      <title>Effects of parallel magnetic fields on sheaths near biased electrodes in a highly collisional Z-pinch plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sheath formation near biased electrodes in magnetic fields parallel to the wall is an understudied topic, especially within the context of Z-pinch fusion experiments. We perform 1X-2V Boltzmann-Poisson simulations of an axial cut at the pinch radius of a Z-pinch plasma between two biased electrodes with a magnetic field parallel to the wall. The collision frequencies are artificially increased to enhance thermalization of the plasma in the smaller simulation domain versus the actual experiment size; this increases the perpendicular mobility and partially de-magnetizes the ions resulting in non-monotonic sheath profiles with the potential increasing away from the wall to a peak before decaying. A classical sheath forms within an electron gyroradius from the wall not due to the natural thermal motion of the electrons, but due to the magnetized electrons gyrating into the wall; therefore, the sheath structure does not significantly change with bias potential or between electrodes. With increasing bias potential, a current is induced perpendicular to the wall due to changes in ion flow, differing from unmagnetized cases where current is induced by changes in electron flow. The magnetic field acts as a high resistivity with the perpendicular current density being three orders of magnitude lower than unmagnetized theoretical predictions. There is, however, significant flow parallel to the wall from the force balance between the pressure tensor and Lorentz force. These parallel flows induce a parallel current density three orders of magnitude larger than the perpendicular current density.</description>

      <title>Updated electrical design of the Diagnostic Neutral Beam Injector in RFX-mod2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Diagnostic Neutral Beam Injector of the RFX-mod2 experiment (Consorzio RFX, Padova) is expected to provide novel and significant information about the Reversed Field Pinch confinement of fusion plasmas. The injection of the hydrogen beam in the plasma will allow Charge Exchange Recombination Spectroscopy (CXRS) and Motional Stark Effect diagnostics (MSE) to measure several quantities: ion speed, ion temperature, impurity content, intensity and pitch of the magnetic field. The DNBI is of particular importance for allowing the determination of these quantities at the core of the plasma. The present DNBI, built by the Budker Institute of Plasma Physics, features an arc discharge H+ source, coupled to a 4-grid 50 keV acceleration system. The 50 ms, 5 A ion beam is neutralized by charge exchange by means of a gas target; residual ions are then deflected by a magnetic field before injection in the torus chamber. The beam can be modulated at maximum 250 Hz. The DNBI will undergo extraordinary maintenance and a structural upgrade to improve its reliability and safety. This contribution presents the latest upgrades of the electrical plants and of the control system of the DNBI.</description>

      <title>From Weibel seeds to collisionless dynamos beyond pair-plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bridging the spatiotemporal scales of magnetic seed field generation and subsequent dynamo amplification in the weakly collisional intracluster medium presents an extreme numerical challenge. We perform collisionless turbulence simulations with initially unmagnetized electrons that capture both magnetic seed generation via the electron Weibel instability and the ensuing dynamo amplification. Going beyond existing pair-plasma studies, we use an ion-to-electron mass ratio of 100 for which we find electron and ion dynamics are sufficiently decoupled. These simulations are enabled by the 10-moment collisionless fluid solver of Gkeyll, which evolves the full pressure tensor for all species. The electron heat-flux closure regulates pressure isotropization and effectively sets the magnetic Reynolds number. We investigate how the strength of of the closure influences the transition between a regime reminiscent of previous kinetic pair-plasma simulations and a more MHD-like dynamo regime.</description>

      <title>Canonical Vorticity Perspective on Magnetogenesis: Unifying Weibel, Biermann, and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We briefly review the current status of magnetogenesis, a cross-disciplinary field that bridges cosmology and plasma physics, studying the origin of magnetic fields in the universe. We formulate a canonical vorticity framework to investigate kinetic plasma physics-based magnetogenesis processes in a collisionless plasma. By considering canonical vorticity, a weighted sum of the fluid vorticity and the magnetic field as the canonical variable, this framework unifies several magnetogenesis processes, including the Biermann battery, the Weibel instability, and predicts several new pressure tensorial configurations as the fundamental source of self-generated magnetic field and vorticity in plasma. The framework is further extended to relativistic regime where an additional source of canonical vorticity, termed as kineclinicity effect, is identified. The theoretical predictions are systematically validated using particle-in-cell simulations, highlighting their implications for laboratory and astrophysical plasma environments.</description>

      <title>Near-Unity-Efficiency Gas Gratings for Ultraviolet, Visible, and Infrared High-Power Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interfering deep ultraviolet (DUV) lasers can induce substantial density modulations in an ozone-doped gas flow via photochemical reactions, creating volume diffraction gratings. These transient optics are immune to target debris and shrapnel and feature orders-of-magnitude higher damage thresholds than conventional solid optics, providing a promising method for efficiently manipulating high-energy lasers. In this work, we describe gas gratings that can efficiently diffract probe beams across a variety of wavelengths and pulse durations, ranging from deep ultraviolet to near-infrared and from nanosecond to femtosecond, achieving a full beam diffraction efficiency up to 99% while preserving the focusability and wavefront quality. In addition, we present a comprehensive characterization of the performance of the gas gratings under various experimental conditions, including imprint fluence, gas composition, and grating geometries, showing significant enhancement of this process with the addition of carbon dioxide. We also demonstrate stable performance over hours of operation. Our results validate a previously developed theoretical model and suggest optimal parameters to efficiently scale gas gratings to high-energy applications.</description>

      <title>Design, Fabrication and Testing of a D-Shaped High Temperature Superconducting Magnet</title>

Abstract: High-temperature technical superconductors are potential candidates for compact and high-field tokamak magnets. The demand for higher fusion power can be met with an on-axis high magnetic field due to toroidal magnets. An R&amp;D activity has been initiated at the Institute for Plasma Research, India, to develop a compact D-shaped superconducting magnet utilizing REBCO high-temperature superconducting tapes. Under this initiative, a toroidal configuration with a major radius of 0.42 m, consisting of eight D-shaped, four poloidal field, and a central solenoid high-temperature superconducting magnets producing an on-axis toroidal magnetic field of 0.23 T has been conceptualized. The fabrication feasibility of a D-shaped coil for this toroidal configuration also envisaged using stacked high-temperature superconducting cable. In this paper, we report the design of a compact D-shaped coil, the fabrication of a long length HTS cable, a winding pack, and its integration with a cryogenic casing and vacuum enclosure. The winding pack terminations, joints, its interfacing with the power supply, and performance testing are also reported in this paper.</description>

      <title>Collisional whistler instability and electron temperature staircase in inhomogeneous plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-beta magnetized plasmas often exhibit anomalously structured temperature profiles, as seen from galaxy cluster observations and recent experiments. It is well known that when such plasmas are collisionless, temperature gradients along the magnetic field can excite whistler waves that efficiently scatter electrons to limit their heat transport. Only recently has it been shown that parallel temperature gradients can excite whistler waves also in collisional plasmas. Here we develop a Wigner--Moyal theory for the collisional whistler instability starting from Braginskii-like fluid equations in a slab geometry. This formalism is necessary because, for a large region in parameter space, the fastest-growing whistler waves have wavelengths comparable to the background temperature gradients. We find additional damping terms in the expression for the instability growth rate involving inhomogeneous Nernst advection and resistivity. They (i) enable whistler waves to re-arrange the electron temperature profile via growth, propagation, and subsequent dissipation, and (ii) allow non-constant temperature profiles to exist stably. For high-beta plasmas, the marginally stable solutions take the form of a temperature staircase along the magnetic field lines. The electron heat flux can also be suppressed by the Ettingshausen effect when the whistler intensity profile is sufficiently peaked and oriented opposite the background temperature gradient. This mechanism allows cold fronts without magnetic draping, might reduce parallel heat losses in inertial fusion experiments, and generally demonstrates that whistler waves can regulate transport even in the collisional limit.</description>

      <title>Fast physics-based launcher optimization for electron cyclotron current drive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the increased urgency to design fusion pilot plants, fast optimization of electron cyclotron current drive (ECCD) launchers is paramount. Traditionally, this is done by coarsely sampling the 4-D parameter space of possible launch conditions consisting of (1) the launch location (constrained to lie along the reactor vessel), (2) the launch frequency, (3) the toroidal launch angle, and (4) the poloidal launch angle. For each initial condition, a ray-tracing simulation is performed to evaluate the ECCD efficiency. Unfortunately, this approach often requires a large number of simulations (sometimes millions in extreme cases) to build up a dataset that adequately covers the plasma volume, which must then be repeated every time the design point changes. Here we adopt a different approach. Rather than launching rays from the plasma periphery and hoping for the best, we instead directly reconstruct the optimal ray for driving current at a given flux surface using a reduced physics model coupled with a commercial ray-tracing code. Repeating this throughout the plasma volume requires only hundreds of simulations, constituting a significant speedup. The new method is validated on two separate example tokamak profiles, and is shown to reliably drive localized current at the specified flux surface with the same optimal efficiency as obtained from the traditional approach.</description>

      <title>Correlation function metrology for warm dense matter: Recent developments and practical guidelines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: X-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) has emerged as a valuable diagnostic for matter under extreme conditions, as it captures the intricate many-body physics of the probed sample. Recent advances, such as the model-free temperature diagnostic of Dornheim et al. [Nat.Commun. 13, 7911 (2022)], have demonstrated how much information can be extracted directly within the imaginary-time formalism. However, since the imaginary-time formalism is a concept often difficult to grasp, we provide here a systematic overview of its theoretical foundations and explicitly demonstrate its practical applications to temperature inference, including relevant subtleties. Furthermore, we present recent developments that enable the determination of the absolute normalization, Rayleigh weight, and density from XRTS measurements without reliance on uncontrolled model assumptions. Finally, we outline a unified workflow that guides the extraction of these key observables, offering a practical framework for applying the method to interpret experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>Laser-induced plasma formation and cavitation in water: from nanoeffects to extreme states of matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an in-depth analysis of the energy dependence of optical breakdown in water by tightly focused laser pulses, from plasma formation to shock waves and cavitation. Laser pulses of fs to ns durations and UV to IR wavelengths are aberration-free focused through microscope objectives. Photography captures luminescent plasmas with submicrometer resolution, and bubble threshold and size are determined via probe beam scattering. The energy dependence of mechanical effects is quantified through the maximum bubble radius Rmax. We find three key scenarios depicting the interaction between multiphoton and avalanche ionization, recombination, and thermal ionization from nanoeffects near threshold to extreme energy densities. They include a previously unknown scenario that emerges with single-longitudinal-mode UV ns pulses from compact lasers. It enables cost-effective creation of nanoeffects, as demonstrated on corneal tissue and glass. High-resolution photography reveals new insights in the spatiotemporal dynamics of plasma formation, with an interplay of breakdown waves, string formation by local instabilities of avalanche ionization, and radiative energy transport. Plasma volume data from photographs together with absorption measurements show that the average energy density of luminescent fs and ns plasmas is similar, ranging between 10 and 40 kJ/cm^3 . However, small hot regions with up to 400 kJ/cm^3 are formed in ns breakdown. From the hot regions, energy is spread out via X-ray bremsstrahlung, forming a luminescent halo. Well above threshold, Rmax scales with E^(1/3) across all scenarios, with 15% - 20% conversion of laser energy into bubble energy. With increasing plasma energy density, an ever-larger energy fraction is converted into shock wave energy (75% at 40 kJ/cm^3 ). The results provide guidelines for parameter selection in laser surgery and material processing.</description>
