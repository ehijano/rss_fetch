      <title>Causal evidence for the primordiality of colours in trans-Neptunian objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origins of the colours of Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) represent a crucial unresolved question, central to understanding the history of our Solar System. Recent observational surveys revealed correlations between the eccentricity and inclination of TNOs, and their colours. This rekindled the long-standing debate on whether these colours reflect the conditions of TNO formation or their subsequent evolution. We address this question using a model-agnostic, data-driven approach that unanimously converges to a common causal graph from the analysis of two different datasets, each from two different conditional independence test methods. For evaluation, we demonstrate how our model is consistent with the currently-accepted paradigms of TNOs' dynamical histories, without involving any orbital modelling or physics-based assumptions. Our causal model (with no knowledge of the existence of Neptune) predicts the need for an unknown confounding variable, consistent with Neptune's effects. The model predicts that the colour of TNOs is the root cause of their inclination distribution, rather than the other way around. This strongly suggests that the colours of TNOs reflect an underlying dynamical property, most likely their formation location. Our model excludes formation scenarios that invoke substantial colour modification by subsequent evolution. We conclude that the colours of TNOs are predominantly primordial.</description>

      <title>Strong NUV Refractory Absorption and Dissociated Water in the Hubble Transmission Spectrum of the Ultra Hot Jupiter KELT-20 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra hot Jupiters (UHJs) present a promising pathway for drawing a link between a planet's composition and formation history. They retain both refractory and volatiles species in gas phase in their atmospheres, which allows us to place unique constraints on their building blocks. Here, we present the 0.2 - 1.7 $\mu$m transmission spectrum of KELT-20 b/MASCARA-2 b taken with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Unlike other UHJs around early-type stars, KELT-20 b's orbit is well aligned with its host star's spin axis and we test whether its distinct dynamical configuration is reflected in its composition. We observe a tremendous rise (&gt;10 scale heights) in the planet's transit depth at the near-UV wavelengths, akin to that observed for WASP-178 b and WASP-121 b, and a muted water absorption feature in the near-IR. Our retrievals indicate that the large NUV depth is driven by Fe II and/or SiO and that the water is mostly thermally dissociated. Assuming equilibrium chemistry, we obtain constraints on Z/H and O/H that indicate accretion of volatile-rich solids and/or gas. Both our low resolution spectrum and the refractory elemental ratios from Gandhi et al. 2023 suggest that nightside condensation and rainout are limited to only the most refractory species in the planet's atmosphere. Within the precision limits of the HST spectra, no strong evidence for limb asymmetry is detected. We contextualize this lack of asymmetry by comparing to predictions from general circulation models with and without the effects of kinematic magnetohydrodynamics. Lastly, we find no major differences in the HST transmission spectra of KELT-20 b, WASP-178, and WASP-121 b despite their different dynamical configurations.</description>

      <title>A constraint on the density of Jupiter's moon Thebe from primordial dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Of the 97 known satellites in the Jovian system, the individual masses and densities of each moon have only been determined for six of them: the four Galileans, Amalthea, and Himalia. In this letter, we derive a prediction for the mean density (and mass) of Thebe, Jupiter's sixth largest regular moon, obtaining a lower limit of $\rho_\text{T}\gtrsim1.0$ g/cm$^3$ ($m_\text{T}\gtrsim 5\times 10^{20}$ g). In particular, this value emerges as a key constraint within the context of the resonant transport model for the origins of Jupiter's interior satellites. Expanding on this theory, here we carry out simulations of the simultaneous gravitational shepherding of Amalthea and Thebe via the resonant influence of inward-migrating Io during Jupiter's disk-bearing epoch. We find that owing to overstability of resonant dynamics facilitated by the circumjovian disk's aerodynamic drag, Thebe's smaller radius (compared to that of Amalthea's) requires a higher density to ensure its terminal orbital distance exceeds that of Amalthea's, as it does today. With multiple current and upcoming space missions devoted to in situ exploration of the Jovian system, a proper measurement of Thebe's mass provides an avenue towards empirical falsification or confirmation of our theoretical model for the dynamical evolution of Jupiter's inner moons.</description>

      <title>The Perturbation Theory Approach to Stability in the Scattered Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scattered disk objects (SDOs) are distant minor bodies that orbit the sun on highly eccentric orbits, frequently with perhelia near Neptune's orbit. Gravitational perturbations due to Neptune frequently lead to chaotic dynamics, with the degree of chaotic diffusion set by an object's perihelion distance. Batygin et al. (2021) developed a perturbative approach for scattered disk dynamics, finding that, to leading order in semi-major axis ratio, an infinite series of $2:j$ resonances drives the dynamics of the distant scattered disk, with overlaps between resonances driving chaotic motion. In this work we extend this model by taking the spherical harmonic expansion for Neptune's gravitational potential to octupole order and beyond. In continuing the expansion out to smaller semi-major axis limits, we find that the $1:j$ and $3:j$ resonances that emerge in the octupole expansion do not individually set new limits on the stability boundary. Instead, we find that for increasingly Neptune-proximate orbits, resonances of progressively higher index are dominant in explaining the emergence of chaotic behavior. In this picture, the mutual intersections between series of $2:j$, $3:j$, $4:j \dots,$ resonant chains explain local chaotic evolution of SDOs and shape the dynamical distribution of the population at large.</description>

      <title>PLATOSpec's first results: planets WASP-35b and TOI-622b are on aligned orbits, and K2-237b is on a polar orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin-orbit angle between a stellar spin axis and its planetary orbital axis is a key diagnostic of planetary migration pathways, yet the mechanisms shaping the observed spin-orbit distribution remain incompletely understood. Combining the spin-orbit angle with atmospheric measurements has emerged as a powerful method of studying exoplanets that showcases the synergy between ground- and space-based observations. We present the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect measurements of the projected spin-orbit angle ($\lambda$) for three gaseous exoplanets using the newly commissioned PLATOSpec instrument on the E152 Telescope at La Silla Observatory. For WASP-35b, we determine $\lambda = 1_{-18}^{+19}$ deg, demonstrating PLATOSpec's capabilities through excellent agreement with HARPS-N literature data. We provide the first spin-orbit measurements for TOI-622b ($\lambda =-4 \pm 12$ deg, true spin-orbit angle $\psi = $16.1$^{+8.0}_{-9.7}$ deg), revealing an aligned orbit consistent with quiescent disc migration. For K2-237b, we find $\lambda = 91 \pm 7$ deg and $\psi = $90.5$^{+6.8}_{-6.2}$ deg, indicating a nearly perfect polar orbit, which suggests a history consistent with disc-free migration, contrasting previous studies inferring disc migration. TOI-622b populates a sparsely populated region of sub-Jovian planets with measured spin-orbit angles orbiting stars above the Kraft break, while K2-237b's polar configuration strengthens tentative evidence for preferential orbital orientations. All three systems are compelling targets for future atmospheric characterization, where these dynamical constraints will be vital for a comprehensive understanding of their formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>Replicating the flyby sampling of salty ocean world ice grains using impact ionization mass spectrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Europa Clipper mission will arrive at the Jovian system in 2030 and analyze ice grains sourced from the icy material on its surface using impact mass spectrometry, which will provide key constraints on Europa's chemical composition and habitability. However, deriving quantitative compositional information from spaceborne impact mass spectra of ice grains has historically proven difficult due to the confounding effects of composition and impact velocity, coupled with difficulties in accelerating ice grains to spacecraft velocities under analogous sampling conditions. Using a novel hypervelocity ice grain acceleration and impact mass spectrometry method, we quantify the degree to which the mass spectra of NaCl-rich ice grains are influenced by chemical composition and impact velocity variations within the flyby velocity ranges planned for the Europa Clipper mission. These results suggest that high-fidelity studies quantifying composition and velocity-related effects in impact mass spectra may be necessary to accurately interpret data collected at Europa and other ocean worlds in the future.</description>

      <title>Thermospheric Density, Composition, and Temperature from GOES-R/SUVI Solar Occultations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new dataset of atomic oxygen and molecular nitrogen number density profiles, along with thermospheric temperature profiles between 180 and 500 km, has been developed. These profiles are derived from solar occultation measurements made by SUVI on the GOES-R satellites, using the 17.1, 19.5, and 30.4 nm channels. Discussed is the novel approach and methods for using EUV solar occultation images to measuring the thermospheric state. Measurement uncertainties are presented as a function of tangent altitude. At 250 km, number density random uncertainties are found to be 8% and 17% for O and N2, respectively, and the random uncertainty for neutral temperature at 250 km was found to be 3%. The impact of effective cross section uncertainty on retrieval bias was assessed, revealing that, as expected, the largest effects occur where O and N2 are minor absorbers. In contrast, total mass density and O/N2 ratios exhibit substantially lower sensitivity, with biases that remain small or nearly constant with altitude. Total mass density comparisons with the MSIS model show good agreement at the dusk terminator, with an average difference of -2%, but larger discrepancies at dawn, with an average difference of -26%. These discrepancies are more prominent during quiet solar conditions, suggesting an overestimation of densities by MSIS during these conditions. Density comparisons with the IDEA and Dragster assimilative models show dawn/dusk percent differences of -24%/-2% and +2%/+13%, respectively. The dataset is available through the NOAA GOES-R L2 pipeline for eclipse seasons from Sept. 2018 onward and is expected to continue through 2035. As this measurement relies only on real-time NOAA space weather SUVI images, these profiles could be produced in real-time, supporting critical space weather monitoring and prediction, and filling in a current measurement gap of thermospheric temperature and density.</description>

      <title>Cosmic cascades: How disk substructure regulates the flow of water to inner planetary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The influx of icy pebbles to the inner regions of protoplanetary disks constitutes a fundamental ingredient in most planet formation theories. The observational determination of the magnitude of this pebble flux and its dependence on disk substructure (disk gaps as pebble traps) would be a significant step forward. In this work we analyze a sample of 21 T Tauri disks (with ages $\approx 0.5{-}2\mathrm{~Myr}$) using JWST/MIRI spectra homogeneously reduced with the JDISCS pipeline and high-angular-resolution ALMA continuum data. We find that the 1500/6000 K water line flux ratio measured with JWST - a tracer of cold water vapor and pebble drift near the snowline - correlates with the radial location of the innermost dust gap in ALMA continuum observations (ranging from 8.7 to 69 au), confirming predictions from recent models that study connections between the inner and outer disk reservoirs. We develop a population synthesis exploration of pebble drift in gapped disks and find a good match to the observed trend for early and relatively effective gaps, while scenarios where pebble drift happens quickly, gaps are very leaky, or where gaps form late are disfavored on a population level. Inferred snowline pebble mass fluxes (ranging between $10^{-6}$ and $10^{-3}~M_\oplus/\mathrm{yr}$ depending on gap position) are comparable to fluxes used in pebble accretion studies and those proposed for the inner Solar System, while system-to-system variations suggest differences in the emerging planetary system architectures and water budgets.</description>

      <title>Additional JWST/NIRSpec Transits of the Rocky M Dwarf Exoplanet GJ 1132 b Reveal a Featureless Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an archetypal M-dwarf rocky exoplanet, GJ 1132 b has a varied history of atmospheric measurements. At 1.13 $\rm R_{\oplus}$, 1.66 $\rm M_{\oplus}$, and 580 K, it orbits a bright, slowly rotating M dwarf in a 1.6-day period, making it a prime target for characterization. In this study, we combine two JWST NIRSpec/G395H transits previously reported by May and MacDonald et al. 2023 with two new NIRSpec/G395M transits to constrain the presence of an atmosphere. This marks the first time the G395H and G395M modes have been combined for a single target, and we report no difference in the quality of data between the two modes. For rocky M-dwarf studies, G395H may still be preferred if stacking transits to utilize the high-resolution flux-calibrated stellar spectra and assess evolving stellar heterogeneity. GJ 1132 b's co-added transmission spectrum is best-fit with a flat line. A thin steam atmosphere is also consistent with the data, but this interpretation is driven almost entirely by the first transit, which suggests an increase in cool spot coverage-fraction derived from the flux-calibrated stellar spectra. This demonstrates the importance of always considering stellar heterogeneity evolution in multi-visit transits, and also the importance of a "leave-one-transit-out" approach in modeling efforts of co-added transits. We combine these results with MIRI/LRS emission data (Xue et al. 2024) to show that together, transmission and emission are consistent with only the thinnest of atmospheres. Given GJ 1132 b's age and distance from the star, a thin atmosphere is not likely stable. Therefore, the simplest explanation is that GJ 1132 b is indeed a bare rock.</description>

      <title>Inside-Out Planet Formation. VIII. Onset of Planet Formation and the Transition Disk Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inside-Out Planet Formation (IOPF) is a theory of {\it in situ} formation via pebble accretion of close-in Earth to Super-Earth mass planets at the pressure maximum associated with the dead zone inner boundary (DZIB), whose location is set initially by thermal ionization of alkali metals at $\sim1,200\:$K. With midplane disk temperatures determined by viscous accretional heating, the radial location of the DZIB depends on the accretion rate of the disk. Here, we investigate the ability of pebbles to be trapped at the DZIB as a function of the accretion rate and pebble size. We discuss the conditions that are needed for pebble trapping to become efficient when the accretion rate drops to $\sim10^{-9}\:M_\odot\:{\rm yr}^{-1}$ and the resulting DZIB is at $\sim 0.1\:$au, which is the expected evolutionary phase of the disk at the onset of IOPF. This provides an important boundary condition for IOPF theory, i.e., the properties of pebbles when planet formation begins. We find for our fiducial model that typical pebble sizes of $\sim0.5\:$mm are needed for pebble trapping to first become efficient at DZIBs near 0.1~au. This model may also provide an explanation for the first emergence of the transition disk phase in protoplanetary disks with accretion rates of $\sim10^{-9}\:M_\odot\:{\rm yr}^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Accelerating exoplanet climate modelling: A machine learning approach to complement 3D GCM grid simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the development of ever-improving telescopes capable of observing exoplanet atmospheres in greater detail and number, there is a growing demand for enhanced 3D climate models to support and help interpret observational data from space missions like CHEOPS, TESS, JWST, PLATO, and Ariel. However, the computationally intensive and time-consuming nature of general circulation models (GCMs) poses significant challenges in simulating a wide range of exoplanetary atmospheres. This study aims to determine whether machine learning (ML) algorithms can be used to predict the 3D temperature and wind structure of arbitrary tidally-locked gaseous exoplanets in a range of planetary parameters. A new 3D GCM grid with 60 inflated hot Jupiters orbiting A, F, G, K, and M-type host stars modelled with Exorad has been introduced. A dense neural network (DNN) and a decision tree algorithm (XGBoost) are trained on this grid to predict local gas temperatures along with horizontal and vertical winds. To ensure the reliability and quality of the ML model predictions, WASP-121 b, HATS-42 b, NGTS-17 b, WASP-23 b, and NGTS-1 b-like planets, which are all targets for PLATO observation, are selected and modelled with ExoRad and the two ML methods as test cases. The DNN predictions for the gas temperatures are to such a degree that the calculated spectra agree within 32 ppm for all but one planet, for which only one single HCN feature reaches a 100 ppm difference. The developed ML emulators can reliably predict the complete 3D temperature field of an inflated warm to ultra-hot tidally locked Jupiter around A to M-type host stars. It provides a fast tool to complement and extend traditional GCM grids for exoplanet ensemble studies. The quality of the predictions is such that no or minimal effects on the gas phase chemistry, hence on the cloud formation and transmission spectra, are to be expected.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric Characterisation with the Twinkle Space Telescope Following Advances from JWST Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Twinkle Space Telescope is a satellite designed for spectroscopic observations of a wide range of extrasolar and solar system objects. Equipped with a 0.45 m diameter telescope and a spectrometer covering from 0.5 to 4.5 microns simultaneously, Twinkle will be launched in a sun-synchronous, low-Earth orbit, and it is expected to operate for seven years. Twinkle is developed, managed and operated by Blue Skies Space (BSSL), a space science data company whose vision is to accelerate and expand the availability of new, high-quality datasets to researchers worldwide, complementing the space observatories delivered by government space agencies.
  Over its lifetime, Twinkle will conduct large-scale survey programs. The scientific objectives and observational strategy of these surveys are defined by researchers who join the Science Team.
  Leveraging advances made possible by recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope, we present here updated simulations evaluating Twinkle's observational capabilities in the context of exoplanet atmospheres. Through retrieval analyses of HD 209458 b, WASP-107 b, GJ 3470 b, and 55 Cnc e, we demonstrate how increasing observational investment enhances the retrieval of atmospheric parameters and molecular abundances. Our sensitivity study highlights Twinkle's capability to detect less abundant or less detectable molecules depending on the observing strategies adopted. This work provides practical guidance for developing targeted observational strategies to maximise Twinkle's scientific return.</description>

      <title>Phased-Array Laser Power Beaming from Cislunar Space to the Lunar Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a rigorous analytical framework for quantitatively evaluating space-based laser power beaming from lunar-orbiting spacecraft to surface receivers, addressing the critical need for continuous, high-density energy to sustain lunar exploration and habitation. The framework integrates physics-based models of spacecraft photovoltaic generation, precise orbital geometries, time-dependent link availability and slant-range variations, coherent beam propagation (including transmitter aperture diameter, beam quality factor, path losses, and pointing jitter), and photonic-to-electrical conversion at the lunar surface. Particular emphasis is placed on phased-array transmitter systems, whose large effective apertures significantly reduce beam divergence relative to single-aperture designs, resulting in orders-of-magnitude increases in delivered surface power under equivalent orbital and power conditions. Parametric sensitivity analyses and illustrative numerical simulations demonstrate how phased-array architectures improve power density and end-to-end efficiency at operational lunar distances. The study also examines advanced orbital configurations (e.g., Near-Rectilinear Halo Orbits, Earth-Moon Lagrange points), real-time adaptive beam steering and wavefront control, optimized receiver geometries, and thermal/dust mitigation strategies. The results establish a clear pathway toward scalable, efficient laser power beaming infrastructures capable of overcoming lunar-specific challenges - including prolonged darkness and permanently shadowed regions - and enabling sustained robotic and crewed surface operations.</description>

      <title>On the Efficacy of Ocean Formation with a Primordial Hydrogen Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10417v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been suggested that Earth's present water budget formed from oxidation reactions between its initial hydrogen-rich primordial atmosphere and its magma ocean. Here we examine this hypothesis by building a comprehensive atmosphere-magma ocean model. We find that water formation is unlikely for two reasons. First, any water formed from oxidation reactions in the magma ocean would quickly outgass because of the water-poor atmosphere above. Second, the top boundary layer of the magma ocean becomes stable against convection because the oxidation reactions produce metallic iron, which sinks to the core of a growing Earth. This iron loss makes the top boundary layer significantly more buoyant than the rest of the magma, thus becoming stable against mixing. Our results suggest that hydrogen dissolution is unlikely to play a major role in the formation of Earth's oceans.</description>

      <title>The ALMA Survey of Gas Evolution of PROtoplanetary Disks (AGE-PRO): VIII. The impact of external photoevaporation on disk masses and radii in Upper Scorpius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Protoplanetary disk evolution can be deeply influenced by the UV radiation emitted by neighboring massive stars (mainly of spectral type O and B). We show that the process of external photoevaporation, which causes an outside-in depletion of disk material due to environmental UV radiation, can lead to a significant decrease in disk size, and moderate in disk mass and lifetime even at moderate irradiation levels (1-10 G$_{0}$). In this work we investigate the role of external photoevaporation in shaping the masses and sizes of the ten AGE-PRO disks in the Upper Scorpius region, which we estimate to be subject to FUV fluxes ranging between 2 and 12 G$_{0}$, on average. We compare the disk masses and sizes resulting from 1D numerical viscous evolution simulations in which the effect of external photoevaporation is included, to the values retrieved from the AGE-PRO observations. While the pure viscous framework fails in adequately explaining the observed disk properties in Upper Scorpius, with the inclusion of external photoevaporation we can successfully reproduce gas disk sizes for 7 out of 10 sources within a factor &lt;2, when the initial disk mass is 1-10% of the stellar mass. We emphasize the importance of accounting for the environmental irradiation when comparing star-forming regions of different ages, even when moderate FUV irradiation fields are experienced, as in the case of Upper Scorpius.</description>

      <title>The Potential Danger to Satellites due to Ejecta from a 2032 Lunar Impact by Asteroid 2024 YR4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On 2032 December 22 the 60 m diameter asteroid 2024 YR4 has a 4% chance of impacting the Moon. Such an impact would release 6.5 MT TNT equivalent energy and produce a ~1 km diameter crater. We estimate that up to 10^8 kg of lunar material could be liberated in such an impact by exceeding lunar escape speed. Depending on the actual impact location on the Moon as much as 10% of this material may accrete to the Earth on timescales of a few days. The lunar ejecta-associated particle fluence at 0.1 - 10 mm sizes could produce upwards of years to of order a decade of equivalent background meteoroid impact exposure to satellites in near-Earth space late in 2032. Our results demonstrate that planetary defense considerations should be more broadly extended to cis-lunar space and not confined solely to near-Earth space.</description>

      <title>From a Different Star: 3I/ATLAS in the context of the \={O}tautahi-Oxford interstellar object population model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05318v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of the third interstellar object (ISO), 3I/ATLAS (`3I'), provides a rare chance to directly observe a small body from another Solar System. Studying its chemistry and dynamics will add to our understanding of how the processes of planetesimal formation and evolution happen across the Milky Way's disk, and how such objects respond to the Milky Way's potential. In this Letter, we present a first assessment of 3I in the context of the \={O}tautahi-Oxford model, which uses data from Gaia in conjunction with models of protoplanetary disk chemistry and Galactic dynamics to predict the properties of the ISO population. The model shows that both the velocity and radiant of 3I are within the expected range. Its velocity predicts an age of over 7.6 Gyr and a high water mass fraction, which may become observable shortly. We also conclude that it is very unlikely that 3I shares an origin with either of the previous two interstellar object detections.</description>

      <title>Error dependencies in the space-based CNEOS fireball database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We evaluate the reliability of CNEOS-derived ephemerides of fireball events given the absence of the underlying data. We analyzed 18 events that have both (i) sufficient satellite information to derive orbits and (ii) ground-based observational counterparts. We quantify the uncertainties on these calibrated events using the orbital similarity criterion $D_D$. We also examine the velocity components imbalance and identify discriminants that can indicate the accuracy of an event. We identify two groups in the CNEOS database. CNEOS data produces ephemeris determinations with $D_D$&lt;0.1 for fireballs reported either (i) after late 2017 or (ii) with impact energies above 0.45 kt with 74-78% of events having $D_D$=0.03$\pm$0.02, while ~11% show $D_D$&lt;0.008. Our statistical test confirms these two parameters as the only reliable discriminants that, when combined, explain the two accuracy groups. Daylight, z-velocity component, low altitude, long duration, and latitude might also indicate errors, although the limited dataset may obscure correlations. No clear discriminants are identified for more restrictive $D_D$ cut-offs. We provide estimates of orbital uncertainties for calibrated events. The hyperbolic fireball subset in the CNEOS database appears as an outlier in the velocity imbalance test. Our results confirm that the fidelity of CNEOS fireball data improved significantly from 2018, likely due to the deployment of next-generation space sensors, and show a growing number of high-velocity events. Hyperbolic candidates should be interpreted with caution, as their velocities and inclinations likely reflect measurement errors. Accuracy constraints remain limited by the dataset size, as evidenced by the lack of statistically significant dependence on duration, preventing strong conclusions from being drawn.</description>

      <title>One-third of Sun-like stars are born with misaligned planet-forming disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exoplanets are organized in a broad array of orbital configurations that reflect their formation along with billions of years of dynamical processing through gravitational interactions. This history is encoded in the angular momentum architecture of planetary systems--the relation between the rotational properties of the central star and the orbital geometry of planets. A primary observable is the alignment (or misalignment) between the rotational axis of the star and the orbital plane of its planets, known as stellar obliquity. Hundreds of spin-orbit constraints have been measured for giant planets close to their host stars, many of which have revealed planets on misaligned orbits. A leading question that has emerged is whether stellar obliquity originates primarily from gravitational interactions with other planets or distant stars in the same system, or if it is primordial--imprinted during the star-formation process. Here we present a comprehensive assessment of primordial obliquities between the spin axes of young, isolated Sun-like stars and the orientation of the outer regions of their protoplanetary disks. Most systems are consistent with angular momentum alignment but about one-third of isolated young systems exhibit primordial misalignment. This suggests that some obliquities identified in planetary systems at older ages--including the Sun's modest misalignment with planets in the Solar System--could originate from initial conditions of their formation.</description>
