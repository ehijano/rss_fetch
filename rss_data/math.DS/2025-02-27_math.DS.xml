      <title>Uniform positivity of the Lyapunov exponent for $C^1$ monotone potentials generated by the cat map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an Arnold's Cat Map generated $C^1$ bounded potential with the directional derivative in the unstable direction bounded away from zero. We show that the Lyapunov exponent for the associated Shr\"odinger Operator is uniformly positive for all energies provided the coupling is sufficiently large.</description>

      <title>Residual Transitivity implies Minimality for Markoff Surfaces over $p$-adic Integers, by Means of $p$-adic Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X_D^\ast$ be the non-singuar locus of the Markoff surface $X_D\colon x^2+y^2+z^2=xyz+D$ and consider the set of its $p$-adic integer points $X_D^\ast(\mathbb{Z}_p)$. It is known to Bourgain, Gamburd, and Sarnak that the modulo $p$ transitivity by algebraic automorphisms of $X_0^\ast$ implies minimality of $X_0^\ast(\mathbb{Z}_p)$ by algebraic automorphisms. In this paper, we provide an alternative proof of this fact, by some techniques to study $p$-adic analytic flows. This establish a slight generalization to those parameters $D$ congruent to $0$ modulo $p^2$ or $(D-4)$ being a nonzero quadratic residue.</description>

      <title>Computing Connection Matrix and Persistence Efficiently from a Morse Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Morse decompositions partition the flows in a vector field into equivalent structures. Given such a decomposition, one can define a further summary of its flow structure by what is called a connection matrix.These matrices, a generalization of Morse boundary operators from classical Morse theory, capture the connections made by the flows among the critical structures - such as attractors, repellers, and orbits - in a vector field. Recently, in the context of combinatorial dynamics, an efficient persistence-like algorithm to compute connection matrices has been proposed in~\cite{DLMS24}. We show that, actually, the classical persistence algorithm with exhaustive reduction retrieves connection matrices, both simplifying the algorithm of~\cite{DLMS24} and bringing the theory of persistence closer to combinatorial dynamical systems. We supplement this main result with an observation: the concept of persistence as defined for scalar fields naturally adapts to Morse decompositions whose Morse sets are filtered with a Lyapunov function. We conclude by presenting preliminary experimental results.</description>

      <title>A Mathematical Model of the Cell Cycle: Exploring the Impact of Zingerone on Cancer Cell Proliferation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a mathematical model that explores the interactions between Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 1 (CDK1) and the Anaphase-Promoting Complex (APC) in cancer cells. Through the analysis of a dynamical system simulating the CDK1-APC network, we investigate the system's behavior and its implications for cancer progression and potential therapeutic interventions. Our findings highlight the critical role of CDK1-APC interactions in regulating the cell cycle and examine the impact of Zingerone, a compound derived from ginger, on modulating the period of the oscillatory dynamics. These results provide new insights into the potential of Zingerone to influence cell proliferation and offer avenues for less harmful cancer treatments. The quantitative analysis is conducted by first theoretically deriving the cell viability as a function of time and Zingerone concentration, and then validating this function by using experimental data.</description>

      <title>H\"older spiral arcs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the H\"older continuity of certain spiral arcs. In particular, we introduce the class of almost circular spirals, and establish a quantitative necessary and sufficient condition for such a spiral to be a H\"older arc. This class contains spirals studied by Fraser in 2021, and by Burell-Falconer-Fraser in 2022. As an application, we recover the sharp result on the H\"older winding problem, initially proved by Fraser. Moreover, we provide a sharp exponent estimate for the H\"older classification of polynomial spirals, which coincides with the corresponding quasiconformal classification estimate, and improve certain exponent bounds on the H\"older classification of elliptical spirals due to Burell-Falconer-Fraser.</description>

      <title>Age Group Sensitivity Analysis of Epidemic Models: Investigating the Impact of Contact Matrix Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the role of different age groups in disease transmission is crucial for designing effective intervention strategies. A key parameter in age-structured epidemic models is the contact matrix, which defines the interaction structure between age groups. However, accurately estimating contact matrices is challenging, as different age groups respond differently to surveys and are accessible through different channels. This variability introduces significant epistemic uncertainty in epidemic models.
  In this study, we introduce the Age Group Sensitivity Analysis (AGSA) method, a novel framework for assessing the impact of age-structured contact patterns on epidemic outcomes. Our approach integrates age-stratified epidemic models with Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) and the Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient (PRCC) method, enabling a systematic sensitivity analysis of age-specific interactions. Additionally, we propose a new sensitivity aggregation technique that quantifies the contribution of each age group to key epidemic parameters.
  By identifying the age groups to which the model is most sensitive, AGSA helps pinpoint those that introduce the greatest epistemic uncertainty. This allows for targeted data collection efforts, focusing surveys and empirical studies on the most influential age groups to improve model accuracy. As a result, AGSA can enhance epidemic forecasting and inform the design of more effective and efficient public health interventions.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of the escaping set of certain H\'enon maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $H$ be a H\'enon map of the form $H(x,y)=(y,p(y)-ax)$. We prove that the escaping set $U^+$ (or the non-escaping set $K^+$), of $H$ is rigid under the actions of automorphisms of $\mathbb{C}^2$ if the $\text{degree of }H=d\le |a|$. Specifically, every automorphism of $\mathbb{C}^2$ that preserves $U^+$, essentially takes the form $C \circ H^s$ where $s \in \mathbb{Z}$, and $C(x,y)=(\eta x, \eta^d y)$ with $\eta$ some $(d^2-1)$-root of unity. Consequently, we show that the automorphisms of the short $\mathbb{C}^2$'s, obtained as the sub-level sets of the Green's function corresponding to the H\'enon map $H$ for strictly positive values, are linear maps of $\mathbb{C}^2$ preserving the escaping set $U^+$. Hence, the automorphism group of these short $\mathbb{C}^2$'s is finite and is a subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}_{d^2-1}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cellular automata are a fundamental computational model with applications in mathematics, computer science, and physics. In this work, we explore the study of cellular automata to cases where the universe is a group, introducing the concept of \( \phi \)-cellular automata. We establish new theoretical results, including a generalized Uniform Curtis-Hedlund Theorem and linear \( \phi \)-cellular automata. Additionally, we define the covering map for \( \phi \)-cellular automata and investigate its properties. Specifically, we derive results for quotient covers when the universe of the automaton is a circulant graph. This work contributes to the algebraic and topological understanding of cellular automata, paving the way for future exploration of different types of covers and their applications to broader classes of graphs and dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Period two solution for a class of distributed delay differential equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.13615v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the existence of a periodic solution for a differential equation with distributed delay. It is shown that, for a class of distributed delay diferential quations, a symmetric period 2 solution, where the period is twice the maximum delay, is given as a periodic solution of a Hamiltonian system of ordinary differential equations. Proof of the idea is based on (Kaplan &amp; Yorke, 1974, J. Math. Anal. Appl.) for a discrete delay differential equation with an odd nonlinear function. To illustrate the results, we present distributed delay differential equations that have periodic solutions expressed in terms of the Jacobi elliptic functions.</description>

      <title>On residues and conjugacies for germs of 1-D parabolic diffeomorphisms in finite regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.13182v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study conjugacy classes of germs of non-flat diffeomorphisms of the real line fixing the origin. Based on the work of Takens and Yoccoz, we establish results that are sharp in terms of differentiability classes and order of tangency to the identity. The core of all of this lies in the invariance of residues under low-regular conjugacies. This may be seen as an extension of the fact (also proved in this article) that the value of the Schwarzian derivative at the origin for germs of $C^3$ parabolic diffeomorphisms is invariant under $C^2$ parabolic conjugacy, though it may vary arbitrarily under parabolic $C^1$ conjugacy.</description>

      <title>On absolute continuity of inhomogeneous and contracting on average self-similar measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a condition for absolute continuity of self-similar measures in arbitrary dimensions. This allows us to construct the first explicit absolutely continuous examples of inhomogeneous self-similar measures in dimension one and two. In fact, for $d\geq 1$ and any given rotations in $O(d)$ acting irreducibly on $\mathbb{R}^d$ as well as any distinct translations, all having algebraic coefficients, we construct absolutely continuous self-similar measures with the given rotations and translations. We furthermore strengthen Varj\'u's result for Bernoulli convolutions, treat complex Bernoulli convolutions and in dimension $\geq 3$ improve the condition on absolute continuity by Lindenstrauss-Varj\'u. Moreover, self-similar measures of contracting on average measures are studied, which may include expanding similarities in their support.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23491v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider state-dependent delay differential equations of the form $$\dot{x}(t) = f(x(t), x(t - r(x_t))),$$ where $f$ is continuously differentiable and fulfills a negative feedback condition in the delayed term. Under suitable conditions on $r$ and $f$, we construct a Morse decomposition of the global attractor, giving some insight into the global dynamics. The Morse sets in the decomposition are closely related to the level sets of an integer valued Lyapunov function that counts the number of sign changes along solutions on intervals of length of the delay. This generalizes former results for constant delay. We also give two major types of state-dependent delays for which our results apply.</description>

Abstract: We prove the finiteness of ergodic measures of maximal entropy for partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms where the center direction has a dominated decomposition into one dimensional bundle and there is a uniform lower bound for the absolute value of the Lyapunov exponents. As applications we prove finiteness for a class derived from Anosov partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms defined on $\mathbb{T}^4$ and that in a class of skew product over partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms there exists a $C^1$ open and $C^r$ dense set of diffeomorphisms with a finite number of ergodic measures of maximal entropy. We also study the upper semicontinuity of the number of measures of maximal entropy with respect to the diffeomorphism.</description>

      <title>On real and observable rational realizations of input-output equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a single (differential-algebraic) input-output equation, we present a method for finding different representations of the associated system in the form of rational realizations; these are dynamical systems with rational right-hand sides. It has been shown that in the case where the input-output equation is of order one, rational realizations can be computed, if they exist. In this work, we focus first on the existence and actual computation of the so-called observable rational realizations, and secondly on rational realizations with real coefficients. The study of observable realizations allows to find every rational realization of a given first order input-output equation, and the necessary field extensions in this process. We show that for first order input-output equations the existence of a rational realization is equivalent to the existence of an observable rational realization. Moreover, we give a criterion to decide the existence of real rational realizations. The computation of observable and real realizations of first order input-output equations is fully algorithmic. We also present partial results for the case of higher order input-output equations.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, a novel mathematical model is developed to evaluate the spatiotemporal vehicle loads on long bridges from slope measurements made at the ends of a bridge based on Euler-Bernoulli beam model with internal and external damping. The mathematical modelling of this phenomena leads to the inverse source problem of determining the spatiotemporal vehicle load $F(x,t)$ in the variable coefficient Euler-Bernoulli equation $\rho_A(x)u_{tt}+\mu(x) u_{t}+(r(x)u_{xx})_{xx}+(\kappa(x)u_{xxt})_{xx}=F(x,t)$, $(x,t)\in \Omega_T:=(0,\ell)\times (0,T)$ subject to the "simply supported" boundary conditions $u(0,t)=(r(x)u_{xx}+(\kappa(x)u_{xxt})_{x=0}=0$, $u(\ell,t)=(r(x)u_{xx}+(\kappa(x)u_{xxt})_{x=\ell}=0$, from the both measured outputs: $\theta_1(t):=u_x(0,t)$ and $\theta_2(t):=u_x(\ell,t)$, that is, the measured boundary slopes. It is shown that the input-output maps $(\Phi F)(t):=u_x(0,t;F)$, $(\Psi F)(t):=u_x(\ell,t;F)$, $F \in \mathcal{F}\subset L^2(\Omega_T)$, corresponding to the inverse problem, are compact and Lipschitz continuous. Then Tikhonov functional $J(F)=\Vert \Phi F-\theta_1 \Vert_{L^2(0,T)}^2+\Vert \Psi F-\theta_2 \Vert_{L^2(0,T)}^2$ is introduced to prove the existence of a quasi-solution to the inverse problem. An explicit gradient formula for the Fr\'{e}chet derivative of the Tikhonov functional is derived. The Lipschitz continuity of the Fr\'{e}chet gradient, which guarantees the monotonicity of iterations in gradient methods, has been proven.</description>

Abstract: By synchronously coupling multiple Lorentz trajectories exploring the same environment consisting of randomly placed scatterers in R^3 we upgrade the annealed invariance principle proved in [C. Lutsko, B. T\'oth, Commun. Math. Phys. 379 589-632 (2020)] to quenched setting (that is, valid for almost all realizations of the environment) along sufficiently fast extractor sequences.</description>

      <title>Extreme vulnerability to intruder attacks destabilizes network dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consensus, synchronization, formation control, and power grid balance are all examples of virtuous dynamical states that may arise in networks. Here we focus on how such states can be destabilized from a fundamental perspective; namely, we address the question of how one or a few intruder agents within an otherwise functioning network may compromise its dynamics. We show that a single adversarial node coupled via adversarial couplings to one or more other nodes is sufficient to destabilize the entire network, which we prove to be more efficient than targeting multiple nodes. Then, we show that concentrating the attack on a single low-indegree node induces the greatest instability, challenging the common assumption that hubs are the most critical nodes. This leads to a new characterization of the vulnerability of a node, which contrasts with previous work, and identifies low-indegree nodes (as opposed to the hubs) as the most vulnerable components of a network. Our results are derived for linear systems but hold true for nonlinear networks, including those described by the Kuramoto model. Finally, we derive scaling laws showing that larger networks are less susceptible, on average, to single-node attacks. Overall, these findings highlight an intrinsic vulnerability of technological systems such as autonomous networks, sensor networks, power grids, and the internet of things, with implications also to the realm of complex social and biological networks.</description>
