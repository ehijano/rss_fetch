      <title>QCD sum rule approach to Okamoto-Nolen-Schiffer anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new framework is introduced to connect between a charge symmetry breaking (CSB) energy density functional (EDF) and the low-energy constants derived from quantum chromodynamics (QCD). By constructing a QCD-based CSB EDF, this method provides new insights into the Okamoto-Nolen-Schiffer anomaly, a long-standing puzzle in the energy differences of mirror nuclei that lacks a robust microscopic explanation. Using examples such as $ {}^{17} \mathrm{F} $-$ {}^{17} \mathrm{O} $, $ {}^{15} \mathrm{O} $-$ {}^{15} \mathrm{N} $, $ {}^{41} \mathrm{Sc} $-$ {}^{41} \mathrm{Ca} $, and $ {}^{39} \mathrm{Ca} $-$ {}^{39} \mathrm{K} $, we demonstrate that the proposed interaction effectively resolves the anomaly within the range of theoretical uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Constituent Quark Model and nucleon-Nucleon Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In these notes, while focusing on the meson-nucleon vertices, we give a derivation of the nucleon-nucleon 9NN) potentials from meson-exchange between quarks. To establish such a relation the quark-quark-meson (QQM) interactions are properly defined. Hitherto, the coefficients in the Pauli-spinor expansion of the meson-nucleon-nucleon (NNM) vertices are equated with those of the QQM-vertices. In these notes we employ the description of the nucleon with Dirac-spinors in the SU(6) semi-relativistic "constituent" quark-model (CQM) as formulated by LeYouanc, et al. It appears that the constituent quark model with $m_q= M_N/3$, is able to produce the same ratio's for the central-, spin-spin-, tensor-, spin-orbit-, and quadratic-spin-orbit Pauli-invariants as in the phenomenological NNM-vertices. In order to achieve this, the scalar-, magnetic-vector, and axial-vector interactions require, besides the standard ones, an extra coupling to the quarks without the introduction of new parameters. in the case of the axial-vector mesons an extra coupling to the quarks is necessary, which is related to the quark orbital angular momentum contribution to the nucleon spin. Furthermore, a momentum correlation between the quark that is coupled to the meson and the remaining quark pair, and a (gaussian) QQM form factor, are necessary to avoid "spurious" terms. From these results we have obtained a formulation of the QQ-interactions which is directly related to the NN extended-soft-core (ESC) interactions. This has been applied to mixed quark-nuclear matter in a study of (heavy) neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Stiffening of matter in quark-hadron continuity: a mini-review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations of neutron stars, combined with causality, thermodynamic stability, and nuclear constraints, indicate rapid stiffening of QCD matter at density slightly above nuclear saturation density ($n_0 \simeq 0.16\,{\rm fm}^{-3}$). The evolution of the stiffening is quicker than expected from purely nucleonic models with many-body repulsion. Taking into account the quark substructure of baryons, we argue that the saturation of quarks states occur at $\sim$ 2-3$n_0$, driving the quark matter formation even before baryonic cores of the radii $\sim$0.5 fm spatially overlap. We describe the continuous transitions from hadronic to quark matter are described within a quarkyonic matter model in which gluons are assumed to be confining at density of interest. To obtain analytic insights for the transient regime, we construct an ideal model of quarkyonic matter, IdylliQ model, in which one can freely switch from baryonic to quark languages and vice versa.</description>

      <title>Transport coefficients of dense nucleon matter at low temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transport properties of cold and dense nucleon matter are important for both nuclear and astrophysics but are relatively less studied than those at finite temperatures. In this paper, we present a primary study of bulk and shear viscosities in the limit $T/\mu_B \ll 1$, where $T$ and $\mu_B$ are the temperature and the baryon chemical potential. The analysis is performed for a generic system where nucleons are dressed by the condensation of both scalar and vector interactions. Under the relaxation time approximation of the Boltzmann equation, we compute the viscosities of the system to leading power in $T/\mu_B$ expansion and establish a relation between the thermodynamic potential and transport coefficients, including bulk viscosity ($\zeta$) and shear viscosity ($\eta$). It is found that hydrodynamic stability ($\zeta&gt;0$) imposes additional constraints on the thermodynamic potential. As an example, these relations are applied to the Walecka model. The fluid properties of the cold and dense nucleon matter are characterized by the dimensionless combination of viscosities times the quasi-Fermi momentum over the enthalpy. Furthermore, we discuss the implication of the stability condition on the range of applicability of the model.</description>

      <title>Dipole response of deformed halo nuclei $^{31}$Ne and $^{37}$Mg</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the soft electric dipole ($E1$) response of deformed halo nuclei $^{31}$Ne and $^{37}$Mg using a deformed Woods-Saxon potential, with the potential depth adjusted to reproduce empirical separation energy of last neutron orbit, i.e., 150 keV for $^{31}$Ne and 220 keV for $^{37}$Mg. The configuration dependence of the $E1$ strength near the neutron threshold is pointed out. The halo configurations $[321]3/2$ at $\beta_2=0.5$ and $[330]1/2$ at $\beta_2=0.24$ in $^{31}$Ne contain large amplitudes of halo $p$-shell orbits, which significantly enhance the threshold strength by several times compared to the non-halo configuration $[202]5/2$ at $\beta_2=0.32$. In $^{37}$Mg, the last neutron configuration is assigned as $[321]1/2$ at a large deformation of $\beta_2=0.46$, which involves a halo $p$-shell configuration that significantly enhances the soft dipole strength. This enhancement is about 60\% larger than that of the $[321]3/2$ configuration in $^{31}$Ne because of large $p$-shell probability in $^{37}$Mg. Experimental confirmation of the soft dipole strength is highly desired to determine the deformation and the configuration of the last neutron orbits both in $^{31}$Ne and $^{37}$Mg.</description>

      <title>Machine learning orbital-free density functional theory: taming quantum shell effects in deformed nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate description of deformed atomic nuclei by the orbital-free density functional theory has been a longstanding textbook challenge, due to the difficulty in accounting for the intricate quantum shell effects that are present in such systems. Orbital-free density functional theory is, in principle, capable of describing all effects of nuclear systems, as guaranteed by the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem. However, from a microscopic perspective, shell and deformation effects are believed to be intrinsically connected to single-orbital structures, posing a significant challenge for orbital-free approaches. Here, we develop a machine learning approach to the orbital-free density functional theory, which is capable of achieving a high level of accuracy in describing the ground-state properties and potential energy curves for both spherical $^{16}$O and deformed $^{20}$Ne nuclei. This is the inaugural instance where a fully orbital-free energy density functional has succeeded in taming the complex shell effects in deformed nuclei. It demonstrates that the orbital-free energy density functional, which is directly based on the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem, is not only a theoretical concept but also a practical one for nuclear systems.</description>

      <title>The reduced-width amplitude in nuclear cluster physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reduced-width amplitude, as a cluster overlap amplitude, is one important physical quantity for analyzing clustering in the nucleus depending on specified channels and has been calculated and applied widely in nuclear cluster physics. In this review, we briefly revisit the theoretical framework for calculating the reduced-width amplitude, as well as the outlines of cluster models to obtain the microscopic or semi-microscopic cluster wave functions. Besides, we also introduce recent progress related to the cluster overlap amplitudes, such as implementation for cross-section estimation and extension to three-body clustering analysis. Comprehensive examples are provided to show the applications of the reduced-width amplitude in analyzing cluster structures.</description>

      <title>Effects of asymmetric dark matter on a magnetized neutron star: A two-fluid approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the interaction between dark matter (DM) and highly magnetized neutron stars (NSs), focusing on how DM particle mass, mass fraction, and magnetic field (MF) strength affect NS structure and stability. We consider self-interacting, non-annihilating, asymmetric fermionic DM that couples to NSs only through gravitational interaction. Using the QMC-RMF4 relativistic mean-field model with density-dependent magnetic fields, we investigate the magnetized equation of state and examine the accumulation of DM under various conditions. Our results show that as the DM fraction increases, the maximum gravitational mass of the NS decreases, especially for heavier DM particles, while lighter DM particles can induce a transition from a dark core to a halo structure, increasing the maximum mass. Strong MFs soften the equation of state and reduce the dark mass a NS core can retain before transitioning to a halo.</description>

      <title>Semi-Classical Spin Hydrodynamics in Flat and Curved Spacetime: Covariance, Linear Waves, and Bjorken Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore various aspects of semi-classical spin hydrodynamics, where hydrodynamic currents are derived from an expansion in the reduced Planck constant $\hbar$, incorporating both flat and curved spacetimes. After establishing covariant definitions for angular momentum currents, we demonstrate that the conservation of the energy-momentum tensor requires modifications involving the Riemann curvature and the spin tensors. We also revise pseudo-gauge transformations to ensure their applicability in curved spacetimes. Key assumptions for semi-classical spin hydrodynamics are introduced, enabling studies without explicitly invoking quantum kinetic theory. We derive and analyze the linearized semi-classical spin hydrodynamic equations, proving that spin and fluid modes decouple in the linear regime. As a concrete example, we study the ideal-spin approximation in a dissipative fluid with shear viscosity. This analysis confirms our general result: the damping of spin waves is governed solely by spin relaxation time coefficients, independent of linear fluid perturbations. We also examine the Gibbs stability criterion and reveal its limitations at first order in $\hbar$, signaling the inherent anisotropy of the equilibrium state, which remains unaddressed in current semi-classical spin hydrodynamics formulations. Finally, within a conformal Bjorken flow background and using the slow-roll approximation attractor for the fluid sector, we show that the relaxation of the spin potential is governed by spin relaxation time coefficients, mirroring the damping behavior of spin waves in the linear regime.</description>

      <title>Moments to All Orders from Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the traditional moments approach in lattice QCD, based on operator product expansion (OPE), can be realized in a way that avoids power divergent mixings, and thus allows to extract moments order by order, to all orders in principle. We propose to use momentum instead of distance as a leverage to extract moments at a given order. Moreover, by utilizing symmetry of the lattice matrix elements, we can determine the even and odd moments separately. As a demonstrative example, we determine the first three moments beyond the tensor charge gT of the isovector quark transversity distribution in the nucleon.</description>

      <title>Pion fragmentation functions from a quark-jet model in a functional approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The elementary fragmentation function that describes the process $q\to \pi$ is predicted applying crossing and charge symmetry to the cut diagram of the pion valence quark distribution function. This elementary probability distribution defines the ladder-kernel of a quark jet fragmentation equation, which is solved self-consistently to obtain the full pion fragmentation function. The hadronization into a pion employs the complete Poincar\'e invariant Bethe-Salpeter wave function, though the overwhelming contribution to the fragmentation function is due the leading Bethe-Salpeter amplitude. Compared to a Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model prediction, the fragmentation function we obtain is enhanced in the range $z \lesssim 0.8$ but otherwise in good qualitative agreement. The full pion fragmentation function is overall greater than the elementary fragmentation function below $z\lesssim 0.6$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the vector meson $\omega$ into the Quark Meson model, and study the impact of vector interactions on the properties of static hadrons using the mean-field approximation. The short-range repulsive force associated with vector interactions leads to an expansion of the root mean square radius of nucleons. While the mass of hadrons increases, the gap between this mass and the energy of the three free constituent quarks decreases, resulting in the instability of hadrons. Our study of nucleon mass and radius at finite temperature and density has potential applications for particle yield in heavy ion collisions and the mass-radius relationship in compact stars.</description>

      <title>The nucleon properties in finite temperature and density with Gaussian fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of nucleons at finite temperature and density using a two-flavor quark meson model with Gaussian fluctuations that extend beyond the mean-field approximation. Our findings suggest that Gaussian fluctuations lead to a non-monotonic behavior of the nucleon mass as a function of temperature and density, which may play an important role in the study of the hadronization process of relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Moreover, we observe an increase in the nucleon radius due to Gaussian fluctuations, suggesting an effective repulsive force akin to the Casimir effect, as observed in the gold-bromobenzene-silica system. This study offers new insights into how temperature, density, and quantum fluctuations affect the structure and properties of nucleons under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>The Spectra of $p\bar\Lambda$ and $p\bar\Sigma$ Hexaquark States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the observation of the $J^P = 1^+$ resonance $X(2085)$ in the $p\bar{\Lambda}$ system by the BESIII collaboration, we studied the molecular states of hexaquarks $p\bar{\Lambda}$ and $p\bar{\Sigma}$ with baryon-antibaryon structures within the framework of the QCD sum rules. Non-perturbative contributions up to dimension 13 were considered in our analysis. The results indicate the existence of six possible molecular states $p\bar{\Lambda}$ and $p\bar{\Sigma}$, with quantum numbers $J^{P}=0^{-}, 0^{+}, 1^{-}$. Consequently, the current sum rule results do not support the interpretation of $X(2085)$ as a $p\bar{\Lambda}$ or $p\bar{\Sigma}$ molecular state. On the other hand, we find that the masses of the proposed $p\bar{\Lambda}$ and $p\bar{\Sigma}$ structures with $J^{P} = 1^{-}$ are in the vicinity of observed $X(2075)$, which implies that the nature of this state needs more invistigations. Moreover, the possible decay modes of the concerned hexaquark states are analyzed.</description>

      <title>Spectral sum rules and phase transition in strongly coupled QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By incorporating contributions from both the (chromo)electric scale $gT$ and (chromo)magnetic scale $g^2T$, we establish spectral sum rules of quarks for strongly coupled QCD that respect Fermi-Dirac statistics as required by quantum mechanics. In sharp contrast to QED and weakly coupled QCD whose spectral functions consist of discontinuous zero-dimensional (poles) and one-dimensional (branch cuts) non-analytic contributions from real energy $p_0 \in \mathbb{R}$, the derived spectral function for strongly coupled quarks features continuous but non-analytic contributions from complex energy $p_0 \in \mathbb{C}$ that are two-dimensional in nature. In light of the novel sum rules, we uncover an intrinsic QCD transition between a three-mode phase at small coupling and a one-mode phase at large coupling. The transition is induced by the magnetic scale that generates a massless hydro-like mode with the genuine non-Abelian feature of positivity violation and serving as the Goldstone mode of the Lorentz symmetry breaking. The thermal mass serves as an order parameter of the transition and vanishes at large coupling in line with phenomenological predictions from Dyson-Schwinger equations and gauge/gravity duality. This result provides novel insights into the mechanism of the QCD deconfinement transition.</description>

      <title>Flavour-Dependent Chemical Freeze-Out of Light Nuclei in Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the production of light nuclei in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 7.7 - 200 GeV and Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 2.76 and 5.02 TeV within a flavour-dependent freeze-out framework, assuming different flavoured hadrons undergo separate chemical freeze-out. Using the Thermal-FIST package, thermal parameters extracted from fits to various sets of hadron yields, including and excluding light nuclei, are used to calculate the ratios of the yields of light nuclei, namely, $d/p$, $\bar{d}/\bar{p}$, $t/p$, and $t/d$. A comparison with data from the STAR and ALICE collaborations shows that a sequential freeze-out scenario provides a better description of light nuclei yield ratios than the traditional single freeze-out approach. These results suggest the flavour-dependent chemical freeze-out for final state light-nuclei production persists in heavy-ion collisions at both RHIC and LHC energies.</description>

      <title>Possible scenario of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in the instanton liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on simulations of the interacting instanton liquid model (IILM) with three flavor quarks, we compute the free energy density of the QCD vacuum as a function of the quark condensate. We evaluate the second derivative of the free energy density with respect to the quark condensate at the origin. This evaluation makes us to examine whether chiral symmetry breaking in the IILM occurs in an anomaly-driven way. Such a breaking pattern of chiral symmetry has been proposed by a previous study to connect the QCD vacuum structure with the meson propoerties, such as the sigma meson mass. We also perform the quenched simulations, in which no dynamical quarks interact with instantons. This simulation helps us to understand the pattern of chiral symmetry brekaing in the IILM by comparing the full calculation results. We find that in the full IILM chiral symmetry is broken in anomaly-driven way, while for the quenched IILM chiral symmetry is broken in ordinary manner. From these results, we expect that chiral symmetry can be broken in anomaly-driven way even in the real QCD and in phenomena where chiral symmetry breaking plays a crucial role the anomaly effect may also play an important role.</description>

      <title>Response of superfluid fermions at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A consistent finite-temperature microscopic theory for the response of strongly coupled superfluid fermionic systems is formulated. We start from the general many-body Hamiltonian with the vacuum (bare) two-fermion interaction and derive the equation of motion (EOM) for the thermally averaged two-time two-fermion correlation function, which determines the spectrum of the system under study. The superfluidity is introduced via the Bogoliubov transformation of the fermionic field operators, and the entire formalism is carried out in the basis of Bogoliubov's quasiparticles, keeping the complete $4\times 4$ block matrix structure of the two-fermion EOM. Static and dynamical interaction kernels of the resulting EOM are discussed. The least correlated static kernel reproduces the known finite-temperature quasiparticle random phase approximation, while the dynamical kernel was previously largely unknown in the finite-temperature superfluid theory. The major focus is then placed on the latter kernel, which is completed and advanced to a factorized form, enabling a minimal truncation of the many-body problem with keeping important effects of emergent collectivity and mapping to the quasiparticle-vibration coupling (qPVC). As in the zero-temperature and non-superfluid cases, the qPVC can be associated with a new order parameter, qPVC vertex. In the thermal superfluid theory, the latter vertex as well as the components of the dynamical kernel acquire an extended form including thermally unblocked transition amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Emergence, Formation and Dynamics of Hot QCD Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this thesis, we make progress in two concrete directions in the vast landscape of hot QCD physics. The first one is quarkonium transport inside quark-gluon plasma (QGP), the high temperature phase of QCD. Over the past two decades it has been realized that a significant fraction of quarkonium suppression in high energy heavy ion collisions comes from dynamic dissociation and recombination processes, instead of static screening of the interaction potential as originally proposed by Matsui and Satz. Our contribution is the formulation of the precise correlation functions in QCD at finite temperature that describe the dissociation and recombination processes of heavy quarkonium in QGP, as well as their calculation in weakly coupled QCD and strongly coupled $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. We also formulate the Euclidean version of these correlation functions so that they may be calculated using Lattice QCD techniques. The second contribution we make is the development of tools to understand the process of hydrodynamization in QCD kinetic theory and their application to a simplified description where only a subset of the QCD scattering mechanisms are included. By doing this, we learn that the process of hydrodynamization in this theory, and specifically, how memory of the initial condition is lost, follows the recently proposed Adiabatic Hydrodynamization scenario. Concretely, hydrodynamization proceeds through a sequential process in which a monotonously shrinking set of low-energy states dominate the dynamics, where the opening of an energy gap relative to the ground state(s) signals the start of each stage of this process. The hydrodynamic attractor is reached when only one low-energy state remains as the ground state, and the system approaches local thermal equilibrium following the adiabatic evolution of this low-energy state.</description>

      <title>Constraining the $f$-mode oscillations frequency in Neutron Stars through Universal Relations in the realm of Energy-Momentum Squared Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars (NSs), superdense objects with exceptionally strong gravitational fields, provide an ideal laboratory for probing general relativity (GR) in the high-curvature regime. They also present an exciting opportunity to explore new gravitational physics beyond the traditional framework of GR. Thus, investigating alternative theories of gravity in the context of superdense stars is intriguing and essential for advancing our understanding of gravitational phenomena in extreme environments. Energy-Momentum Squared Gravity (EMSG) is a modified theory of gravity that extends GR by including nonlinear terms involving the energy-momentum tensor $T_{\mu \nu}$. This study examines the effects of EMSG on the properties and behaviour of NSs by varying the free parameter $\alpha$. The hydrostatic equilibrium equations in the EMSG framework are derived and solved numerically to obtain mass-radius relations for soft, stiff, and intermediate equations of state (EOS). Observational measurements of NS masses and radii are used to constrain the fundamental-mode ($f$-mode) oscillation frequency through its universal relation with the tidal Love number and compactness. Results indicate that the Stiff EOS undergoes a phase transition at the highest energy densities and pressures, followed by the Intermediate and Soft EOSs, highlighting the distinctive characteristics of these models. Additionally, the study explores the impact of EOS choice on the sound speed profile of NSs, reaffirming the physical validity of the models across varying $\alpha$ values.</description>

Abstract: We study the femtoscopic correlation functions of meson-baryon pairs in the strangeness $S=-1$ sector, employing unitarized s-wave scattering amplitudes derived from the chiral Lagrangian up to next-to-leading order. For the first time, we deliver predictions on the $\pi^-\Lambda$ and $K^+\Xi^-$ correlation functions which are feasible to be measured at the Large Hadron Collider. We also demonstrate that the employed model is perfectly capable of reproducing the $K^-p$ correlation function data measured by the same collaboration, without the need to modify the coupling strength to the $\bar{K}^0n$ channel, as has been recently suggested. In all cases, the effects of the source size on the correlation are tested. In addition, we present detailed analysis of the different coupled-channel contributions, together with the quantification of the relative relevance of the different terms in the interaction.</description>

      <title>Time modulation of weak nuclear decays as a probe of axion dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the time modulation of weak nuclear decays as a method to probe axion dark matter. To this end, we develop a theoretical framework to compute the $\theta$-dependence of weak nuclear decays, including electron capture and $\beta$ decay, which enables us to predict the time variation of weak radioactivity in response to an oscillating axion dark matter background. As an application, we recast old data sets, from the weak nuclear decays of ${^{40}\text{K}}$ and ${^{137}\text{Cs}}$ taken at the underground Gran Sasso Laboratory, in order to set constraints on the axion decay constant, specifically in the axion mass range from few $10^{-23}\;$eV up to $10^{-19}\;$eV. We finally propose a new measurement at the Gran Sasso Laboratory, based on the weak nuclear decay of ${^{40}\text{K}}$ via electron capture, in order to explore even shorter timescales, thus reaching sensitivities to axion masses up to $10^{-9}\;$eV.</description>

      <title>Bulk viscosity of nuclear matter with pions in the neutrino-trapped regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18890v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work [B. Fore and S. Reddy, Phys. Rev. C 101 035809 (2020)] has shown that the population of thermal pions could modify the equation of state and transport properties of hot and dense neutron-rich matter and introduce new reaction pathways to change the proton fraction. In this article we study their impact on the bulk viscosity of dense matter, focusing on the neutrino-trapped regime that would be realized in neutron star mergers and supernovae. We find that the presence of a thermal population of pions alters the bulk viscosity by modifying the EoS (via the susceptibilities) and by providing new reaction pathways to achieve beta-equilibrium. In neutron star merger conditions, the bulk viscosity in neutrino-trapped $npe\mu$ matter (without pions) has its peak at temperatures of at most a couple MeV and is quite small at temperatures of tens of MeV. We find that thermal pions enhance the low-temperature peak of the bulk viscosity by a factor of a few and shift it to slightly lower temperatures. At higher temperatures, where the pion abundance is large but the bulk viscosity is traditionally small, pions can increase the bulk viscosity by an order of magnitude or more, although it is still orders of magnitude smaller than its peak value.</description>

      <title>Coupled-Cluster Calculations of Infinite Nuclear Matter in the Complete Basis Limit Using Bayesian Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18234v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Infinite nuclear matter provides valuable insights into the behavior of nuclear systems and aids our understanding of atomic nuclei and large-scale stellar objects such as neutron stars. However, partly due to the large basis needed to converge the system's binding energy, size-extensive methods such as coupled-cluster theory struggle with long computational run times, even using the nation's largest high-performance computing facilities. This research introduces a novel approach to the problem. We propose using a machine learning method to predict the coupled-cluster energies of infinite matter systems in the complete basis limit, leveraging only data collected using smaller basis sets. This method promises to deliver high-accuracy results with significantly reduced run times. The sequential regression extrapolation (SRE) algorithm, based on Gaussian processes, was created to perform these extrapolations. By combining Bayesian machine learning with a unique method of formatting the training data, we can create a powerful extrapolator that can make accurate predictions given very little data. The SRE algorithm successfully predicted the CCD(T) energies for pure neutron matter across six densities near nuclear saturation density, with an average error of 0.0083 MeV/N. The algorithm achieved an average error of 0.038 MeV/A for symmetric nuclear matter. These predictions were made with a time savings of 83.8 node hours for pure neutron matter and 284 node hours for symmetric nuclear matter. Additionally, the symmetry energy at these six densities was predicted with an average error of 0.031 MeV/A and a total time savings of 368 node hours compared to the traditional converged coupled-cluster calculations performed without the SRE algorithm.</description>

Abstract: The gravitational form factors of the deuteron are calculated in the framework of non-relativistic chiral effective field theory. Non-relativistic reduction of the matrix element of the energy-momentum tensor operator for spin-one systems is worked out, and the gravitational form factors of the deuteron are extracted from the three-point function of the energy-momentum tensor using the LSZ reduction formula. The obtained form factors are compared to results of model calculations available in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1809.08752v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The limited statistics of the available (anti)neutrino-hydrogen (H) interactions has been a longstanding impediment for high-energy neutrino physics. We discuss a practical way to achieve accurate (anti)neutrino-hydrogen measurements, addressing the principal limitations of earlier experiments. Interactions on hydrogen are extracted by subtracting measurements on thin dedicated graphite (pure C) and polypropylene (CH$_2$) targets within a highly segmented low-density detector. A kinematic selection is used to increase the purities to 80-95\% before subtraction. A statistics of ${\cal O}(10^6)$ can be realistically achieved in modern neutrino beams for the various $\nu(\bar \nu)$-H event topologies. The availability of such samples would allow a precise determination of neutrino and antineutrino fluxes, as well as to directly constrain nuclear effects from a comparison with corresponding measurements on heavy materials within the same detector. The (anti)neutrino fluxes and the nuclear smearing are typically the leading sources of systematic uncertainties in long-baseline oscillation experiments. (Anti)neutrino-hydrogen interactions also provide an ideal tool for a wide range of precision tests of fundamental interactions.</description>

Abstract: Electron mass is known to modify at finite temperatures and densities. Weak nuclear processes have a great impact on electron mass which modifies in a statistical background. We demonstrate how the temperature change in electron mass is associated with beta decay in the early universe. Its precise contributions to the abundance of light elements in the early universe describe some of the details about nucleosynthesis. We employ the calculational scheme of the renormalization of QED to precisely compute the temperature dependence of electron mass during the nuclear processes. In this paper we precisely compute the concentration of electron and its mass change with temperature during nucleosynthesis and use it to describe the helium abundance, expansion rate and energy density of the universe during nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <title>Estimating Longitudinal Polarization of $\Lambda$ and $\bar{\Lambda}$ Hyperons at Relativistic Energies using Hydrodynamic and Transport models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The global and local polarization measurements of $\Lambda$ ($\bar{\Lambda}$) hyperons by STAR and ALICE Collaborations open up an immense interest in investigating the polarization dynamics in heavy-ion collisions. Recent studies suggest the transverse component of the vorticity field is responsible for the global spin polarization, while the longitudinal component of the vorticity field accounts for the local polarization. The local polarization of $\Lambda$-hyperons arises due to the anisotropic flows in the transverse plane, indicating a quadrupole pattern of the longitudinal vorticity along the beam direction. We derive a simple solution relating the longitudinal mean spin vector with the second-order anisotropic flow coefficient due to the thermal shear for an ideal uncharged fluid in a longitudinal boost invariant scenario. The present study focuses on the local (longitudinal) polarization of $\Lambda$ and $\bar{\Lambda}$ in Au$+$Au and Pb$+$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV and 5.02 TeV, respectively. Further, we explore the azimuthal angle, centrality, and transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) dependence study of longitudinal polarization using hydrodynamic and transport models. All these models predict a maximum longitudinal polarization in mid-central collisions around 30-50 \% centrality at $p_{\rm T} \approx$ 2.0 - 3.0 GeV/c. These findings on longitudinal polarization advocate the existence of a thermal medium in non-central heavy-ion collisions.</description>

Abstract: In the limit of vanishing up, down and strange quark masses, QCD exhibits a chiral symmetry. This symmetry is broken spontaneously to its vector subgroup, giving rise to Goldstone bosons. These acquire a small mass through the explicit chiral symmetry breaking for non-vanishing quark masses. The consequences of these broken symmetries can be investigated in a suitably tailored effective field theory called chiral pertubation theory. It admits a perturbative expansion in the external momenta and the Goldstone boson masses and can be systematically analyzed in terms of a loop expansion. The appearing ultraviolet divergences in loop diagrams can be dealt with order-by-order through the Goldstone boson contact interactions. Matter fields like the lowest-lying baryons can also included, leading to a rich and testable phenomenology of low-energy QCD.</description>
