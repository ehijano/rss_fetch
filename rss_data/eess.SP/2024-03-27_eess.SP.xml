      <title>On the Intersection of Signal Processing and Machine Learning: A Use Case-Driven Analysis Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in sensing, measurement, and computing technologies have significantly expanded the potential for signal-based applications, leveraging the synergy between signal processing and Machine Learning (ML) to improve both performance and reliability. This fusion represents a critical point in the evolution of signal-based systems, highlighting the need to bridge the existing knowledge gap between these two interdisciplinary fields. Despite many attempts in the existing literature to bridge this gap, most are limited to specific applications and focus mainly on feature extraction, often assuming extensive prior knowledge in signal processing. This assumption creates a significant obstacle for a wide range of readers. To address these challenges, this paper takes an integrated article approach. It begins with a detailed tutorial on the fundamentals of signal processing, providing the reader with the necessary background knowledge. Following this, it explores the key stages of a standard signal processing-based ML pipeline, offering an in-depth review of feature extraction techniques, their inherent challenges, and solutions. Differing from existing literature, this work offers an application-independent review and introduces a novel classification taxonomy for feature extraction techniques. Furthermore, it aims at linking theoretical concepts with practical applications, and demonstrates this through two specific use cases: a spectral-based method for condition monitoring of rolling bearings and a wavelet energy analysis for epilepsy detection using EEG signals. In addition to theoretical contributions, this work promotes a collaborative research culture by providing a public repository of relevant Python and MATLAB signal processing codes. This effort is intended to support collaborative research efforts and ensure the reproducibility of the results presented.</description>

      <title>Physics-compliant diagonal representation of beyond-diagonal RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-compliant models of RIS-parametrized channels assign a load-terminated port to each RIS element. For conventional diagonal RIS (D-RIS), each auxiliary port is terminated by its own independent and individually tunable load (i.e., independent of the other auxiliary ports). For beyond-diagonal RIS (BD-RIS), the auxiliary ports are terminated by a tunable load circuit which couples the auxiliary ports to each other. Here, we point out that a physics-compliant model of the load circuit of a BD-RIS takes the same form as a physics-compliant model of a D-RIS-parametrized radio environment: a multi-port network with a subset of ports terminated by individually tunable loads (independent of each other). Consequently, we recognize that a BD-RIS-parametrized radio environment can be understood as a multi-port cascade network (i.e., the cascade of radio environment with load circuit) terminated by individually tunable loads (independent of each other). Hence, the BD-RIS problem can be mapped into the original D-RIS problem by replacing the radio environment with the cascade of radio environment and load circuit. The insight that BD-RIS can be physics-compliantly analyzed with the conventional D-RIS formalism implies that (i) the same optimization protocols as for D-RIS can be used for the BD-RIS case, and (ii) it is unclear if existing comparisons between BD-RIS and D-RIS are fair because for a fixed number of RIS elements, a BD-RIS has usually more tunable lumped elements.</description>

      <title>On the Impact of Random Node Sampling on Adaptive Diffusion Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the effects of random sampling on adaptive diffusion networks. These networks consist in a collection of nodes that can measure and process data, and that can communicate with each other to pursue a common goal of estimating an unknown system. In particular, we consider in our theoretical analysis the diffusion least-mean-squares algorithm in a scenario in which the nodes are randomly sampled. Hence, each node may or may not adapt its local estimate at a certain iteration. Our model shows that, if the nodes cooperate, a reduction in the sampling probability leads to a slight decrease in the steady-state Network Mean-Square Deviation (NMSD), assuming that the environment is stationary and that all other parameters of the algorithm are kept fixed. Furthermore, under certain circumstances, this can also ensure the stability of the algorithm in situations in which it would otherwise be unstable. Although counter-intuitive, our findings are backed by simulation results, which match the theoretical curves well.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Learning for Joint Beamforming Design in RIS-aided ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is critical to design efficient beamforming in reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems for enhancing spectrum utilization. However, conventional methods often have limitations, either incurring high computational complexity due to iterative algorithms or sacrificing performance when using heuristic methods. To achieve both low complexity and high spectrum efficiency, an unsupervised learning-based beamforming design is proposed in this work. We tailor image-shaped channel samples and develop an ISAC beamforming neural network (IBF-Net) model for beamforming. By leveraging unsupervised learning, the loss function incorporates key performance metrics like sensing and communication channel correlation and sensing channel gain, eliminating the need of labeling. Simulations show that the proposed method achieves competitive performance compared to benchmarks while significantly reduces computational complexity.</description>

      <title>A TDD Distributed MIMO Testbed Using a 1-Bit Radio-Over-Fiber Fronthaul Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the uplink and downlink of a time-division duplex distributed multiple-input multiple-output (D-MIMO) testbed, based on a 1-bit radio-over-fiber architecture, which is low-cost and scalable. The proposed architecture involves a central unit (CU) that is equipped with 1-bit digital-to-analog and analog-to-digital converters, operating at 10 GS/s. The CU is connected to multiple single-antenna remote radio heads (RRHs) via optical fibers, over which a binary RF waveform is transmitted. In the uplink, a binary RF waveform is generated at the RRHs by a comparator, whose inputs are the received RF signal and a suitably designed dither signal. In the downlink, a binary RF waveform is generated at the CU via bandpass sigma-delta modulation. Our measurement results show that low error-vector magnitude (EVM) can be achieved in both the uplink and the downlink, despite 1-bit sampling at the CU. Specifically, for point-to-point over-cable transmission between a single user equipment (UE) and a CU equipped with a single RRH, we report, for a 10 MBd signal using single-carrier 16QAM modulation, an EVM of 3.3% in the downlink, and of 4.5% in the uplink. We then consider a CU connected to 3 RRHs serving over the air 2 UEs, and show that, after over-the-air reciprocity calibration, a downlink zero-forcing precoder designed on the basis of uplink channel estimates at the CU, achieves an EVM of 6.4% and 10.9% at UE 1 and UE 2, respectively. Finally, we investigate the ability of the proposed architecture to support orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) waveforms, and its robustness against both in-band and out-of-band interference.</description>

      <title>Channel-Adaptive Pilot Design for FDD-MIMO Systems Utilizing Gaussian Mixture Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose to utilize Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) to design pilots for downlink (DL) channel estimation in frequency division duplex (FDD) systems. The GMM captures prior information during training that is leveraged to design a codebook of pilot matrices in an initial offline phase. Once shared with the mobile terminal (MT), the GMM is utilized to determine a feedback index at the MT in the online phase. This index selects a pilot matrix from a codebook, eliminating the need for online pilot optimization. The GMM is further used for DL channel estimation at the MT via observation-dependent linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) filters, parametrized by the GMM. The analytic representation of the GMM allows adaptation to any signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) level and pilot configuration without re-training. With extensive simulations, we demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed GMM-based pilot scheme compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Waveform Design for Joint Communication and SAR Imaging Under Random Signaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging systems typically employ deterministic signal designs, which lack the capability to convey communication information and are thus not suitable for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) scenarios. In this letter, we propose a joint communication and SAR imaging (JCASAR) system based on orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) signal with cyclic prefix (CP), which is capable of reconstructing the target profile while serving a communication user. In contrast to traditional matched filters, we propose a least squares (LS) estimator for range profiling. Then the SAR image is obtained followed by range cell migration correction (RCMC) and azimuth processing. By minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) of the proposed LS estimator, we investigate the optimal waveform design for SAR imaging, and JCASAR under random signaling, where power allocation strategies are conceived for Gaussian-distributed ISAC signals, in an effort to strike a flexible performance tradeoff between the communication and SAR imaging tasks. Numerical results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed ISAC waveform design for JCASAR systems.</description>

      <title>Leveraging A Variety of Anchors in Cellular Network for Ubiquitous Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has recently attracted tremendous attention from both academia and industry, being envisioned as a key part of the standards for the sixth-generation (6G) cellular network. A key challenge of 6G-oriented ISAC lies in how to perform ubiquitous sensing based on the communication signals and devices. Previous works have made great progresses on studying the signal waveform design that leads to optimal communication-sensing performance tradeoff. In this article, we aim to focus on issues arising from the exploitation of the communication devices for sensing in 6G network. Particularly, we will discuss about how to leverage various nodes available in the cellular network as anchors to perform ubiquitous sensing. On one hand, the base stations (BSs) will be the most important anchors in the future 6G ISAC network, since they can generate/process radio signals with high range/angle resolutions, and their positions are precisely known. Correspondingly, we will first study the BS-based sensing technique. On the other hand, the BSs alone may not enable ubiquitous sensing, since they cannot cover all the places with strong line-of-sight (LOS) links. This motivates us to investigate the possibility of using other nodes that are with higher density in the network to act as the anchors. Along this line, we are interested in two types of new anchors - user equipments (UEs) and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). This paper will shed light on the opportunities and challenges brought by UE-assisted sensing and RIS-assisted sensing. Our goal is to devise a novel 6G-oriented sensing architecture where BSs, UEs, and RISs can work together to provide ubiquitous sensing services.</description>

      <title>Improving the Spatial Correlation Characteristics of Antenna Arrays using Linear Operators and Wide-band Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of wireless communication channels at the mmWave, sub-THz and THz bands gives rise to difficulties in the construction of antenna arrays due to the small maximum inter-element spacing constraints at these frequencies. Arrays with uniform spacing greater than half the wavelength for a certain carrier frequency exhibit aliasing side-lobes in the angular domain, prohibiting non-ambiguous estimates of a propagating wave-front's angle of arrival.
  In this paper, we present how wide-band modelling of the array response is useful in mitigating this spatial aliasing effect. This approach aims to reduce the grating lobes by exploiting the angle- and frequency-dependent phase-shifts observed in the response of the array to a planar wave-front travelling across it.
  Furthermore, we propose a method by which the spatial correlation characteristics of an array operating at 33 GHz carrier frequency with an instantaneous bandwidth of 1 GHz can be improved such that the angular-domain side-lobes are reduced by 5-10 dB. This method, applicable to arbitrary antenna array manifolds, makes use of a linear operator that is applied to the base-band samples of the channel transfer function measured in space and frequency domains. By means of synthetically simulated arrays, we show that when operating with a bandwidth of 1 GHz, the use of a derived linear operator applied to the array output results in the spatial correlation characteristics approaching those of the array operating at a bandwidth of 12 GHz. Hence, non-ambiguous angle estimates can be obtained in the field without the use of expensive high-bandwidth RF front-end components.</description>

      <title>Resolution Limit of Single-Photon LiDAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-photon Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) systems are often equipped with an array of detectors for improved spatial resolution and sensing speed. However, given a fixed amount of flux produced by the laser transmitter across the scene, the per-pixel Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) will decrease when more pixels are packed in a unit space. This presents a fundamental trade-off between the spatial resolution of the sensor array and the SNR received at each pixel. Theoretical characterization of this fundamental limit is explored. By deriving the photon arrival statistics and introducing a series of new approximation techniques, the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of the maximum-likelihood estimator of the time delay is derived. The theoretical predictions align well with simulations and real data.</description>

      <title>Environment Reconstruction based on Multi-User Selection and Multi-Modal Fusion in ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) has been deemed as a key technology for the sixth generation (6G) wireless communications systems. In this paper, we explore the inherent clustered nature of wireless users and design a multi-user based environment reconstruction scheme. Specifically, we first select users based on the estimation precision of channel's multipath, including the line-of-sight (LOS) and the non-line-of-sight (NLOS) paths, to enhance the accuracy of environment reconstruction. Then, we develop a fusion strategy that merges communications signalling with camera image to increase the accuracy and robustness of environment reconstruction. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve a remarkable sensing accuracy of centimeter level, which is about 17 times better than the scheme without user selection. Meanwhile, the fusion of communications data and vision data leads to a threefold accuracy improvement over the image only method, especially under challenging weather conditions like raining and snowing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a reciprocity calibration method for dual-antenna repeaters in wireless networks. The method uses bi-directional measurements between two network nodes, A and B, where for each bi-directional measurement, the repeaters are configured in different states. The nodes A and B could be two access points in a distributed MIMO system, or they could be a base station and a mobile user terminal, for example. From the calibration measurements, the differences between the repeaters' forward and reverse gains are estimated. The repeaters are then (re-)configured to compensate for these differences such that the repeaters appear, transparently to the network, as reciprocal components of the propagation environment, enabling reciprocity-based beamforming in the network.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Indoor and Outdoor THz Communications with Beyond Diagonal-IRS: Optimization and Performance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the application of Beyond Diagonal Intelligent Reflective Surface (BD-IRS) to enhance THz downlink communication systems, operating in a hybrid: reflective and transmissive mode, to simultaneously provide services to indoor and outdoor users. We propose an optimization framework that jointly optimizes the beamforming vectors and phase shifts in the hybrid reflective/transmissive mode, aiming to maximize the system sum rate. To tackle the challenges in solving the joint design problem, we employ the conjugate gradient method and propose an iterative algorithm that successively optimizes the hybrid beamforming vectors and the phase shifts. Through comprehensive numerical simulations, our findings demonstrate a significant improvement in rate when compared to existing benchmark schemes, including time- and frequency-divided approaches, by approximately $30.5\%$ and $70.28\%$ respectively. This underscores the significant influence of IRS elements on system performance relative to that of base station antennas, highlighting their pivotal role in advancing the communication system efficacy.</description>

      <title>PAVITS: Exploring Prosody-aware VITS for End-to-End Emotional Voice Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose Prosody-aware VITS (PAVITS) for emotional voice conversion (EVC), aiming to achieve two major objectives of EVC: high content naturalness and high emotional naturalness, which are crucial for meeting the demands of human perception. To improve the content naturalness of converted audio, we have developed an end-to-end EVC architecture inspired by the high audio quality of VITS. By seamlessly integrating an acoustic converter and vocoder, we effectively address the common issue of mismatch between emotional prosody training and run-time conversion that is prevalent in existing EVC models. To further enhance the emotional naturalness, we introduce an emotion descriptor to model the subtle prosody variations of different speech emotions. Additionally, we propose a prosody predictor, which predicts prosody features from text based on the provided emotion label. Notably, we introduce a prosody alignment loss to establish a connection between latent prosody features from two distinct modalities, ensuring effective training. Experimental results show that the performance of PAVITS is superior to the state-of-the-art EVC methods. Speech Samples are available at https://jeremychee4.github.io/pavits4EVC/ .</description>

Abstract: In a great number of tasks in science and engineering, the goal is to infer an unknown image from a small number of measurements collected from a known forward model describing certain sensing or imaging modality. Due to resource constraints, this task is often extremely ill-posed, which necessitates the adoption of expressive prior information to regularize the solution space. Score-based diffusion models, due to its impressive empirical success, have emerged as an appealing candidate of an expressive prior in image reconstruction. In order to accommodate diverse tasks at once, it is of great interest to develop efficient, consistent and robust algorithms that incorporate {\em unconditional} score functions of an image prior distribution in conjunction with flexible choices of forward models.
  This work develops an algorithmic framework for employing score-based diffusion models as an expressive data prior in general nonlinear inverse problems. Motivated by the plug-and-play framework in the imaging community, we introduce a diffusion plug-and-play method (\textsf{DPnP}) that alternatively calls two samplers, a proximal consistency sampler based solely on the likelihood function of the forward model, and a denoising diffusion sampler based solely on the score functions of the image prior. The key insight is that denoising under white Gaussian noise can be solved {\em rigorously} via both stochastic (i.e., DDPM-type) and deterministic (i.e., DDIM-type) samplers using the unconditional score functions. We establish both asymptotic and non-asymptotic performance guarantees of \textsf{DPnP}, and provide numerical experiments to illustrate its promise in solving both linear and nonlinear image reconstruction tasks. To the best of our knowledge, \textsf{DPnP} is the first provably-robust posterior sampling method for nonlinear inverse problems using unconditional diffusion priors.</description>

      <title>Enhancing UAV Security Through Zero Trust Architecture: An Advanced Deep Learning and Explainable AI Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the dynamic and ever-changing domain of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), the utmost importance lies in guaranteeing resilient and lucid security measures. This study highlights the necessity of implementing a Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) to enhance the security of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), hence departing from conventional perimeter defences that may expose vulnerabilities. The Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) paradigm requires a rigorous and continuous process of authenticating all network entities and communications. The accuracy of our methodology in detecting and identifying unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is 84.59\%. This is achieved by utilizing Radio Frequency (RF) signals within a Deep Learning framework, a unique method. Precise identification is crucial in Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA), as it determines network access. In addition, the use of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) tools such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) contributes to the improvement of the model's transparency and interpretability. Adherence to Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) standards guarantees that the classifications of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are verifiable and comprehensible, enhancing security within the UAV field.</description>

      <title>Efficient generation of realistic guided wave signals for reliability estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Across non-destructive testing (NDT) and structural health monitoring (SHM), accurate knowledge of the systems' reliability for detecting defects, such as Probability of Detection (POD) analysis is essential to enabling widespread adoption. Traditionally this relies on access to extensive experimental data to cover all critical areas of the parametric space, which becomes expensive, and heavily undermines the benefit such systems bring. In response to these challenges, reliability estimation based on numerical simulation emerges as a practical solution, offering enhanced efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Nevertheless, precise reliability estimation demands that the simulated data faithfully represents the real-world performance. In this context, a numerical framework tailored to generate realistic signals for reliability estimation purposes is presented here, focusing on the application of guided wave SHM for pipe monitoring. It specifically incorporates key characteristics of real signals: random noise and coherent noise caused by the imbalance in transducer performance within guided wave monitoring systems. The effectiveness of our proposed methodology is demonstrated through a comprehensive comparative analysis between simulation-generated signals and experimental signals both individually and statistically. Furthermore, to assess the reliability of a guided wave system in terms of the inspection range for pipe monitoring, a series of POD analyses using simulation-generated data were conducted. The comparison of POD curves derived from ideal and realistic simulation data underscores the necessity of considering coherent noise for accurate POD curve calculations. Moreover, the POD analysis based on realistic simulation-generated data provides a quantitative estimation of the inspection range with more details compared to the current industry practice.</description>

      <title>6D Movable Antenna Enhanced Wireless Network Via Discrete Position and Rotation Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) is an effective approach to improve wireless network capacity by adjusting the 3D positions and 3D rotations of distributed antenna surfaces based on the users' spatial distribution and statistical channel information. Although continuously positioning/rotating 6DMA surfaces can achieve the greatest flexibility and thus the highest capacity improvement, it is difficult to implement due to the discrete movement constraints of practical stepper motors. Thus, in this paper, we consider a 6DMA-aided base station (BS) with only a finite number of possible discrete positions and rotations for the 6DMA surfaces. We aim to maximize the average network capacity for random numbers of users at random locations by jointly optimizing the 3D positions and 3D rotations of multiple 6DMA surfaces at the BS subject to discrete movement constraints. In particular, we consider the practical cases with and without statistical channel knowledge of the users, and propose corresponding offline and online optimization algorithms, by leveraging the Monte Carlo and conditional sample mean (CSM) methods, respectively. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of our proposed offline and online algorithms for discrete position/rotation optimization of 6DMA surfaces as compared to various benchmark schemes with fixed-position antennas (FPAs) and 6DMAs with limited movability. It is shown that 6DMA-BS can significantly enhance wireless network capacity, even under discrete position/rotation constraints, by exploiting the spatial distribution characteristics of the users.</description>

      <title>Latency-Aware Generative Semantic Communications with Pre-Trained Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative foundation AI models have recently shown great success in synthesizing natural signals with high perceptual quality using only textual prompts and conditioning signals to guide the generation process. This enables semantic communications at extremely low data rates in future wireless networks. In this paper, we develop a latency-aware semantic communications framework with pre-trained generative models. The transmitter performs multi-modal semantic decomposition on the input signal and transmits each semantic stream with the appropriate coding and communication schemes based on the intent. For the prompt, we adopt a re-transmission-based scheme to ensure reliable transmission, and for the other semantic modalities we use an adaptive modulation/coding scheme to achieve robustness to the changing wireless channel. Furthermore, we design a semantic and latency-aware scheme to allocate transmission power to different semantic modalities based on their importance subjected to semantic quality constraints. At the receiver, a pre-trained generative model synthesizes a high fidelity signal using the received multi-stream semantics. Simulation results demonstrate ultra-low-rate, low-latency, and channel-adaptive semantic communications.</description>

      <title>Cache-Enabled Millimetre-Wave Fluid Antenna Systems: Modeling and Performance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter investigates the performance of content caching in a heterogeneous cellular network (HetNet) consisting of fluid antenna system (FAS)-equipped mobile users (MUs) and millimeter-wave (mm-wave) single-antenna small base stations (SBSs), distributed according to the independent homogeneous Poisson point processes (HPPP). In particular, it is assumed that the most popular contents are cached in the SBSs to serve the FAS-equipped MUs requests. To assess the system performance, we derive compact expressions for the successful content delivery probability (SCDP) and the content delivery delay (CDD) using the Gauss-Laguerre quadrature technique. Our numerical results show that the performance of cache-enabled mm-wave HetNets can be greatly improved, when the FAS is utilized at the MUs instead of traditional fixed-antenna system deployment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Directional motion towards a specified destination is a common occurrence in physical processes and human societal activities. Utilizing this prior information can significantly improve the control and predictive performance of system models. This paper primarily focuses on reconstructing linear dynamic system models based on destination constraints in the set-valued framework. We treat destination constraints as inherent information in the state evolution process and employ convex optimization techniques to construct a coherent and robust state model. This refined model effectively captures the impact of destination constraints on the state evolution at each time step. Furthermore, we design an optimal weight matrix for the reconstructed model to ensure smoother and more natural trajectories of state evolution. We also analyze the theoretical guarantee of optimality for this weight matrix and the properties of the reconstructed model. Finally, simulation experiments verify that the reconstructed model has significant advantages over the unconstrained and unoptimized weighted models and constrains the evolution of state trajectories with different starting and ending points.</description>

      <title>FaultGuard: A Generative Approach to Resilient Fault Prediction in Smart Electrical Grids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting and classifying faults in electricity networks is crucial for uninterrupted provision and keeping maintenance costs at a minimum. Thanks to the advancements in the field provided by the smart grid, several data-driven approaches have been proposed in the literature to tackle fault prediction tasks. Implementing these systems brought several improvements, such as optimal energy consumption and quick restoration. Thus, they have become an essential component of the smart grid. However, the robustness and security of these systems against adversarial attacks have not yet been extensively investigated. These attacks can impair the whole grid and cause additional damage to the infrastructure, deceiving fault detection systems and disrupting restoration. In this paper, we present FaultGuard, the first framework for fault type and zone classification resilient to adversarial attacks. To ensure the security of our system, we employ an Anomaly Detection System (ADS) leveraging a novel Generative Adversarial Network training layer to identify attacks. Furthermore, we propose a low-complexity fault prediction model and an online adversarial training technique to enhance robustness. We comprehensively evaluate the framework's performance against various adversarial attacks using the IEEE13-AdvAttack dataset, which constitutes the state-of-the-art for resilient fault prediction benchmarking. Our model outclasses the state-of-the-art even without considering adversaries, with an accuracy of up to 0.958. Furthermore, our ADS shows attack detection capabilities with an accuracy of up to 1.000. Finally, we demonstrate how our novel training layers drastically increase performances across the whole framework, with a mean increase of 154% in ADS accuracy and 118% in model accuracy.</description>

      <title>Robust Analysis of Full-Duplex Two-Way Space Shift Keying With RIS Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted index modulation system schemes are considered a promising technology for sixth-generation (6G) wireless communication systems, which can enhance various system capabilities such as coverage and reliability. However, obtaining perfect channel state information (CSI) is challenging due to the lack of a radio frequency chain in RIS. In this paper, we investigate the RIS-assisted full-duplex (FD) two-way space shift keying (SSK) system under imperfect CSI, where the signal emissions are augmented by deploying RISs in the vicinity of two FD users. The maximum likelihood detector is utilized to recover the transmit antenna index. With this in mind, we derive closed-form average bit error probability (ABEP) expression based on the Gaussian-Chebyshev quadrature (GCQ) method and provide the upper bound and asymptotic ABEP expressions in the presence of channel estimation errors. To gain more insights, we also derive the outage probability and provide the throughput of the proposed scheme with imperfect CSI. The correctness of the analytical derivation results is confirmed via Monte Carlo simulations. It is demonstrated that increasing the number of elements of RIS can significantly improve the ABEP performance of the FD system over the half-duplex (HD) system. Furthermore, in the high SNR region, the ABEP performance of the FD system is better than that of the HD system.</description>

      <title>Synthesizing Soundscapes: Leveraging Text-to-Audio Models for Environmental Sound Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the past few years, text-to-audio models have emerged as a significant advancement in automatic audio gener- ation. Although they represent impressive technological progress, the effectiveness of their use in the development of audio applications remains uncertain. This paper aims to investigate these aspects, specifically focusing on the task of classification of environmental sounds. This study analyzes the performance of two different environmental classification systems when data generated from text-to-audio models is used for training. Two cases are considered: a) when the training dataset is augmented by data coming from two different text-to-audio models; and b) when the training dataset consists solely of synthetic audio generated. In both cases, the performance of the classification task is tested on real data. Results indicate that text-to-audio models are effective for dataset augmentation, whereas the performance of the models drops when relying on only generated audio.</description>

      <title>Scalable Non-Cartesian Magnetic Resonance Imaging with R2D2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new approach for non-Cartesian magnetic resonance image reconstruction. While unrolled architectures provide robustness via data-consistency layers, embedding measurement operators in Deep Neural Network (DNN) can become impractical at large scale. Alternative Plug-and-Play (PnP) approaches, where the denoising DNNs are blind to the measurement setting, are not affected by this limitation and have also proven effective, but their highly iterative nature also affects scalability. To address this scalability challenge, we leverage the "Residual-to-Residual DNN series for high-Dynamic range imaging (R2D2)" approach recently introduced in astronomical imaging. R2D2's reconstruction is formed as a series of residual images, iteratively estimated as outputs of DNNs taking the previous iteration's image estimate and associated data residual as inputs. The method can be interpreted as a learned version of the Matching Pursuit algorithm. We demonstrate R2D2 in simulation, considering radial k-space sampling acquisition sequences. Our preliminary results suggest that R2D2 achieves: (i) suboptimal performance compared to its unrolled incarnation R2D2-Net, which is however non-scalable due to the necessary embedding of NUFFT-based data-consistency layers; (ii) superior reconstruction quality to a scalable version of R2D2-Net embedding an FFT-based approximation for data consistency; (iii) superior reconstruction quality to PnP, while only requiring few iterations.</description>

      <title>Estimation of Complex Valued Laplacian Matrices for Topology Identification in Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of estimating a complex-valued Laplacian matrix with a focus on its application in the estimation of admittance matrices in power systems. The proposed approach is based on a constrained maximum likelihood estimator (CMLE) of the complex-valued Laplacian, which is formulated as an optimization problem with Laplacian and sparsity constraints. The complex-valued Laplacian is a symmetric, non-Hermitian matrix that exhibits a joint sparsity pattern between its real and imaginary parts. Thus, we present a group-sparse-based penalized log-likelihood approach for the Laplacian estimation. Leveraging the mixed \ell 2,1 norm relaxation of the joint sparsity constraint, we develop a new alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) estimation algorithm for the implementation of the CMLE of the Laplacian matrix under a linear Gaussian model. Next, we apply the proposed ADMM algorithms for the problem of estimating the admittance matrix under three commonly used measurement models that stem from Kirchhoff and Ohm laws, each with different assumptions and simplifications: 1) the nonlinear alternating current (AC) model; 2) the decoupled linear power flow (DLPF) model; and 3) the direct current (DC) model. The performance of the ADMM algorithm is evaluated using data from the IEEE 33-bus power system data under different settings. The numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing methods in terms of mean-squared-error (MSE) and F-score, thus providing a more accurate recovery of the admittance matrix.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02561v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The future of vehicular communication networks relies on mmWave massive multi-input-multi-output antenna arrays for intensive data transfer and massive vehicle access. However, reliable vehicle-to-infrastructure links require exact alignment between the narrow beams, which traditionally involves excessive signaling overhead. To address this issue, we propose a novel proactive beamforming scheme that integrates multi-modal sensing and communications via Multi-Modal Feature Fusion Network (MMFF-Net), which is composed of multiple neural network components with distinct functions. Unlike existing methods that rely solely on communication processing, our approach obtains comprehensive environmental features to improve beam alignment accuracy. We verify our scheme on the Vision-Wireless (ViWi) dataset, which we enriched with realistic vehicle drifting behavior. Our proposed MMFF-Net achieves more accurate and stable angle prediction, which in turn increases the achievable rates and reduces the communication system outage probability. Even in complex dynamic scenarios with adverse environment conditions, robust prediction results can be guaranteed, demonstrating the feasibility and practicality of the proposed proactive beamforming approach.</description>

      <title>On the Accuracy of Phase Extraction from a Known-Frequency Noisy Sinusoidal Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03935v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate phase extraction from sinusoidal signals is a crucial task in various signal processing applications. While prior research predominantly addresses the case of asynchronous sampling with unknown signal frequency, this study focuses on the more specific situation where synchronous sampling is possible, and the signal's frequency is known. In this framework, a comprehensive analysis of phase estimation accuracy in the presence of both additive and phase noises is presented. A closed-form expression for the asymptotic Probability Density Function (PDF) of the resulting phase estimator is presented, and validated by simulations that depict Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) trends in different noise scenarios. The latter estimator is asymptotically efficient, exhibiting fast convergence towards its Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB). Three distinct RMSE behaviours were identified depending on the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), sample count (N), and noise level: (i) saturation towards a random guess at low SNR values, (ii) linear decreasing relationship with the square roots of N and SNR at moderate noise levels, and (iii) saturation at high SNR towards a noise floor function of the phase noise level. By quantifying the impact of sample count, additive noise, and phase noise on phase estimation accuracy, this work provides valuable insights for designing systems that require precise phase extraction, such as phase-based fluorescence assays or system identification.</description>

Abstract: Digital twin channel (DTC) is the real-time mapping of a wireless channel from the physical world to the digital world, which is expected to provide significant performance enhancements for the sixth-generation (6G) air-interface design. In this work, we first define five evolution levels of channel twins with the progression of wireless communication. The fifth level, autonomous DTC, is elaborated with multi-dimensional factors such as methodology, characterization precision, and data category. Then, we provide detailed insights into the requirements and architecture of a complete DTC for 6G. Subsequently, a sensing-enhanced real-time channel prediction platform and experimental validations are exhibited. Finally, drawing from the vision of the 6G network, we explore the potential applications and the open issues in future DTC research.</description>

Abstract: IoT sensors are crucial for visualizing multidimensional and multimodal information and enabling future IT applications/services such as cyber-physical space, digital twins, autonomous driving, smart cities, and virtual/augmented reality (VR or AR). However, IoT sensors need to be battery-free to realistically manage and maintain the growing number of available sensing devices. Here, we provide a novel sensor design approach that employs metasurfaces to enable multifunctional sensing without requiring an external power source. Importantly, unlike existing metasurface-based sensors, our metasurfaces can sense multiple physical parameters even at a fixed frequency by breaking classic harmonic oscillations in the time domain, making the proposed sensors viable for usage with limited frequency resources. Moreover, we provide a method for predicting physical parameters using the machine learning-based approach of random forest regression. The sensing performance was confirmed by estimating temperature and light intensity, and excellent determination coefficients larger than 0.96 were achieved. Our study affords new opportunities for sensing multiple physical properties without relying on an external power source or needing multiple frequencies, which markedly simplifies and facilitates the design of next-generation wireless communication systems.</description>

Abstract: The importance of ground Mobile Robots (MRs) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) within the research community, industry, and society is growing fast. Many of these agents are nowadays equipped with communication systems that are, in some cases, essential to successfully achieve certain tasks. In this context, we have begun to witness the development of a new interdisciplinary research field at the intersection of robotics and communications. This research field has been boosted by the intention of integrating UAVs within the 5G and 6G communication networks. This research will undoubtedly lead to many important applications in the near future. Nevertheless, one of the main obstacles to the development of this research area is that most researchers address these problems by oversimplifying either the robotics or the communications aspect. This impedes the ability of reaching the full potential of this new interdisciplinary research area. In this tutorial, we present some of the modelling tools necessary to address problems involving both robotics and communication from an interdisciplinary perspective. As an illustrative example of such problems, we focus in this tutorial on the issue of communication-aware trajectory planning.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning Using Three-Operator ADMM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.04152v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as an instance of distributed machine learning paradigm that avoids the transmission of data generated on the users' side. Although data are not transmitted, edge devices have to deal with limited communication bandwidths, data heterogeneity, and straggler effects due to the limited computational resources of users' devices. A prominent approach to overcome such difficulties is FedADMM, which is based on the classical two-operator consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). The common assumption of FL algorithms, including FedADMM, is that they learn a global model using data only on the users' side and not on the edge server. However, in edge learning, the server is expected to be near the base station and have direct access to rich datasets. In this paper, we argue that leveraging the rich data on the edge server is much more beneficial than utilizing only user datasets. Specifically, we show that the mere application of FL with an additional virtual user node representing the data on the edge server is inefficient. We propose FedTOP-ADMM, which generalizes FedADMM and is based on a three-operator ADMM-type technique that exploits a smooth cost function on the edge server to learn a global model parallel to the edge devices. Our numerical experiments indicate that FedTOP-ADMM has substantial gain up to 33\% in communication efficiency to reach a desired test accuracy with respect to FedADMM, including a virtual user on the edge server.</description>

      <title>OTFS-based Robust MMSE Precoding Design in Over-the-air Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over-the-air computation (AirComp), as a data aggregation method that can improve network efficiency by exploiting the superposition characteristics of wireless channels, has received much attention recently. Meanwhile, the orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation can provide a strong Doppler resilience and facilitate reliable transmission for high-mobility communications. Hence, in this work, we investigate an OTFS-based AirComp system in the presence of time-frequency dual-selective channels. In particular, we commence from the development of a novel transmission framework for the considered system, where the pilot signal is sent together with data, and the channel estimation is implemented according to the echo from the access point to the sensor, thereby reducing the overhead of channel state information (CSI) feedback. Hereafter, based on the CSI estimated from the previous frame, a robust precoding matrix aiming at minimizing mean square error in the current frame is designed, which takes into account the estimation error from the receiver noise and the outdated CSI. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed robust precoding scheme by comparing it with the non-robust precoding. The performance gain is more obvious in a high signal-to-noise ratio in case of large channel estimation errors.</description>

      <title>Time-Frequency-Space Transmit Design and Receiver Processing with Dynamic Subarray for Terahertz Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) enables simultaneous data transmission with Terabit-per-second (Tbps) rate and millimeter-level accurate sensing. To realize such a blueprint, ultra-massive antenna arrays with directional beamforming are used to compensate for severe path loss in the THz band. In this paper, the time-frequency-space transmit design is investigated for THz ISAC to generate time-varying scanning sensing beams and stable communication beams. Specifically, with the dynamic array-of-subarray (DAoSA) hybrid beamforming architecture and multi-carrier modulation, two ISAC hybrid precoding algorithms are proposed, namely, a vectorization (VEC) based algorithm that outperforms existing ISAC hybrid precoding methods and a low-complexity sensing codebook assisted (SCA) approach. Meanwhile, coupled with the transmit design, parameter estimation algorithms are proposed to realize high-accuracy sensing, including a wideband DAoSA MUSIC method for angle estimation and a sum-DFT-GSS approach for range and velocity estimation. Numerical results indicate that the proposed algorithms can realize centi-degree-level angle estimation accuracy and millimeter-level range estimation accuracy, which are one or two orders of magnitudes better than the methods in the millimeter-wave band. In addition, to overcome the cyclic prefix limitation and Doppler effects, an inter-symbol interference- and inter-carrier interference-tackled sensing algorithm is developed to refine sensing capabilities for THz ISAC.</description>

      <title>Discretized Distributed Optimization over Dynamic Digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a discrete-time model of continuous-time distributed optimization over dynamic directed-graphs (digraphs) with applications to distributed learning. Our optimization algorithm works over general strongly connected dynamic networks under switching topologies, e.g., in mobile multi-agent systems and volatile networks due to link failures. Compared to many existing lines of work, there is no need for bi-stochastic weight designs on the links. The existing literature mostly needs the link weights to be stochastic using specific weight-design algorithms needed both at the initialization and at all times when the topology of the network changes. This paper eliminates the need for such algorithms and paves the way for distributed optimization over time-varying digraphs. We derive the bound on the gradient-tracking step-size and discrete time-step for convergence and prove dynamic stability using arguments from consensus algorithms, matrix perturbation theory, and Lyapunov theory. This work, particularly, is an improvement over existing stochastic-weight undirected networks in case of link removal or packet drops. This is because the existing literature may need to rerun time-consuming and computationally complex algorithms for stochastic design, while the proposed strategy works as long as the underlying network is weight-symmetric and balanced. The proposed optimization framework finds applications to distributed classification and learning.</description>

      <title>Room Transfer Function Reconstruction Using Complex-valued Neural Networks and Irregularly Distributed Microphones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing the room transfer functions needed to calculate the complex sound field in a room has several impor- tant real-world applications. However, an unpractical number of microphones is often required. Recently, in addition to classical signal processing methods, deep learning techniques have been applied to reconstruct the room transfer function starting from a very limited set of measurements at scattered points in the room. In this paper, we employ complex-valued neural networks to estimate room transfer functions in the frequency range of the first room resonances, using a few irregularly distributed microphones. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that complex-valued neural networks are used to estimate room transfer functions. To analyze the benefits of applying complex- valued optimization to the considered task, we compare the proposed technique with a state-of-the-art kernel-based signal processing approach for sound field reconstruction, showing that the proposed technique exhibits relevant advantages in terms of phase accuracy and overall quality of the reconstructed sound field. For informative purposes, we also compare the model with a similarly-structured data-driven approach that, however, applies a real-valued neural network to reconstruct only the magnitude of the sound field.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Multiuser Beam-Training for Extremely Large-Scale MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems are capable of improving spectral efficiency by employing far more antennas than conventional massive MIMO at the base station (BS). However, beam training in multiuser XL-MIMO systems is challenging. To tackle these issues, we conceive a three-phase graph neural network (GNN)-based beam training scheme for multiuser XL-MIMO systems. In the first phase, only far-field wide beams have to be tested for each user and the GNN is utilized to map the beamforming gain information of the far-field wide beams to the optimal near-field beam for each user. In addition, the proposed GNN-based scheme can exploit the position-correlation between adjacent users for further improvement of the accuracy of beam training. In the second phase, a beam allocation scheme based on the probability vectors produced at the outputs of GNNs is proposed to address the above beam-direction conflicts between users. In the third phase, the hybrid TBF is designed for further reducing the inter-user interference. Our simulation results show that the proposed scheme improves the beam training performance of the benchmarks. Moreover, the performance of the proposed beam training scheme approaches that of an exhaustive search, despite requiring only about 7% of the pilot overhead.</description>

      <title>Identification of Craving Maps among Marijuana Users via the Analysis of Functional Brain Networks with High-Order Attention Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00033v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The excessive consumption of marijuana can induce substantial psychological and social consequences. In this investigation, we propose an elucidative framework termed high-order graph attention neural networks (HOGANN) for the classification of Marijuana addiction, coupled with an analysis of localized brain network communities exhibiting abnormal activities among chronic marijuana users. HOGANN integrates dynamic intrinsic functional brain networks, estimated from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI), using long short-term memory (LSTM) to capture temporal network dynamics. We employ a high-order attention module for information fusion and message passing among neighboring nodes, enhancing the network community analysis. Our model is validated across two distinct data cohorts, yielding substantially higher classification accuracy than benchmark algorithms. Furthermore, we discern the most pertinent subnetworks and cognitive regions affected by persistent marijuana consumption, indicating adverse effects on functional brain networks, particularly within the dorsal attention and frontoparietal networks. Intriguingly, our model demonstrates superior performance in cohorts exhibiting prolonged dependence, implying that prolonged marijuana usage induces more pronounced alterations in brain networks. The model proficiently identifies craving brain maps, thereby delineating critical brain regions for analysis.</description>

      <title>Redundancy Transmission in UAV-Aided LoRa Networks Featuring Wake-Up Radios</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a LoRa sensor network featuring a UAV-mounted gateway for collecting sensor data (messages). Wake-up radios (WuR) are employed to inform the sensors of the UAV's arrival. Building on an existing random access scheme for such setups, we propose and evaluate two redundancy transmission protocols for enhancing the reliability of the data transfer. One protocol employs fountain-coded transmissions, whereas the other performs message replication. Our results illustrate how redundancy transmission can be beneficial under the time constraints imposed by the UAV's limited hovering duration, and how node density, hovering time, and sensor energy budget impact the performance of the schemes.</description>

      <title>RIS-assisted Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems With Two-Timescale Design and Hardware Impairments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrating the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) into a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) system is an effective solution to achieve high system capacity with low cost and power consumption. However, existing works of RIS-assisted systems mostly assumed perfect hardware, while the impact of hardware impairments (HWIs) is generally ignored. In this paper, we consider the general Rician fading channel and uplink transmission of the RIS-assisted CF-mMIMO system under transceiver impairments and RIS phase noise. To reduce the feedback overhead and power consumption, we propose a two-timescale transmission scheme to optimize the passive beamformers at RISs with statistical channel state information (CSI), while transmit beamformers at access points (APs) are designed based on instantaneous CSI. Also, the maximum ratio combining (MRC) detection is applied to the central processing unit (CPU). On this basis, we derive the closed-form approximate expression of the achievable rate, based on which the impact of HWIs and the power scaling laws are analyzed to draw useful theoretical insights. To maximize the users' sum rate or minimum rate, we first transform our rate expression into a tractable form, and then optimize the phase shifts of RISs based on an accelerated gradient ascent method. Finally, numerical results are presented to demonstrate the correctness of our derived expressions and validate the previous analysis, which provide some guidelines for the practical application of the imperfect RISs in the CF-mMIMO with transceiver HWIs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is a fundamental tool for signal analysis, widely used across various fields. However, traditional FFT methods encounter challenges in adjusting the frequency bin interval, which may impede accurate spectral analysis. In this study, we propose a method for adjusting the frequency bin interval in FFT by introducing a parameter $\alpha$. We elucidate the underlying principles of the proposed method and discuss its potential applications across various contexts. Our findings suggest that the proposed method offers a promising approach to overcome the limitations of traditional FFT methods and enhance spectral analysis accuracy.</description>
