      <title>Preserving Individuality while Following the Crowd: Understanding the Role of User Taste and Crowd Wisdom in Online Product Rating Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous algorithms have been developed for online product rating prediction, but the specific influence of user and product information in determining the final prediction score remains largely unexplored. Existing research often relies on narrowly defined data settings, which overlooks real-world challenges such as the cold-start problem, cross-category information utilization, and scalability and deployment issues. To delve deeper into these aspects, and particularly to uncover the roles of individual user taste and collective wisdom, we propose a unique and practical approach that emphasizes historical ratings at both the user and product levels, encapsulated using a continuously updated dynamic tree representation. This representation effectively captures the temporal dynamics of users and products, leverages user information across product categories, and provides a natural solution to the cold-start problem. Furthermore, we have developed an efficient data processing strategy that makes this approach highly scalable and easily deployable. Comprehensive experiments in real industry settings demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, our findings reveal that individual taste dominates over collective wisdom in online product rating prediction, a perspective that contrasts with the commonly observed wisdom of the crowd phenomenon in other domains. This dominance of individual user taste is consistent across various model types, including the boosting tree model, recurrent neural network (RNN), and transformer-based architectures. This observation holds true across the overall population, within individual product categories, and in cold-start scenarios. Our findings underscore the significance of individual user tastes in the context of online product rating prediction and the robustness of our approach across different model architectures.</description>

      <title>Fast Computation of Kemeny's Constant for Directed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kemeny's constant for random walks on a graph is defined as the mean hitting time from one node to another selected randomly according to the stationary distribution. It has found numerous applications and attracted considerable research interest. However, exact computation of Kemeny's constant requires matrix inversion, which scales poorly for large networks with millions of nodes. Existing approximation algorithms either leverage properties exclusive to undirected graphs or involve inefficient simulation, leaving room for further optimization. To address these limitations for directed graphs, we propose two novel approximation algorithms for estimating Kemeny's constant on directed graphs with theoretical error guarantees. Extensive numerical experiments on real-world networks validate the superiority of our algorithms over baseline methods in terms of efficiency and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Fast Computation for the Forest Matrix of an Evolving Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The forest matrix plays a crucial role in network science, opinion dynamics, and machine learning, offering deep insights into the structure of and dynamics on networks. In this paper, we study the problem of querying entries of the forest matrix in evolving graphs, which more accurately represent the dynamic nature of real-world networks compared to static graphs. To address the unique challenges posed by evolving graphs, we first introduce two approximation algorithms, \textsc{SFQ} and \textsc{SFQPlus}, for static graphs. \textsc{SFQ} employs a probabilistic interpretation of the forest matrix, while \textsc{SFQPlus} incorporates a novel variance reduction technique and is theoretically proven to offer enhanced accuracy. Based on these two algorithms, we further devise two dynamic algorithms centered around efficiently maintaining a list of spanning converging forests. This approach ensures $O(1)$ runtime complexity for updates, including edge additions and deletions, as well as for querying matrix elements, and provides an unbiased estimation of forest matrix entries. Finally, through extensive experiments on various real-world networks, we demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithms. Particularly, our algorithms are scalable to massive graphs with more than forty million nodes.</description>

      <title>Extracting the U.S. building types from OpenStreetMap data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building type information is crucial for population estimation, traffic planning, urban planning, and emergency response applications. Although essential, such data is often not readily available. To alleviate this problem, this work creates a comprehensive dataset by providing residential/non-residential building classification covering the entire United States. We propose and utilize an unsupervised machine learning method to classify building types based on building footprints and available OpenStreetMap information. The classification result is validated using authoritative ground truth data for select counties in the U.S. The validation shows a high precision for non-residential building classification and a high recall for residential buildings. We identified various approaches to improving the quality of the classification, such as removing sheds and garages from the dataset. Furthermore, analyzing the misclassifications revealed that they are mainly due to missing and scarce metadata in OSM. A major result of this work is the resulting dataset of classifying 67,705,475 buildings. We hope that this data is of value to the scientific community, including urban and transportation planners.</description>

      <title>Sequential Classification of Misinformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years there have been a growing interest in online auditing of information flow over social networks with the goal of monitoring undesirable effects, such as, misinformation and fake news. Most previous work on the subject, focus on the binary classification problem of classifying information as fake or genuine. Nonetheless, in many practical scenarios, the multi-class/label setting is of particular importance. For example, it could be the case that a social media platform may want to distinguish between ``true", ``partly-true", and ``false" information. Accordingly, in this paper, we consider the problem of online multiclass classification of information flow. To that end, driven by empirical studies on information flow over real-world social media networks, we propose a probabilistic information flow model over graphs. Then, the learning task is to detect the label of the information flow, with the goal of minimizing a combination of the classification error and the detection time. For this problem, we propose two detection algorithms; the first is based on the well-known multiple sequential probability ratio test, while the second is a novel graph neural network based sequential decision algorithm. For both algorithms, we prove several strong statistical guarantees. We also construct a data driven algorithm for learning the proposed probabilistic model. Finally, we test our algorithms over two real-world datasets, and show that they outperform other state-of-the-art misinformation detection algorithms, in terms of detection time and classification error.</description>

      <title>A Hetero-functional Graph Resilience Analysis for Convergent Systems-of-Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our modern life has grown to depend on many and nearly ubiquitous large complex engineering systems. Many disciplines now seemingly ask the same question: ``In the face of assumed disruption, to what degree will these systems continue to perform and when will they be able to bounce back to normal operation"? Furthermore, there is a growing recognition that the greatest societal challenges of the Anthropocene era are intertwined, necessitating a convergent systems-of-systems modeling and analysis framework based upon reconciled ontologies, data, and theoretical methods. Consequently, this paper develops a methodology for hetero-functional graph resilience analysis and demonstrates it on a convergent system-of-systems. It uses the Systems Modeling Language, model-based systems engineering and Hetero-Functional Graph Theory (HFGT) to overcome the convergence research challenges when constructing models and measures from multiple disciplines for systems resilience. The paper includes both the ``survival" as well as ``recovery" components of resilience. It also strikes a middle ground between two disparate approaches to resilience measurement: structural measurement of formal graphs and detailed behavioral simulation. This paper also generalizes a previous resilience measure based on HFGT and benefits from recent theoretical and computational developments in HFGT. To demonstrate the methodological developments, the resilience analysis is conducted on a hypothetical energy-water nexus system of moderate size as a type of system-of-systems.</description>

      <title>Mpox Narrative on Instagram: A Labeled Multilingual Dataset of Instagram Posts on Mpox for Sentiment, Hate Speech, and Anxiety Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The world is currently experiencing an outbreak of mpox, which has been declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by WHO. No prior work related to social media mining has focused on the development of a dataset of Instagram posts about the mpox outbreak. The work presented in this paper aims to address this research gap and makes two scientific contributions to this field. First, it presents a multilingual dataset of 60,127 Instagram posts about mpox, published between July 23, 2022, and September 5, 2024. The dataset, available at https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/7fvc-y093, contains Instagram posts about mpox in 52 languages. For each of these posts, the Post ID, Post Description, Date of publication, language, and translated version of the post (translation to English was performed using the Google Translate API) are presented as separate attributes in the dataset. After developing this dataset, sentiment analysis, hate speech detection, and anxiety or stress detection were performed. This process included classifying each post into (i) one of the sentiment classes, i.e., fear, surprise, joy, sadness, anger, disgust, or neutral, (ii) hate or not hate, and (iii) anxiety/stress detected or no anxiety/stress detected. These results are presented as separate attributes in the dataset. Second, this paper presents the results of performing sentiment analysis, hate speech analysis, and anxiety or stress analysis. The variation of the sentiment classes - fear, surprise, joy, sadness, anger, disgust, and neutral were observed to be 27.95%, 2.57%, 8.69%, 5.94%, 2.69%, 1.53%, and 50.64%, respectively. In terms of hate speech detection, 95.75% of the posts did not contain hate and the remaining 4.25% of the posts contained hate. Finally, 72.05% of the posts did not indicate any anxiety/stress, and the remaining 27.95% of the posts represented some form of anxiety/stress.</description>

      <title>Higher-order null models as a lens for social systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18470v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the widespread adoption of higher-order mathematical structures such as hypergraphs, methodological tools for their analysis lag behind those for traditional graphs. This work addresses a critical gap in this context by proposing two micro-canonical random null models for directed hypergraphs: the Directed Hypergraph Configuration Model (DHCM) and the Directed Hypergraph JOINT Model (DHJM). These models preserve essential structural properties of directed hypergraphs such as node in- and out-degree sequences and hyperedge head and tail size sequences, or their joint tensor. We also describe two efficient MCMC algorithms, NuDHy-Degs and NuDHy-JOINT, to sample random hypergraphs from these ensembles.
  To showcase the interdisciplinary applicability of the proposed null models, we present three distinct use cases in sociology, epidemiology, and economics. First, we reveal the oscillatory behavior of increased homophily in opposition parties in the US Congress over a 40-year span, emphasizing the role of higher-order structures in quantifying political group homophily. Second, we investigate non-linear contagion in contact hyper-networks, demonstrating that disparities between simulations and theoretical predictions can be explained by considering higher-order joint degree distributions. Last, we examine the economic complexity of countries in the global trade network, showing that local network properties preserved by NuDHy explain the main structural economic complexity indexes.
  This work advances the development of null models for directed hypergraphs, addressing the intricate challenges posed by their complex entity relations, and providing a versatile suite of tools for researchers across various domains.</description>

      <title>Clustering Time-Evolving Networks Using the Spatio-Temporal Graph Laplacian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-evolving graphs arise frequently when modeling complex dynamical systems such as social networks, traffic flow, and biological processes. Developing techniques to identify and analyze communities in these time-varying graph structures is an important challenge. In this work, we generalize existing spectral clustering algorithms from static to dynamic graphs using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to capture the temporal evolution of clusters. Based on this extended canonical correlation framework, we define the spatio-temporal graph Laplacian and investigate its spectral properties. We connect these concepts to dynamical systems theory via transfer operators, and illustrate the advantages of our method on benchmark graphs by comparison with existing methods. We show that the spatio-temporal graph Laplacian allows for a clear interpretation of cluster structure evolution over time for directed and undirected graphs.</description>

      <title>Integration vs segregation: evidence from measuring and comparing interdisciplinarity in funded and unfunded research using a network approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interdisciplinary research fuels innovation. However, research investment has been found to have become more conservative and highly interdisciplinary ideas tend to be punished during research evaluation. How does this affect the interdisciplinarity of research output? To answer this question, our study presents a novel network approach by comparing the evolution of interdisciplinarity in funded research against unfunded research. Considering the field of infectious disease research, the analysis of temporal networks reveals (i) the growing compartmentalisation of funded research, i.e., it becomes more conservative and focuses on the groups of knowledge with readily established connections, and (ii) the growth in global integration in unfunded research, i.e., it tends to be more widely exploratory and links distant knowledge. In addition, we find that in general funded research is less interdisciplinary than unfunded research but this effect decreases through time. Moreover, we observe that interdisciplinary research on prominent infectious diseases like HIV tends to have strong bridging effects facilitating global knowledge integration in the network. In terms of the coronavirus research, despite the surge in publications since COVID-19, we find its systematic impact on knowledge integration remains relatively low. Overall, this research provides detailed insights into the impact of conservatism in funding interdisciplinary research, allows for the identification of under/over-funded interdisciplinary research areas, and offers valuable implications for policymakers aiming to foster interdisciplinary research.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Like-Minded Peers to Overcome Friend Data Sparsity in Session-Based Social Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Session-based Social Recommendation (SSR) leverages social relationships within online networks to enhance the performance of Session-based Recommendation (SR). However, existing SSR algorithms often encounter the challenge of "friend data sparsity". Moreover, significant discrepancies can exist between the purchase preferences of social network friends and those of the target user, reducing the influence of friends relative to the target user's own preferences. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the concept of "Like-minded Peers" (LMP), representing users whose preferences align with the target user's current session based on their historical sessions. This is the first work, to our knowledge, that uses LMP to enhance the modeling of social influence in SSR. This approach not only alleviates the problem of friend data sparsity but also effectively incorporates users with similar preferences to the target user. We propose a novel model named Transformer Encoder with Graph Attention Aggregator Recommendation (TEGAARec), which includes the TEGAA module and the GAT-based social aggregation module. The TEGAA module captures and merges both long-term and short-term interests for target users and LMP users. Concurrently, the GAT-based social aggregation module is designed to aggregate the target users' dynamic interests and social influence in a weighted manner. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the efficacy and superiority of our proposed model and ablation studies are done to illustrate the contributions of each component in TEGAARec.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16782v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A wide variety of complex systems are characterized by interactions of different types involving varying numbers of units. Multiplex hypergraphs serve as a tool to describe such structures, capturing distinct types of higher-order interactions among a collection of units. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive set of measures to describe structural connectivity patterns in multiplex hypergraphs, considering scales from node and hyperedge levels to the system's mesoscale. We validate our measures with three real-world datasets: scientific co-authorship in physics, movie collaborations, and high school interactions. This validation reveals new collaboration patterns, identifies trends within and across movie subfields, and provides insights into daily interaction dynamics. Our framework aims to offer a more nuanced characterization of real-world systems marked by both multiplex and higher-order interactions.</description>

      <title>A Review of Graph Neural Networks in Epidemic Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19852v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a growing interest in studying epidemiological models. Traditional mechanistic models mathematically describe the transmission mechanisms of infectious diseases. However, they often suffer from limitations of oversimplified or fixed assumptions, which could cause sub-optimal predictive power and inefficiency in capturing complex relation information. Consequently, Graph Neural Networks(GNNs) have emerged as a progressively popular tool in epidemic research. In this paper, we endeavor to furnish a comprehensive review of GNNs in epidemic tasks and highlight potential future directions. To accomplish this objective, we introduce hierarchical taxonomies for both epidemic tasks and methodologies, offering a trajectory of development within this domain. For epidemic tasks, we establish a taxonomy akin to those typically employed within the epidemic domain. For methodology, we categorize existing work into Neural Models and Hybrid Models. Following this, we perform an exhaustive and systematic examination of the methodologies, encompassing both the tasks and their technical details. Furthermore, we discuss the limitations of existing methods from diverse perspectives and systematically propose future research directions. This survey aims to bridge literature gaps and promote the progression of this promising field, with a list of relevant papers at https://github.com/Emory-Melody/awesome-epidemic-modeling-papers. We hope that it will facilitate synergies between the communities of GNNs and epidemiology, and contribute to their collective progress.</description>

      <title>GuideWalk: A Novel Graph-Based Word Embedding for Enhanced Text Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the prime problems of computer science and machine learning is to extract information efficiently from large-scale, heterogeneous data. Text data, with its syntax, semantics, and even hidden information content, possesses an exceptional place among the data types in concern. The processing of the text data requires embedding, a method of translating the content of the text to numeric vectors. A correct embedding algorithm is the starting point for obtaining the full information content of the text data. In this work, a new text embedding approach, namely the Guided Transition Probability Matrix (GTPM) model is proposed. The model uses the graph structure of sentences to capture different types of information from text data, such as syntactic, semantic, and hidden content. Using random walks on a weighted word graph, GTPM calculates transition probabilities to derive text embedding vectors. The proposed method is tested with real-world data sets and eight well-known and successful embedding algorithms. GTPM shows significantly better classification performance for binary and multi-class datasets than well-known algorithms. Additionally, the proposed method demonstrates superior robustness, maintaining performance with limited (only $10\%$) training data, showing an $8\%$ decline compared to $15-20\%$ for baseline methods.</description>

      <title>DF Louvain: Fast Incrementally Expanding Approach for Community Detection on Dynamic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19634v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Community detection is the problem of recognizing natural divisions in networks. A relevant challenge in this problem is to find communities on rapidly evolving graphs. In this report we present our Parallel Dynamic Frontier (DF) Louvain algorithm, which given a batch update of edge deletions and insertions, incrementally identifies and processes an approximate set of affected vertices in the graph with minimal overhead, while using a novel approach of incrementally updating weighted-degrees of vertices and total edge weights of communities. We also present our parallel implementations of Naive-dynamic (ND) and Delta-screening (DS) Louvain. On a server with a 64-core AMD EPYC-7742 processor, our experiments show that DF Louvain obtains speedups of 179x, 7.2x, and 5.3x on real-world dynamic graphs, compared to Static, ND, and DS Louvain, respectively, and is 183x, 13.8x, and 8.7x faster, respectively, on large graphs with random batch updates. Moreover, DF Louvain improves its performance by 1.6x for every doubling of threads.</description>
