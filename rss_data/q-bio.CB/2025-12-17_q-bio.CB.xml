      <title>Measurement of tissue viscosity to relate force and motion in collective cell migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In tissue development, wound healing, and cancer invasion, coordinated cell motion arises from active forces produced by the cells. The relationship between force and motion remains unclear, however, because the forces result from a sum of contributions from activity and the constitutive response of the cell collective. Here, we develop a method to decouple the forces due to activity from those due to constitutive response. As a model of an epithelial tissue, we use a monolayer of epithelial cells in the fluid state, for which the constitutive behavior is that of a viscous fluid. By careful study of the distribution of the ratio between shear stress and strain rate, we show that the order of magnitude of viscosity within the epithelial tissue is 100 Pa-hr and that increasing (decreasing) the actomyosin cytoskeleton and cell-cell adhesions increase (decrease) the magnitude of tissue viscosity. These results establish tissue viscosity as a meaningful way to describe the mechanical behavior of epithelial tissues, and demonstrate a direct relationship between tissue microstructure and material properties. By providing the first experimental measurement of tissue viscosity, our study is a step toward separating the active and constitutive components of stress, in turn clarifying the relationship between force and motion and providing a new means of identifying how active cell forces evolve in space and time.</description>

      <title>TransientTrack: Advanced Multi-Object Tracking and Classification of Cancer Cells with Transient Fluorescent Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tracking cells in time-lapse videos is an essential technique for monitoring cell population dynamics at a single-cell level. Current methods for cell tracking are developed on videos with mostly single, constant signals and do not detect pivotal events such as cell death. Here, we present TransientTrack, a deep learning-based framework for cell tracking in multi-channel microscopy video data with transient fluorescent signals that fluctuate over time following processes such as the circadian rhythm of cells. By identifying key cellular events - mitosis (cell division) and apoptosis (cell death) our method allows us to build complete trajectories, including cell lineage information. TransientTrack is lightweight and performs matching on cell detection embeddings directly, without the need for quantification of tracking-specific cell features. Furthermore, our approach integrates Transformer Networks, multi-stage matching using all detection boxes, and the interpolation of missing tracklets with the Kalman Filter. This unified framework achieves strong performance across diverse conditions, effectively tracking cells and capturing cell division and death. We demonstrate the use of TransientTrack in an analysis of the efficacy of a chemotherapeutic drug at a single-cell level. The proposed framework could further advance quantitative studies of cancer cell dynamics, enabling detailed characterization of treatment response and resistance mechanisms. The code is available at https://github.com/bozeklab/TransientTrack.</description>
