      <title>On the structure of open clusters: geometric vs geomantic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding our place in the universe is an eternal quest. Through the analysis of the 3D structures of 66 nearby open clusters using Gaia DR3 data, we discovered an intriguing pattern: most clusters show their elongation directions pointing at the Sun, suggesting that the Solar System might just be the universe's favorite spot, a cosmic feng shui hotspot! This surprising result hints at a subtle blend of geometry and geomancy.</description>

      <title>Pushing the boundaries of asteroseismic individual frequency modelling: unveiling two evolved very-low metallicity red giants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal-poor stars are key to understanding the first stellar generation in the Galaxy. Asteroseismic characterisation of red giants has traditionally relied on global seismic parameters, not the full spectrum of individual oscillation modes. Here, we present the first characterisation of two evolved very metal-poor stars, including the detailed mixed-mode patterns. We demonstrate that incorporating individual frequencies into grid-based modelling of red-giant stars enhances its precision, enabling detailed studies of these ancient stars and allowing us to infer the stellar properties of two $[\mathrm{Fe}/\mathrm{H}]{\sim}{-}2.5$ dex Kepler stars: KIC 4671239 and KIC 7693833. Recent developments in both observational and theoretical asteroseismology allows for detailed studies of the complex oscillation pattern of evolved giants. We employ Kepler time series and surface properties from high-resolution spectroscopic data to asteroseismically characterise the two stars using the BAyesian STellar Algorithm, BASTA. Both stars show agreement between constraints from seismic and classical observables; an overlap unrecoverable when purely considering the global seismic parameters. KIC 4671239 and KIC 7693833 were determined to have masses of $0.78^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$ and $0.83^{+0.03}_{-0.01} M_{\odot}$ with ages of $12.1^{+1.6}_{-1.5}$ and $10.3^{+0.6}_{-1.4}$ Gyr, respectively. A $\sim10$% discrepancy between observed and modelled $\nu_{\mathrm{max}}$ suggests a metallicity dependence of its scaling relation, leading to overestimated masses and incorrect age inferences for metal-poor stars. Utilising the full spectrum of individual oscillation modes, we circumvent the dependence on the asteroseismic scaling relations, providing direct constraints on the stars themselves, pushing the boundaries of state-of-the-art detailed modelling of evolved stars at metallicities far different from solar.</description>

      <title>All about Cookies: The perfect compromise between softness and crispiness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cookies are enjoyed best when they are both crispy and soft. I investigate in which proportion the cookies are crispy and soft, and disentangle whether it makes them biscuits, cakes, or none of the above. I baked cookies for colleagues at KTH, Stockholm, and University of Geneva, Switzerland, adopting my mum's mum's mum's etc. recipe. I created a dedicated survey for my colleagues with three well-selected questions to answer while eating one cookie. The weighted-average mean of the crispiness and softness, weighted by the respective enjoyment of the cookie, over the whole population amount to 7.0 +/- 1.1 and 5.3 +/- 1.4, respectively. The enjoyment of the cookies amounts to 9.1 +/- 2.3. People like (my) cookies, and cookies are neither cakes, nor biscuits, they are just... cookies!</description>

      <title>A long-lasting eruption heralds SN 2023ldh, a clone of SN 2009ip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the results of the spectroscopic and photometric monitoring of the type IIn supernova (SN) 2023ldh. Survey archive data show that the SN progenitor experienced some erratic outbursts in the years before exploding. From May 2023, the source shows a general slow luminosity rise lasting over four months with some superposed luminosity fluctuations. In analogy to SN 2009ip, we label this brightening as Event A. During Event A, SN 2023ldh reaches a maximum absolute magnitude of Mr = -15.52 $\pm$ 0.24 mag. Then the light curves show a luminosity decline of about 1 mag in all filters lasting about two weeks, followed by a steep brightening (Event B) to an absolute peak magnitude of Mr = -18.53 $\pm$ 0.23 mag, replicating the evolution of SN 2009ip and similar SNe IIn. Three spectra of SN 2023ldh are obtained during Event A, showing multi-component P Cygni profiles of H I and Fe II lines. During the rise to the Event B peak, the spectrum shows a blue continuum dominated by Balmer lines in emission with Lorentzian profiles, with a full width at half-maximum (FWHM) velocity of about 650 km/s. Later, in the post-peak phase, the spectrum reddens, and broader wings appear in the H{\alpha} line profile. Metal lines are well visible with P Cygni profiles and velocities of about 2000 km/s. Beginning around three months past maximum and until very late phases, the Ca II lines become among the most prominent features, while H{\alpha} is dominated by an intermediate-width component with a boxy profile. Although SN 2023ldh mimics the evolution of other SN 2009ip-like transients, it is slightly more luminous and has a slower photometric evolution. The surprisingly homogeneous observational properties of SN 2009ip-like events may indicate similar explosion scenarios and similar progenitor parameters.</description>

      <title>The Detectability of Coronal Mass Ejections in the Low Corona Using Multi-slit Extreme-ultraviolet Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectra of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in the low corona play a crucial role in understanding their origins and physical mechanism, and enhancing space weather forecasting. However, capturing these spectra faces significant challenges. This paper introduces a scheme of a multi-slit spectrometer design with five slits, acquiring the global spectra of the solar corona simultaneously with a focus on the spectra of CMEs in the low corona. The chosen wavelength range of the spectrometer (170-180 {\AA}) includes four extreme ultraviolet emission lines (Fe x 174.53 {\AA}, Fe ix 171.07 {\AA}, Fe x 175.26 {\AA}, Fe x 177.24 {\AA}), which provides information of plasma velocity, density and temperature. Utilizing a numerical simulation of the global corona for both the on-disk and the off-limb scenarios, we focus on resolving the ambiguity associated with various Doppler velocity components of CMEs, particularly for a fast CME in the low corona. A new application of our decomposition technique is adopted, enabling the successful identification of multiple discrete CME velocity components. Our findings demonstrate a strong correlation between the synthetic model spectra and the inverted results, indicating the robustness of our decomposition method and its significant potential for global monitoring of the solar corona, including CMEs.</description>

      <title>The HADS Star CSS_J102714.3+205943: a Component of a Binary System with an Elliptic Orbit?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyzed period changes of the high-amplitude Delta Scuti variable star CSS_J102714.3+205943 for about 20 years, utilizing data from the automated sky surveys along with our own observations. With the help of the O-C diagram, we found that the period decreased noticeably between JD2454800 and JD2457300. A possible cause of the change could be intrinsic processes in the star. However, the observed behavior of the O-C diagram can also be explained by the light-time effect if the star is a component of a binary system. Times of maxima for the star, derived from the surveys and our observations, are listed.</description>

      <title>Exploring Young Stellar Variability with Gaia DR3 light curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Photometric variability is a defining characteristic of young stellar objects (YSO), which can be traced back to a range of physical processes taking place at different stages of young stars' formation and early evolution. Gaia's third Data Release (GDR3) has provided an unprecedented dataset of photometric time series, including 79375 light curves for YSO candidates. With its all-sky coverage, Gaia provides a unique opportunity for large-scale studies of YSO variability. Aims: Our goal was to characterise the GDR3 sample of YSO variables further and verify the recurrence of YSO variability modes due to accretion, extinction, rotation modulation, etc. By adapting the Q&amp;M methodology for Gaia's sparse and long-term light curves, we seek to bridge the gap between low and high-cadence surveys' insights on YSO variability. Methods: We piloted the application of the asymmetry (M) and periodicity (Q) variability metrics to characterise YSO variability with Gaia light curves. Through refined sample selection, we identified sources with appropriate sampling for the Q&amp;M methodology. We used the Generalised Lomb Scargle periodogram and structure functions to infer variability timescales. Results: We successfully derived Q&amp;M indices for ~23000 sources in the GDR3 YSO sample. These variables were then classified into eight variability morphological classes. We linked morphological classes with physical mechanisms by using H$\alpha$ as a proxy of accretion and $\alpha_\mathrm{IR}$-indices to gauge circumstellar material's presence. Conclusions: We demonstrate that the Q&amp;M metrics can be successfully applied to Gaia's sparse time-series. We applied them to distinguish between the several variability modes. While our results are generally consistent with previous high-cadence, short-term studies, we find that GDR3's long timespan yields an enhanced variety of variability mechanisms.</description>

      <title>The $i$-processes nucleosynthesis during the formation of He-rich hot-subdwarf stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been shown that proton ingestion episodes can happen in the formation of hot-subdwarf stars, and that neutron-capture processes are possible in those cases. Moreover, some helium-rich hot subdwarfs display extraordinarily high abundances of heavy elements such as Zr, Yr and Pb on their surfaces. We explore under which conditions neutron-capture processes can occur in late helium core flashes, i.e. those occurring in the cores of stripped red-giant stars.
  We compute evolutionary models through the helium core flash and the subsequent hydrogen ingestion episode in stripped red giant stars. Stellar structure models are then used in post-processing to compute the detailed evolution of neutron-capture elements. We find that for metallicities of $10^{-3}$ and below, neutron densities can be as high as $10^{15}\,$cm$^{-3}$ and intermediate neutron capture processes occur in some of our models. The results depend very strongly on the H-envelope mass that survives after the stripping. Interestingly, we find that computed abundances in some of our models closely match the element abundances up to tin observed for EC 22536-5304, the only well-studied star for which the hot-flasher scenario assumed in our models is the most likely evolutionary path.
  Intermediate neutron capture processes can occur in the He-core flash experienced by the cores of some stripped red giants, and might be connected to the abundances of heavy elements observed in some helium-rich hot-subdwarf stars. The agreement between the observed abundances in EC 22536-5304 and those of our models offers support to our nucleosynthesis calculations. Moreover, if confirmed, the idea that heavy element abundances retain signatures of the different evolutionary channels opens the possibility that heavy element abundances in iHe-sdOB stars can be used to infer their evolutionary origin.</description>

      <title>The Longest Duration SGRE Event in Solar Cycle 25</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar Cycle (SC) 24 was the weakest in the space age, yet it produced many sustained gamma ray emission (SGRE) events from the Sun. Solar cycle (SC) 25, which is a bit stronger than SC 24 observed only a handful of SGRE events over the first five years. Here we report on the 2024 September 14 SGRE event, which has the longest duration (\~11.29 hrs) as of this writing. The associated type II radio burst is also of long duration (\~16 hr). Detailed analysis of the SGRE event reveals that the event is in good agreement with the linear relation of the SGRE duration with the ending frequency and duration of the type II burst. The kinematics of the associated coronal mass ejection (CME) shows that it is one of the fastest CMEs of SC 25, capable of driving a shock that accelerated &gt;300 MeV protons to account for the observed SGRE. By comparing with an event with similar durations in SC 24, we find that it had a lower-speed CME but resulted in a larger-sized SGRE event. We speculate that the difference may be due to the change in the heliospheric state between the two cycles.</description>

      <title>Catsteroseismology: Survey-based Analysis of Purr-mode Oscillations Suggests Inner Lives of Cats are Unknowable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Catsteroseismology, or asterocatsmology, is an unexplored area of observational and theoretical research that proposes to use purr-mode oscillations to study the much-beloved but poorly-understood species Felis catus. In this work, we conduct a survey to measure fundamental purrameters of cats and relate them to their purr-modes. Relations between these fundamental cat purrameters, which include physical (eg. size, cuddliness) and personality (eg. aggression, intelligence) traits, and purr-modes can help probe their inner lives and emotions. We find that while purr characteristics tentatively trend with several physical and personality traits, more data is required to better constrain these relationships and infer the direct predictive power of personality on purr-modes, or vice versa.</description>

      <title>Third Harmonic Structure in an Interplanetary Type II Radio Burst and Other Energetic Phenomena During the 2024 September 14 Solar Eruption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the observation of first, second, and third harmonic components during an interplanetary (IP) type II solar radio burst observed on 2024 September 14 by the radio instruments on board Wind, the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO), and the Parker Solar Probe. The eruption resulted in an ultrafast coronal mass ejection (CME) that had a sky plane speed of \~2366 km per sec, and an X4.5 flare from NOAA active region 13825 (S15E56). Also observed were a large solar energetic particle (SEP) event and a sustained gamma ray emission (SGRE) event. The IP type II burst consists of multiple features. The first, second, and third harmonic bursts are smooth and diffuse with additional patchy bursts superposed only on the fundamental component. The existence of fundamental harmonic structure including the third harmonic can be readily explained by the coherent plasma emission mechanism and works against the possibility of synchrotron mechanism.</description>

      <title>SPHERE/ZIMPOL insights into discs around evolved stars: arcs, asymmetries and porous dust aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Second-generation circumbinary discs around evolved binary stars, such as post-Asymptotic Giant Branch (post-AGB) stars, provide insights into poorly understood mechanisms of dust processing and disc evolution across diverse stellar environments. We present a multi-wavelength polarimetric survey of five evolved binary systems - AR Pup, HR 4049, HR 4226, U Mon, and V709 Car - using the SPHERE/ZIMPOL instrument. Post-AGB discs show significant polarimetric brightness at optical and near-IR wavelengths, often exceeding 1% of the system's total intensity. We also measured a maximum fractional polarization of the scattered light for AR Pup of ~0.7 in the V-band and ~0.55 in the I-band. To investigate wavelength-dependent polarization, we combine the SPHERE/ZIMPOL dataset with results from previous SPHERE/IRDIS studies. This analysis reveals that post-AGB discs exhibit a grey to blue polarimetric colour in the optical and near-IR. Along with high fractional polarization and polarized intensity distribution, these findings indicate that porous dust aggregates dominate the surface dust composition. We also find evidence of diverse disc geometries within the post-AGB sample, including arcs, asymmetries and variations in disc size across optical and near-IR wavelengths for some systems. Combining our findings with existing multi-technique studies, we question the classification of two systems in our sample, HR 4226 and V709 Car, which were originally identified as post-AGB binaries based on their near-IR excess. On comparing post-AGB discs to circumstellar environments around AGB stars and YSOs, we found that post-AGB systems exhibit a higher degree of polarization than single AGB stars and are comparable to the brightest protoplanetary discs around YSOs. Overall, our results reinforce the importance of polarimetric observations in probing dust properties and complex circumbinary structures.</description>

      <title>A MeerKAT survey of nearby dwarf novae: I. New detections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A program to search for radio emission from dwarf-novae-type cataclysmic variables was conducted with the South African MeerKAT radio telescope. The dwarf novae RU Pegasi, V426 Ophiuchi and IP Pegasi were detected during outburst at L-band (1284 MHz central frequency). Previously, only one cataclysmic variable was radio-detected at a frequency this low. We now bring the number to four. With these three newly found radio-emitters, the population of dwarf novae confirmed to be radio-emitting at any frequency reaches 10 systems. We found that the radio luminosity is correlated with the optical luminosity. For V426 Ophiuchi and RU Pegasi we found a radio decline contemporary with the outburst's optical decline. The peak radio luminosity of dwarf novae in outburst is very similar to that of novalike Cataclysmic Variables and no correlation with orbital period is seen.</description>

      <title>Multispacecraft Observations of the 2024 September 9 Backside Solar Eruption that Resulted in a Sustained Gamma Ray Emission Event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the 2024 September 9 sustained gamma ray emission (SGRE) event observed by the Large Area Telescope onboard the Fermi satellite. The event was associated with a backside solar eruption observed by multiple spacecraft such as the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO), Parker Solar Probe (PSP), Solar Orbiter (SolO), Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), Wind, and GOES, and by ground based radio telescopes. SolO Spectrometer Telescope for Imaging X rays (STIX) imaged an intense flare, which occurred about 41 deg behind the east limb, from heliographic coordinates S13E131. Forward modeling of the CME flux rope revealed that it impulsively accelerated (3.54 km s^{-2}) to attain a peak speed of 2162 km s^{-1}. SolO energetic particle detectors (EPD) observed protons up to about 1 GeV from the extended shock and electrons that produced a complex type II burst and possibly type III bursts. The durations of SGRE and type II burst are consistent with the linear relation between these quantities obtained from longer duration (exceeding 3 hours) SGRE events. All these observations are consistent with an extended shock surrounding the CME flux rope, which is the likely source of high energy protons required for the SGRE event. We compare this event with six other BTL SGRE eruptions and find that they are all consistent with energetic shock driving CMEs. We also find a significant east west asymmetry in the BTL source locations.</description>

      <title>Explodability criteria for the neutrino-driven supernova mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive stars undergoing iron core collapse at the end of their evolution terminate their lives either in successful or failed supernovae (SNe). The physics of core collapse supernovae (CCSNe) is complex, and their understanding requires computationally expensive simulations. The sampling of large, densely sampled parameter spaces of SN progenitors, as is needed e.g. for population synthesis studies, is thus not feasible. To remedy this situation, we present criteria that allow us to predict the final fates of stars by evaluating multiple explodability proxies derived from the stellar structure at the onset of core collapse. These are formulated based on the outcomes of a semi-analytic supernova model, evaluated over a set of ~3,900 heterogeneous stellar progenitors (single stars, binary-stripped and accretor stars). Over these, the explodabiliy criteria achieve an accuracy of &gt;99% agreement with the semi-analytic model. The criteria are tested on 29 state-of-the-art 3D CCSN simulation outcomes from two different groups. Furthermore, we find that all explodability proxies needed for our pre-SN criteria have two distinct peaks and intervening valleys as a function of the carbon-oxygen (CO) core mass $M_\mathrm{CO}$, which coincide with failed and successful SNe, respectively. The CO core masses of explodability peaks shift systematically with metallicity, $Z$, and with the timing of hydrogen-rich envelope removal in binary-stripped stars. With these, we identify critical values in $M_\mathrm{CO}$ that define windows over which black holes form by direct collapse. The outcome is a CCSN recipe based on $M_\mathrm{CO}$ and $Z$, applicable for rapid binary population synthesis and other studies. Our explodability formalism is consistent with SN observations that constrain the progenitor $M_\mathrm{CO}$ and partially addresses the missing red supergiant problem by direct black hole formation.</description>

      <title>Populations of evolved massive binary stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud I: Predictions from detailed evolution models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The majority of massive stars are born with a close binary companion. How this affects their evolution and fate is still largely uncertain, especially at low metallicity. Aims. We derive synthetic populations of massive post-interaction binary products and compare them with corresponding observed populations in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Methods. We analyse 53298 detailed binary evolutionary models computed with MESA. Our models include the physics of rotation, mass and angular momentum transfer, magnetic internal angular momentum transport, and tidal spin-orbit coupling. They cover initial primary masses of 5-100Msun, initial mass ratios of 0.3-0.95, and all initial periods for which interaction is expected. They are evolved through the first mass transfer and the donor star death, a possible ensuing Be/X-ray binary phase, and they end when the mass gainer leaves the main sequence. Results.In our fiducial synthetic population, 8% of the OB stars in the SMC are post-mass transfer systems, and 7% are merger products. In many of our models, the mass gainers are spun up and form Oe/Be stars. While our model underpredicts the number of Be/X-ray binaries in the SMC, it reproduces the main features of their orbital period distribution and the observed number of SMC binary WR stars. We expect $\sim$50 OB+BH binaries below and $\sim$170 above 20d orbital period. The latter might produce merging double BHs. However, their progenitors, the predicted long-period WR+OB binaries, are not observed. Conclusions. While the comparison with the observed SMC stars supports many physics assumptions in our high-mass binary models, a better match of the large number of observed OBe stars and Be/X-ray binaries likely requires a lower merger rate and/or a higher mass transfer efficiency during the first mass transfer. The fate of the initially wide O star binaries remains uncertain.</description>

      <title>Populations of evolved massive binary stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud II: Predictions from rapid binary evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive star evolution plays a crucial role in astrophysics but bares large uncertainties. This problem becomes more severe by the majority of massive stars being born in close binary systems, whose evolution is affected by the interaction of their components. We want to constrain major uncertainties in massive binary star evolution, in particular the efficiency and the stability of the first mass transfer phase. We use the rapid population synthesis code ComBinE to generate synthetic populations of post-interaction binaries, assuming constant mass-transfer efficiency. We employ a new merger criterion that adjusts self-consistently to any prescribed mass-transfer efficiency. We tailor our synthetic populations to be comparable to the expected binary populations in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). We find that the observed populations of evolved massive binaries can not be reproduced with a single mass-transfer efficiency. Instead, a rather high efficiency (&gt;50%) is needed to reproduce the number of Be stars and Be/X-ray binaries in the SMC, while a low efficiency (~10%) leads to a better agreement with the observed number of Wolf-Rayet stars. We construct a corresponding mass-dependent mass-transfer efficiency recipe to produce our fiducial synthetic SMC post-interaction binary population. It reproduces the observed number and properties of the Be/X-ray and WR-binaries rather well, and is not in stark disagreement with the observed OBe star population. It further predicts two large, yet unobserved populations of OB+BH binaries, that is ~100 OB+BH systems with rather small orbital periods (&lt;20 days) and ~40 longer period OBe+BH systems.</description>

      <title>The wind properties of O-type stars at sub-SMC metallicity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiation-driven winds heavily influence the evolution and fate of massive stars. Feedback processes from these winds impact the properties of the interstellar medium of their host galaxies. The dependence of mass loss on stellar properties is poorly understood, particularly at low metallicity ($Z$). We aim to characterise stellar and wind properties of massive stars in Local Group dwarf galaxies with $Z$ below that of the Small Magellanic Cloud and confront our findings to theories of radiation-driven winds. We perform quantitative optical and UV spectroscopy on a sample of 11 O-type stars in nearby dwarf galaxies with $Z &lt; 0.2\,Z_\odot$. The stellar atmosphere code Fastwind and the genetic algorithm Kiwi-GA are used to determine stellar and wind parameters. Inhomogeneities in the wind are assumed to be optically thin. The winds of the sample stars are weak, with mass loss rates $\sim 10^{-9}-10^{-7}\,M_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$. Such feeble winds can only be constrained if UV spectra are available. The modified wind momentum as a function of luminosity ($L$) for stars in this $Z$ regime is in agreement with extrapolations to lower $Z$ of a recently established empirical relation for this quantity as a function of both $L$ and $Z$. However, theoretical prescriptions do not match our results or those of other recent analyses at low luminosity ($L \lesssim 10^{5.2}\,L_{\odot}$) and low $Z$; in this regime, they predict winds that are stronger by an order of magnitude or more. For our sample stars at $Z \sim 0.14\,Z_\odot$, with masses $\sim 30 - 50\,M_{\odot}$, stellar winds strip little mass during main-sequence evolution. However, if the steep dependence of mass loss on luminosity found here also holds for more massive stars at these metallicities, these may suffer as severely from main-sequence mass stripping as very massive stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud and Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Dust in the wind of outbursting young stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) are observed to undergo powerful accretion events known as FU Orionis outbursts (FUors). Such events of episodic accretion are now considered to be common during low mass star formation, wherein the accretion onto the protostar occurs through a surrounding centrifugal disk. Increasing evidence suggests that the magnetic disk winds are crucial for driving disk accretion, as they carry both mass and momentum away from the disk. Aims. We aim to investigate the phenomenon of the ejection of magnetic disk winds during episodic accretion, with a focus on the dust contained within these winds. Methods. We conduct magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of formation and evolution of protoplanetary disk (PPD) in the thin-disk limit. We include evolution of dust with two populations and a realistic prescription for viscosity during outbursts, which depends on the local thermal ionization fraction. The disk evolves with the concurrent action of viscosity, self-gravity and magnetic disk winds. Results. The simulated disk displays outbursting behavior in the early stages, with the duration and frequency of the bursts, their rise times, and brightness amplitudes resembling the observations of FUors. We find that during the outbursts, the winds are over an order of magnitude more dusty, as compared to in quiescence. However, despite this increased dust content, the winds are still dust-depleted as the dust-to-gas ratio is about an order of magnitude lower than the canonical interstellar value of 0.01. The results of our numerical experiments are in general agreement with the available observational findings and they shed a light on the mechanism behind production of dusty winds during outbursting events in YSOs.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Image Resolution of Solar Magnetograms: A Latent Diffusion Model Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spatial properties of the solar magnetic field are crucial to decoding the physical processes in the solar interior and their interplanetary effects. However, observations from older instruments, such as the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI), have limited spatial or temporal resolution, which hinders the ability to study small-scale solar features in detail. Super resolving these older datasets is essential for uniform analysis across different solar cycles, enabling better characterization of solar flares, active regions, and magnetic network dynamics. In this work, we introduce a novel diffusion model approach for Super-Resolution and we apply it to MDI magnetograms to match the higher-resolution capabilities of the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI). By training a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) with residuals on downscaled HMI data and fine-tuning it with paired MDI/HMI data, we can enhance the resolution of MDI observations from 2"/pixel to 0.5"/pixel. We evaluate the quality of the reconstructed images by means of classical metrics (e.g., PSNR, SSIM, FID and LPIPS) and we check if physical properties, such as the unsigned magnetic flux or the size of an active region, are preserved. We compare our model with different variations of LDM and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic models (DDPMs), but also with two deterministic architectures already used in the past for performing the Super-Resolution task. Furthermore, we show with an analysis in the Fourier domain that the LDM with residuals can resolve features smaller than 2", and due to the probabilistic nature of the LDM, we can asses their reliability, in contrast with the deterministic models. Future studies aim to super-resolve the temporal scale of the solar MDI instrument so that we can also have a better overview of the dynamics of the old events.</description>

      <title>Kepler's Platonic Model and Its Application to Exoplanetary Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Johannes Kepler's attempt to explain the arrangement of the six innermost planets of the Solar System using his Platonic Solid Model-which postulates that planetary orbits are nested within the five Platonic solids-was ultimately unsuccessful. However, while his model failed to describe our own planetary system, Kepler was remarkably prescient in hypothesizing the existence of exoplanetary systems that might conform to this geometric framework. In this study, we analyze all known multiple exoplanet systems containing three to six planets and identify those that best match the Keplerian Platonic model. Using a semi-major-axis (SMA) ratio metric defined as the sum of squared differences between observed and theoretical semi-major-axis ratios, we find that the most well-matched three-, four-, five-, and six-planet exoplanetary systems exhibit significantly lower discrepancy values $(4.38 \times 10^{-6}, 1.05 \times 10^{-2}, 8.21 \times 10^{-2}$, and $2.43 \times 10^{-1}$, respectively) compared to the inner six planets of the Solar System at 12.68. These results demonstrate that Kepler's Platonic Model is applicable to certain exoplanetary systems, suggesting that while the Solar System does not adhere to this idealized structure, other planetary systems may be governed by underlying geometric and mathematical principles akin to Kepler's vision. This study highlights the special nature of these exoplanetary systems and their potential alignment with the Platonic five-element framework.</description>

Abstract: We study line driven stellar winds using multifrequency, time-dependent radiation hydrodynamics. We compute the radiation force due to lines, the so called force multiplier, using precomputed photoionization tables and a time-dependent, local SED using a three band approximation within the hydro. We find that accounting for changes in the local SED changes the global properties of the flow. This is due to a combination of a change in the available momentum in the radiation field but also due to changes in the gas/radiation coupling mediated by the force multiplier. The acceleration can be suppressed, due to attenuation of UV flux but the force multiplier itself can be enhanced due to the overall SED hardening. We do not see evidence of a changing SED leading to formation or growth of azimuthal instabilities, as this effect appears subdominant to other instabilities in the wind. The computational methods presented can be extended to other outflow problems, notably multi-temperature disc winds and shocking in Wolf-Rayet stars.</description>

      <title>A semi-analytical model of the outer structure of protoplanetary discs formed by the collapse of a rotating molecular cloud</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Protoplanetary discs are formed due to the fragmentation and collapse of giant molecular cloud cores. The physical properties and structure of a formed disc are of great importance when studying the onset of planet formation processes. Aims. Starting from the isothermal collapse of a rotating Bonnor-Ebert sphere, and assuming the conservation of angular momentum, we look for the structure equations of the newly formed protoplanetary disc. We take into account the possible role of pressure gradient in forming the initial disc structure, and compare our results with those obtained from a Keplerian infall model. Our aim is to obtain initial conditions to numerically study the evolution of the gaseous and solid components of protoplanetary discs. Methods. The structure equations developed for protoplanetary discs have been derived analytically, while these equations have been solved numerically. Results. The surface density profiles of the newly formed protoplanetary discs strongly depend on the initial rotation state of the Bonnor-Ebert sphere. According to our results, for slow rotators, gravitational instabilities can develop in the early phases of disc formation, while for relatively fast rotators, the outermost regions of the resulting discs are gravitationally stable, quite massive and highly sub-Keplerian, allowing rapid dust transport to the inner disc and subsequent planet formation.</description>

      <title>The Laplace Surface of a Circumplanetary Disc</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical Laplace surface defines the location of circular particle orbits that do not undergo nodal precession around a planet with some obliquity. Close to the planet the surface coincides with the equator of the planet, while far from the planet it coincides with the orbital plane of the planet. We determine the shape of the Laplace surface of a circumplanetary disc that results from accretion of circumstellar gas and experiences the effects of gas pressure, self-gravity, and viscosity, as well as the gravitational effects due to the planetary spin and the star. We apply the linear theory of warped discs in the wavelike regime for a small-obliquity planet such as Jupiter. As a result of dissipation, a disc that begins slightly away from its Laplace surface will evolve to it. Because of pressure effects in typically warm circumplanetary discs, the disc is highly flattened compared with the classical Laplace surface, meaning that it is much less warped but still significantly tilted. For the case of Jupiter, the disc does not align anywhere with the equator of the planet. For such discs, the effects of self-gravity and viscosity on warping are typically small. The disc tilt is intermediate between the planet's equatorial and orbital planes. Circumplanetary discs that are much cooler than expected can undergo warping and alignment with the planet's equator at small radii. The results have implications for the orbital evolution of satellites in the solar system that are observed to be somewhat aligned with their classical Laplace surface.</description>

Abstract: We present the three-dimensional kinematics of classical Cepheids (CCs) in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) using Gaia DR3 data. By cross-matching the CCs obtained from the fourth phase of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment with Gaia DR3, we obtain distances and proper motions (PMs) for 4,236 CCs. Among them, 91 stars with available radial velocities (RVs) enable the construction of accurate relationship between distance and RV. Furthermore, we calculate the internal PMs of the CCs, providing the internal dynamics of the SMC while removing the distance projection effects. The CCs exhibit a northeast-southwest distance gradient, with internal PMs pointing northeast for nearer stars and southwest for more distant stars, indicating a northeast-southwest elongation. The RVs of the CCs show a northwest-southeast gradient, consistent with RVs of other stellar populations and suggesting that the SMC's northwest-southeast elongation results from interactions with the Large Magellanic Cloud. The distances and RVs of the CCs are nearly uncorrelated, implying that the two elongations arise from distinct causes.</description>

      <title>The Cosmic One-Eyed Smile: Revealing the Hidden Face of Mike Wazowski</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel and somewhat whimsical approach to pulsar hotspot modeling by drawing inspiration from the iconic one-eyed monster, Mike Wazowski, from \emph{Monsters, Inc.}. Utilizing X-ray high-quality timing data from NICER, we apply a Bayesian inference framework to model the X-ray pulse profile of PSR J0437--4715. Our analysis employs a \emph{Wazowski Configuration} (WC) in which the conventional hotspot parametrization is replaced with a predefined image template, whose redness and size are adjusted to mimic temperature variations. The results reveal a configuration where two hotspots--one brighter and smaller in the north represents the energetic ``University time Wazowski", and one larger yet cooler in the south represents the ``Monster, Inc. time Wazowski"--combine to produce the observed X-ray pulse profile. These findings not only demonstrate the sensitivity of pulse profile modeling to hotspot morphology but also open up the intriguing possibility that the X-ray emission of some pulsars may be interpreted as a cosmic homage to our favorite animated character.</description>

      <title>Stellar parameters, extinction, and distances for stars in SMSS DR2 by SPar method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The availability of large datasets containing stellar parameters, distances, and extinctions for stars in the Milky Way, particularly within the Galactic disk, is essential for advancing our understanding of the Galaxy's stellar populations, structure, kinematics, and chemical evolution. In this study, we present a catalog of stellar parameters, including effective temperature (\teff), metallicity (\feh), absolute magnitudes ($M_{G}$), distances ($d$), and reddening values (\ebr), for a sample of 141 million stars from the SkyMapper Southern Survey (SMSS). These parameters are derived using the SPar algorithm, which employs a fitting procedure to match multi-band photometric observations and estimate the stellar properties (\teff, \feh, $M_G$, $d$, and \ebr) on an individual star basis, following the methodology outlined in our previous work. This study successfully determines stellar parameters and extinction values simultaneously for stars located in high and low Galactic latitudes. The resulting stellar parameters and extinction values are in good agreement with results from other studies, demonstrating the robustness of our method. We derive a temperature dispersion of 195\,K and a metallicity dispersion of 0.31\,dex when comparing our results with spectroscopic data. The catalog produced in this work provides a valuable resource for future research on the Galactic metallicity distribution function, the structure of the Galaxy, three-dimensional extinction mapping, and other related astrophysical topics.</description>

      <title>Class I/II Jets with JWST: Mass loss rates, Asymmetries, and Binary induced Wigglings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present JWST NIRSpec spectro-imaging observations of jets from four edge-on protoplanetary disks that exhibit clear signatures of MHD disk winds. Bipolar jets are detected and spatially resolved in over 30 shock-excited forbidden lines, multiple Paschen and Brackett series lines of atomic hydrogen, and the high-energy excitation line of atomic helium (1.083 um). This helium line is the brightest jet-tracer towards HH 30 and FS TauB, which also exhibit asymmetric intensity between their red- and blue-shifted lobes in all tracers, including the [Fe II] and [He I] lines. Extinction maps reveal no significant differences across the lobes, suggesting an asymmetric jet-launching mechanism rather than environmental effects. Diagnostic line ratios yield consistent shock speeds of 50-60 km/s, jet ionization fractions of 0.1-0.2, and pre-shock electron densities of 1000 /cm^3. Combined with pixel-by-pixel electron density maps and [Fe II] line luminosities, we estimate jet mass-loss rates using three independent methods, averaging around a few 10^(-9) solar masses/yr. We estimate the accretion rates for these sources as 10 times the jet mass loss rates and find them to match well with the independently derived accretion estimates of other Class II sources in the Taurus star-forming region. Owing to JWST's high precision, we also investigate jet wiggling and find Tau 042021 to showcase the perfect case of mirror-symmetric wiggling, which can only be explained by the motion of the jet source around a stellar companion. Modeling this wiggling suggests Tau 042021 to host 0.33 and 0.07 solar masses binary at the center with binary separation of 1.35 au and an orbital period of 2.5 years.</description>

      <title>Test and Calibration of the Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SUIT) on board Aditya-L1</title>

Abstract: The Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SUIT) on board the AdityaL1 mission observes the Sun in the 200-400 nm wavelength range. This paper presents the results of various on ground and on board tests and their comparison with the specifications. Moreover, we also present the scheme for data calibration. We demonstrate that the test results are compliant with the specified figures, except the spatial resolution. Such discrepancy will limit the photometric measurements only, at a scale of 2.2" instead of 1.4" as originally envisioned. The results obtained here show that SUIT observations open up a new window for solar observations.</description>

      <title>Dual-band Unified Exploration of Three CMZ Clouds (DUET). Cloud-wide census of continuum sources showing low spectral indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Milky Way's Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) is measured to form stars 10 times less efficiently than in the Galactic disk, based on emission from high-mass stars. However, the CMZ's low-mass protostellar population, which accounts for most of the initial stellar mass budget and star formation rate (SFR), is poorly constrained observationally due to limited sensitivity and resolution. We present the Dual-band Unified Exploration of Three CMZ Clouds (DUET) survey, targeting the 20 km/s Cloud, Sgr C, and Dust Ridge cloud e using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at 1.3 and 3 mm. The mosaicked observations achieve a comparable resolution of 0.2-0.3" (~1600-2500 au) and a sky coverage of 8.3-10.4 square arcmin, respectively. We report 563 continuum sources at 1.3 mm and 330 at 3 mm, respectively, and a dual-band catalog with 450 continuum sources. These sources are marginally resolved at the 2,000 au resolution. We find a cloud-wide deviation (&gt;70%) from commonly-used dust modified blackbody (MBB) models, characterized by either low spectral indices or low brightness temperatures. Three possible explanations for the deviation are discussed. (1) Optically thick Class 0/I Young stellar objects (YSOs) with very small beam filling factors can lead to lower brightness temperatures than what MBB models predict. (2) Large (mm/cm-sized) dust grains have more significant self-scattering, and therefore frequency-dependent albedo could cause lower spectral indices. (3) Free-free emission over 30 uJy can severely contaminate dust emission and cause low spectral indices for mJy sources in our sample, although the needed number of massive protostars (embedded UCHII regions) is infeasibly high for the normal stellar initial mass function. A reliable measurement of the SFR at low protostellar masses will require future work to distinguish between these possible explanations.</description>

      <title>Written in the Stars: How your (pens and) papers decide the fate of the arXiverse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We all love the ecstasy that comes with submitting papers to journals or arXiv. Some have described it as yeeting their back-breaking products of labor into the void, wishing they could never deal with them ever again. The very act of yeeting papers onto arXiv contributes to the expansion of the arXiverse; however, we have yet to quantify our contribution to the cause. In this work, I investigate the expansion of the arXiverse using the arXiv astro-ph submission data from 1992 to date. I coin the term "the arXiverse constant", $a_0$, to quantify the rate of expansion of the arXiverse. I find that astro-ph as a whole has a positive $a_0$, but this does not always hold true for the six subcategories of astro-ph. I then investigate the temporal changes in $a_0$ for the astro-ph subcategories and astro-ph as a whole, from which I infer the fate of the arXiverse.</description>

      <title>Systematic Search for FFPs in KMTNet Full-Frame Images. I. Photometry Pipeline</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To exhume the buried signatures of free-floating planets (FFPs) with small angular Einstein radius $\theta_\mathrm{E}$, we build a new full-frame difference image for the Korean Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet) survey based on the newly optimized pySIS package. We introduce the detailed processes of the new pipeline, including frame registration, difference image analysis, and light curve extraction. To test this pipeline, we extract the light curves for 483,068 stars with $I \lesssim 17$ and conduct a model-independent search for microlensing events. The search finds 36 microlensing events, including five new events and six events discovered by other collaborations but missed by previous KMTNet searches. We find that the light curves from the new pipeline are precise enough to be sensitive to FFPs with $\theta_\mathrm{E} \sim 1~\mu$as. Using the new pipeline, a complete FFP search on the eight-year KMTNet images can be finished within six months and then yield the FFP mass function. The new pipeline can be used for a new KMTNet AlertFinder system, with significantly reduced false positives.</description>

      <title>Non-linear saturation of gravito-inertial modes excited by tidal resonances in binary neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During the last seconds of a binary neutron-star merger, the tidal force can excite stellar oscillation modes to large amplitudes. From the perspective of premerger electromagnetic emissions and next-generation gravitational-wave detectors, gravity ($g-$) modes constitute a propitious class. However, existing estimates for their impact employ linear schemes which may be inaccurate for large amplitudes, as achieved by tidal resonances. With rotation, inertial modes can be excited as well and while their non-linear saturation has been studied, an extension to fully-consistent gravito-inertial modes, especially in the neutron-star context, is an open problem. We study the linear and non-linear saturation of gravito-inertial modes and investigate the astrophysical consequences for binary neutron-star mergers, including the possibility of resonance-induced dynamo activity. A new (non-)linear formulation based on the separation of equilibrium and dynamical tides is developed. Implementing this into the 3D pseudo-spectral code MagIC, a suite of non-linear simulations of tidally-excited flows with an entropy/composition gradient in a stably-stratified Boussinesq spherical-shell are carried out. The new formulation accurately reproduces results of linear calculations for gravito-inertial modes with a free surface for low frequencies. For a constant-density cavity, we show that the axisymmetric differential rotation induced by nonlinear $_2g$ and $_1g$ modes may theoretically be large enough to amplify an ambient magnetic field to $\gtrsim 10^{14}$ G. In addition, rich non-linear dynamics are observed in the form of a parametric instability for the $_1g$ mode. The stars are also spun-up, which extends the resonance window for any given mode.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Popular culture plays a significant role in shaping public interest in science, and Taylor Swift's discography frequently incorporates astrophysics terminology. This study examines the occurrence of astrophysics-related words in her lyrics and their representation in the Eras tour set list. By analyzing the frequency of words in Swift's total discography, we identify that astrophysics is promoted the most within her most recent album, The Tortured Poets Department, whereas songs from Midnights promoted astrophysics the most throughout the Eras tour. We catagorize words into various disciplines of astrophysics and find that multimessenger astronomy is promoted the most, both in Swift's total discography and throughout the Eras tour. We perform Taylor expansion and predict $12 \pm 5$ astrophysical terms in Swift's next album. This analysis offers a unique perspective on the intersection of music and science, revealing how Swift's artistry may unintentionally promote interest in different fields of astrophysics.</description>

      <title>The edge-on disk Tau042021: icy grains at high altitudes and a wind containing astronomical PAHs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectra of the nearly edge-on protoplanetary disks observed with the JWST have shown ice absorption bands of varying optical depths and peculiar profiles, challenging radiative transfer modelling and our understanding of dust and ice in disks. We build models including dust grain size, shape, and composition to reproduce JWST IFU spectroscopy of the large edge-on disk Tau042021. We explore radiative transfer models using different dust grain size distributions, including grains of effective radii a_eff = 0.005-3000 microns. Scattering properties of distributions of triaxial ellipsoidal grains are calculated. We consider compositions with silicates, amorphous carbon, and mixtures of H2O, CO2, and CO. We use RADMC-3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer models of Tau042021 to simulate the spectral cubes observed with JWST-NIRSpec and MIRI. We compare the results to observations, including H2O at 3.05 microns, CO at 4.67 microns, and CO2 at 4.27 microns and to archival JWST-NIRCam and ALMA continuum images. The observed near- to mid-infrared imply dust distributions with grain sizes up to several tens of microns. The intensity distribution perpendicular to the disk exhibits emission profile wings extending into the upper disk atmosphere at altitudes exceeding the classical scale height expected in the isothermal hydrostatic limit. We produce ice map images demonstrating the presence of icy dust grains up to altitudes high above the disk midplane, more than three hydrostatic equilibrium scale heights. We demonstrate the presence of a wind containing the carriers of astronomical PAH bands. The wind appears as an X-shaped emission at 3.3, 6.2, 7.7 and 11.3 microns, characteristic wavelengths of the infrared astronomical PAH bands. We associate the spatial distribution of this component with carriers of astronomical PAH bands that form a layer of emission at the interface with the H2 wind.</description>

      <title>Resolving the baryon assymmetry with RATS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current leading theories of physics such as the Big Bang, the standard model of particle physics, and general relativity suggest that the universe should contain an equal amount of matter and antimatter. Yet observations have found a disproportionately large amount of matter, a phenomenon known as the baryon assymmetry problem. Since century-old established theories are traditionally impossible to refute, the only possible explanation is that the remaining antimatter is hidden in plain sight and remains to be observed. We propose the existence of anti-stars to solve the baryon assymetry in our new Reasonable Antimatter Theory of Stars (RATS). In this context, the RATS will create a framework to resolve the traditional tension between observers and theorists, and thus contribute to the peaceful and collaborative spirit of astronomy. Our method is the firing of neurons in our brains, typically known as a thought experiment. We still have no idea why or how this works, but it must be good because most of science was created this way. Our results are the result of our methods, which result in some text and the resulting conclusions. In order to encourage the reader to reach the end of this short paper, we do not want to spoil the conclusions here. Instead, the conclusions will conclude the paper.</description>

      <title>Temporal Correlation between Positive-Charged Cosmic Ray Flux and Solar Polar Field Variation: Insights from Delayed Modulation Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the time-dependent modulation of galactic cosmic rays near Earth, with a focus on the cosmic proton flux and polar field. Using data from the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) and the Wilcox Solar Observatory, we identify a significant time-lagged relationship between the observation of two missions. Our model incorporates a weighted magnetic field parameter to address the hemispheric asymmetry in polar fields and captures the temporal evolution of cosmic-ray proton spectra in relation to solar activity. We find a time lag of approximately 10 months, varying with cosmic ray rigidity. At 1 GV, the time lag is 360 days, while it is 300 days above 3 GV. A potential mechanism is proposed to explain the observed time-lagged relationship and its dependence on cosmic ray rigidity. This offers predictive insights into cosmic ray modulation within the heliosphere. These results enhance the accuracy of space weather forecasting models, with significant implications for the safety of space missions and aviation.</description>

      <title>Testing the Rossby Paradigm: Weakened Magnetic Braking in early K-type Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is an intricate relationship between the organization of large-scale magnetic fields by a stellar dynamo and the rate of angular momentum loss due to magnetized stellar winds. An essential ingredient for the operation of a large-scale dynamo is the Coriolis force, which imprints organizing flows on the global convective patterns and inhibits the complete cancellation of bipolar magnetic regions. Consequently, it is natural to expect a rotational threshold for large-scale dynamo action and for the efficient angular momentum loss that it mediates through magnetic braking. Here we present new observational constraints on magnetic braking for an evolutionary sequence of six early K-type stars. To determine the wind braking torque for each of our targets, we combine spectropolarimetric constraints on the large-scale magnetic field, Ly-alpha or X-ray constraints on the mass-loss rate, as well as uniform estimates of the stellar rotation period, mass, and radius. As identified previously from similar observations of hotter stars, we find that the wind braking torque decreases abruptly by more than an order of magnitude at a critical value of the stellar Rossby number. Given that all of the stars in our sample exhibit clear activity cycles, we suggest that weakened magnetic braking may coincide with the operation of a subcritical stellar dynamo.</description>

      <title>Chromospherically active stars: Chemical composition of photospheres in 20 RS CVn stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Various element transport processes modify the photospheric chemical composition of low-mass stars during their evolution. The most prominent one is the first dredge-up that occurs at the beginning of the red giant branch. Then, various extra-mixing processes, such as those caused by thermohaline- and/or rotation-induced mixing, come into action. The extent of the influence of stellar magnetic activity on alterations in stellar chemical composition is among the least studied questions. Aims. To investigate how magnetic activity influences mixing in the atmospheres of magnetically active stars, we carried out a detailed study of C, N, and up to ten other chemical element abundances, as well as carbon isotope ratios in a sample of RS CVn stars. Methods. Using a differential model atmosphere method, we analysed high-resolution spectra that had been observed with the VUES spectrograph on the 1.65 m telescope at the Moletai Astronomical Observatory of Vilnius University. Abundances of other chemical elements were determined from equivalent widths or spectral syntheses of unblended spectral lines. Results. We determined the main atmospheric parameters and abundances of up to 12 chemical elements for a sample of 20 RS CVn giants that represented different evolutionary stages. We determined that *29 Dra, *b01 Cyg, and V* V834 Her, which are in the evolutionary stage below the red giant branch luminosity bump, already show evidence of extra-mixing in their lowered carbon isotope ratios. Conclusions. We provide observational evidence that in low-mass chromospherically active RS CVn stars, due to their magnetic activity, extra-mixing processes may start acting below the luminosity bump of the red giant branch.</description>

      <title>Binarity at LOw Metallicity (BLOeM): Enhanced multiplicity of early B-type dwarfs and giants at $Z=0.2\,{\rm Z}_\odot$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Early B-type stars ($M_i=8-15$ M$_\odot$) are frequently in multiple systems, as evidenced by spectroscopic campaigns in the Milky Way (MW) and the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Previous studies have shown no strong metallicity dependence in the close-binary (a&gt;10 au) fraction or orbital-period distributions between the MW's solar metallicity (Z$_\odot$) and that of the LMC (Z=0.5 Z$_\odot$). However, similar analyses in more metal-poor environments are still scarce. We focus on 309 early B-type stars (luminosity classes III-V) from the Binarity at LOw Metallicity campaign in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC, Z=0.2 Z$_\odot$) using VLT/FLAMES multi-epoch spectroscopy. By applying binary detection criteria consistent with previous works, we identify 153 stars (91 SB1, 59 SB2, 3 SB3) exhibiting significant radial-velocity (RV) variations, resulting in an observed multiplicity fraction of $f^{obs}_{mult}=50\pm3\%$. Using Monte Carlo simulations to account for observational biases, we infer an intrinsic close-binary fraction of $f_{mult}=80\pm8\%$. A Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis of the peak-to-peak RV distribution ($\Delta{\rm RV}_{\rm max}$) confirms a high multiplicity fraction of $f_{mult}=78\pm5\%$. These findings suggest a possible anti-correlation between metallicity and the fraction of close B-type binaries, with the SMC multiplicity fraction significantly exceeding previous measurements in the LMC and MW. The enhanced fraction of close binaries at SMC's low metallicity may have broad implications for massive-star evolution in the early Universe. More frequent mass transfer and envelope stripping could boost the production of exotic transients, stripped supernovae, gravitational-wave progenitors, and sustained UV ionising flux, potentially affecting cosmic reionisation. Theoretical predictions of binary evolution under metal-poor conditions will provide a key test of our results.</description>

      <title>Revisiting inelastic Cu+H collisions and the non-LTE Galactic evolution of copper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Galactic evolution of copper remains poorly understood, partly due to the strong departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) affecting Cu I lines. A key source of uncertainty in non-LTE modelling is the treatment of inelastic Cu+H collisions. We present new rate coefficients based on a combined asymptotic LCAO and free electron model approach, which show significant differences from previous calculations. Applying these updated rates to non-LTE stellar modelling, we find reduced line-to-line scatter and improved consistency between metal-poor dwarfs and giants. Our non-LTE analysis reveals a strong upturn in the [Cu/Fe] trend towards lower [Fe/H] &lt; -1.7. We show that this may reflect the interplay between external enrichment of Cu-rich material of the Milky Way halo at low metallicities, and metallicity-dependent Cu yields from rapidly rotating massive stars. This highlights the unique diagnostic potential of accurate Cu abundances for understanding both stellar and Galactic evolution.</description>

      <title>Let there be neutrons! Hadronic photoproduction from a large flux of high-energy photons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose that neutrons may be generated in high-energy, high-flux photon environments via photo-induced reactions on pre-existing baryons. These photohadronic interactions are expected to occur in astrophysical jets and surrounding material. Historically, these reactions have been attributed to the production of high-energy cosmic rays and neutrinos. We estimate the photoproduction off of protons in the context of gamma-ray bursts, where it is expected there will be sufficient baryonic material that may be encompassing or entrained in the jet. We show that typical stellar baryonic material, even material completely devoid of neutrons, can become inundated with neutrons in situ via hadronic photoproduction. Consequently, this mechanism provides a means for collapsars and other astrophysical sites containing substantial flux of high-energy photons to be favorable for neutron-capture nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <title>Light curves and spectra for stellar collisions between main-sequence stars in galactic nuclei</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05265v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-velocity stellar collisions in galactic nuclei produce ejecta that generate potentially observable electromagnetic radiation, making them promising nuclear transients. However, the photometric and spectroscopic properties of these collisions, which would more frequently involve main-sequence stars, remain largely unexplored. Here, using 3D hydrodynamics and 1D radiative-transfer simulations, we investigate the properties and observables of the debris produced in high-velocity collisions between terminal-age main-sequence stars, covering a wide range of collision configurations. The ejecta produce bright ultraviolet (UV) flares with bolometric luminosities typically peaking at $\gtrsim10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, declining steeply as $t^{-2}-t^{-4}$ to reach $\gtrsim10^{41}-10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at 0.5 d and leveling off on a plateau at $10^{39}-10^{41.5}$ erg s$^{-1}$ ($M_V$ between $-$10 to $-$15 mag) after a few days. Their spectra evolve considerably during the first few days, morphing from UV- to optical-dominated. The UV range shows numerous resonance transitions from metals like C, N, and O, whereas the optical primarily shows H I Balmer lines. These properties are qualitatively similar to those observed, as well as obtained in models of Type II supernovae. Observables from these events exhibit clear correlations with collision configurations, including impact parameter, relative velocity, and stellar masses. We provide fitting formulae to describe these correlations. Detecting these flares requires sub-day cadence surveys such as ULTRASAT, combined with spectroscopic observations to disentangle degeneracies and infer collision characteristics.</description>

      <title>The Nature of Gravitational Wave Events with Host Environment Escape Velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel method to probe the parameters and origin channels of gravitational wave events using the escape velocities of their host environments. This method could lead to more convergent posterior distributions offering additional insights into the physical properties, formation, and evolution of the sources. The method provides more accurate parameter estimation for events that represent previous mergers in the hierarchical triple merger scenario and is valuable for the search for such mergers with third-generation ground-based detectors. To demonstrate this approach, we take six recently identified events in LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA data, considered as potential previous mergers in hierarchical triple mergers, as examples. The use of escape velocities results in posterior spin distributions that are concentrated near zero, aligning with the expected birth spins of first-generation black holes formed from the collapse of stars. The uncertainty in the posterior primary mass distribution is significantly reduced comparing with the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA distributions, especially for events modeled under the assumption of a globular cluster origin scenario. We rule out the possibility that GW190512, GW170729, and GW190708 originates from globular clusters as previous mergers in the hierarchical triple merger scenario.</description>

      <title>Unveiling What Makes Saturn Ring: Quantifying the Amplitudes of Saturn's Planetary Normal-Mode Oscillations and Trends in C-Ring Properties Using Kronoseismology (VII)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Certain spiral density waves in Saturn's rings are generated through resonances with planetary normal modes, making them valuable probes of Saturn's internal structure. Previous research has primarily focused on the rotation rates of these waves. However, other characteristics of these waves also contain valuable information about the planet's interior. In this work, we investigate the amplitudes of the waves across the C-ring by analyzing high signal-to-noise profiles derived from phase-corrected averages of occultation profiles obtained by Cassini's Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS). By fitting these wave profiles to linear density wave models, we estimate the ring's surface mass density, mass extinction coefficient and effective kinematic viscosity at 34 locations in the C-ring, as well as the amplitude of the gravitational potential perturbations associated with 6 satellite resonances and 28 planetary normal mode resonances. Our estimates of the C-ring's mass extinction coefficient, indicate that the typical particle mass density is around 0.3 g/cm^3 interior to 84,000 km, but can get as low as 0.03 g/cm^3 exterior to 84,000 km. We also find the ring's viscosity is reduced in the outer C-ring, which is consistent with the exceptionally high porosity of the particles in this region. Meanwhile, we find the amplitudes of Saturn's normal modes are complex functions of frequency, l and m, implying that multiple factors influence how efficiently these modes are excited. This analysis identified two primary sources of these normal-mode oscillations: a deep source located close to Saturn's core, and a shallow source residing near the surface.</description>

      <title>Beyond monoculture: polydisperse moment methods for sub-stellar atmosphere cloud microphysics I. Examining properties of the exponential distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observational data provided by JWST instruments continue to challenge theories and models of cloud formation in sub-stellar atmospheres, requiring more sophisticated approaches in an effort to understand their spatial complexity. However, to date, most cloud microphysical models using the moment method for sub-stellar atmospheres have assumed a monodisperse size distribution, neglecting polydisperse properties. We aim to extend beyond the common assumption of a monodisperse size distribution and analyse cloud microphysical processes assuming an exponential distribution. We derive expressions for the zeroth and first moments of condensation/evaporation and collisional growth processes under the assumption of an exponential size distribution. We then compare the differences between monodisperse and exponential distribution microphysics using a simple one-dimensional (1D) column model applied to a Y-dwarf KCl cloud scenario. We find that adopting an exponential distribution modifies condensation/evaporation rates by a factor of $\approx$0.9 and collisional growth rates by factors of $\approx$1.1 (Kn $\ll$ 1) and $\approx$0.92 (Kn $\gg$ 1) for Brownian coagulation and $\approx$0.85 for gravitational coalescence, compared to the monodisperse case. In our specific test cases, we find relative differences of a maximum 10-12% in total number density and 2-3% in mean radius of the cloud particles between the monodisperse and exponential distributions. Our results offer a simple way to take into account an assumed exponential size distribution for sub-stellar atmospheric cloud microphysics using the two-moment method. In follow up studies, we will examine more complex distributions, such as the log-normal and gamma distributions, that require more than two moments to characterise self-consistently.</description>
