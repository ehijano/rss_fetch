      <title>Illusions of Intimacy: Emotional Attachment and Emerging Psychological Risks in Human-AI Relationships</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emotionally responsive social chatbots, such as those produced by Replika and Character.AI, increasingly serve as companions that offer empathy, support, and entertainment. While these systems appear to meet fundamental human needs for connection, they raise concerns about how artificial intimacy affects emotional regulation, well-being, and social norms. Prior research has focused on user perceptions or clinical contexts but lacks large-scale, real-world analysis of how these interactions unfold. This paper addresses that gap by analyzing over 30K user-shared conversations with social chatbots to examine the emotional dynamics of human-AI relationships. Using computational methods, we identify patterns of emotional mirroring and synchrony that closely resemble how people build emotional connections. Our findings show that users-often young, male, and prone to maladaptive coping styles-engage in parasocial interactions that range from affectionate to abusive. Chatbots consistently respond in emotionally consistent and affirming ways. In some cases, these dynamics resemble toxic relationship patterns, including emotional manipulation and self-harm. These findings highlight the need for guardrails, ethical design, and public education to preserve the integrity of emotional connection in an age of artificial companionship.</description>

      <title>Trajectory-Integrated Accessibility Analysis of Public Electric Vehicle Charging Stations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure is crucial for advancing EV adoption, managing charging loads, and ensuring equitable transportation electrification. However, there remains a notable gap in comprehensive accessibility metrics that integrate the mobility of the users. This study introduces a novel accessibility metric, termed Trajectory-Integrated Public EVCS Accessibility (TI-acs), and uses it to assess public electric vehicle charging station (EVCS) accessibility for approximately 6 million residents in the San Francisco Bay Area based on detailed individual trajectory data in one week. Unlike conventional home-based metrics, TI-acs incorporates the accessibility of EVCS along individuals' travel trajectories, bringing insights on more public charging contexts, including public charging near workplaces and charging during grid off-peak periods.
  As of June 2024, given the current public EVCS network, Bay Area residents have, on average, 7.5 hours and 5.2 hours of access per day during which their stay locations are within 1 km (i.e. 10-12 min walking) of a public L2 and DCFC charging port, respectively. Over the past decade, TI-acs has steadily increased from the rapid expansion of the EV market and charging infrastructure. However, spatial disparities remain significant, as reflected in Gini indices of 0.38 (L2) and 0.44 (DCFC) across census tracts. Additionally, our analysis reveals racial disparities in TI-acs, driven not only by variations in charging infrastructure near residential areas but also by differences in their mobility patterns.</description>

      <title>Community detection of hypergraphs by Ricci flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Community detection in hypergraphs is both instrumental for functional module identification and intricate due to higher-order interactions among nodes. We define a hypergraph Ricci flow that directly operates on higher-order interactions of hypergraphs and prove long-time existence of the flow. Building on this theoretical foundation, we develop HyperRCD-a Ricci-flow-based community detection approach that deforms hyperedge weights through curvature-driven evolution, which provides an effective mathematical representation of higher-order interactions mediated by weighted hyperedges between nodes. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world hypergraphs demonstrate that HyperRCD exhibits remarkable enhanced robustness to topological variations and competitive performance across diverse datasets.</description>

      <title>SIS Epidemic Modelling on Homogeneous Networked System: General Recovering Process and Mean-Field Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although we have made progress in understanding disease spread in complex systems with non-Poissonian activity patterns, current models still fail to capture the full range of recovery time distributions. In this paper, we propose an extension of the classic susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model, called the general recovering process SIS (grp-SIS) model. This model incorporates arbitrary recovery time distributions for infected nodes within the system. We derive the mean-field equations assuming a homogeneous network, provide solutions for specific recovery time distributions, and investigate the probability density function (PDF) for infection times in the system's steady state. Our findings show that recovery time distributions significantly affect disease dynamics, and we suggest several future research directions, including extending the model to arbitrary infection processes and using the quasistationary method to address deviations in numerical results.</description>

      <title>Pre-trained Prompt-driven Community Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The "pre-train, prompt" paradigm is widely adopted in various graph-based tasks and has shown promising performance in community detection. Most existing semi-supervised community detection algorithms detect communities based on known ones, and the detected communities typically do not contain the given query node. Therefore, they are not suitable for searching the community of a given node. Motivated by this, we adopt this paradigm into the semi-supervised community search for the first time and propose Pre-trained Prompt-driven Community Search (PPCS), a novel model designed to enhance search accuracy and efficiency. PPCS consists of three main components: node encoding, sample generation, and prompt-driven fine-tuning. Specifically, the node encoding component employs graph neural networks to learn local structural patterns of nodes in a graph, thereby obtaining representations for nodes and communities. Next, the sample generation component identifies an initial community for a given node and selects known communities that are structurally similar to the initial one as training samples. Finally, the prompt-driven fine-tuning component leverages these samples as prompts to guide the final community prediction. Experimental results on five real-world datasets demonstrate that PPCS performs better than baseline algorithms. It also achieves higher community search efficiency than semi-supervised community search baseline methods, with ablation studies verifying the effectiveness of each component of PPCS.</description>

      <title>Community Search in Time-dependent Road-social Attributed Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world networks often involve both keywords and locations, along with travel time variations between locations due to traffic conditions. However, most existing cohesive subgraph-based community search studies utilize a single attribute, either keywords or locations, to identify communities. They do not simultaneously consider both keywords and locations, which results in low semantic or spatial cohesiveness of the detected communities, and they fail to account for variations in travel time. Additionally, these studies traverse the entire network to build efficient indexes, but the detected community only involves nodes around the query node, leading to the traversal of nodes that are not relevant to the community. Therefore, we propose the problem of discovering semantic-spatial aware k-core, which refers to a k-core with high semantic and time-dependent spatial cohesiveness containing the query node. To address this problem, we propose an exact and a greedy algorithm, both of which gradually expand outward from the query node. They are local methods that only access the local part of the attributed network near the query node rather than the entire network. Moreover, we design a method to calculate the semantic similarity between two keywords using large language models. This method alleviates the disadvantages of keyword-matching methods used in existing community search studies, such as mismatches caused by differently expressed synonyms and the presence of irrelevant words. Experimental results show that the greedy algorithm outperforms baselines in terms of structural, semantic, and time-dependent spatial cohesiveness.</description>

      <title>Framework of Voting Prediction of Parliament Members</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Keeping track of how lawmakers vote is essential for government transparency. While many parliamentary voting records are available online, they are often difficult to interpret, making it challenging to understand legislative behavior across parliaments and predict voting outcomes. Accurate prediction of votes has several potential benefits, from simplifying parliamentary work by filtering out bills with a low chance of passing to refining proposed legislation to increase its likelihood of approval. In this study, we leverage advanced machine learning and data analysis techniques to develop a comprehensive framework for predicting parliamentary voting outcomes across multiple legislatures. We introduce the Voting Prediction Framework (VPF) - a data-driven framework designed to forecast parliamentary voting outcomes at the individual legislator level and for entire bills. VPF consists of three key components: (1) Data Collection - gathering parliamentary voting records from multiple countries using APIs, web crawlers, and structured databases; (2) Parsing and Feature Integration - processing and enriching the data with meaningful features, such as legislator seniority, and content-based characteristics of a given bill; and (3) Prediction Models - using machine learning to forecast how each parliament member will vote and whether a bill is likely to pass. The framework will be open source, enabling anyone to use or modify the framework. To evaluate VPF, we analyzed over 5 million voting records from five countries - Canada, Israel, Tunisia, the United Kingdom and the USA. Our results show that VPF achieves up to 85% precision in predicting individual votes and up to 84% accuracy in predicting overall bill outcomes. These findings highlight VPF's potential as a valuable tool for political analysis, policy research, and enhancing public access to legislative decision-making.</description>

      <title>HyperDet: Source Detection in Hypergraphs via Interactive Relationship Construction and Feature-rich Attention Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypergraphs offer superior modeling capabilities for social networks, particularly in capturing group phenomena that extend beyond pairwise interactions in rumor propagation. Existing approaches in rumor source detection predominantly focus on dyadic interactions, which inadequately address the complexity of more intricate relational structures. In this study, we present a novel approach for Source Detection in Hypergraphs (HyperDet) via Interactive Relationship Construction and Feature-rich Attention Fusion. Specifically, our methodology employs an Interactive Relationship Construction module to accurately model both the static topology and dynamic interactions among users, followed by the Feature-rich Attention Fusion module, which autonomously learns node features and discriminates between nodes using a self-attention mechanism, thereby effectively learning node representations under the framework of accurately modeled higher-order relationships. Extensive experimental validation confirms the efficacy of our HyperDet approach, showcasing its superiority relative to current state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>SourceDetMamba: A Graph-aware State Space Model for Source Detection in Sequential Hypergraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Source detection on graphs has demonstrated high efficacy in identifying rumor origins. Despite advances in machine learning-based methods, many fail to capture intrinsic dynamics of rumor propagation. In this work, we present SourceDetMamba: A Graph-aware State Space Model for Source Detection in Sequential Hypergraphs, which harnesses the recent success of the state space model Mamba, known for its superior global modeling capabilities and computational efficiency, to address this challenge. Specifically, we first employ hypergraphs to model high-order interactions within social networks. Subsequently, temporal network snapshots generated during the propagation process are sequentially fed in reverse order into Mamba to infer underlying propagation dynamics. Finally, to empower the sequential model to effectively capture propagation patterns while integrating structural information, we propose a novel graph-aware state update mechanism, wherein the state of each node is propagated and refined by both temporal dependencies and topological context. Extensive evaluations on eight datasets demonstrate that SourceDetMamba consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Counting Graphlets of Size $k$ under Local Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of counting subgraphs or graphlets under local differential privacy is an important challenge that has attracted significant attention from researchers. However, much of the existing work focuses on small graphlets like triangles or $k$-stars. In this paper, we propose a non-interactive, locally differentially private algorithm capable of counting graphlets of any size $k$. When $n$ is the number of nodes in the input graph, we show that the expected $\ell_2$ error of our algorithm is $O(n^{k - 1})$. Additionally, we prove that there exists a class of input graphs and graphlets of size $k$ for which any non-interactive counting algorithm incurs an expected $\ell_2$ error of $\Omega(n^{k - 1})$, demonstrating the optimality of our result. Furthermore, we establish that for certain input graphs and graphlets, any locally differentially private algorithm must have an expected $\ell_2$ error of $\Omega(n^{k - 1.5})$. Our experimental results show that our algorithm is more accurate than the classical randomized response method.</description>

      <title>Measuring Social Influence with Networked Synthetic Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring social influence is difficult due to the lack of counter-factuals and comparisons. By combining machine learning-based modeling and network science, we present general properties of social value, a recent measure for social influence using synthetic control applicable to political behavior. Social value diverges from centrality measures on in that it relies on an external regressor to predict an output variable of interest, generates a synthetic measure of influence, then distributes individual contribution based on a social network. Through theoretical derivations, we show the properties of SV under linear regression with and without interaction, across lattice networks, power-law networks, and random graphs. A reduction in computation can be achieved for any ensemble model. Through simulation, we find that the generalized friendship paradox holds -- that in certain situations, your friends have on average more influence than you do.</description>

      <title>A large-scale analysis of public-facing, community-built chatbots on Character.AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the first large-scale analysis of public-facing chatbots on Character.AI, a rapidly growing social media platform where users create and interact with chatbots. Character.AI is distinctive in that it merges generative AI with user-generated content, enabling users to build bots-often modeled after fictional or public personas-for others to engage with. It is also popular, with over 20 million monthly active users, and impactful, with recent headlines detailing significant issues with youth engagement on the site. Character.AI is thus of interest to study both substantively and conceptually. To this end, we present a descriptive overview of the site using a dataset of 2.1 million English-language prompts (or ``greetings'') for chatbots on the site, created by around 1 million users. Our work explores the prevalence of different fandoms on the site, broader tropes that persist across fandoms, and how dynamics of power intersect with gender within greetings. Overall, our findings illuminate an emerging form of online (para)social interaction that toes a unique and important intersection between generative AI and user-generated content.</description>

      <title>Post-Post-API Age: Studying Digital Platforms in Scant Data Access Times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, data provided by digital platforms has informed substantial research in HCI to understand online human interaction and communication. Following the closure of major social media APIs that previously provided free access to large-scale data (the "post-API age"), emerging data access programs required by the European Union's Digital Services Act (DSA) have sparked optimism about increased platform transparency and renewed opportunities for comprehensive research on digital platforms, leading to the "post-post-API age." However, it remains unclear whether platforms provide adequate data access in practice. To assess how platforms make data available under the DSA, we conducted a comprehensive survey followed by in-depth interviews with 19 researchers to understand their experiences with data access in this new era. Our findings reveal significant challenges in accessing social media data, with researchers facing multiple barriers including complex API application processes, difficulties obtaining credentials, and limited API usability. These challenges have exacerbated existing institutional, regional, and financial inequities in data access. Based on these insights, we provide actionable recommendations for platforms, researchers, and policymakers to foster more equitable and effective data access, while encouraging broader dialogue within the CSCW community around interdisciplinary and multi-stakeholder solutions.</description>

      <title>Analysis and Resilience of the U.S. Flight Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Air travel is one of the most widely used transportation services in the United States. This paper analyzes the U.S. Flight Network (USFN) using complex network theory by exploring how the network's topology contributes to its efficiency and vulnerability. This is done by examining the structural properties, degree distributions, and community structures in the network. USFN was observed to follow power-law distribution and falls under the anomalous regime, suggesting that the network is hub dominant. Compared to null networks, USFN has a higher clustering coefficient and modularity. Various percolation test revealed that USFN is vulnerable to targeted attacks and is susceptible to complete cascading failure if one of the major hubs fails. The overall results suggest that while the USFN is designed for efficiency, it is highly vulnerable to disruptions. Protecting key hub airports is important to make the network more robust and prevent large-scale failures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale networks have been instrumental in shaping the way that we think about how individuals interact with one another, developing key insights in mathematical epidemiology, computational social science, and biology. However, many of the underlying social systems through which diseases spread, information disseminates, and individuals interact are inherently mediated through groups of arbitrary size, known as higher-order interactions. There is a gap between higher-order dynamics of group formation and fragmentation, contagion spread, and social influence and the data necessary to validate these higher-order mechanisms. Similarly, few datasets bridge the gap between these pairwise and higher-order network data. Because of its open API, the Bluesky social media platform provides a laboratory for observing social ties at scale. In addition to pairwise following relationships, unlike many other social networks, Bluesky features user-curated lists known as "starter packs" as a mechanism for social network growth. We introduce "A Blue Start", a large-scale network dataset comprising 26.7M users and their 1.6B pairwise following relationships and 301.3K groups representing starter packs. This dataset will be an essential resource for the study of higher-order network science.</description>

      <title>MPRM: A Markov Path-based Rule Miner for Efficient and Interpretable Knowledge Graph Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rule mining in knowledge graphs enables interpretable link prediction. However, deep learning-based rule mining methods face significant memory and time challenges for large-scale knowledge graphs, whereas traditional approaches, limited by rigid confidence metrics, incur high computational costs despite sampling techniques. To address these challenges, we propose MPRM, a novel rule mining method that models rule-based inference as a Markov chain and uses an efficient confidence metric derived from aggregated path probabilities, significantly lowering computational demands. Experiments on multiple datasets show that MPRM efficiently mines knowledge graphs with over a million facts, sampling less than 1% of facts on a single CPU in 22 seconds, while preserving interpretability and boosting inference accuracy by up to 11% over baselines.</description>

      <title>Transmission Neural Networks: Approximation and Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transmission Neural Networks (TransNNs) introduced by Gao and Caines (2022) connect virus spread models over networks and neural networks with tuneable activation functions. This paper presents the approximation technique and the underlying assumptions employed by TransNNs in relation to the corresponding Markovian Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model with 2^n states, where n is the number of nodes in the network. The underlying infection paths are assumed to be stochastic with heterogeneous and time-varying transmission probabilities. We obtain the conditional probability of infection in the stochastic 2^n-state SIS epidemic model corresponding to each state configuration under mild assumptions, which enables control solutions based on Markov decision processes (MDP). Finally, MDP control with 2^n-state SIS epidemic models and optimal control with TransNNs are compared in terms of mitigating virus spread over networks through vaccination, and it is shown that TranNNs enable the generation of control laws with significant computational savings, albeit with more conservative control actions.</description>

      <title>Towards Effective Federated Graph Foundation Model via Mitigating Knowledge Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in graph machine learning have shifted to data-centric paradigms, driven by two emerging fields: (1) Federated graph learning (FGL) enables multi-client collaboration but faces challenges from data and task heterogeneity, limiting its practicality; (2) Graph foundation models (GFM) offer strong domain generalization but are usually trained on single machines, missing out on cross-silo data and resources.
  These paradigms are complementary, and their integration brings notable benefits. Motivated by this, we propose FedGFM, a novel decentralized GFM training paradigm. However, a key challenge is knowledge entanglement, where multi-domain knowledge merges into indistinguishable representations, hindering downstream adaptation.
  To address this, we present FedGFM+, an enhanced framework with two core modules to reduce knowledge entanglement: (1) AncDAI: A global anchor-based domain-aware initialization strategy. Before pre-training, each client encodes its local graph into domain-specific prototypes that serve as semantic anchors. Synthetic embeddings around these anchors initialize the global model. We theoretically prove these prototypes are distinguishable across domains, providing a strong inductive bias to disentangle domain-specific knowledge. (2) AdaDPP: A local adaptive domain-sensitive prompt pool. Each client learns a lightweight graph prompt capturing domain semantics during pre-training. During fine-tuning, prompts from all clients form a pool from which the GFM selects relevant prompts to augment target graph attributes, improving downstream adaptation.
  FedGFM+ is evaluated on 8 diverse benchmarks across multiple domains and tasks, outperforming 20 baselines from supervised learning, FGL, and federated GFM variants.</description>

      <title>EpiLLM: Unlocking the Potential of Large Language Models in Epidemic Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advanced epidemic forecasting is critical for enabling precision containment strategies, highlighting its strategic importance for public health security. While recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated effectiveness as foundation models for domain-specific tasks, their potential for epidemic forecasting remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce EpiLLM, a novel LLM-based framework tailored for spatio-temporal epidemic forecasting. Considering the key factors in real-world epidemic transmission: infection cases and human mobility, we introduce a dual-branch architecture to achieve fine-grained token-level alignment between such complex epidemic patterns and language tokens for LLM adaptation. To unleash the multi-step forecasting and generalization potential of LLM architectures, we propose an autoregressive modeling paradigm that reformulates the epidemic forecasting task into next-token prediction. To further enhance LLM perception of epidemics, we introduce spatio-temporal prompt learning techniques, which strengthen forecasting capabilities from a data-driven perspective. Extensive experiments show that EpiLLM significantly outperforms existing baselines on real-world COVID-19 datasets and exhibits scaling behavior characteristic of LLMs.</description>

      <title>No Place for Old Memes: Large-scale Collective Dynamics in the Three Iterations of Reddit r/place</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Is there something akin to geopolitics for online communities? One could think of communities as nations formed around shared interests of individual users. Friendly borders capture similar interests, but conflicts could emerge due to ideological differences or competition for attention (as for land). Over time, new coalitions could emerge, others could crumble, and many could disappear as casualties of online wars with highly unpredictable and often devastating outcomes. The r/place experiment is the most ingenious attempt at reproducing this complex collective dynamics as a series of three social games hosted by Reddit. The result is not only an accurate picture of the diverse interests on Reddit -- one of the most popular social media platforms in the world -- but also fine-grained traces of sequential actions taken by millions of players during the game. In this paper, we are the first to characterize the collective behavior during r/place in terms of engagement, collaboration, and competition using tools from computational social science and data science. Our analysis shows that r/place reflected many patterns found in other relevant group decision-making processes, including empirical evidence for group coordination costs, social loafing, and increased cooperation as a response to competition. We discuss how our findings can support the development of new theoretical models, tools, and mechanisms to optimize collaborative-competitive processes in social networks.</description>

      <title>Community Recovery on Noisy Stochastic Block Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08251v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of community recovery in geometrically-noised stochastic block models (SBM). This work presents two primary contributions: (1) Motif--Attention Spectral Operator (MASO), an attention-based spectral operator that improves upon traditional spectral methods; and (2) Iterative Geometric Denoising (GeoDe), a configurable denoising algorithm that boosts spectral clustering performance. We demonstrate that the fusion of GeoDe+MASO significantly outperforms existing community detection methods on noisy SBMs. Furthermore, we show that using GeoDe+MASO as a denoising step improves belief propagation's community recovery by 79.7% on the Amazon Metadata dataset.</description>

      <title>Conspiracy theories and where to find them on TikTok</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: TikTok has skyrocketed in popularity over recent years, especially among younger audiences. However, there are public concerns about the potential of this platform to promote and amplify harmful content. This study presents the first systematic analysis of conspiracy theories on TikTok. By leveraging the official TikTok Research API we collect a longitudinal dataset of 1.5M videos shared in the U.S. over three years. We estimate a lower bound on the prevalence of conspiratorial videos (up to 1000 new videos per month) and evaluate the effects of TikTok's Creativity Program for monetization, observing an overall increase in video duration regardless of content. Lastly, we evaluate the capabilities of state-of-the-art open-weight Large Language Models to identify conspiracy theories from audio transcriptions of videos. While these models achieve high precision in detecting harmful content (up to 96%), their overall performance remains comparable to fine-tuned traditional models such as RoBERTa. Our findings suggest that Large Language Models can serve as an effective tool for supporting content moderation strategies aimed at reducing the spread of harmful content on TikTok.</description>

      <title>When cardinals strategize: An agent-based model of influence and ideology for the papal conclave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyze two agent-based models to investigate the dynamics of papal conclaves, focusing on how social influence, strategic voting, and ideological alignment affect the time required to elect a pope. In the first model, cardinals interact through two mechanisms: with probability $p$, they imitate the choice of a randomly selected peer, and with probability $q$, they shift support to the most voted candidate from the previous round. Additionally, strategic behavior is introduced via ``useful voting'', where agents abandon their preferred candidate if he receives less than a threshold fraction of the votes, switching instead to the most viable alternative. A candidate must secure a qualified majority of two-thirds to be elected. We then extend the framework by incorporating ideological blocs, assigning each cardinal and candidate to one of two groups (e.g., progressives and conservatives). Cardinals initially vote for candidates from their own group but may cross ideological lines for strategic reasons. We initialize the electorate with $20\%$ conservative cardinals, reflecting the current composition shaped by papal appointments. Numerical simulations show that ideological polarization tends to delay the election by increasing the number of voting rounds required. However, higher values of strategic responsiveness $q$ can restore efficiency even under polarization. We further validate the model by calibrating parameters to historical data from conclaves held between 1939 and 2025. The model reproduces observed convergence times with good agreement, supporting its explanatory power across institutional contexts. The rapid outcome of the 2025 conclave, despite ideological divisions, suggests the importance of informal consensus-building, possibly prior to voting, as a key mechanism for accelerating convergence.</description>
