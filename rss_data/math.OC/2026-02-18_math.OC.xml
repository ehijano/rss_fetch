      <title>On propagation of chaos for the Fisher-Rao gradient flow in entropic mean-field optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of optimization problems on the space of probability measures motivated by the mean-field approach to studying neural networks. Such problems can be solved by constructing continuous-time gradient flows that converge to the minimizer of the energy function under consideration, and then implementing discrete-time algorithms that approximate the flow. In this work, we focus on the Fisher-Rao gradient flow and we construct an interacting particle system that approximates the flow as its mean-field limit. We discuss the connection between the energy function, the gradient flow and the particle system and explain different approaches to smoothing out the energy function with an appropriate kernel in a way that allows for the particle system to be well-defined. We provide a rigorous proof of the existence and uniqueness of thus obtained kernelized flows, as well as a propagation of chaos result that provides a theoretical justification for using the corresponding kernelized particle systems as approximation algorithms in entropic mean-field optimization.</description>

      <title>Revisiting transportation problems under Monge costs with applications to location problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the transportation problem under a Monge cost structure and derive compact formulas for optimal dual solutions based on the northwest-corner rule. As an application illustrating how these formulas yield structural insight while enhancing computational performance, we consider a broad class of facility location problems. In particular, the expressions are used within a Benders decomposition framework to derive novel formulations for the Discrete Ordered Median Problem with non-increasing weights. Numerical experiments validate that the resulting formulations achieve state-of-the-art performance and exhibit strong robustness across a wide range of instances.</description>

      <title>Linear error bounds for HJB equations in finite horizon control problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study semi Lagrangian approximation schemes for Hamilton Jacobi Bellman equations arising from finite horizon optimal control problems. Classical error estimates for these schemes include the term $\frac{1}{\Delta t}$ which leads to pessimistic convergence bounds and is not observed in numerical experiments. In this work, we provide improved error estimates under standard regularity assumptions on the dynamics, the running cost, and the final cost, assuming the presence of a positive discount factor. The new bound depends linearly on the time step, the spatial mesh size, and a measure of the temporal oscillation of the control, thus removing the mixed term appearing in previous analyses. The proof relies on a refined comparison between continuous and discrete cost functionals and on stability estimates for the controlled dynamics. Numerical experiments confirm first-order convergence in both space and time and suggest that the improved behavior persists even in the undiscounted case.</description>

      <title>Efficient Adjoint-based Design Optimization with Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multidisciplinary engineering system design typically employs a sequential process, progressing from system dynamics to design variables and control. However, this process is inefficient and may lead to a suboptimal design. We propose formulating the optimal control and multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) problems as a single problem with linear quadratic regulator (LQR) control. We use the coupled adjoint method to compute the design variable derivatives, which are critical for gradient-based design optimization. The computational cost of the derivative computation using the adjoint method is independent of the number of design variables, making it suitable for large-scale problems. We show that the coupled adjoint can be solved indirectly and more efficiently by solving three smaller adjoint equations that leverage the feedforward structure of the problem. We demonstrate this new approach on two test problems: design optimization of a classic cart-pole problem and the aerodynamic shape of a quadrotor blade. For the quadrotor blade design problem, we reduce the control cost by 10% by optimizing the blade for a specific control task with a slight penalty in steady hovering power consumption.</description>

      <title>Operating room planning with pooling downstream beds among specialties: A stochastic programming approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study pooling downstream beds across specialties in a stochastic operating room planning problem. The main sources of uncertainty are stochastic surgical durations and patients' lengths of stay. We developed a two-stage stochastic programming model where in the first stage we decide on 1) the number of non-shared ICU and ward beds to be allocated to each specialty, and 2) the allocation of surgeries to operating rooms during the planning horizon. In the second stage, we decide on 1) the number of shared beds in ICU and wards to be allocated to different specialties on each day during the planning horizon, 2) the surge capacity required to satisfy downstream service to patients, and 3) the overtime incurred in operating rooms. The proposed model aims at minimizing the total cost including the patients' waiting cost, postponement cost, overtime and fixed cost of operating rooms, and the cost of downstream surge capacity. We have implemented the proposed stochastic programming model in a sample average approximation framework. To enhance the efficiency of sample average approximation, we have developed a specialized algorithm that quickly solves the second-stage model for any given first-stage solution for a large number of scenarios. We have carried out extensive computational experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of several pooling policies for downstream beds and also the efficiency of the proposed sample average approximation algorithm. Moreover, we have performed an extensive sensitivity analysis of cost and stochastic parameters. Our results demonstrated that a full-sharing policy among different specialties in the downstream units enhance the functionality of the system by up to 19.53%. Moreover, the results indicated that the solutions obtained by the proposed stochastic model outperform those from the corresponding deterministic problem by 17.43% on average.</description>

      <title>Carleman Inequalities for the Heat Equation with Fourier Boundary Conditions: Applications to Null Controllability Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we establish a Carleman inequality for the heat equation with Fourier boundary conditions of the form $\partial_\nu y+by=f1_\gamma$, where the control acts on a small portion $\gamma$ of the boundary. We apply this inequality to address the null controllability problem with boundary control supported on this small region. An explicit solution to this problem is obtained via a system of coupled parabolic equations. Based on these results, we propose an iterative numerical method to solve the coupled system.</description>

      <title>Data Informativeness in Linear Optimization under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of determining what data is required to solve a decision-making task when only partial information about the state of the world is available. Focusing on linear programs, we introduce a decision-focused notion of data informativeness that formalizes when a data set is sufficient to recover the optimal decision. Our notion abstracts away the notion of estimators (how data is used): it depends solely on the structure of the optimization task and the uncertainty. Our main result provides a geometric characterization of data sufficiency: a data set is sufficient if and only if, together with prior knowledge, it captures all cost directions that can change the optimal solution, given the task structure and the uncertainty set. Building on our characterization, we develop a tractable algorithm to determine minimal sufficient data sets under general data collection constraints. Taken together, our work introduces a principled framework for task-aware data collection. We demonstrate the approach in two applications: selecting where to conduct field experiments to inform infrastructure design and choosing which candidates to interview in order to make an optimal hiring decision. Our results illustrate that small, carefully selected data sets often suffice to determine the optimal decisions.</description>

      <title>A Geometric Approach to Feedback Stabilization of Nonlinear Systems with Drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents an approach to the construction of stabilizing feedback for strongly nonlinear systems. The class of systems of interest includes systems with drift which are affine in control and which cannot be stabilized by continuous state feedback. The approach is independent of the selection of a Lyapunov type function, but requires the solution of a nonlinear programming 'satisficing problem' stated in terms of the logarithmic coordinates of flows. As opposed to other approaches, point-to-point steering is not required to achieve asymptotic stability. Instead, the flow of the controlled system is required to intersect periodically a certain reachable set in the space of the logarithmic coordinates.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Games on Large Sparse Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for stochastic games on large sparse graphs, covering continuous-time and discrete-time dynamic games as well as static games. Players are indexed by the vertices of simple, locally finite graphs, allowing both finite and countably infinite populations, with asymptotics described through local weak convergence of marked graphs. The framework allows path-dependent utility functionals that may be heterogeneous across players. Under a contraction condition, we prove existence and uniqueness of Nash equilibria and establish exponential decay of correlations with graph distance. We further show that global equilibria can be approximated by truncated local games, and can even be reconstructed exactly on subgraphs given information on their boundary. Finally, we prove convergence of Nash equilibria along locally weakly convergent graph sequences, including sequences sampled from hyperfinite unimodular random graphs.</description>

      <title>BORWin: Exact algorithm based on a Bi-Objective Relaxation for Window-constrained problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A mixed integer maximization problem involving several additional constraints defined with both a lower and an upper bound is considered. It is assumed that one of such constraints is more restrictive than the others. As it can be seen as a resource window constraint, it defines the so-called window-constrained problem. From a bi-objective perspective, a 2-phase algorithm, called BORWin, is devised. It stands for Bi-Objective Relaxation for Window-constrained problems. The first phase is generic for any window-constrained problem and provides a family of upper bounds based on a bi-objective relaxation of the additional constraints. It is shown that the latter bounds strongly relate to the Lagrangian dual bounds. The second phase is derived for a variant involving a graph structure, namely the window-constrained longest-path problem on an acyclic graph. The aim is to take advantage of the upper bounds to devise an efficient label extension algorithm. It is shown that complementary upper bounds could be derived to further improve performance in some special cases. A typical example is when the additional constraints have special knapsack structures. This is the case for the Hydro-Unit Commitment problem with a single plant (1-HUC). From numerical experiments for the 1-HUC, BOR-Win appears to be very efficient compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning in Real Option Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate an entropy-regularized reinforcement learning (RL) approach to optimal stopping problems motivated by real option models. Classical stopping rules are strict and non-randomized, limiting natural exploration in RL settings. To address this, we introduce entropy regularization, allowing randomized stopping policies that balance exploitation and exploration. We derive an explicit analytical solution to the regularized problem and prove convergence of the associated free boundary to the classical stopping threshold as the entropy vanishes. The regularized problem admits a natural formulation as a singular stochastic control problem. Building on this structure, we propose both model-based and model-free policy iteration algorithms to learn the optimal boundary. The model-free method operates without knowledge of system dynamics, using only trajectories from the stochastic environment. We establish convergence guarantees and illustrate strong numerical performance. This framework provides a principled and tractable approach for data-driven stopping problems under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>All roads lead to Rome: Path-following Augmented Lagrangian Methods via Bregman Proximal Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Bregman proximal augmented Lagrangian methods with second-order oracles for convex convex-composite optimization problems. The outer loop is an instance of the Bregman proximal point algorithm with relative errors in the sense of Solodov and Svaiter, applied to the KKT operator associated with the problem. Akin to classical Lagrange-Newton methods, including primal-dual interior point methods the Bregman proximal point algorithm repeatedly solves regularized KKT inclusions by minimizing a smooth Bregman augmented Lagrangian function, obtained after marginalizing out the multiplier variables. Thanks to non-Euclidean geometries the marginal function is generalized self-concordant and therefore within the regime of Newton's method which converges quadratically if the step-size in the outer proximal point loop is chosen carefully. The operator-theoretic viewpoint allows us to employ the framework of metric subregularity to derive fast rates for the outer loop, and eventually state a joint complexity bound. Important special cases of our framework are a proximal variant of the exponential multiplier method due to Tseng and Bertsekas and interior-point proximal augmented Lagrangian schemes closely related to those of Pougkakiotis and Gondzio.</description>

      <title>Pricing Discrete and Nonlinear Markets With Semidefinite Relaxations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonconvexities in markets with discrete decisions and nonlinear constraints make efficient pricing challenging, often necessitating subsidies. A prime example is the unit commitment (UC) problem in electricity markets, where costly subsidies are commonly required. We propose a new pricing scheme for nonconvex markets with both discreteness and nonlinearity, by convexifying nonconvex structures through a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation and deriving prices from the relaxation's dual variables. When the choice set is bounded, we establish strong duality for the SDP, which allows us to extend the envelope theorem to the value function of the relaxation. This extension yields a marginal price signal for demand, which we use as our pricing mechanism. We demonstrate that under certain conditions-for instance, when the relaxation's right hand sides are linear in demand-the resulting lost opportunity cost is bounded by the relaxation's optimality gap. This result highlights the importance of achieving tight relaxations. The proposed framework applies to nonconvex electricity market problems, including for both direct current and alternating current UC. Our numerical experiments indicate that the SDP relaxations are often tight, reinforcing the effectiveness of the proposed pricing scheme. Across a suite of IEEE benchmark instances, the lost opportunity cost under our pricing scheme is, on average, 46% lower than that of the commonly used fixed-binary pricing scheme.</description>

      <title>Predicting Invoice Dilution in Supply Chain Finance with Leakage Free Two Stage XGBoost, KAN (Kolmogorov Arnold Networks), and Ensemble Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Invoice or payment dilution is the gap between the approved invoice amount and the actual collection is a significant source of non credit risk and margin loss in supply chain finance. Traditionally, this risk is managed through the buyer's irrevocable payment undertaking (IPU), which commits to full payment without deductions. However, IPUs can hinder supply chain finance adoption, particularly among sub-invested grade buyers. A newer, data-driven methods use real-time dynamic credit limits, projecting dilution for each buyer-supplier pair in real-time. This paper introduces an AI, machine learning framework and evaluates how that can supplement a deterministic algorithm to predict invoice dilution using extensive production dataset across nine key transaction fields.</description>

      <title>On the efficiency of pairwise Hamiltonian control to desynchronize the higher-order Kuramoto model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synchronization of coupled oscillators is observed in many natural and engineered systems and emerges due to the interactions within the system. It can be both beneficial, e.g., in power grids, and harmful, e.g., in epileptic seizures. In the latter case, efficient control methods to desynchronize the systems are crucial. Recent studies have shown that interactions are not always pairwise, but higher-order, i.e., many-body, and this greatly affects the dynamics. For instance, higher-order interactions increase the linear stability of synchronized states but simultaneously shrink their attraction basin, with potentially opposite effects on control methods. Here, we use a minimally invasive pairwise control based on Hamiltonian control theory, and investigate its efficiency on phase oscillators with higher-order interactions. We show that, if the initial phases are close to the synchronized state, higher-order interactions make desynchronization more difficult to achieve. Otherwise, a non-monotonic effect appears: intermediate strengths of higher-order interactions impede desynchronization while larger ones facilitate it. In all cases, the control can desynchronize the system with a sufficient number of controlled nodes and intensity.</description>

      <title>A discrete gradient scheme for preserving QSR-dissipativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of dissipative dynamical systems provides a formal description of processes that cannot generate energy internally. For these systems, changes in energy can only occur due to an external energy supply or dissipation effects. Unfortunately, dissipative properties tend to deteriorate in numerical computations, especially in nonlinear systems. Discrete gradient methods can help mitigate this problem. In this paper, we present a class of structure-preserving time discretization schemes based on discrete gradients for a special class of systems that are dissipative with respect to a quadratic supply rate.</description>

      <title>Functional Central Limit Theorem for Stochastic Gradient Descent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic shape of the trajectory of the stochastic gradient descent algorithm applied to a convex objective function. Under mild regularity assumptions, we prove a functional central limit theorem for the properly rescaled trajectory. Our result characterizes the long-term fluctuations of the algorithm around the minimizer by providing a diffusion limit for the trajectory. In contrast with classical central limit theorems for the last iterate or Polyak-Ruppert averages, this functional result captures the temporal structure of the fluctuations and applies to non-smooth settings such as robust location estimation, including the geometric median.</description>

      <title>Symbolic recovery of PDEs from measurement data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Models based on partial differential equations (PDEs) are powerful for describing a wide range of complex relationships in the natural sciences. Accurately identifying the PDE model, which represents the underlying physical law, is essential for a proper understanding of the problem. This reconstruction typically relies on indirect and noisy measurements of the system's state and, without specifically tailored methods, rarely yields symbolic expressions, thereby hindering interpretability. In this work, we address this issue by considering existing neural network architectures based on rational functions for the symbolic representation of physical laws. These networks leverage the approximation power of rational functions while also benefiting from their flexibility in representing arithmetic operations. Our main contribution is an identifiability result, showing that, in the limit of noiseless, complete measurements, such symbolic networks can uniquely reconstruct the simplest physical law within the PDE model. Specifically, reconstructed laws remain expressible within the symbolic network architecture, with regularization-minimizing parameterizations promoting interpretability and sparsity in case of $L^1$-regularization. In addition, we provide regularity results for symbolic networks. Empirical validation using the ParFam architecture supports these theoretical findings, providing evidence for the practical reconstructibility of physical laws.</description>

      <title>Solving Parameter-Robust Avoid Problems with Unknown Feasibility using Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning (RL) have achieved strong results on high-dimensional control tasks, but applying RL to reachability problems raises a fundamental mismatch: reachability seeks to maximize the set of states from which a system remains safe indefinitely, while RL optimizes expected returns over a user-specified distribution. This mismatch can result in policies that perform poorly on low-probability states that are still within the safe set. A natural alternative is to frame the problem as a robust optimization over a set of initial conditions that specify the initial state, dynamics and safe set, but whether this problem has a solution depends on the feasibility of the specified set, which is unknown a priori. We propose Feasibility-Guided Exploration (FGE), a method that simultaneously identifies a subset of feasible initial conditions under which a safe policy exists, and learns a policy to solve the reachability problem over this set of initial conditions. Empirical results demonstrate that FGE learns policies with over 50% more coverage than the best existing method for challenging initial conditions across tasks in the MuJoCo simulator and the Kinetix simulator with pixel observations.</description>

      <title>A model predictive control framework with robust stability guarantees under unbounded disturbances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.10216v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To address feasibility issues in model predictive control (MPC), most implementations relax state constraints by using slack variables and adding a penalty to the cost. We propose an alternative strategy: relaxing the initial state constraint with a penalty. Compared to state-of-the-art soft constrained MPC formulations, the proposed formulation has two key features: (i) input-to-state stability and bounds on the cumulative constraint violation for unbounded disturbances; (ii) close-to-optimal performance under nominal operating conditions. The idea is initially presented for open-loop asymptotically stable nonlinear systems by designing the penalty as a Lyapunov function, but we also show how to relax this condition to: i) Lyapunov stable systems; ii) stabilizable systems; and iii) utilizing an implicit characterization of the Lyapunov function. In the special case of linear systems, the proposed MPC formulation reduces to a quadratic program, and the offline design and online computational complexity are only marginally increased compared to a nominal design. Numerical examples demonstrate benefits compared to state-of-the-art soft-constrained MPC formulations.</description>

Abstract: We present a modified simulated annealing method with a dynamical choice of the cooling temperature. The latter is determined via a closed-loop control and is proven to yield exponential decay of the entropy of the particle system. The analysis is carried out through kinetic equations for interacting particle systems describing the simulated annealing method in an extended phase space. Decay estimates are derived under the quasi-invariant scaling of the resulting system of Boltzmann-type equations to assess the consistency with their mean-field limit. Numerical results are provided to illustrate and support the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>A Fast Newton Method Under Local Lipschitz Smoothness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new, fast second-order method is proposed that achieves the optimal $\mathcal{O}\left(|\log(\epsilon)|\epsilon^{-3/2}\right)$ complexity to obtain first-order $\epsilon$-stationary points. Crucially, this is deduced without assuming the standard global Lipschitz Hessian continuity condition, but only using an appropriate local smoothness requirement. The algorithm exploits Hessian information to compute a Newton step and a negative curvature step when needed, in an approach similar to that of the AN2C method.Inexact versions of the Newton step and negative curvature are proposed in order to reduce the cost of evaluating second-order information. Details are given of such an iterative implementation using Krylov subspaces. An extended algorithm for finding second-order critical points is also developed and its complexity is again shown to be within a log factor of the optimal one. Initial numerical experiments are discussed for both factorised and Krylov variants, which demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>A preconditioned difference of convex functions algorithm with extrapolation and line search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel proximal difference-of-convex (DC) algorithm enhanced with extrapolation and aggressive non-monotone line search for solving non-convex optimization problems. We introduce an adaptive conservative update strategy of the extrapolation parameter determined by a computationally efficient non-monotone line search. The core of our algorithm is to unite the update of the extrapolation parameter with the step size of the non-monotone line search interactively. The global convergence of the two proposed algorithms is established through the Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz properties, ensuring convergence within a preconditioned framework for linear equations. Numerical experiments on two general non-convex problems: SCAD-penalized binary classification and graph-based Ginzburg-Landau image segmentation models, demonstrate the proposed method's high efficiency compared to existing DC algorithms both in convergence rate and solution accuracy.</description>

Abstract: This letter presents a data-driven framework for the design of stabilizing controllers from input-output data in the continuous-time, linear, and time-invariant domain. Rather than relying on measurements or reliable estimates of input and output time derivatives, the proposed approach uses filters to derive a parameterization of the system dynamics. This parameterization is amenable to the application of linear matrix inequalities enabling the design of stabilizing output feedback controllers from input-output data and the knowledge of the order of the system.</description>

      <title>Distributed Online Convex Optimization with Nonseparable Costs and Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies distributed online convex optimization with time-varying coupled constraints, motivated by distributed online control in network systems. Most prior work assumes a separability condition: the global objective and coupled constraint functions are sums of local costs and individual constraints. In contrast, we study a group of agents, networked via a communication graph, that collectively select actions to minimize a sequence of nonseparable global cost functions and to satisfy nonseparable long-term constraints based on full-information feedback and intra-agent communication. We propose a distributed online primal-dual belief consensus algorithm, where each agent maintains and updates a local belief of the global collective decisions, which are repeatedly exchanged with neighboring agents. Unlike the previous consensus primal-dual algorithms under separability that ask agents to only communicate their local decisions, our belief-sharing protocol eliminates coupling between the primal consensus disagreement and the dual constraint violation, yielding sublinear regret and cumulative constraint violation (CCV) bounds, both in $O({T}^{1/2})$, where $T$ denotes the time horizon. Such a result breaks the long-standing $O(T^{3/4})$ barrier for CCV and matches the lower bound of online constrained convex optimization, indicating the online learning efficiency at the cost of communication overhead.</description>

      <title>Distributed Multi-Step Model Predictive Control for Consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies consensus of discrete-time multi-agent systems under time-varying directed communication, state and input constraints using a distributed multi-step model predictive control (MPC) framework. Consensus is recast as stabilization of the agreement set, and a geometric viewpoint based on convex-hull invariance and strict interiority is adopted. Building on an existing geometric necessary and sufficient condition for agreement, we show that enforcing terminal inclusion in local neighbor convex hulls guarantees hull invariance but does not, in general, imply the strict relative-interior property required for convergence. An explicit counterexample demonstrates that strictness cannot be deduced from feasibility and contraction constraints alone.
  To resolve this issue without shrinking feasible sets or altering primary performance objectives, a lexicographic tie-breaking mechanism is introduced. Among optimal (or near-optimal) MPC solutions, the proposed secondary criterion selects trajectories maximizing an interiority measure with respect to the neighbor hull. It is shown that whenever an interior feasible terminal state exists, this selection rule enforces the strictness condition required for asymptotic consensus. Explicit horizon conditions are derived for single- and double-integrator agents with bounded inputs, ensuring feasibility and automatic existence of interior feasible terminal points. The resulting scheme provides a distributed and implementable route to consensus via finite-step set-Lyapunov contraction. Numerical simulations with distributed inter-process communication illustrate monotone diameter decay and report per-agent computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Joint Optimization of Multimodal Transit Frequency and Shared Autonomous Vehicle Fleet Size with Hybrid Metaheuristic and Nonlinear Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19401v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) bring competition to traditional transit services but redesigning multimodal transit network can utilize SAVs as feeders to enhance service efficiency and coverage. This paper presents an optimization framework for the joint multimodal transit frequency and SAV fleet size problem, a variant of the transit network frequency setting problem. The objective is to maximize total transit ridership (including SAV-fed trips and subtracting boarding rejections) across multiple time periods under budget constraints, considering endogenous mode choice (transit, point-to-point SAVs, driving) and route selection, while allowing for strategic route removal by setting frequencies to zero. Due to the problem's non-linear, non-convex nature and the computational challenges of large-scale networks, we develop a hybrid solution approach that combines a metaheuristic approach (particle swarm optimization) with nonlinear programming for local solution refinement. To ensure computational tractability, the framework integrates analytical approximation models for SAV waiting times based on fleet utilization, multimodal network assignment for route choice, and multinomial logit mode choice behavior, bypassing the need for computationally intensive simulations within the main optimization loop. Applied to the Chicago metropolitan area's multimodal network, our method illustrates a 33.3% increase in transit ridership through optimized transit route frequencies and SAV integration, particularly enhancing off-peak service accessibility and strategically reallocating resources.</description>

      <title>Functional multi-armed bandit and the best function identification problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bandit optimization usually refers to the class of online optimization problems with limited feedback, namely, a decision maker uses only the objective value at the current point to make a new decision and does not have access to the gradient of the objective function. While this name accurately captures the limitation in feedback, it is somehow misleading since it does not have any connection with the multi-armed bandits (MAB) problem class. We propose two new classes of problems: the functional multi-armed bandit problem (FMAB) and the best function identification problem. They are modifications of a multi-armed bandit problem and the best arm identification problem, respectively, where each arm represents an unknown black-box function. These problem classes are a surprisingly good fit for modeling real-world problems such as competitive LLM training. To solve the problems from these classes, we propose a new reduction scheme to construct UCB-type algorithms, namely, the F-LCB algorithm, based on algorithms for nonlinear optimization with known convergence rates. We provide the regret upper bounds for this reduction scheme based on the base algorithms' convergence rates. We add numerical experiments that demonstrate the performance of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Qronos: Correcting the Past by Shaping the Future... in Post-Training Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11695v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Qronos -- a new state-of-the-art post-training quantization algorithm that sequentially rounds and updates neural network weights. Qronos not only explicitly corrects errors due to both weight and activation quantization, but also errors resulting from quantizing previous layers. Our iterative algorithm is based on an interpretable and disciplined optimization framework that subsumes and surpasses existing data-driven approaches. At each step, Qronos alternates between error correction and diffusion via optimal update rules. Importantly, we prove that Qronos admits an efficient implementation that uses the Cholesky decomposition for solving least-squares problems. We also demonstrate that Qronos is compatible with existing transformation techniques such as Hadamard-based incoherence processing and weight-activation scaling equalization, among others. We evaluate Qronos using recent autoregressive language generation models in the Llama3 family; Qronos consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art adaptive rounding methods when quantizing the weights, activations, and/or KV caches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional robust $\mathcal H_2/\mathcal H_\infty$ control minimizes the worst-case performance, often leading to a conservative design driven by very rare parametric configurations. To reduce this conservatism while taking advantage of the stochastic properties of Monte-Carlo sampling and its compatibility with parallel computing, we introduce an alternative paradigm that optimizes the controller with respect to a stochastic criterion, namely the conditional value at risk. We illustrate the potential of this approach on a realistic satellite benchmark, showing that it can significantly improve overall performance by tolerating some degradation in very rare worst-case scenarios.</description>
