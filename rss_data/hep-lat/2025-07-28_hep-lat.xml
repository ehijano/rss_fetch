      <title>$\mathbb{Z}_N$ stability and continuity in twisted Eguchi-Kawai model with two-flavor adjoint fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the twisted Eguchi-Kawai (TEK) reduced model of four-dimensional $SU(N)$ gauge theory in the presence of two-flavor adjoint fermions (adjoint TEK model). Using Monte Carlo simulations with $N=121$, twist parameter $k=1$, hopping parameter $\kappa=0.01$-$0.03$ ($\ll\kappa_c $) and inverse 't Hooft coupling $b=0.30$-$0.45$, we show that heavy adjoint fermions stabilize the $(\mathbb{Z}_N)^4$ center-symmetric vacuum even for the minimal twist satisfying $k/\sqrt{N} &lt; 1/9$, where the $(\mathbb{Z}_N)^4$ symmetry is spontaneously broken in the absence of adjoint fermions. This result also suggests that the adjoint TEK model with the minimal twist is equivalent to $SU(N)$ gauge theory over a broader $(\kappa,b)$ parameter region than the adjoint EK model without twist. We further extend our analysis to a partially reduced model to realize a geometry akin to $\mathbb{R}^3 \times S^1$ and study the theory under $S^1$ compactification with periodic adjoint fermions. Numerical simulations with $N=16$-$49$, $b=0.30$-$0.46$ and $\kappa=0.03$-$0.16$ supports the adiabatic continuity conjecture: with periodic adjoint fermions, the theory remains in a center-symmetric (confined) phase as the $S^1$ circle size is reduced, in contrast to the deconfining transition observed in the pure TEK model or in the TEK model with antiperiodic adjoint fermions. We present the Polyakov loop measurements and consistency checks supporting these findings.</description>

      <title>Lattice study of scattering phase shifts for $DD^*$ and $BB^*$ systems using twisted boundary conditions: search for bound state formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the $S$- and $P$-wave phase shifts for the $DD^\ast$ and $BB^\ast$ scatterings using L\"uscher's finite-size method under twisted boundary conditions to search for doubly charmed tetraquaks, $T_{cc}^+$, and doubly bottomed tetraquarks, $T_{bb}^-$ as the hadronic bound states. The $T_{cc}^+$ state was observed as a peak just bellow the $DD^*$ threshold by LHCb Collaboration, while the $T_{bb}^-$ state is a theoretically predicted tetraquark state having heavier quark flavors $bb\bar u \bar d$. L\"uscher's finite-size method is one of the well established methods for calculating the scattering phase shifts between two hadrons in lattice QCD simulations. Several studies have used simulations under the periodic boundary condition to determine the scattering phase shifts at a few discrete momenta for the $DD^*$ system. However, the scattering phase shift has not been investigated for the $BB^*$ system. In this study, $S$- and $P$-wave scattering phase shifts for the $DD^*$ and $BB^*$ systems in both $I=0$ and $I=1$ channels under several types of partially twisted boundary conditions. The use of the partially twisted boundary conditions enables us to obtain the scattering phase shift at any momentum by continuously varying the twisting angle. It also allows us to easily access the $P$-wave scattering phase shifts through the mixing of $S$- and $P$-waves, which is induced by the imposed boundary conditions. The 2+1 flavor PACS-CS gauge ensembles at $m_\pi=295$, 411 and 569 MeV are used. For charm and bottom quarks, the relativistic heavy quark action is adopted to reduce the lattice discretization artifacts due to the heavy quark mass. We discuss the emergence of a shallow bound state with a binding energy of $\mathcal{O}(100)$ keV at the physical pion mass in the $BB^*$ system, which has the quantum number $I(J^P)=0(1^+)$.</description>

      <title>Proton and neutron electromagnetic form factors from lattice QCD in the continuum limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the electromagnetic form factors of the proton and neutron using lattice QCD. We employ $N_\mathrm{f}$=2+1+1 twisted mass clover-improved fermions with quark masses tuned to their physical values. Three ensembles with lattice spacings of $a$=0.080 fm, 0.068 fm, and 0.057 fm, and approximately the same physical volume allow us to obtain the continuum limit directly at the physical pion mass. For each ensemble, we use several values of the sink-source time separation, ranging from 0.5 fm to 1.5 fm, to allow for a thorough analysis of excited state effects via multi-state fits. The disconnected contributions are also analyzed using high statistics combined with techniques to mitigate stochastic noise in the estimation of the fermion loop. These techniques include low-mode deflation, dilution in the color and spin components, and hierarchical probing. We study the momentum transfer dependence of the form factors using the $z$-expansion and dipole Ans\"atze, thereby enabling the extraction of the electric and magnetic radii and the magnetic moments, as well as the Zemach and Friar radii in the continuum limit. Results for the proton and neutron electric and magnetic mean square radii are $\sqrt{\langle r_E^2\rangle^p} = 0.860(38)(23)$ fm, $\langle r_E^2\rangle^n = -0.147(48)$ fm$^2$, $\sqrt{\langle r_M^2\rangle^p} = 0.870(53)(15)$ fm and $\sqrt{\langle r_M^2\rangle^n} = 0.913(67)(19)$ fm, and for the proton and neutron magnetic moments $\mu^p=2.849(92)(52)$ and $\mu^n=-1.819(76)(29)$, respectively. In all cases, the first error is statistical and the second systematic, where the latter includes an estimate of the error from the fits to the momentum dependence of the form factors and from the continuum extrapolation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Instead of the glueball-$\eta'$ mixing ansatz, the latest measured ratios of the branching fractions of $B_{(s)}^0\to J/\psi \eta^{(\prime)}$ decays by LHCb can be understood by including the contribution from the light quark annihilation effect enhanced by the QCD $\mathrm{U}_A(1)$ anomaly for light pseudoscalar mesons.</description>

      <title>High-precision bootstrap of multi-matrix quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider matrix quantum mechanics with multiple bosonic matrices, including those obtained from dimensional reduction of Yang-Mills theories. Using the matrix bootstrap, we study simple observables like $\langle \mathop{tr} X^2 \rangle$ in the confining phase of the theory in the infinite $N$ limit. By leveraging the symmetries of these models and using non-linear relaxation, we consider constraints up to level 14, e.g., constraints from traces of words of length $\le 14$. Our results are more precise than large $N$, continuum extrapolations of lattice Monte Carlo simulations, including an estimate of certain simple observables up to 8 significant digits.</description>

      <title>Sparsity dependence of Krylov state complexity in the SYK model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20569v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Krylov state complexity of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model for $N \le 28$ Majorana fermions with $q$-body fermion interaction with $q=4,6,8$ for a range of sparse parameter $k$ that controls the number of remaining terms in the original SYK model after sparsification. The critical value of $k$ below which the model ceases to be holographic, denoted $k_c$, has been subject of several recent investigations. Using Krylov complexity as a probe, we find that the peak value of complexity does not change as we increase $k$ beyond $k \ge k_{\text{min}}$ at large temperatures. We argue that this behavior is related to the change in the holographic nature of the Hamiltonian in the sparse SYK-type models such that the model is holographic for all $k \ge k_{\text{min}} \approx k_c$. Our results provide a novel way to determine $k_c$ in SYK-type models.</description>

      <title>Resummation for Lattice QCD Calculation of Generalized Parton Distributions at Nonzero Skewness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-momentum effective theory (LaMET) provides an approach to directly calculate the $x$-dependence of generalized parton distributions (GPDs) on a Euclidean lattice through power expansion and a perturbative matching. When a parton's momentum becomes soft, the corresponding logarithms in the matching kernel become non-negligible at higher orders of perturbation theory, which requires a resummation. But the resummation for the off-forward matrix elements at nonzero skewness $\xi$ is difficult due to their multi-scale nature. In this work, we demonstrate that these logarithms are important only in the threshold limit, and derive the threshold factorization formula for the quasi-GPDs in LaMET. We then propose an approach to resum all the large logarithms based on the threshold factorization, which is implemented on a GPD model. We demonstrate that the LaMET prediction is reliable for $[-1+x_0,-\xi-x_0]\cup[-\xi+x_0,\xi-x_0]\cup[\xi+x_0,1-x_0]$, where $x_0$ is a cutoff depending on hard parton momenta. Through our numerical tests with the GPD model, we demonstrate that our method is self-consistent and that the inverse matching does not spread the nonperturbative effects or power corrections to the perturbatively calculable regions.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Unveils the Power Law of Finite-Volume Energy Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06496v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finite-volume extrapolation is an important step for extracting physical observables from lattice calculations. However, it is a significant challenge for the system with long-range interactions. We employ symbolic regression to regress finite-volume extrapolation formula for both short-range and long-range interactions. The regressed formula still holds the exponential form with a factor $L^n$ in front of it. The power decreases with the decreasing range of the force. When the range of the force becomes sufficiently small, the power converges to $-1$, recovering the short-range formula as expected. Our work represents a significant advancement in leveraging machine learning to probe uncharted territories within particle physics.</description>

      <title>Three-qubit encoding in ytterbium-171 atoms for simulating 1+1D QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating nuclear matter described by quantum chromodynamics using quantum computers is notoriously inefficient because of the assortment of quark degrees of freedom such as matter/antimatter, flavor, color, and spin. Here, we propose to address this resource efficiency challenge by encoding three qubits within individual ytterbium-171 atoms of a neutral atom quantum processor. The three qubits are encoded in three distinct sectors: an electronic "clock" transition, the spin-1/2 nucleus, and the lowest two motional states in one radial direction of the harmonic trapping potential. We develop a family of composite sideband pulses and demonstrate a universal gate set and readout protocol for this three-qubit system. We then apply it to single-flavor quantum chromodynamics in 1+1D axial gauge for which the three qubits directly represent the occupancy of quarks in the three colors. We show that two atoms are sufficient to simulate both vacuum persistence oscillations and string breaking. We consider resource requirements and connections to error detection/correction. Our work is a step towards resource-efficient digital simulation of nuclear matter and opens new opportunities for versatile qubit encoding in neutral atom quantum processors.</description>
