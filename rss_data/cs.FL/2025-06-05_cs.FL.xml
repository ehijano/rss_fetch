      <title>Comparison of different Unique hard attention transformer models by the formal languages they can recognize</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This note is a survey of various results on the capabilities of unique hard attention transformers encoders (UHATs) to recognize formal languages. We distinguish between masked vs. non-masked, finite vs. infinite image and general vs. bilinear attention score functions. We recall some relations between these models, as well as a lower bound in terms of first-order logic and an upper bound in terms of circuit complexity.</description>

      <title>Jumbled Scattered Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we combine the research on (absent) scattered factors with the one of jumbled words. For instance, $\mathtt{wolf}$ is an absent scattered factor of $\mathtt{cauliflower}$ but since $\mathtt{lfow}$, a jumbled (or abelian) version of $\mathtt{wolf}$, is a scattered factor, $\mathtt{wolf}$ occurs as a jumbled scattered factor in $\mathtt{cauliflower}$. A \emph{jumbled scattered factor} $u$ of a word $w$ is constructed by letters of $w$ with the only rule that the number of occurrences per letter in $u$ is smaller than or equal to the one in $w$. We proceed to partition and characterise the set of jumbled scattered factors by the number of jumbled letters and use the latter as a measure. For this new class of words, we relate the folklore longest common subsequence (scattered factor) to the number of required jumbles. Further, we investigate the smallest possible number of jumbles alongside the jumbled scattered factor relation as well as Simon's congruence from the point of view of jumbled scattered factors and jumbled universality.</description>

      <title>Mapped Exponent and Asymptotic Critical Exponent of Words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04091v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how much injective morphisms can increase the repetitiveness of a given word. This question has a few possible variations depending on the meaning of ``repetitiveness''. We concentrate on fractional exponents of finite words and asymptotic critical exponents of infinite words. We characterize finite words that, when mapped by injective morphisms, can have arbitrarily high fractional exponent. For infinite words, alongside other results, we show that the asymptotic critical exponent grows at most by a constant factor (depending on the size of the alphabet) when mapped by an injective morphism. For both finite and infinite words, the binary case is better understood than the general case.</description>

      <title>The Attractor-Cycle Notation for Finite Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.1138</link>
      <description>arXiv:1306.1138v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a new notation for finite transformations. This attractor-cycle notation extends the orbit-cycle notation for permutations and builds upon existing transformation notations. How the basins of attraction of a finite transformation flow into permuted orbit cycles is visible from the notation. It gives insight into the structure of transformations and reduces the length of expressions without increasing the number of types of symbols.</description>

      <title>Discounted-Sum Automata with Multiple Discount Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08780v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discounting the influence of future events is a key paradigm in economics and it is widely used in computer-science models, such as games, Markov decision processes (MDPs), reinforcement learning, and automata. While a single game or MDP may allow for several different discount factors, nondeterministic discounted-sum automata (NDAs) were only studied with respect to a single discount factor. It is known that every class of NDAs with an integer as the discount factor has good computational properties: It is closed under determinization and under the algebraic operations min, max, addition, and subtraction, and there are algorithms for its basic decision problems, such as automata equivalence and containment. Extending the integer discount factor to an arbitrary rational number, loses most of these good properties.

We define and analyze nondeterministic discounted-sum automata in which each transition can have a different integral discount factor (integral NMDAs). We show that integral NMDAs with an arbitrary choice of discount factors are not closed under determinization and under algebraic operations and that their containment problem is undecidable. We then define and analyze a restricted class of integral NMDAs, which we call tidy NMDAs, in which the choice of discount factors depends on the prefix of the word read so far. Among their special cases are NMDAs that correlate discount factors to actions (alphabet letters) or to the elapsed time. We show that for every function $\theta$ that defines the choice of discount factors, the class of $\theta$-NMDAs enjoys all of the above good properties of NDAs with a single integral discount factor, as well as the same complexity of the required decision problems. Tidy NMDAs are also as expressive as deterministic integral NMDAs with an arbitrary choice of discount factors.</description>
