      <title>Fluctuation Theorems from a Continuous-Time Markov Model of Information-Thermodynamic Capacity in Biochemical Signal Cascades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biochemical signaling cascades transmit intracellular information while dissipating energy under nonequilibrium conditions. We model a cascade as a code string and apply information-entropy ideas to quantify an optimal transmission rate. A time-normalized entropy functional is maximized to define a capacity-like quantity governed by a conserved multiplier. To place the theory on a rigorous stochastic-thermodynamic footing, we formulate stepwise signaling as a continuous-time Markov jump process with forward and reverse competing rates. The embedded jump chain yields well-defined transition probabilities that justify time-scale-based expressions. Under local detailed balance, the log ratio of forward and reverse rates can be interpreted as entropy production per event, enabling a trajectory-level derivation of detailed and integral fluctuation theorems. We further connect the information-theoretic capacity to the mean dissipation rate and outline finite-time fluctuation structure via the scaled cumulant generating function (SCGF) and Gallavotti--Cohen symmetry, including a worked example using MAPK/ERK timescales.</description>

      <title>A generalized work theorem for stopped stochastic chemical reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a generalized work theorem for stochastic chemical reaction networks (CRNs). By using a compensated Poisson jump process, we identify a martingale structure in a generalized entropy defined relative to an auxiliary backward process and extend nonequilibrium work relations to processes stopped at bounded arbitrary times. Our results apply to discrete, mesoscopic chemical reaction networks and remain valid for singular initial conditions and state-dependent termination events. We show how martingale properties emerge directly from the structure of reaction propensities without assuming detailed balance. Stochastic simulations of a simple chemical kinetic proofreading network are used to explore the dependence of the exponentiated entropy production on initial conditions and model parameters, validating our new work theorem relationships. Our results provide new quantitative tools for analyzing biological circuits ranging from metabolic to gene regulation pathways.</description>

      <title>Information Transmission and Processing in G-Protein-Coupled-Receptor Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are central to cellular information processing, yet the physical principles governing their switching behavior remain incompletely understood. We present a first principles theoretical framework, grounded in nonequilibrium thermodynamics, to describe GPCR switching as observed in light-controlled impedance assays. The model identifies two fundamental control parameters: (1) ATP/GTP-driven chemical flux through the receptor complex, and (2) the free-energy difference between phosphorylated and dephosphorylated switch states. Together, these parameters defin the switch configuration. The model predicts that GPCRs can occupy one of three quasi-stable configurations, each corresponding to a local maximum in information transmission. Active states support chemical flux and exist in an on or off switch configuration, whereas inactive states lack flux, introducing a distinction absent in conventional phosphorylation models. The model takes two ligand-derived inputs: fixed structural features and inducible conformations (e.g. cis or trans). It shows that phosphatase activity, modeled as an energy barrier, chiefly governs on/off occupancy, whereas the kinase sustains flux without directly determining the switch configuration. Comparison with experimental data confirms the predicted existence of multiple quasi-stable states modulated by ligand conformation. Importantly, this framework generalizes beyond GPCRs to encompass a wider class of biological switching systems driven by nonequilibrium chemical flux.</description>
