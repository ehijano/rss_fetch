      <title>Real-Time Brain-Computer Interface Control of Walking Exoskeleton with Bilateral Sensory Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) technology has demonstrated the possibility of restoring brain-controlled walking in paraplegic spinal cord injury patients. However, current implementations of BCI-controlled walking still have significant drawbacks. In particular, prior systems are unidirectional and lack sensory feedback for insensate patients, have suboptimal reliance on brain signals from the bilateral arm areas of the motor cortex, and depend on external systems for signal processing. Motivated by these shortcomings, this study is the first time a bidirectional brain-computer interface (BDBCI) has demonstrated the restoration of both brain-controlled walking and leg sensory feedback while utilizing the bilateral leg motor and sensory cortices. Here, a subject undergoing subdural electrocorticogram electrode implantation for epilepsy surgery evaluation leveraged the leg representation areas of the bilateral interhemispheric primary motor and sensory cortices to operate a BDBCI with high performance. Although electrode implantation in the interhemispheric region is uncommon, electrodes can be safely implanted in this region to access rich leg motor information and deliver bilateral leg sensory feedback. Finally, we demonstrated that all BDBCI operations can be executed on a dedicated, portable embedded system. These results indicate that BDBCIs can potentially provide brain-controlled ambulation and artificial leg sensation to people with paraplegia after spinal cord injury in a manner that emulates full-implantability and is untethered from any external systems.</description>

      <title>Mapping minds not averages: a scalable subject-specific manifold learning framework for neuroimaging data</title>

Abstract: Mental and cognitive representations are believed to reside on low-dimensional, non-linear manifolds embedded within high-dimensional brain activity. Uncovering these manifolds is key to understanding individual differences in brain function, yet most existing machine learning methods either rely on population-level spatial alignment or assume data that is temporally structured, either because data is aligned among subjects or because event timings are known. We introduce a manifold learning framework that can capture subject-specific spatial variations across both structured and temporally unstructured neuroimaging data. On simulated data and two naturalistic fMRI datasets (Sherlock and Forrest Gump), our framework outperforms group-based baselines by recovering more accurate and individualized representations. We further show that the framework scales efficiently to large datasets and generalizes well to new subjects. To test this, we apply the framework to temporally unstructured resting-state fMRI data from individuals with schizophrenia and healthy controls. We further apply our method to a large resting-state fMRI dataset comprising individuals with schizophrenia and controls. In this setting, we demonstrate that the framework scales efficiently to large populations and generalizes robustly to unseen subjects. The learned subject-specific spatial maps our model finds reveal clinically relevant patterns, including increased activation in the basal ganglia, visual, auditory, and somatosensory regions, and decreased activation in the insula, inferior frontal gyrus, and angular gyrus. These findings suggest that our framework can uncover clinically relevant subject-specific brain activity patterns. Our approach thus provides a scalable and individualized framework for modeling brain activity, with applications in computational neuroscience and clinical research.</description>

      <title>A Bioinformatic Study of Genetics Involved in Determining Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Severity and Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aim: This in silico study sought to identify specific biomarkers for mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) through the analysis of publicly available gene and miRNA databases, hypothesizing their influence on neuronal structure, axonal integrity, and regeneration. Methods: This study implemented a three-step process: (1) Data searching for mTBI-related genes in Gene and MalaCard databases and literature review ; (2) Data analysis involved performing functional annotation through GO and KEGG, identifying hub genes using Cytoscape, mapping protein-protein interactions via DAVID and STRING, and predicting miRNA targets using miRSystem, miRWalk2.0, and mirDIP (3) RNA-sequencing analysis applied to the mTBI dataset GSE123336. Results: Eleven candidate hub genes associated with mTBI outcome were identified: APOE, S100B, GFAP, BDNF, AQP4, COMT, MBP, UCHL1, DRD2, ASIC1, and CACNA1A. Enrichment analysis linked these genes to neuron projection regeneration and synaptic plasticity. miRNAs linked to the mTBI candidate genes were hsa-miR-9-5p, hsa-miR-204-5p, hsa-miR-1908-5p, hsa-miR-16-5p, hsa-miR-10a-5p, has-miR-218-5p, has-miR-34a-5p, and has-miR-199b-5p. The RNA sequencing revealed 2664 differentially expressed miRNAs post-mTBI, with 17 showing significant changes at the time of injury and 48 hours post-injury. Two miRNAs were positively correlated with direct head hits. Conclusion: Our study indicates that specific genes and miRNAs, particularly hsa-miR-10a-5p, may influence mTBI outcomes. Our research may guide future mTBI diagnostics, emphasizing the need to measure and track these specific genes and miRNAs in diverse cohorts.</description>

      <title>Geometrical Structure of Bifurcations during Spatial Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Animals must constantly make decisions on the move, such as when choosing among multiple options, or "targets", in space. Recent evidence suggests that this results from a recursive feedback between the (vectorial) neural representation of the targets and the resulting motion defined by this consensus, which then changes the egocentric neural representation of the the options, and so on. Here we employ a simple model of this process to both explore how its dynamics account for the experimentally-observed abruptly-branching trajectories exhibited by animals during spatial decision-making, and to provide new insights into spatiotemporal computation. Essential neural dynamics, notably local excitation and long-range inhibition, are captured in our model via spin-system dynamics, with groups of Ising-spins representing neural "activity bumps" corresponding to target directions. Analysis, employing a novel "mean-field trajectory" approach, reveals the nature of the spontaneous symmetry breaking - bifurcations in the model that result in literal bifurcations in trajectory space and how it results in new geometric principles for spatiotemporal decision-making. We find that all bifurcation points, beyond the very first, fall on a small number of "bifurcation curves". It is the spatial organization of these curves that is shown to be key to determining the shape of the trajectories, such as self-similar or space filling, exhibited during decision-making, irrespective of the trajectory's starting point. Furthermore, we find that a non-Euclidean representation of space considerably reduces the number of bifurcation points in many geometrical configurations, preventing endless indecision and promoting effective spatial decision-making. This suggests that a non-Euclidean neural representation of space may be expected to have evolved across species in order to facilitate spatial decision-making.</description>
