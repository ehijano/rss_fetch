      <title>Identification of Shared Genetic Biomarkers to Discover Candidate Drugs for Cervical and Endometrial Cancer by Using the Integrated Bioinformatics Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cervical (CC) and endometrial cancers (EC) are two common types of gynecological tumors that threaten the health of females worldwide. Since their underlying mechanisms and associations remain unclear, computational bioinformatics analysis is required. In the present study, bioinformatics methods were used to screen for key candidate genes, their functions and pathways, and drug agents associated with CC and EC, aiming to reveal the possible molecular-level mechanisms. Four publicly available microarray datasets of CC and EC from the Gene Expression Omnibus database were downloaded, and 72 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were selected through integrated analysis. Then, we performed the protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis and identified 9 shared genetic biomarkers (SGBs). The GO functional and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses of these SGBs revealed some important functions and signaling pathways significantly associated with CC and EC. The interaction network analysis identified four transcription factors (TFs) and two miRNAs as key transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulators of SGBs. The expression of the AURKA, TOP2A, and UBE2C genes was higher in CC and EC tissues than in normal samples, and this gene expression was linked to disease progression. Furthermore, we performed docking analysis between 9 SGBs-based proteins and 145 meta-drugs, and identified the top-ranked 10 drugs as candidate drugs. Finally, we investigated the binding stability of the top-ranked three drugs (Sorafenib, Paclitaxel, Sunitinib) using 100 ns MD-based MM-PBSA simulations with UBE2C, AURKA, and TOP2A proteins, and observed their stable performance. Therefore, the proposed drugs might play a vital role in the treatment against CC and EC.</description>

      <title>Fast Voxel-Wise Kinetic Modeling in Dynamic PET using a Physics-Informed CycleGAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tracer kinetic modeling serves a vital role in diagnosis, treatment planning, tracer development and oncology, but burdens practitioners with complex and invasive arterial input function estimation (AIF). We adopt a physics-informed CycleGAN showing promise in DCE-MRI quantification to dynamic PET quantification. Our experiments demonstrate sound AIF predictions and parameter maps closely resembling the reference.</description>

      <title>Transverse contributions to the longitudinal stiffness of the human foot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04610</link>
      <description>arXiv:1706.04610v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humans rely on foot stiffness to withstand the propulsive forces of walking and running. Skeletal adaptations that increase foot stiffness include the medial longitudinal arch (MLA) and the transverse tarsal arch (TTA). The TTA has been hypothesized to stiffen the foot through cross-axis coupling of transverse intermetatarsal stiffness with sagittal-plane midfoot stiffness, but this has been tested only in cadaveric specimens. In vivo testing is essential because muscle contraction substantially modulates MLA function and may similarly affect the TTA's cross-axis coupling. Here we provide in vivo evidence for the TTA's contribution to foot stiffness by externally increasing intermetatarsal stiffness and measuring its effects on midfoot elasticity during walking. As predicted by the cross-axis coupling hypothesis, increasing intermetatarsal stiffness with an elastic tape wrapped around the forefoot reduced the energy absorbed in midfoot flattening and increased sagittal-plane midfoot stiffness concomitantly (mean,$\pm$,standard error of the mean (SEM): $13.9\% \pm 3\%$ and $16.8\% \pm 5.8\%$, respectively). However, taping did not change the curvature of the TTA, thereby isolating the effects of cross-axis coupling from morphological changes to the TTA. Thus, forefoot taping modulates midfoot stiffness through cross-axis coupling and could provide a non-invasive means to manage pathological foot flexibility or enhance athletic performance.</description>

      <title>FedCVD++: Communication-Efficient Federated Learning for Cardiovascular Risk Prediction with Parametric and Non-Parametric Model Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) cause over 17 million deaths annually worldwide, highlighting the urgent need for privacy-preserving predictive systems. We introduce FedCVD++, an enhanced federated learning (FL) framework that integrates both parametric models (logistic regression, SVM, neural networks) and non-parametric models (Random Forest, XGBoost) for coronary heart disease risk prediction. To address key FL challenges, we propose: (1) tree-subset sampling that reduces Random Forest communication overhead by 70%, (2) XGBoost-based feature extraction enabling lightweight federated ensembles, and (3) federated SMOTE synchronization for resolving cross-institutional class imbalance.
  Evaluated on the Framingham dataset (4,238 records), FedCVD++ achieves state-of-the-art results: federated XGBoost (F1 = 0.80) surpasses its centralized counterpart (F1 = 0.78), and federated Random Forest (F1 = 0.81) matches non-federated performance. Additionally, our communication-efficient strategies reduce bandwidth consumption by 3.2X while preserving 95% accuracy.
  Compared to existing FL frameworks, FedCVD++ delivers up to 15% higher F1-scores and superior scalability for multi-institutional deployment. This work represents the first practical integration of non-parametric models into federated healthcare systems, providing a privacy-preserving solution validated under real-world clinical constraints.</description>
