      <title>Discovery of crested quasi-periodic eruptions following the most luminous SRG/eROSITA tidal disruption event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of complex flaring activity from the galactic nucleus hosting the five-year-old tidal disruption event eRASSt J234402.9-352640 (J2344). With Einstein Probe and XMM-Newton observations, we detected highly structured soft X-ray variability. Through temporal decomposition of the XMM-Newton light curve and time-resolved spectral analysis, we identified broad, thermal flares recurring every $\sim$12 hours and lasting $\sim$2 hours, consistent with quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs). Remarkably, these QPEs are accompanied by an unprecedented crest of hotter, shorter flares, each lasting between 5 and 30 minutes. These flares are predominantly found in the rising phases of the QPEs, although they also appear throughout the quiescence. These findings establish J2344 as a new member of the QPE emitter population and uncover a previously unobserved phenomenology that challenges current models of QPEs. In this letter, we present the phenomenological properties of this unique source and discuss possible interpretations within the framework of extreme-mass-ratio inspirals.</description>

      <title>Modeling X-ray Bursting Neutron Star Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a verification of a computational model, developed at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) for simulating radiation transfer in X-ray bursting neutron star atmospheres. We tested a baseline case and demonstrated strong agreement in the behavior of the outgoing spectrum's color-correction factor with earlier work and theoretical expectations. By analyzing the relationship between the simulation time and outgoing flux, we also demonstrated how the model calculates through a sequence of time-independent atmospheric snapshots, each iteratively refined, and uses them to progressively converge toward the correct atmospheric state (as would be observed during a burst). We examined the behavior of the outgoing flux across different optical depths and explored the physical explanations for deviations from a pure blackbody spectrum, attributed to frequency-dependent opacity sources. Additionally, we assessed the impact of Compton scattering, highlighting its role in redistributing photon energies.</description>

      <title>McFACTS IV: Electromagnetic Counterparts to AGN Disk Embedded Binary Black Hole Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accretion disks of active galactic nuclei (AGN) are promising environments for producing binary black hole (BBH) mergers, which have been detected via gravitational waves (GW) with LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK). BBH mergers embedded in AGN disks are unique among GW formation channels in their generic ability to produce electromagnetic (EM) counterparts, via interactions between the merger remnant and the surrounding disk gas (though these are not always observable). While such mergers represent valuable multi-messenger sources, the lack of predictive statistical models in existing literature currently limits our ability to select possible EM counterparts with GW detections in archival data and in real time using time-domain surveys such as ZTF or LSST. Here, we employ the Monte Carlo For AGN Channel Testing and Simulation code (\texttt{McFACTS}\footnote{https://www.github.com/mcfacts/mcfacts}) to predict the bolometric luminosities of jets and shocks associated with LVK-detectable BBH merger remnants in AGN disks. \texttt{McFACTS} predicts the distribution of GW observables for an underlying BH population and disk model. In this work we present a new capability that simultaneously generates the distribution of bolometric EM luminosities corresponding to these predicted GW detections. We show that (i) migration traps in dense, Sirko-Goodman-like AGN disks efficiently drive hierarchical BH mergers, yielding high-mass, high-spin BH remnants capable of powering observable EM counterparts across merger generations; and ii) mergers embedded in sufficiently dense disks with chirp mass $\mathcal{M}\gtrsim40M_\odot$ are highly likely to yield observable EM counterparts for sufficiently long-lived disks and top-heavy BH initial mass functions.</description>

      <title>SN 2024abfl: A Low-Luminosity Type IIP Supernova in NGC 2146 from a Low-Mass Red Supergiant Progenitor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type IIP supernovae (SNe IIP) exhibit a significant diversity in their explosion properties, yet the physical mechanisms driving this diversity remain unknown. In this work, we present photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2024abfl, a SN IIP in NGC 2146 with a directly detected red supergiant (RSG) progenitor. We find it has a low plateau luminosity ($M_V \sim -15$ mag) and a relatively long plateau length ($\sim 126.5$ days). By fitting a semi-analytical model, we estimated a $^{56}$Ni mass of $\sim 0.009 M_\odot$, an initial kinetic energy of $\sim 0.42$ foe, an initial thermal energy of $\sim 0.03$ foe and an ejecta mass of $\sim 8.3 M_\odot$. The spectral evolution of SN 2024abfl is similar to those of other SNe IIP, except for much lower ejecta velocities at similar epochs. At later epochs, we find a relatively high-velocity H$\alpha$ absorption feature at $\sim -4000$ km s$^{-1}$, possibly due to a fast-moving plume of matter in the inner ejecta, and two emission features at $\pm 2000$ km s$^{-1}$, possibly caused by CSM interaction. We estimate the progenitor mass to be $\le 15 M_\odot$ based on nebular spectra. We conclude that SN 2024abfl is a low-luminosity SN IIP originating from a low-mass RSG progenitor.</description>

      <title>Emergence of cyclic flux eruptions in kinetic simulations of magnetized spherical accretion onto a Schwarzschild black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of black hole magnetospheres critically depend on the black hole spin and on the structure of the accretion flow. In the limit of a Schwarzschild black hole immersed in a zero-net angular momentum flow, accretion is spherical. However, in the presence of a large-scale vertical magnetic field, the classical Bondi accretion model is significantly altered. The frozen-in field is stretched radially as the plasma is pulled inward by gravity. This continues until the restoring force from the magnetic tension suddenly expels the material and resets the field, allowing a new cycle to begin. Although this scenario has been well depicted in previous studies, it remains incomplete as the issues of dissipation and particle acceleration are not yet fully resolved. In this work, we aim to revisit these issues with a first-principles kinetic plasma model. We perform two-dimensional global general relativistic particle-in-cell simulations of magnetized spherical accretion onto a Schwarzschild black hole, for both pair and electron-ion plasmas. The simulations are evolved over long timescales to capture multiple flux eruption events and establish a quasi-steady state. For each accretion cycle, we find that the system goes through three main stages: (i) an ideal advection phase where magnetic flux through the horizon increases quasi-linearly with time; (ii) a reconnection-regulated phase where the net increase of the flux is slowed down by intermittent reconnection events near the horizon; and (iii) a flaring phase when a major, large-scale reconnection event expels the flux, leading to efficient particle acceleration. The emergence of large-amplitude quasi-periodic flux eruptions and concomitant particle acceleration is reminiscent of Sgr A* flaring activity. This phenomenon could also be applicable to quiescent black holes, especially isolated black holes accreting the interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>$\gamma$-Ray Lines -- Signatures of Nucleosynthesis, Cosmic Rays, Positron Annihilation, and Fundamental Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nuclear $\gamma$-ray lines in the MeV range of the electromagnetic spectrum hold a vast variety of astrophysical, particle-physical, and fundamental physical information that is otherwise extreme difficult to access. MeV $\gamma$-ray line observations provide the most direct evidence for ongoing nucleosynthesis in galaxies by measuring freshly produced radioactive isotopes from massive stars, supernovae, classical novae, or binary neutron star mergers. Their flux ratios can determine the low-energy cosmic-ray spectrum in different objects and of the Milky Way as a whole. Different phases of the interstellar medium are traced by hot nucleosynthesis ejecta, cooling positrons, or cosmic-ray interactions with molecular clouds. Positron annihilation itself can be considered as an astrophysical messenger as their production and destruction in typical space environments is inevitable. Finally, as-of-yet unknown signatures from beyond standard model physics might have their elusive imprints in $\gamma$-ray lines. This Chapter gives an overview of historical $\gamma$-ray line measurements, newest results, and open questions that may only be solved by a new generation of MeV telescopes.</description>

      <title>Constraints on cyclotron features and accretion regime in the high-mass X-ray binary 4U 1700--37 from NuSTAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 4U 1700-37 is a wind-fed high-mass X-ray binary hosting a compact object, likely a neutron star, accreting from O6.5 Iaf+ supergiant HD 153919. Coherent pulsations not firmly detected; magnetic field strength remains uncertain. We analyze NuSTAR observations to characterize hard X-ray timing and spectral properties, test robustness of candidate cyclotron features, and constrain magnetic field and accretion regime. We perform timing and spectral analysis of two observations, modeling spectra with continua used for accreting pulsars, and use simulations to assess significance of features. No coherent pulsations detected; pulsed fraction constrained below 1.5\%. Spectra are well described by absorbed blackbody plus cutoff power-law continuum, showing residuals around 20 keV and 40--50 keV. Features improve fits but do not constitute firm cyclotron detections. Intensity-resolved spectroscopy suggests possible shifts of apparent line centroid. Results favor neutron-star magnetic field of 1.7--4.4 $\times 10^{12}$ G and quasi-spherical subsonic accretion regime with equilibrium spin period $\sim 1.9$ ks. Analysis provides quantitative constraints on magnetic field and accretion physics, helping reconcile discrepant line-energy measurements.</description>

      <title>An Afterglow Study of the "New Year's Burst" GRB 220101A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed broadband afterglow study of GRB 220101A ($10^4\lesssim\Delta T\lesssim10^7$ s) combining multi-wavelength data from soft X-rays until 6 GHz. The afterglow light curves in both X-ray and optical show distinct steepening around $\sim9$ days, followed by a sharp post-break decay index of $\sim2.99\pm0.10$. We fit the light curves using the afterglow modelling package \texttt{afterglowpy} for both Top-hat and Gaussian jets for different values of the electronic participation fraction $\xi$ from 0.01 to 1.0 and find that, although the radio behavior is well described by the $\xi=1.0$ case, the required circumburst medium (CBM) densities are very low, $&lt;10^{-4}$ cm$^{-3}$. However, the resulting energy requirements are modest, $\sim10^{52}$ erg, with an electron energy distribution (EED) index $p\sim2.05$. Similar results are also obtained from an analytic model fit to the light curve, except the predicted $p$ is higher, $\sim2.40$. The observed post-break decay index of $2.99$ is at least 5$\sigma$ away from $p$, which is one of the steepest observed so far. We also find that when ignoring the radio observations, the CBM density is raised by a few orders of magnitude to $\sim0.01$ cm$^{-3}$ for $\xi=1.0$, still far from the expected ISM density ($&gt;1$ cm$^{-3}$) of GRB environments, which are highly star forming regions. Similarly low ISM densities have been seen in modeling of other LAT GRBs as well, especially ones with reverse-shock features (e.g., GRBs 130427A, 160509A and 160625B), thereby hinting at either an issue with the standard model or possible evacuated cavities where GRBs explode.</description>

      <title>Low-mass stars dominate the hot (0.7 keV) Galactic X-ray emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The circumgalactic medium (CGM) of the Milky Way is composed of a tenuous atmosphere filled with multi-phase plasma, including a warm-hot virialised component. Recent studies suggest a much hotter (~0.7 keV) super-virial component detected in both absorption and emission. We want to shed light on the nature of this putative super-virial component. We analysed the X-ray background as observed by SRG/eROSITA over the entire western Galactic hemisphere. We show that low-mass stars provide a large fraction of the 0.7 keV emission. Indeed, a tight correlation is found between the surface brightness of the 0.7 keV emission and the mass distribution of the Milky Way across a large portion of the western Galactic hemisphere. The correlation coefficient implies an X-ray luminosity per unit of stellar mass comparable to that of the average low-mass stars within 10 pc of the Sun, suggesting that unresolved M dwarfs and F, G, and K type stars dominate the 0.7 keV emission. This emission is asymmetric with respect to the Galactic plane, influenced by the asymmetric distribution of nearby star-forming regions, and broadly consistent with the known offset of the Sun above the Galactic midplane. The remaining signal might be produced by the cumulative emission of stars of different types or ages, in addition to other sources (e.g. hot interstellar medium, Galactic corona, etc.). Assuming that the putative residual hot super-virial atmosphere is homogeneous and has a spherical beta profile with slope $\beta=0.4$, we constrain its density at 10 kpc to be $n_e&lt;4\times10^{-4}$~cm$^{-3}$. Our findings may help refine models of the circumgalactic medium around external galaxies, advancing our understanding of hot baryon flows and galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>Eigenmodes in an ultra-relativistic ultra-magnetized pair QED-plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-relativistic quantum-electrodynamic (QED) plasmas, characterized by magnetic field strengths approaching and even exceeding the Schwinger field of approximately $B_{Q} \approx 4 \times 10^{13}$ gauss, hold significant interest for laser-plasma experiments and astrophysical observations of neutron stars and magnetars. In this study, we investigate the joint modification of normal plasma modes in ultra-relativistic electron-positron plasmas, both charge neutral and non-neutral, by the super-strong magnetic field and plasma relativistic temperature. Our analysis shows that the most substantial modification concerns the reduction of the plasma frequency cutoff, resulting in relativistic and field-induced transparency. Additionally, we observe a temperature-independent modification of the index of refraction of electromagnetic waves, which coincides with the behavior observed in a cold QED plasma.</description>

      <title>From Main Sequence Binary to Blast: MESA Modeling of the Double-Detonation Progenitor PTF1~J2238+7430</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hot subdwarf B (sdB) stars in close binaries with white dwarf (WD) companions are potential progenitors of double-detonation thermonuclear supernovae. The recently discovered system PTF1 J2238+7430 is a candidate for this evolutionary channel, hosting a low-mass sdB and a comparatively massive WD in a compact orbit. We aim to reproduce the evolutionary history of PTF1 J2238+7430, in which the sdB forms first via stable mass transfer, followed by the formation of the WD through a subsequent common-envelope (CE) phase. Additionally, we seek to constrain the range of initial binary parameters that can lead to such double-detonation progenitors. Using the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA), we performed detailed binary evolution simulations from the zero-age main sequence to the present-day configuration. We explored initial stellar masses, orbital periods, and mass-loss fractions, including the effects of angular momentum transfer, tidal synchronization, and gravitational-wave-driven orbital evolution. The post-CE binary properties were derived using the standard energy formalism. Our models successfully reproduce the observed properties of PTF1 J2238+7430, consisting of a 0.406 solar-mass sdB and a 0.72 solar-mass WD in a 76.34-minute orbit. Stable Roche-lobe overflow of an approximately 2.7 solar-mass donor produces the sdB, while the WD forms from the initially less massive companion during an episode of CE evolution. We find that the CE ejection efficiency must be high to match the observed orbit, exceeding canonical values for similar systems. We further delineate the allowed parameter space for initial binaries that can evolve into sdB+WD systems consistent with double-detonation progenitors. These limits are preliminary; a systematic exploration of all parameters is needed for robust constraints, but our results provide a useful starting point for future work.</description>

      <title>SN 2017ati: A luminous type IIb explosion from a massive progenitor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present optical photometric and spectroscopic observations of the Type~IIb supernova (SN)~2017ati. It reached the maximum light at about 27~d after the explosion and the light curve shows a broad, luminous peak with an absolute $r$-band magnitude of $M_{r} = -18.48 \pm 0.16$~mag. At about 50~d after maximum light, SN~2017ati exhibits a decline rate close to that expected from the $^{56}$Co $\rightarrow$ $^{56}$Fe radioactive decay, at 0.98 mag per 100 days, as usually observed in SNe IIb. However, it remains systematically brighter at late times by about 1--2~mag, exceeding the usual upper luminosity range of this class. As a result, modelling the light curve of SN~2017ati with a standard $^{56}$Ni decay scenario requires a large nickel mass of up to $\sim0.37\,M_{\odot}$ and still fails to reproduce the early-time light curve adequately. In contrast, incorporating additional energy input from a magnetar yields a significantly improved fit to the light curve of SN~2017ati, which would reduce the nickel mass to $\sim0.21\,M_{\odot}$, still close to the upper end of the range typically inferred for SNe~IIb. Comparing the fitted results of SN~2017ati with the known sample of SNe~IIb indicates that its luminosity evolution is best explained by a combination of neutron star spin-down energy and radioactive nickel deposition. From late-time nebular spectra of SN~2017ati, the luminosity of the [\Oi]~$\lambda\lambda6300,6364$ doublet implies an oxygen mass of $\sim1.82-3.34\,M_{\odot}$, and the combination of a [\Caii]/[\Oi] flux ratio of $\sim0.5$ with nebular spectral model comparisons favours a progenitor zero-age main-sequence mass of $\geq17\,M_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>Neutron Dark Decay and Exotic Compact Objects</title>

Abstract: Recent measurements of the compact star XTE J1814-338, with a mass of $M=1.2_{-0.05}^{+0.05}\ M_{\odot}$ and a radius of $R=7_{-0.4}^{+0.4} \ {\rm Km}$ alongside those of HESS J1731-347, which has a mass of $M=0.77_{-0.17}^{+0.20}\ M_{\odot}$ and a radius of $R=10.4_{-0.78}^{+0.86} \ {\rm Km}$, provide compelling evidence for the potential existence of exotic matter in neutron star cores. These observations offer important insights into the equation of state of dense nuclear matter. Recently, Fornal and Grinstein, in order to overcame the discrepancy between the neutron lifetime measured in beam and bottle experiments, proposed the existence of neutron dark decay. In the present work, an effort is made to connect the interpretation of the above exotic compact objects with the possible existence of dark particles, assumed to be products of neutron dark decay. Our hypothesis offers an advantage over comparable proposals, as the coexistence of dark matter and hadronic matter within neutron stars emerges from an intrinsic mechanism, thereby obviating the need to invoke external merger-related processes. It is still unclear to what extent the proposed dark decay of the neutron is affected by the extreme environment within neutron stars. Within this framework, we examined the case in which a mechanism suppressing the dark neutron decay becomes operative at densities few times above nuclear saturation density. We found that the proposed alternative explanation accommodates the simultaneous existence of neutron dark decay while consistently predicting both the two solar mass limit and the presence of compact objects with subsolar masses.</description>

      <title>Expanding the Horizon of Black Hole Imaging with AtLAST</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has directly resolved and imaged two supermassive black holes and opening a new window on black hole physics. However, the current array is limited to only these two brightest nearby targets. This white paper outlines how future EHT upgrades, anchored by the Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST), will enable a transformative expansion of the accessible population of event-horizon-scale sources. By substantially improving sensitivity and multi-frequency capabilities, EHT+AtLAST will enable demographic studies of black hole growth, accretion physics, and jet launching across a wide range of masses, environments, and accretion states.</description>

      <title>Inference on inner galaxy structure via gravitational waves from supermassive binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05906v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection of a stochastic gravitational wave background by pulsar-timing arrays indicates the presence of a population of supermassive black hole binaries. Although the observed spectrum generally matches predictions for orbital evolution driven by gravitational-wave emission in circular orbits, there is a preference for a spectral turnover at the lowest observed frequencies, which may point to substantial hardening during a transition from early environmental influences to later stages dominated by emission. In the vicinity of these binaries, the ejection of stars or dark matter particles through gravitational three-body slingshots efficiently extracts orbital energy, leading to a low-frequency turnover in the spectrum. Here we model how the gravitational-wave spectrum depends on the initial inner galactic profile before scouring by binary ejections while accounting for a range of initial binary eccentricities. By analysing the NANOGrav 15-year data, we find that a parsec-scale galactic-centre density of around $10^6 M_{\odot} \mathrm{pc}^{-3}$ is favoured across most of the parameter space, thus shedding light on the environmental effects that shape black hole evolution and the combined matter density near galaxy centres.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Ray Magnetohydrodynamics: A New Two-Moment Framework with Numerical Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmic rays (CRs) play a pivotal role in various astrophysical systems, delivering feedback over a broad range of scales. However, modeling CR transport remains challenging due to its inherently multi-scale nature and complex microphysics. Recent advances in two-moment CR hydrodynamics have alleviated some of these challenges, improving understanding of CR feedback. Yet, current two-moment methods may not be able to directly incorporate all relevant CR transport processes, while the outcome of CR feedback sensitively depends on these underlying microphysics. Furthermore, numerical challenges persist, including instabilities from streaming terms and ambiguities in solver design for coupled CR-MHD systems. In this work, we develop a two-moment description for CR hydrodynamics from first principles. Beyond canonical CR streaming, our formulation accounts for CR pressure anisotropy and Alfv\'en waves propagating in both directions along the magnetic field, providing a general framework to incorporate more CR transport physics. We implement this framework as a new CR fluid module in the \textit{Athena}++ code, and validate it through a suite of benchmark tests. In particular, we derive the full dispersion relation of the two-moment CR-MHD system, identifying the CR-acoustic instability as well as other wave branches. These CR-MHD waves serve as rigorous benchmarks and also enable the use of realistic signal speeds in our Riemann solver. We propose a time step guideline to mitigate numerical instabilities arising from streaming source terms.</description>

      <title>Polar Mounds on Strangeon Stars: the Neutrino Emission from Ultraluminous X-ray Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultraluminous X-ray pulsars (ULXPs) serve as unique astrophysical laboratories, offering critical insights into accretion physics under extreme conditions, such as strong magnetic fields and super-Eddington accretion rates. Additionally, the nature of pulsars, i.e., the equation of state of supranuclear matter, is still a matter of intense debate, basing on either conventional neutron stars or strange stars. In this work, in order to differentiate the conjectured states of matter, we investigate accretion columns of ULXPs based on the strangeon-star (SS) model, focusing on the thermal mound at the column base. Accounting for Coulomb and strangeness barriers of SSs, we find that the mound can reach $0.7-0.95\,\rm km$ in height with temperatures above $10^9\, \rm K$, enabling substantial neutrino emission via electron-positron annihilation. At low accretion rates ($&lt; 10^{20}\, \rm g\,s^{-1}$), photons dominate the luminosity, while at higher rates ($&gt; 10^{21}\, \rm g\, s^{-1}$), photon trapping makes neutrino emission the main cooling channel, with total luminosity exceeding photon emission, which saturates near $10^{41}\, \rm erg\,s^{-1}$. Even though the predicted neutrino flux from the nearest system, Swift J0243.6$+$6124, lies well below the diffuse MeV background--implying that detectable emission would require substantially closer or more luminous sources--these results demonstrate the key role of the thermal mound and SS properties in accretion, providing a foundation for future ULXP studies and suggesting that neutrino observations could, in principle, offer a novel probe of SSs and extreme supranuclear matter.</description>

      <title>New determination of the neutrino hadronic production cross sections from GeV to beyond PeV energies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The flux of astrophysical neutrinos is now measured with unprecedented accuracy and over several decades of energy spectrum. Their origin traces back to hadronic collisions between protons and nuclei in the cosmic rays with hydrogen and helium in the target gas. To accurately interpret the data, a precise determination of the underlying cross sections is therefore mandatory. We present a new evaluation of the neutrino production cross section from $p+p$ collisions, building on our previous analysis of the production cross section for $\pi^\pm$, $K^\pm$, and minor baryonic and mesonic channels. Cross sections for scatterings involving nuclei heavier than protons are also derived. The novelty of our approach is the analytical description of the Lorentz invariant cross section $\sigma_{\rm inv}$, and the fit of the model to the available accelerator data. We work with neutrino energies from $10$ GeV to $10^7$ GeV, and, correspondingly, to incident proton (nuclei) energies from $10$ GeV to $10^9$ GeV (GeV/n). We obtain the total differential cross section, $d\sigma(p+p\rightarrow \nu+X)/dE_{\nu}$ as a function of neutrino and proton energies, with an estimated uncertainty of 5% for neutrino energies below 100 GeV, increasing to 10% above TeV energies. Predictions are given for $\nu_e, \nu_\mu, \bar{\nu_e}$ and $\bar{\nu_\mu}$. A comparison with state-of-the-art cross sections, all relying on Monte Carlo generators, is also presented. To facilitate the use by the community, we provide numerical tables and a script for accessing our energy-differential cross sections.</description>

      <title>The steep redshift evolution of the hierarchical binary black hole merger rate may cause the $z$-$\chi_{\rm eff}$ correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03456v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is growing evidence from gravitational-wave observations that some merging black holes are created from previous mergers. Using the prediction that these hierarchically-merged black holes have dimensionless spin magnitudes of $\chi \approx 0.69$, we identify a subpopulation in the gravitational-wave data consistent with a hierarchical-merger origin in dense star clusters. This subpopulation's primary mass distribution peaks at $17.0^{+18.3}_{-4.4},\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, which is approximately twice as large as its secondary mass distribution's mode ($10.5^{+29.7}_{-4.7},\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$), and its spin tilt distribution is consistent with isotropy. Our inferred secondary mass distributions imply that isolated binary evolution may still be needed to explain the entirety of the $9\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ peak. Surprisingly, we find that the rate of hierarchical mergers may evolve more steeply with redshift than the rest of the population ($98.0\%$ credibility): the fraction of all binary black holes that are hierarchically formed at $z=0.1$ is $0.03^{+0.05}_{-0.02}$, compared to $0.09^{+0.11}_{-0.07}$ at $z=1$. This provides an explanation for the previously-discovered broadening of the effective spin distribution with redshift. Our results have implications for star cluster formation histories, as they suggest the potential existence of a high-redshift population of massive, compact clusters.</description>

      <title>The X-ray properties and structure of A3571 up to $R_{500}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Abell 3571 is a nearby, X-ray bright galaxy cluster located in the Shapley Supercluster. Although it appears morphologically relaxed in X-ray images, multiwavelength observations reveal subtle indications of residual dynamical activity, likely associated with past merger events. Using wide-field ($1^{\circ} \times 1^{\circ}$) data from the Einstein Probe Follow-up X-ray Telescope (EP-FXT), we extend measurements of the cluster's properties beyond its $R_{500}$ radius. We detect surface-brightness excesses on both the northern and southern sides, consistent with previous XMM-Newton results. The temperature, pressure, and entropy in the northern excess region are lower than the average values, whereas those on the southern side are slightly higher. However, we find no evidence for cold fronts or shocks. These features can be interpreted as sloshing motions triggered by an off-center minor merger. Our findings suggest that, despite its symmetric appearance, A3571 is still recovering from a minor merger and is currently in a post-merger phase. This work also demonstrates the excellent capability of EP-FXT for probing the outskirts of galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>A multi-wavelength study of the 2025 low state of the intermediate polar BG CMi</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14156v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present multi-wavelength observations of the first recorded low state of the intermediate polar BG CMi. Optical monitoring of the source by members of the American Association of Variable Star Observers reveals a decrease of ~0.5 mag that lasted ~50 d in early 2025. During the low state the optical timing properties imply that BG CMi underwent a change in the accretion mode, as power at the spin frequency $\omega$ dramatically dropped. An XMM-Newton observation revealed a substantial decrease in intrinsic absorption and a slight increase in intrinsic X-ray luminosity, compared to archival Suzaku data. Timing analysis of the X-ray light curves shows that power shifted from the orbital frequency $\Omega$ (prominent in Suzaku data) to $2\Omega$ in the low state XMM-Newton data, along with the strengthening of certain orbital sidebands. We suggest that BG CMi transitioned to disk-overflow accretion, where the white dwarf accreted matter via both a disk and a stream, the latter becoming more dominant during the low state due to a decrease in the mass and size of the disk.</description>

Abstract: Twin stars are predicted to exist in nature if the hadron-to-quark phase transition is strong enough to form a new branch of hybrid stars, separated from the branch of neutron stars. We adopt an agnostic approach, using transition energy density, transition pressure, the discontinuity strength, and a constant speed of sound for quark matter as our parameter space to construct a large possibility of hybrid equations of state, and thereby encapsulating a comprehensive picture of the twin star scenario. First, we report the complete conditions on our parameter space imposed by the general relativistic hydrostatic equilibrium solutions. For a fixed transition energy density and speed of sound for quark matter, we define distinct ranges of transition pressures based on the allowed strengths of discontinuity. Below a maximum transition pressure, a range of discontinuity exists that increases as the transition pressure decreases. Thereby, we identify the loci of the limits on discontinuities as the `witch-hat' curves. Based on the causality limit, the witch-hat curves can be punctured or incomplete. Strong constraints on this picture are drawn from the inferences from GW170817 and the NICER measurements. We computed the maximum mass for twin stars to be $2.05~M_\odot$, the allowed strongest discontinuity in rest-mass density to be $7.76\rho_\mathrm{sat}$, and the upper bound on transition rest-mass density to be $4.03\rho_\mathrm{sat}$. Subsequently, we compute the implications of the stiffness of the quark matter equation of state on this picture. Different confidence levels for observational inferences are considered to assess the extent of inclusion (and rejection) of hybrid equations of state and, consequently, their effects on the limits of the maximum mass of twin stars and phase transition properties.</description>

      <title>Laboratory Modeling of Supernova Remnants Collisions: Implications for Triggered Star Formation</title>

Abstract: Theoretical models of star formation consistently underestimate the rates observed in astronomical surveys. Stars form within giant molecular clouds, which fragment into dense clumps under the combined influences of turbulence, magnetic fields, radiation, and gravity. While some of these clumps collapse spontaneously, others require an external trigger, a mechanism estimated to account for 14%-25% of star formation in regions such as the Elephant Trunk Nebula. Laboratory astrophysics has emerged as a powerful approach for investigating such triggering processes, in particular those involving supernova remnants (SNRs). Recent experiments, guided by well-established scaling laws, have successfully replicated the dynamics of SNRs and their interactions with dense clumps or other SNRs. In this work, we present a comprehensive numerical study of these experimental configurations using the 3D radiation-hydrodynamics code TROLL. The simulations provide enhanced insight into the underlying physical mechanisms, accurately reproduce key experimental phenomena, and offer valuable comparisons with analytical models. This study underscores the strong synergy between laboratory experiments and numerical simulations, laying a robust foundation for future advancements in laboratory astrophysics. Furthermore, we propose a new experimental setup that offers improved scaling for the asymmetric collision observed in the DEM L316 system. Our findings also show that SNR collisions in dense environments can decrease the gravitational stability of dense clumps, thereby promoting their collapse and potentially triggering star formation.</description>

      <title>Common Envelope Evolution of Ultralight Boson Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultralight bosons can be excited around spinning black holes via black hole superradiance. These boson clouds may play an important role in the orbital evolution of binary black holes. In this work, we investigate the formation and evolution of common envelopes of ultralight boson clouds in comparable mass-ratio black hole binaries. We describe the cloud evolution using gravitational molecular eigenstates and analyze the possible level transitions during orbital decay, as well as the impact on orbital dynamics. We find that the cloud can generally lead to eccentricity growth. In particular, the eccentricity may vary significantly during level transition, leaving an eccentricity of ${\cal O}(0.1)$ within the detection band of ground-based gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Co-evolution of Nuclear Star Clusters and Massive Black Holes: Extreme Mass-Ratio Inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) in the co-evolution of massive black holes (MBHs) and nuclear star clusters (NSCs), which host diverse stellar populations across a wide range of masses. The dynamics are simulated self-consistently with GNC, which we have updated to incorporate gravitational wave orbital decay, the loss cone of a spinning MBH, and stellar evolution. Over $12$ Gyr, we investigate the evolution of the NSC with a mass-growing MBH, as well as the EMRIs of stellar black holes, neutron stars, white dwarfs, brown dwarfs (BDs), and low-mass main-sequence stars (MSs), along with tidal disruption events (TDEs) involving MSs, BDs, and post-MSs. The mass growth of the MBH contributed by TDEs is typically $\sim 10^7\,M_{\odot}$, $\sim 10^6\,M_{\odot}$, and $\sim 5\times10^4\,M_{\odot}$ for massive, Milky-Way-like, and smaller NSCs, respectively. Between $40\%$ and $70\%$ of the stellar mass is lost during stellar evolution, which dominates the mass growth of the MBH if a significant fraction of the lost mass is accreted. The evolution of EMRI rates is generally affected by the cluster's size expansion or contraction, stellar population evolution, MBH mass growth, and the stellar initial mass function. The EMRI rates for compact objects peak at early epochs ($\lesssim 1$ Gyr) and then gradually decline over cosmic time. LISA-band ($0.1$ mHz) EMRIs involving compact objects around Milky-Way-like MBHs tend to have high eccentricities, while those around spinning MBHs preferentially occupy low-inclination (prograde) orbits. In contrast, MS- and BD-EMRIs usually have eccentricity and inclination distributions that are distinct from those of compact objects.</description>

      <title>Finite Populations &amp; Finite Time: The Non-Gaussianity of a Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong evidence for an isotropic, Gaussian gravitational wave background (GWB) has been found by multiple pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). The GWB is expected to be sourced by a finite population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) emitting in the PTA sensitivity band, and astrophysical inference of PTA data sets suggests a GWB signal that is at the higher end of GWB spectral amplitude estimates. However, current inference analyses make simplifying assumptions, such as modeling the GWB as Gaussian, assuming that all SMBHBs only emit at frequencies that are integer multiples of the total observing time, and ignoring the interference between the signals of different SMBHBs. In this paper, we build analytical and numerical models of an astrophysical GWB without the above approximations, and compare the statistical properties of its induced PTA signal to those of a signal produced by a Gaussian GWB. We show that finite population and windowing effects introduce non-Gaussianities in the PTA signal, which are currently unmodeled in PTA analyses.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Lorentz-Dirac Dynamics and Post-Newtonian Interaction of Radiating Point Charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18637v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine classical radiation reaction by combining the covariant Lorentz--Dirac formulation, its Landau--Lifshitz (LL) order reduction, and a post-Newtonian (PN) Hamiltonian treatment of interacting and radiating charges. After reviewing the LL reduction and its removal of runaway and preacceleration behavior, we verify energy balance in several relativistic single-particle scenarios by demonstrating agreement between the LL Larmor power and the loss of mechanical energy. We then construct an N-body framework based on the conservative Darwin Hamiltonian supplemented with the leading 1.5PN radiation--reaction term. Numerical simulations of charge-neutral binary systems of both symmetric and asymmetric mass configurations show orbital decay, circularization, and monotonic Hamiltonian decrease consistent with dipole radiative losses. The resulting framework provides a simple analogue of gravitational PN radiation reaction and a tractable system for studying dissipative and potentially chaotic electromagnetic dynamics.</description>
