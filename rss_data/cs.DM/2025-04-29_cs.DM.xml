      <title>The frequency $K_i$s for symmetrical traveling salesman problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The frequency $K_i$s ($i\in[4,n]$) are studied for symmetrical traveling salesman problem ($TSP$) to identify the edges in optimal Hamiltonian cycle ($OHC$). A frequency $K_i$ is computed with a sort of ${{i}\choose{2}}$ optimal $i$-vertex paths with given endpoints (optimal $i$-vertex path) in a corresponding $K_i$ in $K_n$. In frequency $K_i$, the frequency of an edge is the number of the optimal $i$-vertex paths containing the edge in the corresponding $K_i$. Given an $OHC$ edge related to $K_i$, it has a frequency bigger than $\frac{1}{2}{{i}\choose{2}}$ in the corresponding frequency $K_i$, and that of an ordinary edge not in $OHC$ is smaller than $\frac{i+2}{2}$. On average, an $OHC$ edge in $K_i$ has a frequency bigger than $\frac{i^2-4i+7}{2}$ whereas an ordinary edge has a frequency smaller than 2. Moreover, given a frequency $K_i$ containing an $OHC$ edge related to $K_n$, the frequency of the $OHC$ edge is bigger than $\frac{1}{2}{{i}\choose{2}}$ in the worst average case. It implies that the average frequency of an $OHC$ edge computed with frequency $K_i$s is bigger than $\frac{1}{2}{{i}\choose{2}}$. It also found that the probability that an $OHC$ edge is contained in optimal $i$-vertex paths keeps stable or increases according to $i\in [4, n]$. As the frequency $K_i$s are used to compute the frequency of an edge, each $OHC$ edge has its own peak frequency at $i=P_0$ where $P_0=\frac{n}{2} + 2$ for even $n$ or $\frac{n+1}{2} + 1$ for odd $n$. For ordinary edges out of $OHC$, the probability that they are contained in optimal $i$-vertex paths decreases according to $i$. Moreover, the average frequency of an ordinary edge will be smaller than $\frac{1}{2}{{i}\choose{2}}$ if $i \geq [0.3660n + 1.5849]$. Based on these findings, an algorithm is presented to find $OHC$ in $O(n^62^{0.3660n})$ time using dynamic programming.</description>

      <title>A Group Theoretic Construction of Batch Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Batch codes serve as critical tools for load balancing in distributed storage systems. While numerous constructions exist for specific batch sizes t, current methodologies predominantly rely on code dimension parameters, limiting their adaptability. Practical implementations, however, demand versatile batch code designs capable of accommodating arbitrary batch sizes-a challenge that remains understudied in the literature. This paper introduces a novel framework for constructing batch codes through finite groups and their subgroup structures, building on the quasi-uniform group code framework proposed by Chan et al. By leveraging algebraic properties of groups, the proposed method enables systematic code construction, streamlined decoding procedures, and efficient reconstruction of information symbols. Unlike traditional linear codes, quasi-uniform codes exhibit broader applicability due to their inherent structural flexibility.
  Focusing on abelian 2-groups, the work investigates their subgroup lattices and demonstrates their utility in code design-a contribution of independent theoretical interest. The resulting batch codes achieve near-optimal code lengths and exhibit potential for dual application as locally repairable codes (LRCs), addressing redundancy and fault tolerance in distributed systems. This study not only advances batch code construction but also establishes group-theoretic techniques as a promising paradigm for future research in coded storage systems. By bridging algebraic structures with practical coding demands, the approach opens new directions for optimizing distributed storage architectures.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Split Comparability Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A split graph is a graph whose vertex set can be partitioned into a clique and an independent set. A split comparability graph is a split graph which is transitively orientable. In this work, we characterize split comparability graphs in terms of vertex labelling. Further, using this characterization, we prove that the permutation-representation number of a split comparability graph is at most three. This gives us an alternative proof of the result in order theory that the dimension of a split order is at most three.</description>

      <title>Expanding vertices to triangles in cubic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contraction of triangles is a standard operation in the study of cubic graphs, as it reduces the order of the graph while typically preserving many of its properties. In this paper, we investigate the converse problem, wherein certain vertices of cubic graphs are expanded into triangles to achieve a desired property. We first focus on bridgeless cubic graphs and define the parameter $T(G)$ as the minimum number of vertices that need to be expanded into triangles so that the resulting cubic graph can be covered with four perfect matchings. We relate this parameter to the concept of shortest cycle cover. Furthermore, we show that if $5$-Cycle Double Cover Conejcture holds true, then $T(G)\leq \frac{2}{5} |V(G)|$. We conjecture a tighter bound, $T(G)\leq \frac{1}{10}|V(G)|$, which is optimal for the Petersen graph, and show that this bound follows from major conjectures like the Petersen Coloring Conjecture. In the second part of the paper, we introduce the parameter $t(G)$ as the minimum number of vertex expansions needed for the graph to admit a perfect matching. We prove a Gallai type identity: $t(G)+\ell(G)=|V(G)|$, where $\ell(G)$ is the number of edges in a largest even subgraph of $G$. Then we prove the general upper bound $t(G)&lt; \frac{1}{4}|V(G)|$ for cubic graphs, and $t(G)&lt; \frac{1}{6}|V(G)|$ for cubic graphs without parallel edges. We provide examples showing that these bounds are asymptotically tight. The paper concludes with a discussion of the computational complexity of determining these parameters.</description>

      <title>(Almost-)Optimal FPT Algorithm and Kernel for $T$-Cycle on Planar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research of cycles through specific vertices is a central topic in graph theory. In this context, we focus on a well-studied computational problem, \textsc{$T$-Cycle}: given an undirected $n$-vertex graph $G$ and a set of $k$ vertices $T\subseteq V(G)$ termed \textit{terminals}, the objective is to determine whether $G$ contains a simple cycle $C$ through all the terminals. Our contribution is twofold: (i) We provide a $2^{O(\sqrt{k}\log k)}\cdot n$-time fixed-parameter deterministic algorithm for \textsc{$T$-Cycle} on planar graphs; (ii) We provide a $k^{O(1)}\cdot n$-time deterministic kernelization algorithm for \textsc{$T$-Cycle} on planar graphs where the produced instance is of size $k\log^{O(1)}k$.
  Both of our algorithms are optimal in terms of both $k$ and $n$ up to (poly)logarithmic factors in $k$ under the ETH. In fact, our algorithms are the first subexponential-time fixed-parameter algorithm for \textsc{$T$-Cycle} on planar graphs, as well as the first polynomial kernel for \textsc{$T$-Cycle} on planar graphs. This substantially improves upon/expands the known literature on the parameterized complexity of the problem.</description>

      <title>Hardness of Finding Kings and Strong Kings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A king in a directed graph is a vertex $v$ such that every other vertex is reachable from $v$ via a path of length at most $2$. It is well known that every tournament (a complete graph where each edge has a direction) has at least one king. Our contributions in this work are:
  - We show that the query complexity of determining existence of a king in arbitrary $n$-vertex digraphs is $\Theta(n^2)$. This is in stark contrast to the case where the input is a tournament, where Shen, Sheng, and Wu [SICOMP'03] showed that a king can be found in $O(n^{3/2})$ queries.
  - In an attempt to increase the "fairness" in the definition of tournament winners, Ho and Chang [IPL'03] defined a strong king to be a king $k$ such that, for every $v$ that dominates $k$, the number of length-$2$ paths from $k$ to $v$ is strictly larger than the number of length-$2$ paths from $v$ to $k$. We show that the query complexity of finding a strong king in a tournament is $\Theta(n^2)$. This answers a question of Biswas, Jayapaul, Raman, and Satti [DAM'22] in the negative.
  A key component in our proofs is the design of specific tournaments where every vertex is a king, and analyzing certain properties of these tournaments. We feel these constructions and properties are independently interesting and may lead to more interesting results about tournament solutions.</description>

      <title>Determining a graph from its reconfiguration graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$ and a natural number $k$, the $k$-recolouring graph $\mathcal{C}_k(G)$ is the graph whose vertices are the $k$-colourings of $G$ and whose edges link pairs of colourings which differ at exactly one vertex of $G$. Recently, Hogan et al. proved that $G$ can be determined from $\mathcal{C}_k(G)$ provided $k$ is large enough (quadratic in the number of vertices of $G$). We improve this bound by showing that $k=\chi(G)+1$ colours suffice, and provide examples of families of graphs for which $k=\chi(G)$ colours do not suffice.
  We then extend this result to $k$-Kempe-recolouring graphs, whose vertices are again the $k$-colourings of a graph $G$ and whose edges link pairs of colourings which differ by swapping the two colours in a connected component induced by selecting those two colours. We show that $k=\chi(G)+2$ colours suffice to determine $G$ in this case.
  Finally, we investigate the case of independent set reconfiguration, proving that in only a few trivial cases is one guaranteed to be able to determine a graph $G$.</description>

      <title>Spectral Independence Beyond Uniqueness with. the topological method -- An extended view</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present novel results for fast mixing of Glauber dynamics using the newly introduced and powerful Spectral Independence method from [Anari, Liu, Oveis-Gharan: FOCS 2020]. We mainly focus on the Hard-core model and the Ising model. We obtain bounds for fast mixing with the parameters expressed in terms of the spectral radius of the adjacency matrix, improving on the seminal work in [Hayes: FOCS 2006]. Furthermore, we go beyond the adjacency matrix and establish -- for the first time -- rapid mixing results for Glauber dynamics expressed in terms of the spectral radius of the Hashimoto non-backtracking matrix of the underlying graph $G$. Working with the non-backtracking spectrum is extremely challenging, but also more desirable. Its eigenvalues are less correlated with the high-degree vertices than those of the adjacency matrix and express more accurately invariants of the graph such as the growth rate. Our results require ``weak normality" from the Hashimoto matrix. This condition is mild and allows us to obtain very interesting bound. We study the pairwise influence matrix ${I}^{\Lambda,\tau}_{G}$ by exploiting the connection between the matrix and the trees of self-avoiding walks, however, we go beyond the standard treatment of the distributional recursions. The common framework that underlies our techniques we call the topological method. Our approach is novel and gives new insights into how to establish Spectral Independence for Gibbs distributions. More importantly, it allows us to derive new -- improved -- rapid mixing bounds for Glauber dynamics on distributions such as the Hard-core model and the Ising model for graphs that the spectral radius is smaller than the maximum degree.</description>

      <title>On sampling two spin models using the local connective constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work establishes novel optimum mixing bounds for the Glauber dynamics on the Hard-core and Ising models. These bounds are expressed in terms of the local connective constant of the underlying graph $G$. This is a notion of effective degree for $G$.
  Our results have some interesting consequences for bounded degree graphs:
  (a) They include the max-degree bounds as a special case
  (b) They improve on the running time of the FPTAS considered in [Sinclair, Srivastava, \v Stefankoni\v c and Yin: PTRF 2017] for general graphs
  (c) They allow us to obtain mixing bounds in terms of the spectral radius of the adjacency matrix and improve on [Hayes: FOCS 2006].
  We obtain our results using tools from the theory of high-dimensional expanders and, in particular, the Spectral Independence method [Anari, Liu, Oveis-Gharan: FOCS 2020]. We explore a new direction by utilising the notion of the $k$-non-backtracking matrix $H_{G,k}$ in our analysis with the Spectral Independence. The results with $H_{G,k}$ are interesting in their own right.</description>

Abstract: In 2009, Shur published the following conjecture: Let $L$ be a power-free language and let $e(L)\subseteq L$ be the set of words of $L$ that can be extended to a bi-infinite word respecting the given power-freeness. If $u, v \in e(L)$ then $uwv \in e(L)$ for some word $w$. Let $L_{k,\alpha}$ denote an $\alpha$-power free language over an alphabet with $k$ letters, where $\alpha$ is a positive rational number and $k$ is positive integer. We prove the conjecture for the languages $L_{k,\alpha}$, where $\alpha\geq 5$ and $k\geq 3$.</description>

Abstract: A split graph is a graph whose vertex set can be partitioned into a clique and an independent set. The word-representability of split graphs was studied in a series of papers in the literature, and the class of word-representable split graphs was characterized through semi-transitive orientation. Nonetheless, the representation number of this class of graphs is still not known. In general, determining the representation number of a word-representable graph is an NP-complete problem. In this work, through an algorithmic procedure, we show that the representation number of the class of word-representable split graphs is at most three. Further, we characterize the class of word-representable split graphs as well as the class of split comparability graphs which have representation number exactly three.</description>

      <title>The Beginner's Textbook for Fully Homomorphic Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05136v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a cryptographic scheme that enables computations to be performed directly on encrypted data, as if the data were in plaintext. After all computations are performed on the encrypted data, it can be decrypted to reveal the result. The decrypted value matches the result that would have been obtained if the same computations were applied to the plaintext data.
  FHE supports basic operations such as addition and multiplication on encrypted numbers. Using these fundamental operations, more complex computations can be constructed, including subtraction, division, logic gates (e.g., AND, OR, XOR, NAND, MUX), and even advanced mathematical functions such as ReLU, sigmoid, and trigonometric functions (e.g., sin, cos). These functions can be implemented either as exact formulas or as approximations, depending on the trade-off between computational efficiency and accuracy.
  Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enables privacy-preserving machine learning by allowing a server to process the client's data in its encrypted form through an ML model. With FHE, the server learns neither the plaintext version of the input features nor the inference results. Only the client, using their secret key, can decrypt and access the results at the end of the service protocol.FHE can also be applied to confidential blockchain services, ensuring that sensitive data in smart contracts remains encrypted and confidential while maintaining the transparency and integrity of the execution process. Other applications of FHE include secure outsourcing of data analytics, encrypted database queries, privacy-preserving searches, efficient multi-party computation for digital signatures, and more.
  This article is designed to help the reader understand how FHE works from the mathematical level.</description>

      <title>Vertex-Based Localization of Tur\'{a}n's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a simple graph $G$, let $n$ and $m$ denote the number of vertices and edges in $G$, respectively. Tur\'{a}n's theorem states that in a simple $K_{r+1}$ free graph, $m \leq \frac{n^2(r-1)}{2r}$. In this paper, we generalize this result as follows: For each $v \in V(G)$, let $c(v)$ be the order of the largest clique that contains $v$. We show that \[ m \leq \frac{n}{2}\sum_{v\in V(G)}\frac{c(v)-1}{c(v)}\] Furthermore, we characterize the class of extremal graphs that attain equality in this bound.</description>

Abstract: Denote by $f_D(n)$ the maximum size of a set family $\mathcal{F}$ on $[n] = \{1, \dots, n\}$ with distance set $D$. That is, $|A \bigtriangleup B| \in D$ holds for every pair of distinct sets $A, B \in \mathcal{F}$. Kleitman's celebrated discrete isodiametric inequality states that $f_D(n)$ is maximized at Hamming balls of radius $d/2$ when $D = \{1, \dots, d\}$. We study the generalization where $D$ is a set of arithmetic progression and determine $f_D(n)$ asymptotically for all homogeneous $D$. In the special case when $D$ is an interval, our result confirms a conjecture of Huang, Klurman, and Pohoata. Moreover, we demonstrate a dichotomy in the growth of $f_D(n)$, showing linear growth in $n$ when $D$ is a non-homogeneous arithmetic progression. Different from previous combinatorial and spectral approaches, we deduce our results by converting the restricted distance problems to restricted intersection problems.
  Our proof ideas can be adapted to prove upper bounds on $t$-distance sets in Hamming cubes (also known as binary $t$-codes), which has been extensively studied by algebraic combinatorialists community, improving previous bounds from polynomial methods and optimization approaches.</description>
