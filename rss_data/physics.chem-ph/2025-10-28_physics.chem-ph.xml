      <title>Tuning laser-induced optical breakdown and cavitation through the ionic environment in aqueous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser-induced cavitation in liquids originates from optical breakdown processes that depend sensitively on both laser-plasma dynamics and the chemical microenvironment of the solvent. Herein, we experimentally decouple the effects of ionic strength and ion specificity on cavitation inception in aqueous electrolytes spanning neutral, acidic, and alkaline regimes. Using focused nanosecond laser pulses, we show that increasing ionic strength universally lowers the cavitation threshold by enhancing charge screening and seed-electron availability. However, under constant ionic strength, strongly asymmetric behavior emerges: acidic (hydrogen chloride, HCl) solutions inhibit cavitation, whereas alkaline (sodium hydroxide, NaOH) solutions enhance it. This asymmetry arises from hydrated-electron kinetics that depends on the ion specificity. In acidic solutions, hydronium ions act as diffusion-limited scavengers of hydrated electrons, quenching their lifetime and inhibiting avalanche ionization. In contrast, hydroxide ions reduce hydronium availability and extend electron survival, promoting more efficient plasma formation. Despite large discrepancies in breakdown thresholds, electrical conductivity remains nearly constant, demonstrating that microscopic electron chemistry, rather than bulk charge transport, governs cavitation onset. These results establish a mechanism connection between electrolyte chemistry and optical breakdown, showing that ion-specific reaction dynamics fundamentally control laser-induced cavitation in aqueous environments.</description>

      <title>Tracking Microhydration of the NaCl Rocksalt Molecule in Helium Nanodroplets by Penning Ionization Electron Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The microhydration of rock salt (NaCl) molecules was investigated using high-resolution Penning ionization electron spectroscopy (PIES) in helium nanodroplets. Although model calculations predict that NaCl molecules are fully submerged inside the droplets, PIES of NaCl are highly resolved, in stark contrast to other molecular species. Co-doping the droplets with a controlled number of $n=5$--10 water molecules leads to efficient quenching of the NaCl Penning ionization signal and to its full suppression for $n\gtrsim 30$. Accompanying density-functional theory (DFT) and force field calculations reveal a transition from contact ion pair structures to solvent-separated ion pairs at $n=12$--15. However, it takes $n\approx 17$ water molecules to form a complete solvation shell around the Cl$^-$ anion and as many as $n\approx 34$ to fully hydrate the Na$^+$ cation, thus the entire NaCl molecule, which rationalizes the experimental findings.</description>

      <title>Unraveling vibronic interactions in molecules functionalized with optical cycling centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report detailed characterization of the vibronic interactions between the first two electronically excited states, A and B, in SrOPh (Ph = phenyl, -C6H5) and its deuterated counterpart, SrOPh-d5 (-C6D5). The vibronic interactions, which arise due to non-adiabatic coupling between the two electronic states, mix the B,v0 state with the energetically close vibronic level A,v21v33, resulting in extra transition probability into the latter state. This state mixing is more prominent in the deuterated molecule because of the smaller energy gap between the interacting states. We model the mixing of the A and B states using the Koppel-Domcke-Cederbaum (KDC) Hamiltonian parametrized in the diabatic framework of Ichino, Gauss, and Stanton on the basis of equation-of-motion coupled-cluster calculations. The simulation attributes the observed mixing to a second-order effect mediated by linear quasi-diabatic couplings between the A-C and B-C states. Based on the measured spectra, we deduce an effective coupling strength of 0.5 cm-1. Non-adiabatic couplings between different electronic states is an important factor that should be considered in the design of laser-cooling protocols for complex molecules.</description>

      <title>Computing Solvation Shell Dynamics and Energetics in Electron Transfer Reactions via Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Marcus theory is fundamental to describing electron transfer reactions and quantifying their rates, effectively representing the energy surface associated with an electron transfer from the reactant to the product ionic state via parabolas within a reaction coordinate diagram. Here, we present an intuitive and computationally efficient generalised reaction coordinate amenable to molecular dynamics simulations. By utilising the nuclear charge of the ion, we are able to quantify in a targeted approach changes in the ion's solvation shell, thereby efficiently obtaining the free energy profile associated with the electron transfer, the transition state geometry and the evolution of the water network.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: QC Lab is an open-source Python package for QC dynamics simulations aimed to promote the development of QC algorithms, and their application to a wide variety of relevant model problems. It follows a modular design that facilitates cross-compatibility between algorithms and models. By decomposing algorithms and models into a series of tasks and ingredients that can be substituted and reused, it minimizes development efforts and code redundancy. In this Paper, we introduce the first stable release of QC Lab, and describe its design philosophy.</description>

      <title>Over four minutes relaxation of pyruvate using chemically and physically induced deceleration of relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: [1-13C]pyruvate is the most widely used tracer for hyperpolarized metabolic magnetic resonance imaging, with profound applications in tumor and inflammation diagnosis as well as treatment monitoring. The most fundamental hurdle to broader application, however, remains the rapid polarization relaxation and the associated signal loss. Here, we report a method to address this challenge. Studying the nuclear spin relaxation dispersion of [1-13C]pyruvate across magnetic fields from 8 {\mu}T to 9.4 T, as a function of additives, solvents, and preparation methods, allowed us to achieve relaxation times of up to four minutes. Such a long time could enable reliable quality control and nearly polarization loss-free transport, further boosting the power of hyperpolarized metabolic MRI.</description>

      <title>Analytic $G_0W_0$ gradients based on a double-similarity transformation equation-of-motion coupled-cluster treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate prediction of ionization potentials (IPs) is central to understanding molecular reactivity, redox behavior, and spectroscopic properties. While vertical IPs can be accessed directly from electronic excitations at fixed nuclear geometries, the computation of adiabatic IPs requires nuclear gradients of the ionized states, posing a major theoretical and computational challenge, especially within correlated frameworks. Among the most promising approaches for IP calculations is the many-body Green's function $GW$ method, which provides a balanced compromise between accuracy and computational efficiency. Furthermore, it is applicable to both finite and extended systems. Recent work has established formal connections between $GW$ and coupled-cluster doubles (CCD) theory, leading to the first derivation of analytic $GW$ nuclear gradients via a unitary CCD framework. In this work, we present an alternative, fully analytic formulation of $GW$ nuclear gradients based on a modified version of the traditional equation-of-motion CCD formalism, enabling the inclusion of missing correlation effects in the traditional CCD methods.</description>

      <title>Prospects towards Paired Electrolysis at Industrial Currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Paired electrolysis at industrial current densities offers an energy-efficient and sustainable alternative to thermocatalytic chemical synthesis by leveraging anodic and cathodic valorization. However, its industrial feasibility remains constrained by system integration, including reactor assembly, asymmetric electron transfer kinetics, membrane selection, mass transport limitations, and techno-economic bottlenecks. Addressing these challenges requires an engineering-driven approach that integrates reactor architecture, electrode-electrolyte interactions, reaction pairing, and process optimization. Here, we discuss scale-specific electrochemical reactor assembly strategies, transitioning from half-cell research to full-scale stack validation. We develop reaction pairing frameworks that align electrocatalyst design with electrochemical kinetics, enhancing efficiency and selectivity under industrial operating conditions. We also establish application-dependent key performance indicators (KPIs) and benchmark propylene oxidation coupled with hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) or oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) against existing industrial routes to evaluate process viability. Finally, we propose hybrid integration models that embed paired electrolysis into existing industrial workflows, overcoming adoption barriers.</description>

      <title>Highly Tunable Phonon Polaritons via Metal Intercalation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phonon polaritons in van der Waals crystals offer mid-infrared light confinement deep below the diffraction limit, making them promising for nanophotonics applications. However, the practical use of phonon polaritons remains limited, in part due to the lack of precise control over the phonon polariton dispersion, as crystal lattice vibrations are often inert to external stimuli. Here, we address this challenge by zerovalent metal intercalation of $\alpha$-MoO$_3$. Photo-induced force microscopy shows that introducing tin into the van der Waals gap modulates the phonon polariton dispersion by up to $38.5\pm0.5\%$, which is the highest amount of tunability among non-mechanical modulation approaches, to the best of our knowledge. Intercalation with various metal species preserves the phonon polariton lifetimes, while modulating the dielectric permittivity in agreement with the density functional theory and analytical calculations. Our results establish metal intercalation as a practical route to reconfigurable mid-infrared nanophotonics.</description>

      <title>Mastering energy landscapes via liquid liquid phase separation to program active supramolecular coassembly from the nano to macro scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The energy landscape dictates pathways and outcomes in supramolecular selfassembly, yet harnessing it from the nano to the macro scales remains a major challenge. Here, we demonstrate liquid liquid phase separation (LLPS) as a powerful tool to navigate and engineer the energy landscapes of coassembly systems comprising disordered proteins and peptides. We quantitatively map the energy barriers and transition states governing structural transitions, enabling predictive on off control of assembly and hierarchical order from nano to macro scales. By integrating supramolecular biofabrication, we achieve spatially organized architectures with life like non equilibrium behaviour. Crucially, assembly stability and scalable selfsorting are shown to depend on accessing minimum energy states, regardless of whether the co assembled structures are disordered or ordered. This work establishes energy landscape mediation via LLPS as a general framework for designing lifelike, hierarchically structured materials.</description>

      <title>Topological Control of Transition Metal Networks for Reversible High-Capacity Li-rich Cathodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing high-energy-density batteries is essential for advancing sustainable energy technologies. However, leading cathode materials such as Li-rich oxides, including Li$_2$MnO$_3$, suffer from capacity loss due to irreversible oxygen release and structural degradation, both consequences of the oxygen redox activity that also enables their high capacity. The atomic-scale mechanisms behind this degradation, and whether it can be made reversible, remain open questions. Here, using submicrosecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations with first-principles accuracy, we directly visualize the entire charge-discharge cycle of Li$_2$MnO$_3$, uncovering the full lifecycle of the O$_2$-filled nanovoids responsible for degradation and identifying the critical size limit for voids to remain fully repairable upon discharge. Our results reveal that the topology of the Mn cation network is the key factor governing void growth, coalescence, and reparability. Based on a structural topology-informed design principle, we computationally develop a novel Li$_2$MnO$_3$ structure featuring a Mn lattice with a Kagome-like pattern, demonstrating full electrochemical reversibility even under extreme 80% delithiation. Our work establishes a new paradigm for designing high-energy cathodes, shifting the focus from mitigating damage to engineering inherent stability through atomic-level topological control of transition metal network.</description>

      <title>Robust and tuneable ion selectivity in vermiculite membranes intercalated with unexchangeable ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Membranes selective to ions of the same charge are increasingly sought for wastewater processing and valuable element recovery. However, while narrow channels are known to be essential, other membrane parameters remain difficult to identify and control. Here we show that Zr$^{4+}$, Sn$^{4+}$, Ir$^{4+}$, and La$^{3+}$ ions intercalated into vermiculite laminate membranes become effectively unexchangeable, creating stable channels, one to two water layers wide, that exhibit robust and tuneable ion selectivity. Ion permeability in these membranes spans five orders of magnitude, following a trend dictated by the ions' Gibbs free energy of hydration. Unexpectedly, different intercalated ions lead to two distinct monovalent ion selectivity sequences, despite producing channels of identical width. The selectivity instead correlates with the membranes' stiffness and the entropy of hydration of the intercalated ions. These results introduce a new ion selectivity mechanism driven by entropic and mechanical effects, beyond classical size and charge exclusion.</description>

      <title>Size-consistent implementation of Hamiltonian simulation-based quantum-selected configuration interaction method for the supramolecular approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum-selected configuration interaction (QSCI) method is a promising approach for large-scale quantum chemical calculations on currently available quantum hardware. However, its naive implementation lacks size consistency, which is essential for accurate intermolecular interaction energy calculations using the supramolecular approach. Here, we present a size-consistent implementation of QSCI by sampling Slater determinants for the dimer in the localized molecular orbital basis, constructing the subspaces for the monomers and dimer, and augmenting the dimer subspace with additional determinants required for size consistency. Implemented within the Hamiltonian simulation-based QSCI (HSB-QSCI) framework, our method numerically satisfies size consistency for 4H/8H clusters, the FH dimer, and the FH--H$_2$O system. Application to intermolecular interaction energy calculations of hydrogen-bonded FH dimer and FH--H$_2$O demonstrates that our approach reproduces complete active space-configuration interaction (CAS-CI) values with errors below 0.04 kcal mol$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Automated Exploration of Radical-Molecule Chemistry: The Case of Oxirane + CH in the ISM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum chemistry provides accurate and reliable methods to investigate reaction pathways of reactive molecular systems relevant to the interstellar medium. However, the exhaustive exploration of a reactive network is often a daunting task, resulting in unexplored reactive channels that affect kinetic outcomes and branching ratios. Here, an automated workflow for exploring reactive potential energy surfaces (PESs) is employed for the first time to study the oxirane (C$_2$H$_4$O) plus methylidyne ($^.$CH) reaction. The ultimate goal is to comprehensively map its PES and, subsequently, derive rate constants for the most important reaction channels. In addition to its astrochemical relevance, this reaction has been considered because it is a challenging test case, its network being very extended, with 60 exothermic bimolecular products lying below the reactant's energy. Kinetic simulations indicate that the main product of the reaction is the HCO radical plus ethene (C$_2$H$_4$), while formation of s-trans-propenal (acrolein) and 2H-oxene is also possible, but to a lesser extent. Based on the present study and other references in the literature, we suggest that the slightly higher relative abundance of s-trans-propenal compared to methyl ketene in the interstellar medium is a gas-phase kinetic effect, s-trans-propenal being a more easily accessible product on the C$_3$H$_5$O$^.$ PES.</description>

      <title>Ground and excited potential energy surfaces for CaF+Ca interactions and isotope exchange reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the intermolecular interactions between laser-cooled CaF and Ca, in their ground and excited electronic states, aiming to understand atom-exchange reaction pathways. Using state-of-the-art \textit{ab initio} quantum chemistry methods, we compute potential energy surfaces for nine electronic states arising from the lowest three asymptotes of Ca$_2$F trimer, within the rigid rotor approximation applied to CaF. Two-dimensional potential energy surfaces are computed for the ground state and one of the excited states. We use a combination of the coupled cluster method restricted to single, double, and perturbative triple excitations, and the multireference configuration interaction method with single and double excitations. The ground (X)~$^2\mathrm{A}'$ electronic state of the trimer is significantly deep and highly anisotropic. The excited electronic states are also strongly bound. Notably, the potential energy surface of one of the excited states, (2)~$^2\mathrm{A}'$, lies below the ground-state asymptote of the trimer. By analyzing the potential energy surfaces, we discuss atom-exchange reaction pathways involving both the ground-state interaction between CaF and Ca and the excited metastable state of Ca.</description>

      <title>General integrated rate law for complex self-assembly reactions reveals the mechanism of amyloid-beta co-aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15932v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analyzing kinetic experiments on protein aggregation using integrated rate laws has led to numerous advances in our understanding of the fundamental chemical mechanisms behind amyloidogenic disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. However, the description of biologically relevant processes may require rate equations that are too complex to solve using existing methods, hindering mechanistic insights into these processes. An example of significance is co-aggregation in environments containing multiple amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide alloforms, which may play a crucial role in the biochemistry of Alzheimer's disease but whose mechanism is still poorly understood. Here, we use the mathematics of symmetry to derive a general integrated rate law valid for most plausible linear self-assembly reactions. We use it in conjunction with experimental data to determine the mechanism of co-aggregation of the most physiologically abundant Abeta alloforms: Abeta42, Abeta40, Abeta38 and Abeta37 peptides. We find that Abeta42 fibril surfaces catalyze the formation of co-oligomers, which accelerate new Abeta40, Abeta38 and Abeta37 fibril formation whilst inhibiting secondary nucleation of new Abeta42 fibrils. The simplicity, accuracy and broad applicability of our general integrated rate law will enable kinetic analysis of more complex filamentous self-assembly reactions, both with and without co-aggregation.</description>

      <title>Transferability and interpretability of vibrational normalizing-flow coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15750v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The choice of vibrational coordinates is crucial for the accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability of molecular vibrational dynamics and spectra calculations. We explore the recently proposed normalizing-flow vibrational coordinates, which are learned molecule-specific coordinate transformations optimized for a given basis set. Much like how spherical coordinates naturally simplify the hydrogen atom by embedding physical insight into the coordinate system, normalizing-flow coordinates offload complexity from the basis functions into the coordinate transformation itself. This shift not only improves basis-set convergence, but also enhances interpretability of vibrational motions. We provide an analysis of the utility, interpretation and associated constraints of normalizing-flow vibrational coordinates. Moreover, we demonstrate that these coordinates can be generalized across different isotopologues, and even structurally related molecules, achieved with minimal fine-tuning of selected output parameters.</description>

      <title>Application of Correlated-Wavefunction and Density-Functional Theories to Endofullerenes: A Cautionary Tale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent study by Panchagnula et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 161, 054308 (2024)] illustrated the non-concordance of a variety of electronic structure methods at describing the symmetric double-well potential expected along the anisotropic direction of the endofullerene Ne@C$_{70}$. In this article we present new correlated-wavefunction data from coupled cluster theory for this system, and scrutinise a variety of state-of-the-art density-functional approximations (DFAs) and dispersion corrections (DCs). We identify rigorous criteria for the double-well potential and compare the shapes, barrier heights, and minima positions obtained with the DFAs and DCs to the correlated wavefunction data. We show that many of the DFAs are extremely sensitive to the numerical integration grid used, the dispersion damping function, and the extent of exact-exchange mixing. We pose the Ne@C$_{70}$ system as a challenge to functional developers and as a diagnostic system for testing dispersion corrections, and reiterate the need for more experimental data for comparison.</description>

      <title>Energy-Based Coarse-Graining in Molecular Dynamics: A Flow-Based Framework without Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coarse-grained (CG) models provide an effective route to reducing the complexity of molecular simulations (MD), but conventional approaches depend heavily on long all-atom MD trajectories to adequately sample configurational space. This data dependence limits accuracy and generalizability, as unvisited configurations remain excluded from the resulting CG models. We introduce a fully data-free, generative framework for CG that directly targets the all-atom Boltzmann distribution. The model defines a structured latent space comprising slow collective variables, associated with multimodal marginal densities capturing metastable states, and fast variables, represented through simple, unimodal conditional distributions. A learnable, bijective map from latent space to atomistic coordinates enables the automatic and accurate reconstruction of molecular structures. Training relies solely on the interatomic potential and minimizes the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence via an energy-based objective. To stabilize optimization and ensure mode coverage, we employ an adaptive tempering scheme that promotes the exploration of diverse configurations. Once trained, the model can generate independent, one-shot equilibrium samples at full atomic resolution. Validation on two synthetic systems, a double-well potential and a Gaussian mixture model, as well as on the benchmark alanine dipeptide, demonstrates that the method captures all relevant modes of the Boltzmann distribution, reconstructs atomic configurations, and automatically learns physically meaningful CG representations. These results suggest a promising, data-free alternative to traditional CG techniques, offering both a principled approach to addressing the long-standing "chicken-and-egg" challenge in coarse-graining and an effective solution to the back-mapping problem by enabling accurate reconstruction of all-atom configurations.</description>

      <title>FlashMD: long-stride, universal prediction of molecular dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) provides insights into atomic-scale processes by integrating over time the equations that describe the motion of atoms under the action of interatomic forces. Machine learning models have substantially accelerated MD by providing inexpensive predictions of the forces, but they remain constrained to minuscule time integration steps, which are required by the fast time scale of atomic motion. In this work, we propose FlashMD, a method to predict the evolution of positions and momenta over strides that are between one and two orders of magnitude longer than typical MD time steps. We incorporate considerations on the mathematical and physical properties of Hamiltonian dynamics in the architecture, generalize the approach to allow the simulation of any thermodynamic ensemble, and carefully assess the possible failure modes of such a long-stride MD approach. We validate FlashMD's accuracy in reproducing equilibrium and time-dependent properties, using both system-specific and general-purpose models, extending the ability of MD simulation to reach the long time scales needed to model microscopic processes of high scientific and technological relevance.</description>

      <title>Numerically Exact Configuration Interaction at Quadrillion-Determinant Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20375v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The combinatorial scaling of configuration interaction (CI) has long restricted its applicability to only the simplest molecular systems. Here, we report the first numerically exact CI calculation exceeding one quadrillion ($10^{15}$) determinants, enabled by categorical compression within the small-tensor-product distributed active space (STP-DAS) framework. As a demonstration, we converged the relativistic complete active space CI (CASCI) ground state of HBrTe involving over $10^{15}$ complex-valued 2-spinor determinants in under 34.5 hours (time-to-completion) using 1000 nodes, representing the largest CASCI calculation reported to date. Additionally, we achieved $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$-build times of just 5 minutes for systems with approximately 150 billion complex-valued 2-spinor determinants using only a few compute nodes. Extensive benchmarks confirm that the method retains numerical exactness with drastically reduced resource demands. Compared to previous state-of-the-art CI calculations, this work represents a 3-orders-of-magnitude increase in CI space, a 6-orders-of-magnitude increase in FLOP count, and a 6-orders-of-magnitude improvement in computational speed. By introducing a numerically exact, categorically compressed representation of the CI expansion vectors and reformulating the $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$-build accordingly, we eliminate memory bottlenecks associated with storing excitation lists and CI vectors while significantly reducing computational cost. A compression-compatible preconditioner further enhances performance by generating compressed CI expansion vectors throughout Davidson iterations. This work establishes a new computational frontier for numerically exact CI methods, enabling chemically and physically accurate simulations of strongly correlated, spin-orbit coupled systems previously thought to be beyond reach.</description>

      <title>Simulating the interplay of dipolar and quadrupolar interactions in NMR by spin dynamic mean-field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The simulation of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments is a notoriously difficult task, if many spins participate in the dynamics. The recently established dynamic mean-field theory for high-temperature spin systems (spinDMFT) represents an efficient yet accurate method to deal with this scenario. SpinDMFT reduces a complex lattice system to a time-dependent single-site problem, which can be solved numerically with small computational effort. Since the approach retains local quantum degrees of freedom, a quadrupolar term can be exactly incorporated. This allows us to study the interplay of dipolar and quadrupolar interactions for any parameter range, i.e., without the need for a perturbative treatment. We highlight the relevance of local quantum effects by a comparison with the classical analogue system.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed machine learning for combustion: A review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03347v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) represents an emerging paradigm that integrates various forms of physical knowledge into machine learning (ML) components, thereby enhancing the physical consistency of ML models compared to purely data-driven paradigms. The field of combustion, characterized by a rich foundation of physical laws and abundant data, is undergoing a transformation due to PIML. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of PIML for combustion, systematically outlining fundamental principles, significant contributions, key advancements, and available resources. The application of PIML in combustion is categorized into three domains: combustion chemical kinetics, combustion reacting flows, and other combustion-related scenarios. Additionally, current challenges, potential solutions, and practical guidelines for researchers and engineers will be discussed. A primary focus of this review is to demonstrate how combustion laws can be integrated into ML, either through soft or hard constraints, via loss functions or representation models, and within coordinate-to-variable or field-to-field paradigms. This paper shows that PIML offers a unified framework linking physics, model, and data in combustion--integrating physical knowledge in model-to-data simulation and reconstruction tasks, as well as data-to-model modeling tasks--resulting in enhanced data, improved physical models, and more reliable ML models. PIML for combustion presents significant opportunities for both the combustion and ML communities, encouraging greater collaboration and cross-disciplinary engagement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models have dual-use potential, potentially serving both beneficial and malicious purposes. The development of open-source models in chemistry has specifically surfaced dual-use concerns around toxicological data and chemical warfare agents. We discuss a chain risk framework identifying three misuse pathways and corresponding mitigation strategies: inference-level, model-level, and data-level. At the data level, we introduce a model-agnostic noising method to increase prediction error in specific desired regions (sensitive regions). Our results show that selective noise induces variance and attenuation bias, whereas simply omitting sensitive data fails to prevent extrapolation. These findings hold for both molecular feature multilayer perceptrons and graph neural networks. Thus, noising molecular structures can enable open sharing of potential dual-use molecular data.</description>
