      <title>Multifunctional physical reservoir computing in soft tensegrity robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that the dynamics of physical systems can be utilized for the desired information processing under the framework of physical reservoir computing (PRC). Robots with soft bodies are examples of such physical systems, and their nonlinear body-environment dynamics can be used to compute and generate the motor signals necessary for the control of their own behavior. In this simulation study, we extend this approach to control and embed not only one but also multiple behaviors into a type of soft robot called a tensegrity robot. The resulting system, consisting of the robot and the environment, is a multistable dynamical system that converges to different attractors from varying initial conditions. Furthermore, attractor analysis reveals that there exist "untrained attractors" in the state space of the system outside the training data. These untrained attractors reflect the intrinsic properties and structures of the tensegrity robot and its interactions with the environment. The impacts of these recent findings in PRC remain unexplored in embodied AI research. We here illustrate their potential to understand various features of embodied cognition that have not been fully addressed to date.</description>

      <title>The invariant rate of energy extraction by polymers in turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polymeric turbulence, flows of fluids with dilute polymer additives at high Reynolds numbers, exhibits striking deviations from the Kolmogorovean behaviour of Newtonian turbulence. Recent experiments as well as simulations have uncovered a robust self-similar energy spectrum scaling as $k^{-2.3}$, in sharp contrast to the $k^{-5/3}$ scaling of Newtonian flows. The origin of this novel scaling, however, has remained unresolved. In this work, we uncover the underlying physical mechanism responsible for this emergent behaviour. Using fundamental governing equations aided by scaling arguments, we show that the fluid energy cascade is depleted by the polymers at a constant rate across a wide range of scales. This constant depletion rate acts as a second invariant, alongside the total energy flux, thereby setting the scaling properties of the spectrum. Our results reveal that polymeric turbulence is governed by two simultaneous invariants, unlike the single-invariant structure of Newtonian turbulence, and suggest new strategies for turbulence control through suitably engineered and targeted polymer design.</description>

      <title>Inverse problems for dynamic patterns in coupled oscillator networks: When larger networks are simpler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Networks of coupled phase oscillators are one of the most studied dynamical systems with numerous applications in physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering. Their typical behaviour looks like a partially synchronized dynamic pattern, where some oscillators behave almost identically, while others behave differently relative to each other. In the case of large networks, the properties of these patterns can often be analysed using a kind of mean-field approach (called thermodynamic limit or continuum limit), where the state of the system is represented by a single-particle probability density function and its evolution is described by a standard continuity equation. Such an analytical approach allows to predict what type of network dynamics can be observed for different system parameters. But it is less known that for different partially synchronized patterns it also allows to obtain statistical equilibrium relations that express the dependence of some time-averaged observable quantities of individual oscillators on the internal parameters of these oscillators and the interaction functions between them. In this paper, we show how such relations can be derived, what their typical accuracy is for finite-size networks, and how they can be used to reconstruct the parameters of the corresponding model. The proposed method is particularly effective for large networks, for unevenly sampled or noisy observables, and for partial observations. Its possibilities are demonstrated by application to chimera states in networks of phase oscillator with nonlocal coupling.</description>

      <title>Integrability and Quantum Chaos in the Spectrum of Bell Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a permutationally invariant multipartite Bell inequality for many-body three-level systems and use it to investigate a connection between Bell nonlocality and (lack of) quantum chaos. Interpreting the Bell operator, defined by fixing measurement settings, as an effective Hamiltonian, we analyze its spectral statistics across different SU(3) irreducible representations and measurement choices. Surprisingly, we find that, in every irreducible representation exhibiting nonlocality, the measurement settings yielding maximal violation result in a Bell operator with Poissonian level statistics, thus signaling integrable behavior. This integrability is both unique and fragile, since generic or slightly perturbed measurements lead to the Wigner-Dyson statistics associated with chaotic behavior. Through further analysis, we are able to identify an emergent parity symmetry in the Bell operator near the point of maximal violation, providing an explanation for the observed regularity in the spectrum. These results suggest a deep interplay between optimal quantum measurements, non-local correlations, and integrability, opening new perspectives at the intersection of Bell nonlocality and quantum chaos.</description>
