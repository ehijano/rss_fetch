      <title>A Critique of Deng's "P=NP"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we critically examine Deng's "P=NP" [Den24]. The paper claims that there is a polynomial-time algorithm that decides 3-coloring for graphs with vertices of degree at most 4, which is known to be an NP-complete problem. Deng presents a semidefinite program with an objective function that is unboundedly negative if the graph is not 3-colorable, and a minimum of 0 if the graph is 3-colorable. Through detailed analysis, we find that Deng conflates subgraphs with induced subgraphs, leading to a critical error which thereby invalidates Deng's proof that $\text{P}=\text{NP}$.</description>

      <title>IPS Lower Bounds for Formulas and Sum of ROABPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give new lower bounds for the fragments of the Ideal Proof System (IPS) introduced by Grochow and Pitassi (JACM 2018). The Ideal Proof System is a central topic in algebraic proof complexity developed in the context of Nullstellensatz refutation (Beame, Impagliazzo, Krajicek, Pitassi, Pudlak, FOCS 1994) and simulates Extended Frege efficiently. Our main results are as follows.
  1. mult-IPS_{Lin'}: We prove nearly quadratic-size formula lower bound for multilinear refutation (over the Boolean hypercube) of a variant of the subset-sum axiom polynomial. Extending this, we obtain a nearly matching qualitative statement for a constant degree target polynomial.
  2. IPS_{Lin'}: Over the fields of characteristic zero, we prove exponential-size sum-of-ROABPs lower bound for the refutation of a variant of the subset-sum axiom polynomial. The result also extends over the fields of positive characteristics when the target polynomial is suitably modified. The modification is inspired by the recent results (Hakoniemi, Limaye, Tzameret, STOC 2024 and Behera, Limaye, Ramanathan, Srinivasan, ICALP 2025).
  The mult-IPS_{Lin'} lower bound result is obtained by combining the quadratic-size formula lower bound technique of Kalorkoti (SICOMP 1985) with some additional ideas. The proof technique of IPS_{Lin'} lower bound result is inspired by the recent lower bound result of Chatterjee, Kush, Saraf and Shpilka (CCC 2024).</description>

      <title>Directed disjoint paths remains W[1]-hard on acyclic digraphs without large grid minors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Vertex Disjoint Paths with Congestion problem, the input consists of a digraph $D$, an integer $c$ and $k$ pairs of vertices $(s_i, t_i)$, and the task is to find a set of paths connecting each $s_i$ to its corresponding $t_i$, whereas each vertex of $D$ appears in at most $c$ many paths. The case where $c = 1$ is known to be NP-complete even if $k = 2$ [Fortune, Hopcroft and Wyllie, 1980] on general digraphs and is W[1]-hard with respect to $k$ (excluding the possibility of an $f(k)n^{O(1)}$-time algorithm under standard assumptions) on acyclic digraphs [Slivkins, 2010]. The proof of [Slivkins, 2010] can also be adapted to show W[1]-hardness with respect to $k$ for every congestion $c \geq 1$.
  We strengthen the existing hardness result by showing that the problem remains W[1]-hard for every congestion $c \geq 1$ even if:
  - the input digraph $D$ is acyclic,
  - $D$ does not contain an acyclic $(5, 5)$-grid as a butterfly minor,
  - $D$ does not contain an acyclic tournament on 9 vertices as a butterfly minor, and
  - $D$ has ear-anonymity at most 5.
  Further, we also show that the edge-congestion variant of the problem remains W[1]-hard for every congestion $c \geq 1$ even if:
  - the input digraph $D$ is acyclic,
  - $D$ has maximum undirected degree 3,
  - $D$ does not contain an acyclic $(7, 7)$-wall as a weak immersion and
  - $D$ has ear-anonymity at most 5.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper where he first defined Communication Complexity, Yao asks: \emph{Is computing $CC(f)$ (the 2-way communication complexity of a given function $f$) NP-complete?} The problem of deciding whether $CC(f) \le k$, when given the communication matrix for $f$ and a number $k$, is easily seen to be in NP. Kushilevitz and Weinreb have shown that this problem is cryptographically hard. Here we show it is NP-hard.</description>

      <title>Immutability Does Not Guarantee Trust: A Formal and Logical Refutation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is frequently claimed in blockchain discourse that immutability guarantees trust. This paper rigorously refutes that assertion. We define immutability as the cryptographic persistence of historical states in an append-only data structure and contrast it with trust, understood as a rational epistemic expectation under uncertainty. Employing predicate logic, automata-theoretic models, and epistemic game-theoretic analysis, we demonstrate that immutability neither entails nor implies correctness, fairness, or credibility. Through formal constructions and counterexamples--including predictive fraud schemes and the phenomenon of garbage permanence--we show that the belief conflates structural and epistemic domains. Immutability preserves all data equally, regardless of veracity. Therefore, the assertion that immutability guarantees trust collapses under the weight of formal scrutiny.</description>

      <title>m-Eternal Domination and Variants on Some Classes of Finite and Infinite Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the m-Eternal Domination problem, which is the following two-player game between a defender and an attacker on a graph: initially, the defender positions k guards on vertices of the graph; the game then proceeds in turns between the defender and the attacker, with the attacker selecting a vertex and the defender responding to the attack by moving a guard to the attacked vertex. The defender may move more than one guard on their turn, but guards can only move to neighboring vertices. The defender wins a game on a graph G with k guards if the defender has a strategy such that at every point of the game the vertices occupied by guards form a dominating set of G and the attacker wins otherwise. The m-eternal domination number of a graph G is the smallest value of k for which (G,k) is a defender win.
  We show that m-Eternal Domination is NP-hard, as well as some of its variants, even on special classes of graphs. We also show structural results for the Domination and m-Eternal Domination problems in the context of four types of infinite regular grids: square, octagonal, hexagonal, and triangular, establishing tight bounds.</description>

      <title>The Network Satisfaction Problem for Relation Algebras with at most 4 Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Andr\'eka and Maddux classified the relation algebras with at most 3 atoms, and in particular they showed that all of them are representable. Hirsch and Cristiani showed that the network satisfaction problem (NSP) for each of these algebras is in P or NP-hard. There are relation algebras with 4 atoms that are not representable, and there are many results in the literature about representations and non-representability of relation algebras with at most 4 atoms. We extend the result of Hirsch and Cristiani to relation algebras with at most 4 atoms: the NSP is always either in P or NP-hard. To this end, we construct universal, fully universal, or even normal representations for these algebras, whenever possible.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Network Design with Restricted Link Usage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a digraph with two terminal vertices $s$ and $t$ as well as a conservative cost function and several not necessarily disjoint color classes on its arc set, our goal is to find a minimum-cost subset of the arcs such that its intersection with each color class contains an $s$-$t$ dipath. Problems of this type arise naturally in multi-commodity network design settings where each commodity is restricted to use links of its own color only.
  We study several variants of the problem, deriving strong hardness results even for restricted cases, but we also identify cases that can be solved in polynomial time. The latter ones include the cases where the color classes form a laminar family, or where the underlying digraph is acyclic and the number of color classes is constant. We also present an FPT algorithm for the general case parameterized by the number of multi-colored arcs.</description>

      <title>Consensus, Inconsistency, Emergence: what's paraconsistency got to do with it?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The consensus problem, briefly stated, consists of having processes in an asynchronous distributed system agree on a value. It is widely known that the consensus problem does not have a deterministic solution that ensures both termination and consistency, if there is at least one faulty process in the system. This result, known as the FLP impossibility theorem, led to several generalizations and developments in theoretical distributed computing. This paper argues that the FLP impossibility theorem holds even under a generalized definition of computation through oracles. Furthermore, using a theoretical machinery from complex systems, this paper also posits that inconsistency may be an emergent feature of consensus over distributed systems by examining how a system transitions phases. Under the same complex systems framework, this paper examines paraconsistent logics, arguing that while inconsistency is not an emergent feature for these logics, triviality may be. Lastly, some attention is given to the possibility of developing consensus algorithms capable of paraconsistent reasoning.</description>

      <title>Space-bounded online Kolmogorov complexity is additive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02777v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The even online Kolmogorov complexity of a string $x = x_1 x_2 \cdots x_{n}$ is the minimal length of a program that for all $i\le n/2$, on input $x_1x_3 \cdots x_{2i-1}$ outputs $x_{2i}$. The odd complexity is defined similarly. The sum of the odd and even complexities is called the dialogue complexity.
  In [Bauwens, 2014] it is proven that for all $n$, there exist $n$-bit $x$ for which the dialogue complexity exceeds the Kolmogorov complexity by $n\log \frac 4 3 + O(\log n)$. Let $\mathrm C^s(x)$ denote the Kolmogorov complexity with space bound~$s$. Here, we prove that the space-bounded dialogue complexity with bound $s + 6n + O(1)$ is at most $\mathrm C^{s}(x) + O(\log (sn))$, where $n=|x|$.</description>

      <title>Tarski Lower Bounds from Multi-Dimensional Herringbones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tarski's theorem states that every monotone function from a complete lattice to itself has a fixed point. We analyze the query complexity of finding such a fixed point on the $k$-dimensional grid of side length $n$ under the $\leq$ relation. In this setting, there is an unknown monotone function $f: \{0,1,\ldots, n-1\}^k \to \{0,1,\ldots, n-1\}^k$ and an algorithm must query a vertex $v$ to learn $f(v)$. The goal is to find a fixed point of $f$ using as few oracle queries as possible.
  We show that the randomized query complexity of this problem is $\Omega\left( \frac{k \cdot \log^2{n}}{\log{k}} \right)$ for all $n,k \geq 2$. This unifies and improves upon two prior results: a lower bound of $\Omega(\log^2{n})$ from [EPRY 2019] and a lower bound of $\Omega\left( \frac{k \cdot \log{n}}{\log{k}}\right)$ from [BPR 2024], respectively.</description>

      <title>Range Avoidance in Boolean Circuits via Turan-type Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a circuit $C : \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}^m$ from a circuit class $F$, with $m &gt; n$, finding a $y \in \{0,1\}^m$ such that $\forall x \in \{0,1\}^n$, $C(x) \ne y$, is the range avoidance problem (denoted by $F$-$avoid$). Deterministic polynomial time algorithms (even with access to $NP$ oracles) solving this problem is known to imply explicit constructions of various pseudorandom objects like hard Boolean functions, linear codes, PRGs etc. Deterministic polynomial time algorithms are known for $NC^0_2$-$avoid$ when $m &gt; n$, and for $NC^0_3$-$avoid$ when $m \ge \frac{n^2}{\log n}$, where $NC^0_k$ is the class of circuits with bounded fan-in which have constant depth and the output depends on at most $k$ of the input bits. On the other hand, it is also known that $NC^0_3$-$avoid$ when $m = n+O\left(n^{2/3}\right)$ is at least as hard as explicit construction of rigid matrices.
  In this paper, we propose a new approach to solving range avoidance problem via hypergraphs. We formulate the problem in terms of Turan-type problems in hypergraphs of the following kind - for a fixed $k$-uniform hypergraph $H'$, what is the maximum number of edges that can exist in a $k$-uniform hypergraph $H$ which does not have a sub-hypergraph isomorphic to $H'$? We use our approach to show (using known Turan-type bounds) that there is a constant $c$ such that $mon$-$NC^0_3$-$avoid$ can be solved in deterministic polynomial time when $m &gt; cn^2$. To improve the stretch constraint to linear, we show a new Turan-type theorem for a hypergraph structure (which we call the the loose $chi$-cycles) and use it to show that $mon$-$NC^0_3$-$avoid$ can be solved in deterministic polynomial time when $m &gt; n$, thus improving the known bounds of $NC^0_3$-avoid for the case of monotone circuits.</description>

      <title>Lower Bounds for Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Hard-Attention Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02393v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chain-of-thought reasoning and scratchpads have emerged as critical tools for enhancing the computational capabilities of transformers. While theoretical results show that polynomial-length scratchpads can extend transformers' expressivity from $TC^0$ to $PTIME$, their required length remains poorly understood. Empirical evidence even suggests that transformers need scratchpads even for many problems in $TC^0$, such as Parity or Multiplication, challenging optimistic bounds derived from circuit complexity. In this work, we initiate the study of systematic lower bounds for the number of chain-of-thought steps across different algorithmic problems, in the hard-attention regime. We study a variety of algorithmic problems, and provide bounds that are tight up to logarithmic factors. Overall, these results contribute to emerging understanding of the power and limitations of chain-of-thought reasoning.</description>

      <title>Quasipolynomial bounds for the corners theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07006v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite abelian group and $A$ be a subset of $G \times G$ which is corner--free, meaning that there are no $x, y \in G$ and $d \in G \setminus \{0\}$ such that $(x, y)$, $(x+d, y)$, $(x, y+d) \in A$. We prove that \[|A| \le |G|^2 \cdot \exp(-(\log |G|)^{\Omega(1)}).\] As a consequence, we obtain polynomial (in the input length) lower bounds on the nondeterministic communication complexity of Exactly-N in the 3-player Number-on-Forehead model. We also obtain the first "reasonable'' lower bounds on the coloring version of the $3$-dimensional corners problem, as well as on the nondeterministic communication complexity of Exactly-N in the 4-player Number-on-Forehead model.</description>
