      <title>Probing the band splitting near the {\Gamma} point in the van der Waals magnetic semiconductor CrSBr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the electronic band structure of Chromium Sulfur Bromide (CrSBr) through comprehensive photoluminescence (PL) characterization. We clearly identify low-temperature optical transitions between two closely adjacent conduction-band states and two different valence-band states. The analysis of the PL data robustly unveils energy splittings, bandgaps and excitonic transitions across different thicknesses of CrSBr, ranging from monolayer to bulk. Temperature-dependent PL measurements elucidate the stability of the band splitting below the N\'eel temperature, suggesting that magnons coupled with excitons are responsible for the symmetry breaking and brightening of the transitions from the secondary conduction band minimum (CBM2) to the global valence band maximum (VBM1). Collectively, these results not only reveal band splitting in both the conduction and valence bands, but also point to an intricate interplay between the optical, electronic and magnetic properties of antiferromagnetic two-dimensional van der Waals crystals.</description>

      <title>Simulating Holographic Conformal Field Theories on Hyperbolic Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate how table-top settings combining hyperbolic lattices with nonlinear dynamics universally lead to a genuine realization of the bulk-boundary-correspondence between gravity in anti-de-Sitter (AdS) space and conformal field theory (CFT). Our concrete and broadly applicable holographic toy model simulates gravitational self-interactions in the bulk and features an emergent CFT with nontrivial correlations on the boundary. We measure the CFT data contained in the two- and three-point functions and clarify how a thermal CFT is simulated through an effective black hole geometry. As a concrete example, we propose and simulate an experimentally feasible protocol to measure the holographic CFT using electrical circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermal resistance of a spin-polarized hydrodynamic Dirac plasma in graphene is considered. A mechanism for the coupling of heat and spin flows is discussed, demonstrating that spin diffusion and spin thermocurrent modify viscous dissipation, leading to a significant enhancement of thermal resistance. Practical calculations are then presented for graphene devices in the Corbino geometry.</description>

      <title>Electronic ferroelectricity in monolayer graphene for multifunctional neuromorphic electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectricity is intriguing for its spontaneous electric polarization, which is switchable by an external electric field. Expanding ferroelectric materials to two-dimensional limit will provide versatile applications for the development of next-generation nonvolatile devices. Conventional ferroelectricity requires the materials consisting of at least two constituent elements associated with polar crystalline structures. Monolayer graphene as an elementary two-dimensional material unlikely exhibits ferroelectric order due to its highly centrosymmetric hexagonal lattices. Nevertheless, two-dimensional moire superlattices offer a powerful way to engineer diverse electronic orders in non-polar materials. Here, we report the observations of electronic ferroelectricity in monolayer graphene by introducing asymmetric moire superlattice at the graphene/h-BN interface. Utilizing Hall measurements, the electric polarization is identified to stem from electron-hole dipoles, suggesting the electronic dynamics of the observed ferroelectricity. Standard polarization-electric field hysteresis loops, as well as unconventional multiple switchable polarization states, have been achieved. By in-situ comparing with control devices, we found that the electronic ferroelectricity in graphene moire systems is independent of layer number of graphene and the corresponding fine band structures. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applications of this ferroelectric moire structures in multi-state non-volatile data storage and the emulation of versatile synaptic behaviors, including short-term plasticity, long-term potentiation and long-term depression. This work not only enriches the fundamental understanding of ferroelectricity, but also demonstrates the promising applications of graphene in multi-state memories and neuromorphic computing.</description>

      <title>Coupled harmonics due to time-modulated point scatterers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the resonance and scattering properties of a composite medium containing scatterers whose properties are modulated in time. When excited with an incident wave of a single frequency, the scattered field consists of a family of coupled harmonics at frequencies differing by the frequency of temporal modulation. Similarly, the temporal modulation induces coupling between the resonance frequencies, leading to exceptional points at certain modulation amplitudes. Moreover, the lack of energy conservation causes scattering coefficients to blow up when (complex) resonances cross the real axis. We have developed an integral operator approach to characterize the scattering problem and, for high-contrast scatterers, we present small-volume asymptotic formulas analogous to the classical results for the static (unmodulated) case. We conclude the paper with a boundary integral formulation of the time-modulated problem, which gives an efficient numerical approach and corroborates the asymptotic formulas.</description>

      <title>Electronic transport, metal-insulator transition, and Wigner crystallization in transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two recent electronic transport experiments from Columbia University and Harvard University have reported record high mobility and low channel densities in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) WSe$_2$ monolayers [J. Pack, et al., arXiv:2310.19782; A. Y. Joe, et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 056303 (2024)]. A two-dimensional (2D) metal-insulator transition (MIT) is demonstrated in the Columbia sample at low densities, a regime where the formation of a Wigner crystal (WC) is theoretically anticipated in the absence of disorder. We employ the finite-temperature Boltzmann theory to understand the low-temperature transport properties of monolayer TMDs, taking into account realistic disorder scattering. We analyze the experimental results, focusing on the 2D MIT behavior and the influence of temperature and density on mobility and resistivity in the metallic phase. We provide a discussion of the nontrivial carrier density dependence of our transport results. Our analysis elucidates the linear-in-$T$ resistivity in the metallic phase, attributing it to Friedel oscillations associated with screened charged impurities. Furthermore, we explore whether Coulomb disorder could lead to the MIT through either a quantum Anderson localization transition or a classical percolation transition. Our theoretical estimates of the disorder-induced MIT critical densities, although smaller, are within a factor of ~2 of the experimental critical density. We examine the exceptionally high melting temperature ~10 K of WCs observed experimentally in the MoSe$_2$ systems at low density, an order of magnitude larger than the pristine melting temperature. This suggests that the observed 2D low-density MIT behavior is likely a result of the complex interplay between disorder effects and interaction-driven WC physics, offering a comprehensive understanding of the low-temperature transport phenomena in TMD monolayers.</description>

      <title>On-demand higher-harmonic generation through nonlinear Hall effects in curved nanomembranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high-order Hall effects, which go beyond the ordinary, unlock more possibilities of electronic transport properties and functionalities. Pioneer works focus on the manufacture of complex nanostructures with low lattice symmetry to produce them. In this paper, we theoretically show that such high-order Hall effects can alternatively be generated by curving a conducting nanomembrane which is highly tunable and also enables anisotropy. Its Hall response can be tuned from first to fourth order by simply varying the direction and magnitude of the applied magnetic field. The dominant Hall current frequency can also be altered from zero to double, or even four times that of the applied alternating electric field. This phenomenon is critically dependent on the occurrence of high-order snake orbits associated with the effective magnetic-field dipoles and quadruples induced by the curved geometry. Our results offer pathways for spatially engineering magnetotransport, current rectification, and frequency multiplication in the bent conducting nanomembrane.</description>

      <title>Chirality-Driven Orbital Angular Momentum and Circular Dichroism in CoSi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral crystals and molecules were recently predicted to form an intriguing platform for unconventional orbital physics. Here, we report the observation of chirality-driven orbital textures in the bulk electronic structure of CoSi, a prototype member of the cubic B20 family of chiral crystals. Using circular dichroism in soft X-ray angle-resolved photoemission, we demonstrate the formation of a bulk orbital-angular-momentum texture and monopole-like orbital-momentum locking that depends on crystal handedness. We introduce the intrinsic chiral circular dichroism, icCD, as a differential photoemission observable and a natural probe of chiral electron states. Our findings render chiral crystals promising for spin-orbitronics applications.</description>

      <title>Dephasing in Fluxonium Qubits from Coherent Quantum Phase Slips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase slips occur across all Josephson junctions (JJs) at a rate that increases with the impedance of the junction. In superconducting qubits composed of JJ-array superinductors -- such as fluxonium -- phase slips in the array can lead to decoherence. In particular, phase-slip processes at the individual array junctions can coherently interfere, each with an Aharonov--Casher phase that depends on the offset charges of the array islands. These coherent quantum phase slips (CQPS) perturbatively modify the qubit frequency, and therefore charge noise on the array islands will lead to dephasing. By varying the impedance of the array junctions, we design a set of fluxonium qubits in which the expected phase-slip rate within the JJ-array changes by several orders of magnitude. We characterize the coherence times of these qubits and demonstrate that the scaling of CQPS-induced dephasing rates agrees with our theoretical model. Furthermore, we perform noise spectroscopy of two qubits in regimes dominated by either CQPS or flux noise. We find the noise power spectrum associated with CQPS dephasing appears to be featureless at low frequencies and not $1/f$. Numerical simulations indicate this behavior is consistent with charge noise generated by charge-parity fluctuations within the array. Our findings broadly inform JJ-array-design tradeoffs, relevant for the numerous superconducting qubit designs employing JJ-array superinductors.</description>

      <title>Even-Odd Layer-Dependent Exchange Bias Effect in MnBi2Te4 Chern Insulator Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic topological materials with coexisting magnetism and non-trivial band structures exhibit many novel quantum phenomena, including the quantum anomalous Hall effect, the axion insulator state, and the Weyl semimetal phase. As a stoichiometric layered antiferromagnetic topological insulator, thin films of MnBi2Te4 show fascinating even-odd layer-dependent physics. In this work, we fabricate a series of thin-flake MnBi2Te4 devices using stencil masks and observe the Chern insulator state at high magnetic fields and a square hysteresis loop near zero magnetic field in all these devices. Upon magnetic field training, a large exchange bias effect is observed in odd but not in even septuple layer (SL) devices. Our theoretical calculations interpret this even-odd layer-dependent exchange bias effect as a consequence of contrasting surface and bulk magnetic properties of MnBi2Te4 devices. Our findings reveal the microscopic magnetic configuration of MnBi2Te4 thin flakes and highlight the challenges in replicating the zero magnetic field quantum anomalous Hall effect in odd SL MnBi2Te4 devices.</description>

      <title>Towards tailored magnetic anisotropy: A first-principles study of L1$_0$ FeNi ultrathin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In previous experiments, thin films of L1$\mathrm{_0}$ FeNi with different surfaces, including (001), (110) and (111), were produced and studied. Each surface defines a different alignment of the crystallographic tetragonal axis with respect to the film's plane, resulting in different magnetic anisotropies. In this study, we use density functional theory calculations to examine three series of L1$\mathrm{_0}$ FeNi films with surfaces (001), (010), and (111), and with thicknesses ranging from 0.5 to 3 nm (from 4 to 16 atomic monolayers). Our results show that films (001) have perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, while (010) favor in-plane magnetization, with a clear preference for the tetragonal axis [001]. We propose calling this type of in-plane anisotropy fixed in plane. A film with surface (111) and a thickness of four atomic monolayers has the magnetization easy axis almost perpendicular to the plane of the film. As the thickness of the (111) film increases, the direction of magnetization rotates towards a tetragonal axis [001], positioned at an angle of about 45$^{o}$ to the plane of the film. Furthermore, the magnetic moment of ultrathin films increases by a maximum of 5%, and the most significant changes in spin and orbital magnetic moments occur at a depth of about three near-surface atomic monolayers. The presented results could be useful for experimental efforts to synthesize ultrathin L1$\mathrm{_0}$ FeNi films with different surfaces. Ultrathin L1$\mathrm{_0}$ FeNi films with varying magnetic anisotropies may find applications in spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>From orbital to paramagnetic pair breaking in layered superconductor 2H-NbS$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The superconducting transition metal dichalcogenides 2H-NbSe$_2$ and 2H-NbS$_2$ are intensively studied on account of their unique electronic properties such as Ising superconductivity, found in multi- and monolayers, with upper critical fields beyond the Pauli limit. Even in bulk crystals, there are reports of multiband superconductivity and exotic states, such as the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov phase. In this work, we investigate the superconducting properties of 2H-NbS$_2$ through a detailed high-field mapping of the phase diagram by means of magnetotransport and magnetostriction experiments. We compare the phase diagram between bulk crystals and a 6~nm thick flake of 2H-NbS$_2$ and find a drastically enhanced Maki parameter in the flake, signifying a change of the relevant pair breaking mechanism from orbital to paramagnetic pair breaking, which we attribute to an effect of enhanced spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose controlling the hybridization between Majorana zero modes at the ends of magnetic adatom chains on superconductors by an additional magnetic adatom deposited close by. By tuning the additional adatom's magnetization, position, and coupling to the superconductor, we can couple and decouple the Majorana modes as well as control the ground state parity. The scheme is independent of microscopic details in ferromagnetic and helical magnetic chains on superconductors with and without spin-orbit coupling, which we show by studying their full microscopic models and their common low-energy description. Our results show that scanning tunneling microscopy and electron spin resonance techniques are promising tools for controlling the Majorana hybridization in magnetic adatoms-superconductor setups, providing a basis for Majorana parity measurements, fusion, and braiding techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theory of the orbital Hall effect (OHE), a transverse flow of orbital angular momentum in response to an electric field, has concentrated overwhelmingly on intrinsic mechanisms. Here, using a quantum kinetic formulation, we determine the full OHE in the presence of short-range disorder using 2D massive Dirac fermions as a prototype. We find that, in doped systems, extrinsic effects associated with the Fermi surface (skew scattering and side jump) provide $\approx 95\%$ of the OHE. This suggests that, at experimentally relevant transport densities, the OHE is primarily extrinsic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00447v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a practical implementation of a universal quantum computer that uses local fermionic modes (LFM) rather than qubits. The device layout consists of quantum dots tunnel coupled by a hybrid superconducting island and a tunable capacitive coupling between the dots. We show that coherent control of Cooper pair splitting, elastic cotunneling, and Coulomb interactions allows us to implement the universal set of quantum gates defined by Bravyi and Kitaev. Due to the similarity with charge qubits, we expect charge noise to be the main source of decoherence. For this reason, we also consider an alternative design where the quantum dots have tunable coupling to the superconductor. In this second device design, we show that there is a sweetspot for which the local fermionic modes are charge neutral, making the device insensitive to charge noise effects. Finally, we compare both designs and their experimental limitations and suggest future efforts to overcome them.</description>

      <title>Geometry of the dephasing sweet spots of spin-orbit qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dephasing time of spin-orbit qubits is limited by the coupling with electrical and charge noise. However, there may exist "dephasing sweet spots" where the qubit decouples (to first order) from the noise so that the dephasing time reaches a maximum. Here we discuss the nature of the dephasing sweet spots of a spin-orbit qubit electrically coupled to some fluctuator. We characterize the Zeeman energy $E_\mathrm{Z}$ of this qubit by the tensor $G$ such that $E_\mathrm{Z}=\mu_B\sqrt{\vec{B}^\mathrm{T}G\vec{B}}$ (with $\mu_B$ the Bohr magneton and $\vec{B}$ the magnetic field), and its response to the fluctuator by the derivative $G^\prime$ of $G$ with respect to the fluctuating field. The geometrical nature of the sweet spots on the unit sphere describing the magnetic field orientation depends on the sign of the eigenvalues of $G^\prime$. We show that sweet spots usually draw lines on this sphere. We then discuss how to characterize the electrical susceptibility of a spin-orbit qubit with test modulations on the gates. We apply these considerations to a Ge/GeSi spin qubit heterostructure, and discuss the prospects for the engineering of sweet spots.</description>

      <title>Observation of Chiral Surface State in Superconducting NbGe$_2$</title>

Abstract: The interplay between topology and superconductivity in quantum materials harbors rich physics ripe for discovery. In this study, we investigate the topological properties and superconductivity of the nonsymmorphic chiral superconductor NbGe$_2$ using high-resolution angle-resolved pho-toemission spectroscopy (ARPES), transport measurements, and ab initio calculations. The ARPES data revealed exotic chiral surface states on the (100) surface originating from the inherent chiral crystal structure. Supporting calculations indicate that NbGe$_2$ likely hosts elusive Weyl fermions in its bulk electronic structure. Furthermore, we uncovered the signatures of van Hove singularities that can enhance many-body interactions. Additionally, transport measurements demonstrated that NbGe$_2$ exhibits superconductivity below 2K. Overall, our comprehensive results provide the first concrete evidence that NbGe$_2$ is a promising platform for investigating the interplay between non-trivial band topology, possible Weyl fermions, van Hove singularities, and superconductivity in chiral quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetic magnons on a M\"obius strip: topology-induced symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A M\"obius strip comprising of two antiferromagnetically coupled spin chains showcase exotic magnon excitations with non-trivial physical behavior, which is solely attributed to the real-space boundary condition even in the absence of local curvature effects. Counterintuitively, magnons on a M\"obius strip feature linear polarization of the N\'eel vector devoid of chirality even when the spin Hamiltonian preserves local rotational symmetry around the anisotropic easy axis. These linearly-polarized magnons form two non-degenerate branches that can neither be smoothly connected to nor be decomposed by the circularly-polarized magnons of opposite chirality commonly found in antiferromagnets. Only one branch supports standing-wave formation on the M\"obius strip while the other does not, owing to its spectral shift incurred by the boundary condition. By unraveling a hitherto unknown mechanism of topology-induced symmetry breaking, our findings highlight the profound impact of real-space topology on the physical nature of not only magnons but also other bosonic quasiparticles.</description>

      <title>QDarts: A Quantum Dot Array Transition Simulator for finding charge transitions in the presence of finite tunnel couplings, non-constant charging energies and sensor dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present QDarts, an efficient simulator for realistic charge stability diagrams of quantum dot array (QDA) devices in equilibrium states. It allows for pinpointing the location of concrete charge states and their transitions in a high-dimensional voltage space (via arbitrary two-dimensional cuts through it), and includes effects of finite tunnel coupling, non-constant charging energy and a simulation of noisy sensor dots. These features enable close matching of various experimental results in the literature, and the package hence provides a flexible tool for testing QDA experiments, as well as opening the avenue for developing new methods of device tuning.</description>

      <title>Entangling cavity-magnon polaritons by interacting with phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.15217v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how to entangle two cavity-magnon polaritons (CMPs) formed by two strongly coupled microwave cavity and magnon modes. This is realized by introducing vibration phonons, via magnetostriction, into the system that are dispersively coupled to the magnon mode. Stationary entanglement between two CMPs can be achieved when they are respectively resonant with the two sidebands of the drive field scattered by the phonons, and when the proportions of the cavity and magnon modes in the two polaritons are appropriately chosen. The entangled CMPs can improve the detection sensitivity in the dark matter search experiments using CMPs, and can also lead to the emission of frequency-entangled microwave photons.</description>

      <title>Bypassing the lattice BCS-BEC crossover in strongly correlated superconductors: resilient coherence from multiorbital physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity emerges from the spatial coherence of a macroscopic condensate of Cooper pairs. Increasingly strong binding and localization of electrons into these pairs compromises the condensate's phase stiffness, thereby limiting critical temperatures - a phenomenon known as the BCS-BEC crossover in lattice systems. In this study, we report on an enhancement of superconductivity beyond the limits of the lattice BCS-BEC crossover realized in a multiorbital model of alkali-doped fullerides (A$_3$C$_{60}$). We show how strong correlations and multiorbital effects lead into a localized superconducting regime characterized by a short coherence length but robust stiffness and a domeless rise in critical temperature with increasing pairing interaction. These insights are derived from the development of a theoretical framework to calculate the fundamental length scales of superconductors, namely the coherence length ($\xi_0$) and the London penetration depth ($\lambda_{\mathrm{L}}$), in microscopic theories and from first principles, even in presence of strong electron correlations.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian topology and criticality in photonic arrays with engineered losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrated photonic systems provide a flexible platform where artificial lattices can be engineered in a reconfigurable fashion. Here, we show that one-dimensional photonic arrays with engineered losses allow the realization of topological excitations stemming from non-Hermiticity and bulk mode criticality. We show that a generalized modulation of the local photonic losses allows the creation of topological modes both in the presence of periodicity and even in the quasiperiodic regime. We demonstrate that a localization transition of all the bulk photonic modes can be engineered in the presence of a quasiperiodic loss modulation, and we further demonstrate that such a transition can be created in the presence of both resonance frequency modulation and loss modulation. We finally address the robustness of this phenomenology to the presence of next to the nearest neighbor couplings and disorder in the emergence of criticality and topological modes. Our results put forward a strategy to engineer topology and criticality solely from engineered losses in a photonic system, establishing a potential platform to study the impact of nonlinearities in topological and critical photonic matter.</description>

      <title>Theory of tunneling spectroscopy in $p$-wave altermagnet-superconductor hybrid structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically study the tunneling conductance of a junction consisting of a two-dimensional $p$-wave altermagnet (AM) and a superconductor (SC) for various pairing states. The zero bias conductance peaks arising from the dispersionless surface Andreev bound states (SABSs) in $d_{xy}$-wave and $p_{x}$-wave superconductor junctions are robust against varying the altermagnetic spin-splitting strength $\alpha _{y}$. Moreover, for chiral $p$- or chiral $d$-wave SCs, zero bias conductance shows a non-monotonic behavior as a function of $\alpha_{y}$ indicating the existence of the dispersive SABSs. Our obtained results of tunneling spectroscopy based on a $p$-wave AM serve as an effective way for the identification of the pairing states of unconventional superconductors. It is noted that our used Hamiltonian of AM is also available for persistent spin helix systems.</description>

      <title>Chiral Spin Textures Driven by Emergent Spin-Orbit Interaction: A Numerical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore numerically the intricate interplay between Berry phases in both real and momentum spaces within itinerant magnets. This interplay manifests as an emergent spin-orbit coupling, where charge carriers occupying a Berry-curved band generate an orbital magnetization, inducing a pseudo-magnetic field originating in chiral spin textures. Using density-matrix-renormalization-group techniques, we demonstrate that switching on a band Berry curvature in a metallic ferromagnetic phase results in chiral magnetic textures. Furthermore, employing a two-leg strip geometry, we establish a connection between charge and spin chirality, further supporting this emergent spin-orbit interaction.</description>
