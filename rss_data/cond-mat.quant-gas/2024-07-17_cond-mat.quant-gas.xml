      <title>Observation of relaxation stages in a non-equilibrium closed quantum system: decaying turbulence in a trapped superfluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of non-equilibrium closed quantum systems and their route to thermalization are of fundamental interest to several fields, from cosmology to particle physics. However, a comprehensive description of non-equilibrium phenomena still presents a significant challenge. In this work, we report the observation of distinct stages during the relaxation of the decaying turbulence in trapped Bose-Einstein condensates. Our findings show a direct particle cascade from low to high momenta, a consequence of the energy injection in the system, exhibiting a characteristic universal scaling. This stage is followed by an inverse particle cascade responsible for repopulating the previously depleted condensate. Both cascades can be explained through self-similar solutions provided by wave turbulence theory. These findings provide important insights into the relaxation stages of out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and density fluctuations in a bilayer Hubbard system of ultracold atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure the equation of state in a bilayer Hubbard system for different ratios of the two tunnelling amplitudes $t_\perp /t$. From the equation of state we deduce the compressibility and observe its dependency on $t_\perp /t$. Moreover, we infer thermodynamic number fluctuations from the equation of state by employing the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. By comparing the thermodynamic with local density fluctuations, we find that non-local density fluctuations in our bilayer Hubbard system become more prominent for higher $t_\perp /t$ in the low filling regime. To validate our measurements, we compare them to Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo simulations of a bilayer Hubbard system with 6$\times$6 lattice sites per layer.</description>

      <title>Exact eigenstates with off-diagonal long-range order for interacting bosonic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fermions and hardcore bosons share the same restriction: no more than one particle can occupy a single site in a lattice system. Specifically, in one dimension, two systems can share the same matrix representation. In this work, we investigate both the fermion and hardcore-boson models with nearest-neighbor (NN) interaction in a ring lattice. We construct the exact eigenstates of the hardcore-boson model with resonant NN interaction and show that they possess off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO) in the thermodynamic limit. In comparison, the fermionic counterpart does not support such a feature due to the different particle statistics, although they share an identical energy spectrum. In addition, we examine the effect of the periodic boundary condition on the dynamics of the condensate states through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Multi-reservoir enhanced loading of tweezer atom arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a species-independent method for improved loading into a single-atom optical tweezer array, utilizing iterative loading with multiple reservoir tweezers. Demonstrated with dual wavelength tweezer arrays of $^{88}$Sr atoms, our approach achieves a 96$\%$ loading rate after four reload cycles. This method can significantly enhance existing tweezer rearrangement protocols, potentially reducing iteration time and optical power consumption, thereby enabling a larger number of atoms in a quantum logic device.</description>

      <title>Condensation of vanishing photon emission rates in random atomic clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the collective photon emission from atomic clouds both the atomic transition frequency and the decay rate are modified compared to a single isolated atom, leading to the effects of superradiance and subradiance. In this Letter, we analyse the properties of the Euclidean random matrix associated to the radiative dynamics of a cold atomic cloud, previously investigated in the contexts of photon localization and Dicke super- and subradiance. We present evidence of a new type of phase transition, surprisingly controlled by the cooperativeness parameter, rather than the spatial density or the diagonal disorder. The numerical results corroborate the occurrence of such a phase transition at a critical value of the cooperativeness parameter, above which the lower edge of the spectrum vanishes exhibiting a macroscopic accumulation of eigenvalues. Independent evaluations based on the two phenomena provide the same value of the critical cooperativeness parameter.</description>

      <title>Stable infinite-temperature eigenstates in SU(2)-symmetric nonintegrable models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonintegrable many-body quantum systems typically thermalize at long times through the mechanism of quantum chaos. However, some exceptional systems, such as those harboring quantum scars, break thermalization, serving as testbeds for foundational problems of quantum statistical physics. Here, we investigate a class of nonintegrable bond-staggered models that is endowed with a large number of zero-energy eigenstates and possesses a non-Abelian internal symmetry. We use character theory to give a lower bound on the zero-energy degeneracy, which matches exact diagonalization results, and is found to grow exponentially with the system size. We also show that few-magnon zero-energy states have an exact analytical description, allowing us to build a basis of low-entangled fixed-separation states, which is stable to most perturbations found in experiments. This remarkable dynamical stability of special states elucidates our understanding of nonequilibrium processes in non-Abelian chaotic quantum models.</description>

      <title>Bound Bogoliubov quasiparticles in photon superfluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bogoliubov's description of Bose gases relies on the linear dynamics of noninteracting quasiparticles on top of a homogeneous condensate. Here, we theoretically explore the weakly-nonlinear regime of a one-dimensional photon superfluid in which phonon-like elementary excitations interact via their backreaction on the background flow. The generalized dispersion relation extracted from spatiotemporal intensity spectra reveals additional branches that correspond to bound Bogoliubov quasiparticles -- phase-locked collective excitations originating from nonresonant harmonic-generation and wave-mixing processes. These mechanisms are inherent to fluctuation dynamics and highlight non-trivial scattering channels other than resonant interactions that could be relevant in the emergence of dissipative and turbulent phenomena in superfluids.</description>

      <title>Optical Manipulation of Spin States in Ultracold Magnetic Atoms via an Inner-Shell Hz Transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lanthanides, like erbium and dysprosium, have emerged as powerful platforms for quantum-gas research due to their diverse properties, including a significant large spin manifold in their absolute ground state. However, effectively exploiting the spin richness necessitates precise manipulation of spin populations, a challenge yet to be fully addressed in this class of atomic species. In this work, we present an all-optical method for deterministically controlling the spin composition of a dipolar bosonic erbium gas, based on a clock-like transition in the telecom window at 1299 nm. The atoms can be prepared in just a few tens of microseconds in any spin-state composition using a sequence of Rabi-pulse pairs, selectively coupling Zeeman sublevels of the ground state with those of the long-lived clock-like state. Finally, we demonstrate that this transition can also be used to create spin-selective light shifts, thus fully suppressing spin-exchange collisions. These experimental results unlock exciting possibilities for implementing advanced spin models in isolated, clean and fully controllable lattice systems.</description>

Abstract: Topological and geometrical features arising in bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) systems have mainly been studied by utilizing a generalized symplectic version of the Berry curvature and related Chern numbers. Here, we propose a symplectic quantum geometric tensor (SQGT), whose imaginary part leads to the previously studied symplectic Berry curvature, while the real part gives rise to a symplectic quantum metric, providing a natural distance measure in the space of bosonic Bogoliubov modes. We propose how to measure all components of the SQGT by extracting excitation rates in response to periodic modulations of the systems' parameters. Moreover, we connect the symplectic Berry curvature to a generalized symplectic anomalous velocity term for Bogoliubov Bloch wave packets. We test our results for a bosonic Bogoliubov-Haldane model.</description>

      <title>Accelerated creation of NOON states with ultracold atoms via counterdiabatic driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17545v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quantum control protocol is proposed for the creation of NOON states with $N$ ultracold bosonic atoms on two modes, corresponding to the coherent superposition $\vert N,0\rangle + \vert 0,N\rangle$. This state can be prepared by using a third mode where all bosons are initially placed and which is symmetrically coupled to the two other modes. Tuning the energy of this third mode across the energy level of the other modes allows the adiabatic creation of the NOON state. While this process normally takes too much time to be of practical usefulness, due to the smallness of the involved spectral gap, it can be drastically boosted through counterdiabatic driving which allows for efficient gap engineering. We demonstrate that this process can be implemented in terms of static parameter adaptations that are experimentally feasible with ultracold quantum gases. Gain factors in the required protocol speed are obtained that increase exponentially with the number of involved atoms and thus counterbalance the exponentially slow collective tunneling process underlying this adiabatic transition.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Bethe Ansatz</title>

Abstract: The recently proposed exact quantum solution for two delta-function-interacting particles with a mass-ratio 3:1 in a hard-wall box [Y. Liu, F. Qi, Y. Zhang and S. Chen, iScience 22, 181 (2019)] violates the conventional necessary condition for a Bethe Ansatz integrability, the condition being that the system must be reducible to a superposition of semi-transparent mirrors that is invariant under all the reflections it generates. In this article, we found a way to relax this condition: some of the semi-transparent mirrors of a known self-invariant mirror superposition can be replaced by the perfectly reflecting ones, thus breaking the self-invariance. The proposed name for the method is Asymmetric Bethe Ansatz (Asymmetric BA). As a worked example, we study in detail the bound states of the nominally non-integrable system comprised of a bosonic dimer in a delta-well. Finally, we show that the exact solution of the Liu-Qi-Zhang-Chen problem is a particular instance of the the Asymmetric BA.</description>

      <title>Effects of forward disorder on quasi-1D superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the competition between disorder and singlet superconductivity in a quasi-1d system. We investigate the applicability of the Anderson theorem, namely that time-reversal conserving (non-magnetic) disorder does not impact the critical temperature, by opposition to time-reversal breaking disorder (magnetic). To do so we examine a quasi-1d system of spin 1/2 fermions with attractive interactions and forward scattering disorder using field theory (bosonization). By computing the superconducting critical temperature ($T_c$), we find that for non-magnetic disorder the Anderson theorem also holds in the quasi-1D geometry. On the contrary, magnetic disorder has an impact on the critical temperature, that we investigate by deriving renormalization group (RG) equations describing the competition between the disorder and the interactions. Computing the critical temperature as a function of disorder strength, we see that different regimes arise depending on the strength of interactions. We discuss possible platforms where to observe this in cold atoms and condensed matter.</description>

      <title>Violation of the Leggett-Garg Inequality for Dynamics of a Bose-Einstein Condensate in a Double-Well Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Leggett-Garg inequality (LGI) serves as a criterion to determine the adherence of macroscopic system dynamics to macrorealism, as postulated by Leggett and Garg. A violation of this inequality implies either the absence of a realistic description of the system or the impracticality of noninvasive measurements. In this work, we investigate the violation of the LGI for the system of bosons in a double-well potential. Specifically, we explore the violation of the LGI in the dynamics of bosons in a double-well potential in the Bose-Einstein-Condensation (BEC) regime, where the system can be considered as two weakly coupled Bose condensates, and in the single-particle regime to establish the conditions under which the violation of the LGI occurs. Our analysis reveals that the LGI is violated due to Josephson oscillations, while it remains unviolated in the strong coupling regime, attributed to the self-trapping phenomena. Notably, we observe that the violation of the LGI becomes increasingly significant as the particle number increases. These findings provide valuable insights into the macrorealistic behavior of Bose condensates and highlight the effect of measurements on the dynamics of a macroscopic system.</description>
