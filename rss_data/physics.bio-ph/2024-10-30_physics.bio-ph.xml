      <title>The Interplay of Heterogeneity and Product Detachment in Templated Polymer Copying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Templated copolymerization, in which information stored in the sequence of a heteropolymer template is copied into another polymer product, is the mechanism behind all known methods of genetic information transfer. A key aspect of templated copolymerization is the eventual detachment of the product from the template. A second key feature of natural biochemical systems is that the template-binding free energies of both correctly-matched and incorrect monomers are heterogeneous. Previous work has considered the thermodynamic consequences of detachment, and the consequences of heterogeniety for polymerisation speed and accuracy, but the interplay of both separation and heterogeniety remains unexplored. In this work, we investigate a minimal model of templated copying that simultaneously incorporates both detachment from behind the leading edge of the growing copy and heterogeneous interactions. We first extend existing coarse-graining methods for models of polymerisation to allow for heterogeneous interactions. We then show that heterogeneous copying systems with explicit detachment do not exhibit the subdiffusive behaviour observed in the absence of detachment when near equilibrium. Next, we show that heterogeneity in correct monomer interactions tends to result in slower, less accurate copying, while heterogeneity in incorrect monomer interactions tends to result in faster, more accurate copying, due to an increased roughness in the free energy landscape of either correct or incorrect monomer pairs. Finally, we show that heterogeneity can improve on known thermodynamic efficiencies of homogeneous copying, but these increased thermodynamic efficiencies do not always translate to increased efficiencies of information transfer.</description>

      <title>Complete mathematical theory of the jamming transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The jamming transition of frictionless athermal particles is a paradigm to understand the mechanics of amorphous materials at the atomic scale. Concepts related to the jamming transition and the mechanical response of jammed packings have cross-fertilized into other areas such as atomistic descriptions of the elasticity and plasticity of glasses. In this perspective article, the microscopic mathematical theory of the jamming transition is reviewed from first-principles. The starting point of the derivation is a microscopically-reversible particle-bath Hamiltonian from which the governing equation of motion for the grains under an external deformation is derived. From this equation of motion, microscopic expressions are obtained for both the shear modulus and the viscosity as a function of the distance from the jamming transition (respectively, above and below the transition). Regarding the vanishing of the shear modulus at the unjamming transition, this theory, as originally demonstrated in [Zaccone \&amp; Scossa-Romano, Phys. Rev. B 83, 184205 (2011)], is currently the only quantitative microscopic theory in parameter-free agreement with numerical simulations of [O'Hern et al. Phys. Rev. E 68, 011306 (2003)] for jammed packings. The divergence of the viscosity upon approaching the jamming transition from below is derived here, for the first time, from the same microscopic Hamiltonian. The quantitative microscopic prediction of the diverging viscosity is shown to be in fair agreement with numerical results of sheared 2D soft disks from [Olsson \&amp; Teitel, Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 178001 (2007)].</description>

      <title>Condensation and activator/repressor control of a transcription-regulated biomolecular liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cells operate in part by compartmentalizing chemical reactions. For example, recent work has shown that chromatin, the material that contains the cell's genome, can auto-regulate its structure by utilizing reaction products (proteins, RNA) to compartmentalize biomolecules via liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). Here, we develop a model biomolecular system that permits quantitative investigation of such dynamics, particularly by coupling a phase-separating system of DNA nanostars to an in vitro transcription reaction. The DNA nanostars' sequence is designed such that they self-assemble into liquid droplets only in the presence of a transcribed single-stranded RNA linker. We find that nanostar droplets form with a substantial delay and non-linear response to the kinetics of RNA synthesis. In addition, we utilize the compartments generated by the phase-separation process to engineer an activator/repressor network, where the transcription reaction activates the formation of droplets, and then droplets suppress the transcription reaction by segregating transcription components inside them. Our work on transcription-driven liquid-liquid phase separation constitutes a robust and programmable platform to explore non-equilibrium reaction-phase transition dynamics and could also provide a foundation to understand the dynamics of transcriptional condensate assembly in cells.</description>

      <title>Dynamical metastability and re-entrant localization of trapped active elements with speed and orientation fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the dynamics of active elements performing persistent random motion with fluctuating active speed and in the presence of translational noise in a $d$-dimensional harmonic trap, modeling active speed generation through an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Our approach employs an exact analytic method based on the Fokker-Planck equation to compute time-dependent moments of any dynamical variable of interest across arbitrary dimensions. We analyze dynamical crossovers in particle displacement before reaching the steady state, focusing on three key timescales: speed relaxation, persistence, and dynamical relaxation in the trap. Notably, for slow active speed relaxation, we observe an intermediate time metastable saturation in the mean-squared displacement before reaching the final steady state. The steady-state distributions of particle positions exhibit two types of non-Gaussian departures based on control parameters: bimodal distributions with negative excess kurtosis and heavy-tailed unimodal distributions with positive excess kurtosis. We obtain detailed steady-state phase diagrams using the exact calculation of excess kurtosis, identifying Gaussian and non-Gaussian regions and possible re-entrant transitions.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic uncertainty relation for systems with active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22126v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs) delineate tradeoff relations between the thermodynamic cost and the magnitude of an observable's fluctuation. While TURs have been established for various nonequilibrium systems, their applicability to systems influenced by active noise remains largely unexplored. Here, we present an explicit expression of TUR for systems with active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles (AOUPs). Our findings reveal that active noise introduces modifications to the terms associated with the thermodynamic cost in the TUR expression. The altered thermodynamic cost encompasses not only the conventional entropy production but also the energy consumption induced by the active noise. We examine the capability of this TUR as an accurate estimator of the extent of anomalous diffusion in systems with active noise driven by a constant force in free space. By introducing the concept of a contracted probability density function, we derive a steady-state TUR tailored to this system. Moreover, through the adoption of a new scaling parameter, we enhance and optimize the TUR bound further. Our results demonstrate that active noise tends to hinder accurate estimation of the anomalous diffusion extent. Our study offers a systematic approach for exploring the fluctuation nature of biological systems operating in active environments.</description>

Abstract: The following is an unedited version of two short articles that are forthcoming in Nature Chemical Engineering. Inspired by Purcell's classic lecture "Life at low Reynolds number", I discuss how scaling arguments, dimensional analysis, and fundamental concepts from chemical engineering science can be used to quantitatively describe microbial swimming -- thereby helping to better understand biological systems and inspiring new engineering advances in turn.</description>

      <title>The Inertial Spin Model of flocking with position-dependent forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06368v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an extension to the ISM of flocking and swarming. The model has been introduced to explain certain dynamic features of swarming (second sound, a lower than expected dynamic critical exponent) while preserving the mechanism for onset of order provided by the Vicsek model. The ISM has only been formulated with an imitation (``ferromagnetic'') interaction between velocities. Here we show how to add position-dependent forces in the model, which allows to consider effects such as cohesion, excluded volume, confinement and perturbation with external position-dependent field, and thus study this model without periodic boundary conditions. We study numerically a single particle with an harmonic confining field and compare it to a Brownian harmonic oscillator and to a harmonically confined active Browinian particle, finding qualitatively different behavior in the three cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce software for reading, writing and processing fluorescence single-molecule and image spectroscopy data and developing analysis pipelines that unifies various spectroscopic analysis tools. Our software can be used for processing multiple experiment types, e.g., for time-resolved single-molecule (sm) spectroscopy, laser scanning microscopy, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, and image correlation spectroscopy. The software is file format agnostic, processes and outputs multiple time-resolved data formats. Thereby our software eliminates the need for data conversion and mitigates data archiving issues.</description>
