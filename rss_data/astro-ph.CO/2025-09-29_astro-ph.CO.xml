      <title>Constraining Inflationary Particle Production with CMB Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inflation generates correlated temperature ($T$) and polarization ($E$-mode) fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), which differ only by their transfer functions. Following Philcox et al. (2025), we investigate a scenario with a massive partner to the inflaton ($\mathcal{O}(100)$ times the inflationary Hubble scale), in which particles are produced during a narrow time period, leaving characteristic hot- or cold-spots in the CMB. Using tools developed for thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich cluster-finding, we search component-separated $\textit{Planck}$ PR4 $E$-mode maps for these hotspots, and compare to analogous results in $T$. Our analysis pipeline is validated on simulated observations and gives unbiased constraints for sufficiently large and bright hotspots. We find no strong evidence for primordial hotspots and thereby place novel bounds on the marginal and relevant coupling between the inflaton and massive scalars during inflation, probing physics at energies many orders of magnitude above any feasible terrestrial collider. Due to the large noise in $\textit{Planck}$ polarization, the temperature data dominate constraints for small hotspots, but for sufficiently large hotspots, our bounds improve on those of Philcox et al. (2025) by $\sim 25\%$. We also forecast the inferred bounds on inflationary physics for a search using Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data, and from an optimistic cosmic-variance-limited experiment (CV), for which $E$-mode data provide stronger constraints than $T$ on nearly all scales. ACT should improve on the $\textit{Planck}$ constraints by $\gtrsim25\%$, nearing the CV limit on intermediate scales. Finally, we compare the constraining power of localized searches to that of a power spectrum analysis, and demonstrate that for sufficiently few produced particles the localized search performed herein is dominant.</description>

      <title>Evidence for increasing dark energy in DESI from the Local Distance Ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The {\it Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument} (DESI) provides a comprehensive survey of {\it Baryon Acoustic Oscillation} (BAO) in the {\it Large Scale Structure} (LSS), {in stratified data covering a finite redshift range.} Extracting cosmological parameters in a joint analysis of LSS-CMB data is hereby inherently a nonlinear problem. In particular, this nonlinearity may concern the unknown equation of state of dark energy $w(a)$, defined in the general $w(a)$CDM framework. Nevertheless, a common approach is the linearized approximation hereto notably $w_0w_a$CDM, also applied by DESI. Here, we consider a potential source of a systematic uncertainty in this linearization due to non-commutativity between $w_0w_a$CDM and {\it a posteriori} linearization of $w(a)$CDM, identified with a symmetry in the latter, which is violated in the former. We shall refer to these as early and late linearization, respectively. We demonstrate this in the analysis of the Hubble expansion in the Local Distance Ladder (LDL). Strikingly, opposite results are found for the evolution of dark energy by early versus late linearization, indicating a thawing or respectively, increasing dark energy. It is unlikely that the DESI pipeline is immune to the same contradiction. Our results show rather than thawing, claimed by DESI, dark energy may in fact be increasing. Further confirmation is expected from {\it Euclid}.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy dark matter simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fuzzy dark matter (FDM), composed of ultralight bosons, exhibits intricate wave phenomena on galactic scales. Compared to cold dark matter, FDM simulations are significantly more computationally demanding due to the need to resolve the de Broglie wavelength and its rapid oscillations. In this review, we first outline the governing equations and distinctive features of FDM. We then present a range of numerical algorithms for both wave- and fluid-based simulations, discuss their respective advantages and limitations, and highlight representative test problems. To facilitate code comparison, we also provide publicly available initial condition files for both isolated-halo and cosmological simulations.</description>

      <title>Comological Prediction from the joint observation of MeerKAT and CSST at $z$ = 0.4 $\sim$ 1.2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-correlating neutral hydrogen (HI) 21cm intensity mapping with galaxy surveys provides an effective probe of astrophysical and cosmological information. This work presents a cross-correlation analysis between MeerKAT single-dish HI intensity mapping and Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) spectroscopic galaxy surveys in $z=0.4\sim1.2$, which will share a survey area of several thousand square degrees. Utilizing Jiutian-1G cosmological simulation, we simulate the observational data of MeerKAT and CSST with survey areas from $\sim1600$ to $600$ deg$^2$ at $z=0.5$, 0.7, and 1. The effects of beam pattern, polarization leakage, and different foregrounds in the MeerKAT HI intensity mapping are considered in the simulation. After employing foreground removal with the principal component analysis (PCA) method and performing signal compensation, we derive the cross-power spectra of MeerKAT and CSST. We perform the joint constraint using the CSST galaxy auto-power spectra and MeerKAT-CSST cross-power spectra with the least-squares fitting method. The constraint results show that, in the simulated survey area, the relative accuracy can achieve $6\%\sim 8\%$ for the parameter products $\Omega_{\rm HI}b_{\rm HI}b_{g}r_{\rm HI,g}$ and $\Omega_{\rm HI}b_{\rm HI}r_{\rm HI,g}$ at the three redshifts, which is $3\sim4$ times smaller than the current result. These findings indicate that the full MeerKAT-CSST joint observation with thousands of square degrees overlapping survey area can be a powerful probe of cosmic</description>

      <title>Renormalization group corrections to $\Lambda$CDM model and observational consequences for $H_0$ tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the renormalization group-based extension of the $\Lambda$CDM model as a potential solution to the current cosmological tensions. In this approach, both the cosmological constant density and Newton's constant are allowed to vary with the energy scale, as a consequence of the remnant effects of massive quantum fields in the low-energy regime. The corresponding cosmological model is consistent with the principles of quantum field theory, based on the covariance of the vacuum effective action, and is characterized by an unique extra parameter $\nu$. Our analysis yields a best-fit value of $\nu = - (2.5 \pm 1.3)\times 10^{-4}$, placing the $\Lambda$CDM limit at the $2\sigma$ region of the $\nu$ posterior. This narrow range is consistent with data from CMB (Planck), BAO (DESI), and SN Ia (DES Y5). Our result also alleviates the $H_0$ tension and is consistent with the previously established constraints from large-scale structure. In this kind of models there is a link between cosmology and particle physics. Our results point to possibility of a new physics, characterized by a mass spectrum lying below the Planck scale but above the values typically associated with Grand Unified Theories (GUTs).</description>

      <title>Inferring Cosmological Parameters with Evidential Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the use of a novel variant of Physics-Informed Neural Networks to predict cosmological parameters from recent supernovae and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) datasets. Our machine learning framework generates uncertainty estimates for target variables and the inferred unknown parameters of the underlying PDE descriptions. Built upon a hybrid of the principles of Evidential Deep Learning, Physics-Informed Neural Networks, Bayesian Neural Networks and Gaussian Processes, our model enables learning of the posterior distribution of the unknown PDE parameters through standard gradient-descent based training. We apply our model to an up-to-date BAO dataset (Bousis et al. 2024) calibrated with the CMB-inferred sound horizon, and the Pantheon$+$ Sne Ia distances (Scolnic et al. 2018), examining the relative effectiveness and mutual consistency among the standard $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM and $\Lambda_s$CDM models. Unlike previous results arising from the standard approach of minimizing an appropriate $\chi^2$ function, the posterior distributions for parameters in various models trained purely on Pantheon$+$ data were found to be largely contained within the $2\sigma$ contours of their counterparts trained on BAO data. Their posterior medians for $h_0$ were within about $2\sigma$ of one another, indicating that our machine learning-guided approach provides a different measure of the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>CMB Hemispherical Power Asymmetry from Early Phase of Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the hemispherical power asymmetry observed in the CMBR by attributing it to an early inhomogeneous phase of cosmic expansion. Unlike the conventional assumption of a perfectly isotropic and homogeneous pre-inflationary Universe, we introduce a small inhomogeneous perturbation, treated within a perturbative framework. Our analysis builds on previously developed empirical models of inhomogeneous primordial power spectrum models based on dipole modulation. Using in-in formalism, we compute two-point correlations directly from the metric and demonstrate that, at leading order, this introduces a direction-dependent power spectrum that breaks rotational symmetry and naturally selects a preferred direction, relating observed violation of the cosmological principle to inflationary power spectra arising from scalar field fluctuations. Additionally, we find that this framework produces correlations between multipoles separated by $\Delta l=1$, leading to distinctive signatures in the multipole space. Furthermore, we constrain the parameters of the inhomogeneous perturbation using observed PR4 \texttt{Commander} CMB data.</description>

      <title>SymBoltz.jl: a symbolic-numeric, approximation-free and differentiable linear Einstein-Boltzmann solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SymBoltz is a new Julia package that solves the linear Einstein-Boltzmann equations. It features a symbolic-numeric interface for specifying equations, is free of approximation switching schemes and is compatible with automatic differentiation. Cosmological models are built from replaceable physical components in a way that scales well in model space. The modeler should simply write down their equations, and SymBoltz solves them and eliminates much of the friction in the process. SymBoltz enables up to 100x shorter model definitions compared to browsing equivalent files in CLASS. Symbolic knowledge enables powerful automation of tasks, such as separating computational stages like the background and perturbations, generating the Jacobian matrix and its sparsity pattern, and interpolating arbitrary expressions from the solution. Modern implicit solvers integrate the full stiff equations at all times, reducing slowdowns by taking long time steps, reusing the Jacobian and LU-factorizing it over several time steps, and using fast linear system solvers. Automatic differentiation gives exact derivatives of any output with respect to any input, which is important for gradient-based Markov chain Monte Carlo methods in large parameter spaces, training of emulators, Fisher forecasting and sensitivity analysis. These features are useful in their own rights, but also reinforce each other in a synergy. Results agree with established codes like CLASS and CAMB. With more work, SymBoltz can grow into an integrated symbolic-numeric cosmological modeling environment with a large library of models that delivers differentiable output as fast as other codes. SymBoltz is available at https://github.com/hersle/SymBoltz.jl with single-command installation and extensive documentation, and welcomes questions, suggestions and contributions.</description>

      <title>Graph-based Analysis for Revealing the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background in Pulsar Timing Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) reveals valuable information about its origin and the Universe. The pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are suitable indicators for detecting SGWB within the nano-Hertz frequency range. In this work, we propose a graph-based method implemented on the pulsar timing residuals (PTRs) for SGWB detection and examining uncertainties of its parameters. We construct a correlation graph with pulsars as its nodes, and analyze the graph-based summary statistics, which include topological and geometrical characteristics, for identifying SGWB in real and synthetic datasets. The effect of the number of pulsars, the observation time span, and the strength of the SGWB on the graph-based feature vector is evaluated. Our results demonstrate that the merit feature vector for common signal detection consists of the average clustering coefficient and the edge weight fluctuation. The SGWB detection conducted after the observation of a common signal and then exclusion of non-Hellings \&amp; Downs templates is performed by the second cumulant of edge weight for angular separation thresholds $\bar{\zeta}\gtrsim 40^{\circ}$. The lowest detectable value of SGWB strain amplitude utilizing our graph-based measures at the current PTAs sensitivity is $A_{\rm SGWB}\gtrsim 1.2\times 10^{-15}$. Fisher forecasts confirmed that the uncertainty levels of $\log_{10} A_{\rm SGWB}$ and spectral index reach $2.2\%$ and $28.3\%$, respectively, at $2\sigma$ confidence interval. Evidence for an SGWB at the $3\sigma$ level is obtained by applying our graph-based method to the NANOGrav 15-year dataset.</description>

      <title>AGN hosting jets. I: A semi-analytical model for the evolution of radio galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional simulations of relativistic jets are a useful tool to understand the evolution of jets and radio galaxies in detail. However, computationally demanding as they are, their use is limited to a relatively small number of representative cases. When comparing to the distribution of large samples of objects in the luminosity-distance plane (P-D plane), the most efficient approach is to use analytical or semi-analytical models that reproduce the evolution of the main parameters governing the dynamics and radio luminosity of the sources. Our aim is to build a semi-analytical model that allows us to produce mock samples of radio galaxies to be compared with real populations and use this approach to constrain the general properties of active galaxies with jets in a cosmological context. In this work, we present a new model for the evolution of radio galaxies based on the resolution of ordinary differential equations and inspired both by previous experience on numerical simulations of jets across several orders of magnitude in power, and by observational evidence. Our results show remarkable agreement between the results given by the semi-analytical model and those obtained by both 2D and 3D relativistic hydrodynamics simulations of jets ranging from 1.e35 W to 1.e39 W. From the derived trajectories of powerful radio galaxies through the P-D diagram (powers greater than 1.e36 W), our model agrees with typical lifetimes of galactic activity of &lt; 500 Myr. We also compare our results with previous models in the literature. In a follow-up paper, we use this model to generate mock populations of radio galaxies at low redshifts and compare them to the LoTSS sample.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from axion inflation in the gradient expansion formalism II: Fermionic axion inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axion inflation represents an intriguing source of gravitational waves (GWs) from the early Universe. In a companion paper arXiv:2508.00798, we previously leveraged the gradient expansion formalism (GEF) to investigate pure axion inflation (PAI), i.e., axion inflaton coupled to a pure gauge sector. In this paper, we extend our analysis to fermionic axion inflation (FAI), i.e., we allow for the presence of fermions in the gauge sector. PAI predicts a strongly blue-tilted GW spectrum; in our GEF benchmark study, all parameter regions leading to observable GWs turned out to violate the upper limit on the number of extra relativistic degrees of freedom, $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. As we demonstrate in this paper, the situation is different for FAI: Schwinger pair creation of the charged fermions results in a damping of the gauge-field production, which attenuates the GW signal. As a result, the GW signal from FAI can fall into the sensitivity reach of LISA and ET without violating the upper limit on $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. This result notably applies to the arguably most realistic variant of Abelian axion inflation, in which the axion couples to the hypercharge sector of the Standard Model. Besides, we discuss GW emission from the fermion gas, which may further enhance the total GW signal but which also requires a more quantitative investigation in future work. Additionally, we identify a new backreaction regime in which fermion production moderates the axion--vector dynamics. In this regime, the axion velocity and all energy-density components exhibit oscillations analogous to the strong backreaction in PAI, but here, the oscillations occur around the slow-roll trajectory and are damped by the presence of charged fermions. These observations define again an interesting GEF benchmark for future lattice studies.</description>

      <title>Extended mass distribution of PBHs during QCD phase transition: SGWB and mini-EMRIs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are one of the most important tracers of cosmic history. In this work, we investigate the formation of PBHs around the time of the QCD phase transition from a broadly peaked inflationary scalar power spectrum, which naturally produces an extended PBH mass function. This scenario yields two distinct stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWB): (i) scalar-induced, second-order tensor perturbations generated at PBH formation, and (ii) a merger-driven SGWB from the subsequent PBH binary population. Using Bayesian analysis, we examine both SGWB channels with the data from the NANOGrav 15-year dataset and the first three observing runs of LVK. We also forecast continuous-wave signals from mini extreme mass ratio inspirals (mini-EMRIs) for direct comparison with NANOGrav and LVK constraints. Our parameter scans identify regions of the parameter space where the combined SGWB is detectable in future ground-based and space-based detectors. A broad PBH mass distribution naturally gives rise to mini-EMRIs, which future ground-based observatories, such as LVK A+, ET, and CE, can detect. For a large part of the PBH parameter space, the SGWB of astrophysical origin masks the primordial SGWB in the frequency band of ground-based detectors. Thus, for extended PBH mass distributions, we find that the detection of mini-EMRIs is a more robust channel for probing the PBH parameter space than the corresponding SGWB.</description>

Abstract: We study a class of Unified Dark Matter (UDM) models based on generalized K-essence, where a single scalar field with non-canonical kinetic terms accounts for dark radiation, dark matter, and dark energy. Starting from the purely kinetic Lagrangian proposed by Scherrer (2004), we extend the analysis to quadratic and exponential scalar potentials and explore their phenomenology. All models are implemented in a modified version of \texttt{Hi\_CLASS} and confronted with data from \textit{Planck} 2018, DESI DR1, and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. The scenarios reproduce the full sequence of cosmic epochs: an early radiation-like phase, a matter-dominated era, and late-time accelerated expansion. The new models predict slightly higher values of the Hubble constant compared to $\Lambda$CDM, thereby partially alleviating the respective tensions from $\sim 4.4 \sigma$ to $\sim 3.4 \sigma$. The quadratic potential requires an ultralight mass that makes it effectively indistinguishable from the Scherrer solution. Overall, generalized K-essence provides a minimal and observationally viable realization of UDM, offering a unified description of the dark sector with distinctive signatures in both early- and late-time cosmology.</description>

      <title>gCAMB: A GPU-accelerated Boltzmann solver for next-generation cosmological surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inferring cosmological parameters from Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data requires repeated and computationally expensive calculations of theoretical angular power spectra using Boltzmann solvers like CAMB. This creates a significant bottleneck, particularly for non-standard cosmological models and the high-accuracy demands of future surveys. While emulators based on deep neural networks can accelerate this process by several orders of magnitude, they first require large, pre-computed training datasets, which are costly to generate and model-specific. To address this challenge, we introduce gCAMB, a version of the CAMB code ported to GPUs, which preserves all the features of the original CPU-only code. By offloading the most computationally intensive modules to the GPU, gCAMB significantly accelerates the generation of power spectra, saving massive computational time, halving the power consumption in high-accuracy settings and, among other purposes, facilitating the creation of extensive training sets needed for robust cosmological analyses. We make the gCAMB software available to the community at https://github.com/lstorchi/CAMB/tree/gpuport.</description>

      <title>Non-linear infusion of intrinsic alignment and source clustering: impact on non-Gaussian cosmic shear statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intrinsic alignments (IA) of galaxies is one of the key secondary signals to cosmic shear measurements, and must be modeled to interpret weak lensing data and infer the correct cosmology. There are large uncertainties in the physical description of IA, and analytical calculations are often out of reach for weak lensing statistics beyond two-point functions. We present here a set of six flexible IA models infused directly into weak lensing simulations, constructed from the mass shells, the projected tidal fields and, optionally, dark matter halo catalogues. We start with the non-linear linear alignment (NLA) and progressively sophisticate the galaxy bias and the tidal coupling models, including the commonly-used extended NLA (also known as the e-NLA or $\delta$-NLA) and the tidal torque (TT) models. We validate our methods with MCMC analyses from two-point shear statistics, then compute the impact on non-Gaussian cosmic shear probes from these catalogues as well as from reconstructed convergence maps. We find that the $\delta$-NLA model has by far the largest impact on most probes, at times more than twice the strength of the NLA. We also observe large differences between the IA models in under-dense regions, which makes minima, void profiles and lensing PDF the best probes for model rejection. Furthermore, our bias models allow us to separately study the source-clustering term for each of these probes, finding good agreement with the existing literature, and extending the results to these new probes. The third-order aperture mass statistics ($M^3_{ap}$) and the integrated three-point functions are particularly sensitive to this when including low-redshift data, often exceeding a 20% impact on the data vector. Our IA models are straightforward to implement and rescale from a single simulated IA-infused galaxy catalogue, allowing for fast model exploration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter halos are fundamental structures in cosmology, forming the gravitational potential wells hosting galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Their properties and statistical distribution (including the halo mass function) are invaluable tools to infer the fundamental properties of the Universe. The \texttt{halox} package is a JAX-powered Python library enabling differentiable and accelerated computations of key properties of dark matter halos, and of the halo mass function. The automatic differentiation capabilities of \texttt{halox} enable its usage in gradient-based workflows, e.g. in efficient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling or machine learning applications.</description>

      <title>Constraining inhomogeneous energy injection from annihilating dark matter and primordial black holes with 21-cm cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cosmic dawn 21-cm signal is a highly sensitive probe of any process which injects energy into the intergalactic medium, enabling novel searches for anomalous energy injection by through dark matter interactions. In addition to modifying the global 21-cm signal, these processes would leave distinct imprints on the frequency-resolved 21-cm power spectrum with a morphology jointly set by the time- and spatial-dependence of energy emission and absorption. In this work, we extend the DM21cm code package, which models the effects of spatially inhomogeneous energy emission and deposition on 21-cm cosmology, to study three well-motivated scenarios which 21-cm measurements are particularly well-suited to probe: dark matter annihilation through $p$-wave processes, the Hawking radiation of light primordial black holes, and energetic emission from accreting solar-mass primordial black holes. We project sensitivities to each of these scenarios, demonstrating that leading or near leading sensitivity to each can be achieved through 21-cm probes. We also make public our updates to the DM21cm code package that enable it to accommodate energy injection processes for general continuum spectra with arbitrary spatial and temporal dependence in an accompanying release.</description>

      <title>A Splashback-like Feature of Central Galaxies in Galaxy Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a splashback-like feature in the outer region of central galaxies (CGs) in clusters. This feature is detected as a "dip" in the radial slope of the CG surface brightness, derived through the stacking of Dark Energy Survey data of over four thousand galaxy clusters in the redshift range of 0.2 to 0.5 with richness 20 and above. The local minimum of the dip occurs between 40 to 60 kpc from the CG center, with a mild dependence on cluster richness. This feature resembles the density transition caused by the splashback effect at the outskirts of galaxy clusters, when accreted matter reaches the apocenter for the first time. We turn to the IllustrisTNG hydro-dynamic simulation to gain theoretical insights. Density bumps, shells and accretion streaks are identified in the diffuse stellar content of the CGs and intra-cluster light which relate to the recent history of disruption and accretion. These features occur at the outskirts of the CGs, up to several hundred kiloparsecs from the cluster center. Thus, the location of the splashback-like dip in the data potentially marks the edge of the CG and the beginning of a region with the cluster diffuse light undergoing active or recent accretion.</description>

      <title>BBN bounds on neutrinophilic ultralight Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The high densities in the early Universe provide a unique laboratory to constrain couplings between feebly interacting particles, such as dark matter and neutrinos. In this article, we study how Big Bang Nucleosynthesis can constrain models of Ultra-Light Dark Matter diagonally coupled to neutrinos. We follow an adiabatic formalism which allows to average-out the rapid oscillations of the Dark Matter field and consistently take into account the feedback between the neutrino and the Dark Matter fields. This feedback alters the early Universe dynamics, causing the Dark Matter energy density to scale as radiation, while the neutrino mass scales as $a^{-1}$. These two effects modify primordial element abundances by modifying interaction rates and the expansion rate during nucleosynthesis. Then, we use primordial abundances to obtain leading cosmological bounds on the coupling in the range $m_\phi/{\rm eV}\in (10^{-22},10^{-17})$, namely $g\lesssim 0.13(m_\phi/{\rm eV})$ for $m_\phi \gtrsim 3\times 10^{-20}\,\rm eV$ and $g\lesssim 1.8\times 10^{-11}\sqrt{m_\phi/\rm eV}$ for $m_\phi \lesssim 3\times 10^{-20}\,\rm eV$. This consistent cosmological treatment emphasizes that, in the mass interval where its physical assumptions hold, neutrino masses cannot be generated refractively by a direct coupling with an Ultra-Light Dark Matter field.</description>

      <title>Vector Horndeski black holes in nonlinear electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On a spherically symmetric and static background, we study the existence of linearly stable black hole (BH) solutions in nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) with a Horndeski vector-tensor (HVT) coupling, with and without curvature singularities at the center ($r=0$). Incorporating the electric charge $q_E$ and the magnetic charge $q_M$, we first show that nonsingular BHs can exist only if $q_M = 0$. We then study the stability of purely electric BHs by analyzing the behavior of perturbations in the metric and the vector field. Nonsingular electric BHs are unstable due to a Laplacian instability in the vector perturbation near the regular center. In the absence of the HVT coupling ($\beta=0$), singular BHs in power-law NED theories can be consistent with all linear stability conditions, while Born-Infeld BHs encounter strong coupling due to a vanishing propagation speed as $r \to 0$. In power-law NED and Born-Infeld theories with $\beta \neq 0$, the electric fields for singular BHs are regular near $r=0$, while the metric functions behave as $\propto r^{-1}$. Nevertheless, we show that Laplacian instabilities occur for regions inside the outer horizon $r_h$, unless the HVT coupling constant $\beta$ is significantly smaller than $r_h^2$. For $\beta \neq 0$, we also reconstruct the NED Lagrangian so that one of the metric functions takes the Reissner-Nordstr\"om form. In this case, there exists a branch where all squared propagation speeds are positive, but the ghost and strong coupling problems are present around the BH center. Thus, the dominance of the HVT coupling generally leads to BH instability in the high-curvature regime.</description>

      <title>Complete Classification of Domain Wall Solutions in the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric 2HDM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a complete classification of domain wall solutions in the two-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) with a global $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, categorised as superconducting, CP-violating, or neither, depending on the scalar particle masses and the ratio of the two Higgs doublets' vacuum expectation values. We demonstrate that any domain wall solution can be reduced to depend on only six of the eight general field components, with further field reductions possible within different regions of the parameter space. Furthermore, we show that the superconducting solutions can be used to construct stable, current-carrying domain walls in two spatial dimensions. Similarly, the CP-violating solutions allow for two-dimensional configurations where CP symmetry is locally broken on the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric wall, which could provide an out-of-equilibrium environment for CP-violating processes to occur.</description>

      <title>A non-inflationary solution to the monopole problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic monopoles are a long-standing prediction of Grand Unified Theories, yet their efficient production in early universe phase transitions would lead to a monopole abundance that far exceeds observational limits. The standard solution of the problem invokes inflation occurring after monopole production, diluting their density to undetectable levels and eliminating any possibility of present-day observation. Here, we propose an alternative solution based on the breaking, in the early universe prior to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, of the Weyl conformal symmetry of the gauge kinetic sector of the Lagrangian. This mechanism enhances monopole annihilation, thereby reducing their abundance to acceptable levels without requiring inflation. This scenario also predicts a residual flux of GUT monopoles potentially within the sensitivity of current and upcoming cosmic ray detectors, making their discovery possible in the near future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic fields in the universe potentially serve as a messenger of primordial physics. The observationally suggested intergalactic magnetic fields may be a relic of helical primordial $\mathrm{U}(1)_Y$ magnetic fields, which may also explain the origin of the baryon asymmetry of the universe. This scenario has been considered to be not viable, which we revisit as well as the baryon isocurvature problem for non-helical primordial $\mathrm{U}(1)_Y$ magnetic fields, based on the recent discussion on the hot electroweak theory. We find that maximally helical fields can be the origin of both the intergalactic magnetic fields and the baryon asymmetry of the universe and that there can be a window for non-helical fields to explain the origin of the intergalactic magnetic fields if the Higgs dynamics during the electroweak crossover compensate the helicity decay with a $\lesssim10^{-9\text{--}-10}$ precision.</description>

      <title>Aligned Hierarchical Black Hole Mergers in AGN disks revealed by GWTC-4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The active galactic nucleus (AGN) accretion disks are ideal sites for hierarchical black hole (BH) mergers. To robustly probe such a possibility, we analyze binary black hole mergers in the GWTC-4 with a flexible mixture population model for component masses, spin magnitudes, and spin tilt angles, and identify two distinct subpopulations. In the second subpopulation characterized by high spin magnitudes $\chi\sim 0.8$ as well as the broad mass distribution up to $\gtrsim 150M_\odot$, we find a pronounced preference for spins aligned with the orbital angular momentum: an isotropic tilt distribution is strongly disfavored (logarithmic Bayes factor = 4.5). The aligned events account for $\sim 0.57^{+0.23}_{-0.31}$ of the second subpopulation, corresponding to a local rate of $\sim 0.25^{+0.38}_{-0.16} ~ {\rm Gpc}^{-3} {\rm yr}^{-1}$ (all values reflect central 90\% credible intervals). These notable features naturally arise from hierarchical mergers embedded in AGN disks, where gas torques can effectively align spins. Our results identify AGN-disk hierarchical assembly as an important channel in the present gravitational-wave sample and provide concrete, testable predictions for future detection.</description>

Abstract: We investigate cosmological solutions for the modified gravity theory obtained from quantum relative entropy between the metric of spacetime and the metric induced by the geometry and matter fields. The vacuum equations admit inflationary solutions, hinting at an entropic origin for inflation. Equations also admit a regime of phantom like behavior. Assuming that the relation between slow roll parameters and CMB observables holds for entropic gravity, the theory predicts a viable spectrum.</description>

      <title>Far-infrared lines hidden in archival deep multi-wavelength surveys: Limits on [CII]-158$\mu$m at $z \sim 0.3-2.9$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Singly-ionized carbon is theorized to be the brightest emission line feature in star-forming galaxies, and hence an excellent tracer of the evolution of cosmic star formation. Archival maps from far-infrared and sub-millimeter surveys potentially contain the redshifted [CII]-158$\mu$m, hidden in the much brighter continuum emission. We present a search for aggregate [CII]-158$\mu$m line emission across the predicted peak of star formation history by tomographically stacking a high-completeness galaxy catalog on broadband deep maps of the COSMOS field and constraining residual excess emission after subtracting the continuum spectral energy distribution (SED).
  We obtain constraints on the sky-averaged [CII]-158$\mu$m signal from the three Herschel/SPIRE maps: $11.8\pm10.2$, $11.0\pm8.7$, $9.6\pm9.8$, and $9.2\pm6.6$ $k$Jy/sr at redshifts $z\sim 0.65$, $\sim1.3$, $\sim2.1$, and $\sim2.6$ respectively, corresponding to $1-1.4\sigma$ significance in each bin. Our $3\sigma$ upper limits are in tension with past $z\sim2.6$ results from cross-correlating SDSS-BOSS quasars with high-frequency Planck maps, and indicate a much less dramatic evolution ($\sim\times7.5$) of mean [CII] intensity across the peak of star formation history than collisional excitation models or frameworks calibrated to the tentative PlanckxBOSS measurement. We discuss this tension, particularly in the context of in-development surveys (TIM, EXCLAIM) that will map this [CII] at high redshift resolution. Having demonstrated stacking in broadband deep surveys as a complementary methodology to next-generation spectrometers for line intensity mapping, our novel methods can be extended to upcoming galaxy surveys such as Euclid, as well as to place upper limits on fainter atomic and molecular lines.</description>

Abstract: High-velocity collisions between gas-rich ultra-diffuse galaxies present a promising formation channel for baryon-dominated dwarf galaxies (BDDGs). Using hydrodynamical simulations, we show that the progenitors' baryonic binding energy, $|E_{\rm bind}|$, critically controls the outcome. Repeated potential fluctuations, e.g., from bursty feedback, inject energy and reduce $|E_{\rm bind}|$ by $\approx 15\%$, yielding fewer but substantially more massive BDDGs. By contrast, elastic self-interacting dark matter produces comparable cores without lowering $|E_{\rm bind}|$, resulting in negligible effect. This provides a novel way to distinguish between two leading galactic core formation channels, i.e., the baryon feedback and elastic dark matter self-interaction. Among 15 paired simulation runs, 13 show higher BDDG masses in the weakened-binding case, and about two thirds exhibit $&gt;100\%$ mass enhancements. The simulations also predict systematically lower gas fractions due to sustained post-collision star formation, yielding a clean observational signature. Upcoming wide-field imaging (CSST, LSST), HI surveys (FAST), and kinematic follow-up will be crucial to test this scenario.</description>

      <title>A Five-dimensional Kaluza-Klein Approach to Unimodular Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we present a possibility of imposing the unimodular condition within the 5-dimensional Kaluza-Klein theory including the scalar field. Unimodular gravity became an object of increasing interest in the late 80-ties; and was recently used in primordial Universe modeling with cosmological constant, in the context of the Brans-Dicke gravity including scalar field. A generalization of the unimodularity principle to the 5-dimensional Kaluza-Klein model was discussed in our recent paper, in which variational principle is formulated in 5 dimensions first, and dimensional reduction is applied to the resulting set of equations. A cosmological model based on these equations was then presented and discussed. Here we present further developments of this approach, focussing our attention at perturbative aspects and stability of solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological defects can have significant cosmological consequences, so their production must be examined carefully. It is usually assumed that topological defects are produced if the temperature becomes sufficiently high, but in reality their formation depends on the post-inflationary dynamics of a symmetry-breaking scalar. We analyze the dynamics of a symmetry-breaking scalar field in the early universe within models that provide an effective negative mass term at the origin, and show that the symmetry can remain broken so that topological defects are never formed. In particular, we demonstrate that nonthermally produced particles (such as the Standard Model Higgs) during preheating can generate such an effective negative mass term, allowing the scalar field to follow a time-dependent minimum even in renormalizable models with a quartic coupling. We also discuss the implications of this result for the Peccei-Quinn scalar in axion models.</description>

      <title>High Reheating Temperature without Axion Domain Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a cosmological scenario in which the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry remains broken in the entire history of the Universe, thereby avoiding the formation of axion strings and domain walls. Contrary to the conventional expectation, it is demonstrated that appropriately chosen scalar interactions are able to keep the PQ symmetry broken at arbitrarily high temperatures. We carefully examine the finite-temperature effective potential in a model with two PQ breaking scalar fields. The existence of flat directions plays a vital role in suppressing axion isocurvature perturbations during inflation by stabilizing a PQ field at a large field value. The viable parameter space consistent with theoretical and observational constraints is identified. Our scenario provides a minimal path for PQ symmetry breaking that addresses both the axion domain wall and isocurvature problems while permitting arbitrarily high reheating temperatures accommodating high-scale baryogenesis scenarios such as thermal leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>Vector dark matter production during inflation in the gradient-expansion formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A massive vector field is a highly promising candidate for dark matter in the universe. A salient property of dark matter is its negligible or null coupling to ordinary matter, with the exception of gravitational interaction. This poses a significant challenge in producing the requisite amount of dark particles through processes within the Standard Model. In this study, we examine the production of a vector field during inflation due to its direct interaction with the inflaton field through kinetic and axion-like couplings as well as the field-dependent mass. The gradient-expansion formalism, previously proposed for massless Abelian gauge fields, is extended to include the longitudinal polarization of a massive vector field. We derive a coupled system of equations of motion for a set of bilinear functions of the vector field. This enables us to address the nonlinear dynamics of inflationary vector field production, including backreaction on background evolution. To illustrate this point, we apply our general formalism to a low-mass vector field whose kinetic and mass terms are coupled to the inflaton via the Ratra-type exponential function. The present study investigates the production of its transverse and longitudinal polarization components in a benchmark inflationary model with a quadratic inflaton potential. It has been demonstrated that pure mass coupling is able to enhance only the longitudinal components. By turning on also the kinetic coupling, one can get different scenarios. As the coupling function decreases, the primary contribution to the energy density is derived from the transverse polarizations of the vector field. Conversely, for an increasing coupling function, the longitudinal component becomes increasingly significant and rapidly propels the system into the strong backreaction regime.</description>

      <title>Gravitational entropy of fluids with energy flux</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine gravitational entropy growth within the formalism of Clifton, Ellis and Tavakol (CET) applied to a class of spherically symmetric exact solutions whose source is a shear-free fluid with energy flux in a comoving frame. By considering these solutions as potential cosmological models, we update previous literature that considered them only as restricted toy models of radiating spheres collapsing in a Vaidya background. In the present paper we examine the integrability of the CET entropy form in connection with Einstein's equations in the fluid flow approach, proving as well that all expanding configurations comply with the growth of CET gravitational entropy. Finally, we examine the connection between the CET gravitational entropy and the notion of a gravitational ``arrow of time'' based on the ratio of Weyl to Ricci curvature. Some of the solutions also provide potentially useful and viable inhomogeneous generalizations of FLRW models, thus suggesting an appealing potential for applications to current cosmological research.</description>

      <title>V\textit{z}$-$GAL: Probing Cold Molecular Gas in Dusty Star-forming Galaxies at $\bf \textit{z}=1-6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first results of V\textit{z}-GAL, a high-redshift CO(\textit{J} = 1 $-$ 0) large survey with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, targeting 92 \textit{Herschel}-selected, infrared-luminous, dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs). This flux density-limited sample includes 106 DSFGs in total, along with 14 galaxies from a recent pilot study -- altogether doubling the to-date available high-redshift \coonezero observations. These sources cover redshifts 1 to 6 with available mid/high-\textit{J} CO transitions from the Northern Extended Millimeter Array \zgal survey. We detect \coonezero emission in 90/92 targets above signal-to-noise ratio of 2, while two DSFGs remain undetected. \vzgal also covers additional \cotwoone emission lines in 10 of these sources. We find gas masses of the entire \vzgal sample to be $\rm (\alpha_{CO}/{4.0}) \mu {M}_{\rm H_2}$ = $(2-20) \times {10}^{11}~\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, calibrated using \coonezero line luminosities. We confirm that these DSFGs -- with derived gas depletion timescales of $(50-600)$ Myr -- represent a heterogeneous population, potentially comprising both main-sequence galaxies and starbursts in the early Universe. Using \coonezero luminosities as an anchor, we robustly derive the CO brightness temperature ratios with a good statistical significance up to \textit{J} = 6. Our measurements reveal a broad range of gas excitation conditions across the \vzgal DSFGs. We also explore [CI](1$-$0)/CO(1$-$0) ratios in 23 \vzgal galaxies that have existing detections of atomic carbon ground-state emission, [CI](1$-$0), from the \zgal survey. Our results show similar [CI]/CO ratio values across cosmic time for starbursts and local star-forming galaxy populations, supporting the use of \cionezero as an alternative cold gas tracer.</description>

      <title>Defying eternal inflation in warm inflation with a negative running</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It was pointed out previously~\cite{Kinney:2014jya} that a sufficiently negative running of the spectral index of curvature perturbations from (ordinary i.e. cold) inflation is able to prevent eternal inflation from ever occurring. Here, we reevaluate those original results, but in the context of warm inflation, in which a substantial radiation component (produced by the inflaton) exists throughout the inflationary period.
  We demonstrate that the same general requirements found in the context of ordinary (cold) inflation also hold true in warm inflation; indeed an even tinier amount of negative running is sufficient to prevent eternal inflation. This is particularly pertinent, as models featuring negative running are more generic in warm inflation scenarios. Finally, the condition for the existence of eternal inflation in cold inflation -- that the curvature perturbation amplitude exceed unity on superhorizon scales -- becomes more restrictive in the case of warm inflation. The curvature perturbations must be even larger, i.e. even farther out on the potential, away from the part of the potential where observables, e.g. in the Cosmic Microwave Background, are produced.</description>

      <title>Constraining the nonstandard propagating gravitational waves in the cosmological background with GWTC-3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10031v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves (GWs) has opened a new window to test the fundamental nature of gravity. We present constraints on the nonstandard propagation of GWs using the spectral siren method applied to binary black hole (BBH) mergers from the third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-3). The spectral siren method exploits the redshift distribution of BBHs to probe the cosmic expansion history and break degeneracies between cosmology and modified gravity effects. We focus on the friction term $\nu$ in the nonstandard GW propagation equation, which characterizes the running of the Planck mass. Assuming the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, we find $\nu = 0.5^{+3.5}_{-2.6}$ (median and $90\%$ credible interval), improving upon previous constraints from the bright siren event GW170817 by an order of magnitude. This improvement is due to the higher redshifts of BBHs in GWTC-3, reaching up to $z \sim 1$. Our result suggests that the propagation of GWs is consistent with the predictions of general relativity, placing limits on modified gravity theories that predict a time-varying Planck mass. As the sensitivity of GW detectors improves, the spectral siren method will provide a powerful tool for testing gravity on cosmological scales and probing the physics of the early Universe.</description>

      <title>2D BAO vs 3D BAO: Hints for new physics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As next-generation telescopes and observational surveys continue to expand the boundaries of our understanding, tensions and discrepancies between observational datasets are becoming increasingly prominent. In this work, we focus on one such discrepancy: the differences between 2D and 3D Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements. Without extending beyond the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework, we systematically study and highlight this discrepancy in different parameter spaces. This work examines the constraints on fundamental cosmological parameters ($H_0$, $r_d$, $\Omega_m$) derived from Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) and Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa) data. By analyzing BAO observational datasets from two distinct methodologies (2D and 3D) alongside the Pantheon Plus SNIa sample, we identify a significant systematic difference: 2D BAO measurements consistently yield higher values of $hr_d$ compared to both 3D BAO and DESI analyses. While 2D BAO measurements appear to bridge the Hubble tension by simultaneously accommodating both a higher $H_0$ value (aligning with SH0ES) and a larger sound horizon $r_d$ (matching Planck), this apparent reconciliation comes at the cost of introducing tension with the well-constrained Planck measurement of $\Omega_{m0}h^2$. This behavior arises because of systematically higher values of the product $H_0r_d$ observed in 2D BAO analysis compared to 3D analyses. Therefore, given these systematic differences, we advocate for careful consideration when using 2D BAO measurements to address the Hubble tension, suggesting that understanding the origin of this 2D-3D discrepancy should be a priority for future investigations.</description>

      <title>Impact of Large-Scale Structure Systematics on Cosmological Parameter Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large near-future galaxy surveys offer sufficient statistical power to make our cosmology analyses data-driven, limited primarily by systematic errors. Understanding the impact of systematics is therefore critical. We perform an end-to-end analysis to investigate the impact of some of the systematics that affect large-scale structure studies by doing an inference analysis using simulated density maps with various systematics; these include systematics caused by photometric redshifts (photo-$z$s), Galactic dust, structure induced by the telescope observing strategy and observing conditions, and incomplete covariance matrices. Specifically, we consider the impacts of incorrect photo-$z$ distributions (photometric biases, scatter, outliers; spectroscopic calibration biases), dust map resolution, incorrect dust law, selecting none or only some contaminant templates for deprojection, and using a diagonal covariance matrix instead of a full one. We quantify the biases induced by these systematics on cosmological parameter estimation using tomographic galaxy angular power spectra, with a focus on identifying whether the maximum plausible level of each systematic has an adverse impact on the estimation of key cosmological parameters from a galaxy clustering analysis with Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We find photo-$z$ systematics to be the most pressing out of the systematics investigated, with spectroscopic calibration biases leading to the greatest adverse impact while helpfully being flagged by a high $\chi^2$ value for the best fit model. Larger-than-expected photo-$z$ scatter, on the other hand, has a significant impact without necessarily indicating a poor fit. In contrast, in the analysis framework used in this work, biases from observational systematics and incomplete covariance matrices are comfortably subdominant.</description>

Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) can form from gravitational collapse of large overdensities in the early Universe, giving rise to rich phenomena in astrophysics and cosmology. We develop a novel, general, and systematic method based on theory of density contrast peaks to calculate the abundance of PBHs for a broad power spectrum of curvature perturbations with Gaussian statistics. We introduce a window function to account for the relevant perturbation scales associated with PBHs of different masses, along with a filter function that removes unphysical contributions from super-horizon-scale overdensities. While some uncertainties remain due to the limited understanding of the nonlinear collapse process, our approach substantially reduces the discrepancy previously observed between peaks theory and the Press-Schechter formalism.</description>

Abstract: The cosmic neutrino background and other light relics leave distinct imprints in the cosmic microwave background anisotropies through their gravitational influence. Since neutrinos decoupled from the primordial plasma about one second after the big bang, they have been free-streaming through the universe. This induced a characteristic phase shift in the acoustic peaks as a unique signature. In this work, we constrain the free-streaming nature of these relativistic species and other light relics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics by establishing two complementary template-based approaches to robustly infer the size of this phase shift from the temperature and polarization power spectra. One template shifts the multipoles in these spectra, while the other novel template more fundamentally isolates the phase shift at the level of the underlying photon-baryon perturbations. Applying these methods to Planck data, we detect the neutrino-induced phase shift at about $10\sigma$ significance, which rises to roughly $14\sigma$ with additional data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope and the South Pole Telescope. We also infer that the data is consistent with the Standard Model prediction of three free-streaming neutrinos. In addition, we forecast the capabilities of future experiments which will enable significantly more precise phase-shift measurements, with the Simons Observatory and CMB-S4 reducing the $1\sigma$ uncertainties to roughly 4.3% and 2.5%, respectively. More generally, we establish a new analysis pipeline for the phase shift induced by neutrinos and other free-streaming dark radiation which additionally offers new avenues for exploring physics beyond the Standard Model in a signature-driven and model-agnostic way.</description>

      <title>Influence of finite-temperature effects on CMB power spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the implications of finite-temperature quantum field theory effects on cosmological parameters within the framework of the $\L$CDM model and its modification. By incorporating temperature-dependent corrections to the cosmological constant, we extend the standard cosmological model to include additional density parameters, $\Omega_{\L_2}$ and $\Omega_{\L_3}$, which arise from finite-T quantum gravitational effects. Using the Cosmic Linear Anisotropy Solving System (CLASS), we analyze the impact of these corrections on the cosmic microwave background power spectrum and compare the results with the Planck 2018 data. Through brute-force parameter scans and advanced machine learning techniques, including quartic regression, we demonstrate that the inclusion of $\Omega_{\L_2}$ and $\Omega_{\L_3}$ improves the model's predictive accuracy, achieving high $R^2$ values and low mean squared error. The present work paves the way for future research into higher-order corrections and enhanced computational methods for cosmological parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>SIDM Concerto: Compilation and Data Release of Self-interacting Dark Matter Zoom-in Simulations</title>

Abstract: We present SIDM Concerto: $14$ cosmological zoom-in simulations in cold dark matter (CDM) and self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) models based on the Symphony and Milky Way-est suites. SIDM Concerto includes one Large Magellanic Cloud-- (LMC-) mass system (host mass $\sim 10^{11}~M_{\mathrm{\odot}}$), two Milky Way (MW) analogs ($\sim 10^{12}~M_{\mathrm{\odot}}$), two group-mass hosts ($\sim 10^{13}~M_{\mathrm{\odot}}$), and one low-mass cluster ($\sim 10^{14}~M_{\mathrm{\odot}}$). Each host contains $\approx 2\times 10^7$ particles and is run in CDM and one or more strong, velocity-dependent SIDM models. Our analysis of SIDM (sub)halo populations over seven subhalo mass decades reveals that (1) the fraction of core-collapsed isolated halos and subhalos peaks at a maximum circular velocity corresponding to the transition of the SIDM cross section from a $v^{-4}$ to $v^0$ scaling; (2) SIDM subhalo mass functions are suppressed by $\approx 50\%$ relative to CDM in LMC, MW, and group-mass hosts but are consistent with CDM in the low-mass cluster host; (3) subhalos' inner density profile slopes, which are more diverse in SIDM than in CDM, are sensitive to both the amplitude and shape of the SIDM cross section. Our simulations provide a benchmark for testing SIDM predictions with astrophysical observations of field and satellite galaxies, strong lensing systems, and stellar streams.

      <title>Hint of $r\simeq 0.01$ after DESI DR2 ?</title>

Abstract: In the report by BICEP/Keck collaborations, the tensor-to-scalar ratio is $r_{0.05}&lt;0.036$ (95\% C.L.). However, recent datasets have preferred the evolving dark energy, which thus have significantly shifted the bestfit values of standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological parameters. In this paper, we perform the joint analysis of BICEP/Keck cosmic microwave background (CMB) B-mode data, latest DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillations and supernova data, combined with Planck PR3 and PR4 CMB data respectively, and find $r_{0.05}=0.0159^{+0.0057}_{-0.014}$ and $r_{0.05}=0.0164^{+0.0063}_{-0.014}$. The constraints on $r$ are further tightened compared to the result of BICEP/Keck collaborations. Though there might be still systematic uncertainties in B-mode measurements due to the foreground contamination, our work is to not say what the value of $r$ is, but present the state-of-the-art constraints on $r$ and emphasize that the detection for $r$ depends potentially on our insight into the dark universe, highlighting the important role of cosmological surveys in comprehending our very early universe.</description>

      <title>Testing the local supervoid solution to the Hubble tension with direct distance tracers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several observational studies suggest that the local few hundred Mpc around the Local Group are significantly underdense based on source number counts in redshift space across much of the electromagnetic spectrum, particularly in near-infrared galaxy counts. This ``Keenan--Barger--Cowie (KBC) void'', ``Local Hole'', or ``local supervoid'', would have significant ramifications for the Hubble tension by generating outflows that masquerade as an enhanced local expansion rate. We evaluate models for the KBC void capable of resolving the Hubble tension with a background Planck cosmology. We fit these models to direct distances from the Tully--Fisher catalogue of the CosmicFlows-4 compilation using a field-level forward model. Depending on the adopted void density profile, we find the derived velocity fields to prefer a void size of less than 70 Mpc, which is less than 10 per cent of the fiducial size found by Haslbauer et al. based on the KBC luminosity density data. The predicted local Hubble constant is $72.1^{+0.9}_{-0.8}$, $70.4^{+0.4}_{-0.4}$, or $70.2^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$ km/s/Mpc for an initial underdensity profile that is exponential, Gaussian, or Maxwell-Boltzmann, respectively. The latter two ameliorate the Hubble tension to within $3\sigma$ of the 4-anchor distance ladder approach of Breuval et al. giving $73.2 \pm 0.9$ km/s/Mpc. The exponential profile does achieve consistency with this measurement at just over $1\sigma$, but it is disfavoured by the Bayesian evidence. The preferred models produce bulk flow curves that disagree with recent estimates from CosmicFlows-4, despite the void models being flexible enough to match such estimates.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Group Spin Alignment with Cosmic Filament in the TNG Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the alignment between the spin vectors of galaxy groups and the axes of their nearest cosmic filaments using the TNG300-1 cosmological hydrodynamical simulation. By systematically analyzing a large sample of groups, we find a robust perpendicular alignment between group spin and filament orientation. Among all examined properties, only group mass and the distance to the nearest filament significantly affect the strength of this alignment: more massive groups and those closer to filaments exhibit a stronger perpendicular signal. In contrast, the alignment is largely insensitive to group richness, the stellar mass threshold used to select member galaxies, and redshift. We further quantify the bias introduced by using member galaxies as tracers of group spin, finding a typical misalignment angle of $\sim38^\circ$ between the spin measured from all dark matter particles and that inferred from member galaxies, independent of group richness or stellar mass cut. Our results provide a clear theoretical benchmark for interpreting observational measurements of spin-filament alignment and highlight the importance of considering group mass and environment. These findings help clarify the main factors influencing spin-filament alignment and provide useful context for future observational and theoretical studies of angular momentum in the cosmic web.</description>

      <title>Resistive Scaling in the Magnetic Helicity-Driven Inverse Cascade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inverse cascade in MHD turbulence plays a crucial role in various astrophysical processes such as galaxy cluster formation, solar and stellar dynamo mechanisms, and the evolution of primordial magnetic fields in the early universe. A standard numerical approach involves injecting magnetic helicity at intermediate length scales to generate a secondary, time-dependent spectral peak that gradually propagates toward larger scales. Previous simulations have already suggested a resistive dependence of inverse transfer rates and demonstrated the significant influence of magnetic helicity flux density $\epsilon_\mathrm{H}$ on this process. On dimensional grounds, we have $E_\mathrm{M}(k,t)=C_\mathrm{H} \epsilon_\mathrm{H}^{2/3} k^{-1}$ where $C_\mathrm{H}$ represents a potentially universal dimensionless coefficient analogous to the Kolmogorov constant. We present a summary of the 25 distinct simulations conducted with the \textsc{Pencil Code}, systematically varying the forcing wavenumber $k_\mathrm{f}$, magnetic Prandtl number $Pm$, grid resolution $N^3$, and Lundquist number $Lu$. We obtained $C_\mathrm{H}$ and corresponding error bars by calculating the compensated spectrum and investigated its dependence with $Lu$ and $k_\mathrm{f}$. For the $C_\mathrm{H}$ - $Lu$ relationship, we observe strong correlations with power-law exponents of 1 and 2/3. In contrast, we find no significant correlation between $C_\mathrm{H}$ and $k_\mathrm{f}$.</description>

      <title>Modified Cosmology or Modified Galaxy Astrophysics is Driving the z&gt;6 JWST Results? CMB Experiments can discover the Origin in Near Future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The massive and bright galaxies observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) at high redshifts ($z &gt; 6$) have challenged our understanding of the Universe. This may require revisiting the physics of galaxy formation and evolution, or modifying the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model to explain these observations, or both. We show that high-resolution CMB experiments such as the Simons Observatory (or CMB-S4) can measure smoking-gun signatures jointly in weak lensing and kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) power spectra, which can shed light on both these scenarios. An increase in the matter power spectrum at small scales will enhance the number density of dark matter halos at high redshifts, thereby increasing the galaxy formation rate. This will cause enhanced weak lensing signal from these redshifts and also lead to enhanced patchy-kSZ signal from the epoch of reionization. However, if only galaxy astrophysics is modified, without any modification in the matter power spectrum, then the patchy-kSZ signal gets altered, while the weak lensing signal remains nearly unaltered. We show that we can measure the modified astrophysical and cosmological scenarios at a statistical significance of $6.2\sigma$ (and $17.4\sigma$) from Simons Observatory (and CMB-S4), which will enable a conclusive understanding on what physical process is driving the high-redshift observations of JWST.</description>

      <title>Till the core collapses: the evolution and properties of self-interacting dark matter subhalos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09910v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the hottest questions in the cosmology of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) is whether scatterings can induce detectable core-collapse in halos by the present day. Because gravitational tides can accelerate core-collapse, the most promising targets to observe core-collapse are satellite galaxies and subhalo systems. However, simulating small subhalos is computationally intensive, especially when subhalos start to core-collapse. In this work, we present a hierarchical framework for simulating a population of SIDM subhalos, which reduces the computation time to linear order in the total number of subhalos. With this method, we simulate substructure lensing systems with multiple velocity-dependent SIDM models, and show how subhalo evolution depends on the SIDM model, subhalo mass and orbits. We find that an SIDM cross section of $\gtrsim 200$ cm$^2$/g at velocity scales relevant for subhalos' internal heat transfer is needed for a significant fraction of subhalos to core-collapse in a typical lens system at redshift $z=0.5$, and that core-collapse has unique observable features in lensing. We show quantitatively that core-collapse in subhalos is typically accelerated compared to field halos, except when the SIDM cross section is non-negligible ($\gtrsim \mathcal{O}(1)$ cm$^2$/g) at subhalos' orbital velocities, in which case evaporation by the host can delay core-collapse. This suggests that substructure lensing can be used to probe velocity-dependent SIDM models, especially if line-of-sight structures (field halos) can be distinguished from lens-plane subhalos. Intriguingly, we find that core-collapse in subhalos can explain the recently reported ultra-steep density profiles of substructures found by lensing with the \emph{Hubble Space Telescope}</description>

      <title>Minimal Dark Matter Freeze-in with Low Reheating Temperatures and Implications for Direct Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of the reheating temperature of the visible sector on the freeze-in dark matter (DM) benchmark model for direct detection experiments, where DM production is mediated by an ultralight dark photon. Here we consider a new regime for this benchmark: we take the initial temperature of the thermal Standard Model (SM) bath to be below the DM mass. The production rate from the SM bath is drastically reduced due to Boltzmann suppression, necessitating a significant increase in the portal coupling between DM and the SM to match the observed relic DM abundance. This enhancement in coupling strength increases the predicted DM-electron scattering cross section, making freeze-in DM more accessible to current direct detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Diversity and universality: evolution of dwarf galaxies with self-interacting dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14621v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter halos with self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) experience a unique evolutionary phenomenon, in that their central regions eventually collapse to high density through the runaway gravothermal process after initially forming a large and low-density core. When coupled with orbital evolution, this is expected to naturally produce a large diversity in dark-matter halos' inner mass distribution, potentially explaining the diversity problem of dwarf galaxies. However, it remains unknown how the diversity in SIDM dark-matter halos propagates to the more easily observed luminous matter at the center of the halo, especially the stellar component. In this work, we use idealized N-body simulations with two species of particles (dark matter and stars) to study the response of the stellar properties of field and satellite dwarf galaxies to SIDM evolution and orbital effects on their halos. Galaxies' stellar components, including galaxy size, mass-to-light ratio, and stellar velocity dispersion, display a much larger scatter in SIDM than the standard cold dark matter (CDM) model. Importantly, we find signs of universality in the evolution pathways, or "tidal tracks", of SIDM dwarf satellites, which are physically interpretable and potentially parameterizable. This type of tidal-track model can be layered onto larger-scale, cosmological simulations to reconstruct the evolution of populations of SIDM dwarfs in cases where high-resolution simulations of galaxies are otherwise prohibitively expensive.</description>

      <title>Resonant Locking Between Binary Systems Induced by Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01733v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interaction of gravitational waves (GWs) with matter is thought to be typically negligible in the Universe. We identify an exception in the case of resonant interactions, where GWs emitted by a background binary system, such as an inspiraling supermassive black hole (SMBH) binary, cause a resonant response in a stellar-mass foreground binary and the frequencies of the two systems become, and remain, synchronized. We point out that this previously unexplored dynamical phenomenon is not only possible, but can lead to $\mathcal{O}(30)$ binary systems becoming resonantly locked in the host galaxy of merging SMBHs of mass $10^{8.5-11}\Msun$, each of which has a significantly reduced merger time. We predict $\mathcal{O}(10^{10})$ binary systems have been locked in the Universe's history. Resonant locking could be detected through anomalous inspiral of binary systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Leptophilic sub-MeV spin-zero dark matter (DM) decays into photons via one-loop processes, a scenario that has been in part overlooked in current literature. In this work, we provide updated and comprehensive upper limits on scalar, pseudo-scalar, and axion-like DM-electron couplings based on the latest NPIPE cosmic microwave background data from Planck. Our bounds on the couplings are not only competitive with astrophysical and terrestrial experiments, but outperform them in certain regions of parameter space. Notably, we present the most stringent limits to date on scalar DM with masses around a few keV and pseudo-scalar DM with masses between 100 eV and a few keV. Additionally, we explore, for the first time, the impact of implementing a cosmology-consistent treatment of energy deposition into the cosmic medium.</description>

Abstract: In this work we construct a formalism that can reveal the general characteristics of classes of viable $F(R)$ inflationary theories. The assumptions we make is that the slow-roll era occurs, and that the de Sitter scalaron mass $m^2(R)$ of the $F(R)$ gravity is positive or zero, for both the inflationary and late-time quasi de Sitter eras, a necessary condition for the stability of the de Sitter spacetime. In addition, we require that the de Sitter scalaron mass is also a monotonically increasing function of the Ricci scalar, or it has an extremum. Also the $F(R)$ gravity function is required to depend on the two known fundamental scales in cosmology, the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ and the mass scale $m_s^2=\frac{\kappa^2 \rho_m^{(0)}}{3}$, with $\rho_m^{(0)}$ denoting the energy density of the cold dark matter at the present epoch, that is $F(R)=F(R,\Lambda,m_s^2)$. Using these general assumptions we provide the general features of viable classes of $F(R)$ gravity inflationary theories which remarkably can also simultaneously describe successfully the dark energy era. This unique feature of a unified description of the dark energy and inflationary eras stems from the requirement of the monotonicity of the de Sitter scalaron mass $m^2(R)$. These viable classes are either deformations of the $R^2$ model or $\alpha$-attractors type theories. The analysis of the viability of a general $F(R)$ gravity inflationary theory is reduced in evaluating the parameter $x=\frac{R F_{RRR}}{F_{RR}}$ and the first slow-roll index of the theory, either numerically or approximately. We also disentangle the power-law $F(R)$ gravities from power-law evolution.</description>

      <title>Constraining the environment of compact binary mergers with self-lensing signatures</title>

Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) from coalescing binary black holes (BBHs) can come from different environments. GWs interact gravitationally with astrophysical objects, which makes it possible to use gravitational lensing by objects in the same gravitational system (self-lensing) to learn about their environments. We quantify the probability of self-lensing through the optical depth $\tau$ for the main channels of detectable GWs at frequencies $f_{\rm GW}\sim (1-10^3)\,{\rm Hz}$. We then analyze the detectability of the lensing effect (imprint). In star clusters, the probability of self-lensing by stellar-mass black holes (BHs) is low, $\tau\simeq10^{-7}$, even when taking into account nearby BHs in resonant interactions, $\tau\simeq 10^{-5}$. Additionally, the lensing imprint of a stellar-mass lens (diffraction and interference) is too marginal to be detectable by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detectors and most Einstein Telescope signals. For a massive BH lens in the center of a cluster, the probability can reach $\tau\simeq 10^{-4}$ either via von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai induced mergers of BBHs orbiting a central massive BH, or BBHs formed as GW captures in single-single interactions in the Bahcall-Wolf cusp of a nuclear cluster. For self-lensing by a supermassive BH for BBHs in the migration trap of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) disk, $\tau \simeq 10^{-2}$. The imprint of these massive lenses are multiple images that are already detectable. Moreover, self-lensed signals from AGN disks have a distinct linear polarization. The probability depends on the extent of the detectability through the threshold impact parameter $y_{\rm max}$, which can increase for future detectors. We conclude that constraining the environment of BBHs is possible by combining self-lensing imprints with other waveform signatures such as eccentricity and polarization.</description>

      <title>Thermal Gravitons from Warm Inflation</title>

Abstract: In warm inflation (WI), the persistent thermal bath that is sustained by dissipative interactions with the inflaton field produces a stochastic background of gravitational waves (GWs). In this paper we study the production and evolution of these GWs. Specifically, we investigate the emission of thermal gravitons (gravitons emitted by a thermal bath) from particle scattering in the bath and the evolution of the corresponding GWs. We find that the bulk of thermal graviton production in WI occurs during the transition to radiation domination after inflation. Further, the energy density of thermal gravitons is enhanced by roughly one to two orders of magnitude compared to that in a radiation-dominated scenario with the same reheating temperature. We also calculate the spectrum of the resulting stochastic GW background and find that it has a distinctive shape, consisting of a peak at high frequencies ~100 GHz and an almost flat spectrum extending to low frequencies. The peak arises from emission of sub-horizon modes that follow the temperature of the bath. The flat part of the spectrum corresponds to the modes that exit the horizon during WI and re-enter during radiation domination. We show that the detection prospects for the high-frequency peak of the GW spectrum, while improved slightly compared to the radiation-dominated case, still remain challenging. The thermal spectrum's low-frequency plateau is typically subdominant to the amplitude of the standard vacuum tensor modes from inflation, although WI models can exist where the thermal graviton plateau surpasses the vacuum contribution without exceeding current observational limits on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. Furthermore, we calculate the thermal graviton contribution from WI to dark radiation and show that WI models are generally expected to satisfy current observational bounds, including those from the cosmic microwave background.</description>

      <title>Attenuation of the ultra-high-energy neutrino flux by dark matter scatterings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A flux of ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrinos, produced by astrophysical sources at cosmological distances, is anticipated to exist and reach Earth. In this paper, we investigate the impact on the total flux, energy spectrum, and arrival directions of UHE neutrinos of neutrino-dark matter (DM) scatterings. We study scatterings both in the intergalactic medium and in the Milky Way. We emphasize the complementarity among neutrino detectors at different latitudes, that can probe anisotropies induced by neutrinos scattering with the Milky Way DM halo. We also discuss that, with mild astrophysical assumptions, limits on the DM-$\nu$ scattering cross section can be placed even if the neutrino sources are unknown. Finally, we explore all this phenomenology with the recent UHE neutrino event KM3230213A, and place the corresponding limits on the DM-$\nu$ scattering cross section.</description>

      <title>Capturing System Drift with Time Series Calibration for Global 21-cm Cosmology Experiments</title>

Abstract: To achieve the sensitivity required to detect signals from neutral hydrogen from the Cosmic Dawn and Epoch of Reionisation it is critical to have a well-calibrated instrument which has a stable calibration over the course of the observation. Previous calibration methods do not explicitly use the time information available and make assumptions on the impedance matching of the reference sources. Here we present a new calibration method based on noise wave parameters which fits a calibration solution over time and frequency to the data, interpolating the solutions to the times at which the antenna is being measured. To test this method we simulate a dataset using measurements of the REACH receiver, modelling a low noise amplifier which is drifting over time. Fitting a polynomial surface in frequency and time to the simulated data demonstrates that we can remove the drift in the calibrated solution over time but leaves a chromatic residual. We further show that we can remove assumptions on the reflection coefficients of the reference noise source and the cold load, reducing degeneracies in the parameter fits. Applying this new calibration equation and surface fitting method to the simulated data removes the chromatic residual in the calibrated spectrum and recovers the parameters to within 0.06% of the truth and a 97% reduction in the RMSE of the spectrum of the validation source compared with previous calibration methods. For two parameters we report up to six times smaller fit error after the degeneracies are removed from the time-based calibration.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of Weak Interactions in Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weak interactions cause small parity-violating energy differences between left- and right-handed chiral systems. Although normally tiny, these effects may be significantly enhanced during collective phenomena such as phase transitions. We propose a theoretical model describing the enhancement of weak interactions in phase transitions. The enhancement factor is proportional to the critical number of atoms, $N_c$, in the nucleus of the new phase. After the nucleus reaches its critical size, it grows until it fills the entire system. Measurement of the ratio of produced left and right chiral structures may provide a way to measure this critical number $N_c$. Experiments where definite spin-chiral structures are formed during a phase transition in crossed electric and magnetic fields, indicate $N_c \sim 10^9 - 10^{10}$. An open question is whether a similar enhancement could operate during cosmological phase transitions - thereby boosting CP-violating effects sufficiently to contribute to the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry (baryogenesis).</description>
