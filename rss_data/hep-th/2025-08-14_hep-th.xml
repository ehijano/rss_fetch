      <title>A Carroll Limit of AdS/CFT: A Triality with Flat Space Holography?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a novel holographic duality by taking a Carrollian limit of the AdS/CFT correspondence, relating string theory in a Carroll bulk geometry to a Carroll $\mathcal{N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills theory. We further propose the existence of an underlying triality connecting Carroll string theory, relativistic string theory in flat spacetime, and Carroll gauge theory. Finally, we analyse the symmetries of the Carroll gauge theory, showing that they are non-linearly realised and do not close under ordinary Lie brackets.</description>

      <title>$c_\text{eff}$ from Surgery and Modularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\widehat{Z}$ invariants, rigorously defined for negative definite plumbed 3-manifolds, are expected--on physical grounds--to exist for every closed, oriented 3-manifold. Several prescriptions have been proposed to extend their definition to generic plumbings by reversing the orientation of a negative definite plumbing, thus turning it into a positive definite one. Two existing proposals are relevant for this paper: (i) the regularized $+1/r$-surgery conjecture combined with the false-mock modular conjecture, and (ii) a construction based on resurgence and a false theta function duality. In this note, we compare these proposals on the class of Brieskorn homology spheres $\Sigma\left(s,t,rst\pm1\right)$ and find that they are incompatible in general. Our diagnostic is the effective central charge, $c_{\text{eff}}$, which governs the asymptotic growth of coefficients of $\widehat{Z}$. First, we prove that the upper bound on $c_{\text{eff}}$ from prescription (i) is governed by the Ramanujan theta function, which regularizes the surgery formula. Second, we develop numerical and modular tools that deliver the lower bounds as well as exact values via mixed mock-modular analysis. Complementing this, we also study $c_{\text{eff}}$ for negative definite plumbed 3-manifolds which allow for a better comparison of pairs of 3-manifolds related by orientation reversal. As a result, we find that for some Brieskorn spheres the surgery and false-mock prescriptions violate the expected relation between $c_{\text{eff}}$, Chern-Simons invariants and non-abelian flat connections. These findings underscore $\widehat{Z}$ as a sensitive probe of the "positive side" of $\widehat{Z}$-theory.</description>

      <title>De Sitter Complexity Grows Linearly in the Static Patch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observable universe has undergone periods of expansion that are well approximated by de Sitter (dS) space. Still lacking is a quantum mechanical description of dS, both globally and when restricted to the static patch. We develop a novel prescription for computing holographic complexity in the dS static patch to determine its microscopic features. Specifically, we propose that the natural candidate for dS complexity is the volume of extremal timelike surfaces restricted to the static patch, anchored to the cosmological horizon or an observer worldline. Our anchoring prescription provides a clear definition of a reference state, overcoming a common ambiguity in prior definitions of de Sitter holographic complexity. The late-time growth of our complexity functional is linear and proportional to the number of degrees of freedom associated to the cosmological horizon, and therefore does not exhibit hyperfast growth. Our results imply the dS static patch is characterized by a quantum mechanical system, with a finite dimensional Hilbert space whose evolution is governed by a chaotic Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>$c_{\rm eff}$ from Resurgence at the Stokes Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent papers [1,2], a new method to cross the natural boundary has been proposed, and applied to Mordell-Borel integrals arising in the study of Chern-Simons theory, based on decompositions into {\it resurgent cyclic orbits}. Resurgent analysis on the Stokes line leads to a unique transseries decomposition in terms of unary false theta functions, which can be continued across the natural boundary to produce dual $q$-series whose integer-valued coefficients enumerate BPS states. This constitutes a deeper new manifestation of resurgence in quantum field theoretic path integrals. In this paper we show that the algebraic structure of the {\it resurgent cyclic orbits}, combined with just the leading term of the $q$-series, completely determines the large order rate of growth of the dual $q$-series coefficients. The essential exponent of this asymptotic growth has a Cardy-like interpretation [10] of an effective central charge in a 3 dimensional quantum field theory with $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry related to the Chern-Simons theory through the $3d$-$3d$ correspondence.</description>

      <title>Type IIA supergravity at one loop: $\alpha'^3$ terms in the metric-dilaton-RR one-form sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The circle compactification of M-theory is dual to type IIA string theory, requiring that the dimensional reduction of the M-theory couplings \((t_8 t_8 - \frac{1}{4} \epsilon_8 \epsilon_8) R^4\) must reproduce the type IIA one-loop effective action at order \(\alpha'^3\), including contributions from the metric, dilaton, and RR one-form. Through compactification, we obtain 1,276 couplings involving Riemann, Ricci, and Ricci scalar tensors, along with first and second derivatives of the dilaton and RR one-form. By employing field redefinitions, we reduce these to a basis of 359 independent couplings. Crucially, we observe that the dilaton cannot be entirely removed from the couplings via field redefinitions, even in the pure metric-dilaton sector. We validate our results by showing exact agreement between all four-field couplings and the corresponding string-theory S-matrix elements in the string frame.
  Further, upon compactifying on K3, we demonstrate that the resulting six-dimensional \(\alpha'\) couplings at one-loop level transform under S-duality into the tree-level \(\alpha'\) couplings of heterotic string theory on \(T^4\). This match necessitates carefully chosen field redefinitions for both the type IIA (on K3) and heterotic (on \(T^4\)) sectors, providing a stringent test of the duality.</description>

      <title>Momentum expansions in finite-density perturbative calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex-valued Feynman integrals in the imaginary time formalism and zero-temperature limit suffer from particular types of infrared divergences that can not be regulated by integration dimension alone. Related problems leading to integration order dependent results are even further pronounced in the presence of additional scales such as external momenta. This plays a noticeable role in systems featuring fermionic degrees of freedom such as cold Quantum Chromodynamics, where loop integrals are complexified by chemical potential(s). Working in the limit of vanishing temperature, we utilize novel complex-valued extensions to bubble Feynman integrals and study momentum expansions of fermionic loop integrals. The expansions are then used to illustrate the mechanisms of manifested discrepancies between orders of integration, associated with the residue theorem. Finally, we address the issues by introducing a representation avoiding the observed ambiguity and briefly overview classes of integrals insensitive to problems from external momenta.</description>

      <title>Unexpected Symmetries of Kerr Black Hole Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent introduction of the Dirac bracket framework to compute spinning observables for the scattering of Kerr black holes, we initiate the study of conserved quantities from an on-shell amplitude perspective. We establish new results for the conservation of energy, angular momentum, the R\"udiger invariant and the quadrupolar Carter constant using the spinning radial action extracted from the literature both in the probe limit and beyond, up to third post-Minkowskian order in the conservative sector. Furthermore, we offer a new perspective on the spin-shift symmetry of the radial action, clarifying its role in the dynamics. Finally, we define a new on-shell notion of asymptotic integrability in the Liouville sense and present strong evidence that it is surprisingly satisfied by a spinning probe in Kerr up to quartic order in the probe spin, to all orders in the post-Minkowskian expansion. We further establish integrability beyond the probe limit at low PM orders. Our results suggest important new implications for the dynamics of Kerr black holes.</description>

      <title>Statistics in 3d gravity from knots and links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been remarkable progress in evaluating wormhole amplitudes in 3d Einstein gravity with negative cosmological constant and matching them to statistics of 2d CFT data. In this work, we compute non-perturbative Gaussian and non-Gaussian gravitational contributions to the OPE statistics using a framework that can systematically generate a class of such non-perturbative effects - \textit{Fragmentation of knots and links by Wilson lines}. We illustrate this idea by constructing multi-boundary wormholes from fragmentation diagrams of prime knots and links with upto five crossings. We discuss fragmentations of hyperbolic knots and links like the figure-eight knot, the three-twist knot and the Whitehead link; and non-hyperbolic ones like the Hopf link, the trefoil knot, the Solomon's knot and the Cinquefoil knot. Using Virasoro TQFT, we show how the partition functions on wormholes constructed from different fragmentations of the same knot or link are closely related. Using these fragmentations, we compute gravitational contributions to the variance, a two-point non-Gaussianity, two structures of four-point non-Gaussianities called the `pillow contraction' and the `$6j$-contraction', and some six-point non-Gaussianities. We also check the consistency of some of these non-Gaussianities with the extended Gaussian ensemble of OPE data that incorporates the Gaussian corrections to the variance from knots.</description>

      <title>Effects of light-mass fermionic dark matter on the equilibrium and stability of white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: White dwarfs (WDs) can be used as laboratories to test strong gravity and high-density regimes, once their equation of state is not so uncertain as the one of neutron stars. This makes them also a useful tool to constrain dark-matter models. In this work, we study dark matter white dwarfs (DMWD) composed of white dwarf matter admixed with fermionic dark matter in a two-fluid general relativistic framework. Dark matter particles are considered to have masses between $0.1-10$ GeV. The equilibrium configurations and stability are derived, showing that the DMWD can be more compact, with masses around 1.3 $M\odot$ and radii around 500 km. The increasing compactness leads to changes in the fundamental modes of radial oscillations ($\sim20\%$ for 0.1 GeV DM), which produce detectable shifts in GW frequencies. The interplay between dark matter and normal matter thus provides a compelling avenue for interpreting deviations in observed WD properties and for placing constraints on DM characteristics through astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Corrected Deformation of RN-AdS Black Holes with a Cloud of Strings Immersed in Quintessential-like Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG), we investigate the Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) black hole (BH) solution coupled with a cloud of strings in an anti-de Sitter (AdS) background, surrounded by a quintessence-like fluid. We begin by analyzing the optical properties of the BH through null geodesic motion, deriving an effective potential that governs photon dynamics. This effective potential is central to understanding key phenomena such as photon trajectories, circular null orbits, photon sphere, and the resulting BH shadow. Subsequently, we study the dynamics of neutral test particles by deriving effective potential that describes their motion. Using the potential, we compute the specific energy and specific angular momentum of neutral particles in circular orbits around the BH and analyze the outcomes. We also investigate the innermost stable circular orbits (ISCO) and demonstrate how various geometrical and physical properties influence the radius of ISCO. Furthermore, we explore the thermodynamic properties of the BH solution by deriving key quantities such as the Hawking temperature, entropy, Gibbs free energy, internal energy, and specific heat capacity. Throughout the study, we demonstrate that the geodesic structure, scalar field behavior, and thermodynamic properties are significantly influenced by parameters such as the string cloud, quantum correction, electric charge, the surrounding quintessence-like fluid, and the AdS curvature radius.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole Formation and Spin in Matter Domination Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we calculate the mass distribution of primordial black holes (PBHs) formed in the matter-dominated (MD) era by the peak theory. We apply the Zel'dovich approximation to track the nonlinear evolution of overdensities and compute the PBH abundance and mass function by incorporating a PBH formation criterion based on the hoop conjecture. We find that the PBH abundance $\beta$ follows the scaling law $\beta \simeq A_\gamma \sigma_h^{*5}$ for $\sigma_h^*\ll 1$. Here, $\sigma_h^*$ is the quantity that characterizes the variance of the density fluctuation at the horizon entry. We also find that, in contrast to the previous estimates, the PBH spin is very small for $\sigma_h^*\ll 1$ but could be larger for larger $\sigma_h^*$ and broader power spectra. Finally, specializing to a monochromatic power spectrum, we prove analytically that the PBH mass distribution becomes effectively monochromatic and reveal that the resultant PBH abundance is approximately 19 times the previous prediction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Van der Waals potentials describing interactions between color-singlet mesons and/or baryons vanish at leading order in potential nonrelativistic quantum chromodynamics (pNRQCD). This result and constraints from Gauss's law are used to prove that weakly-coupled pNRQCD van der Waals potentials in generic non-Abelian gauge theories with only heavy quarks are too weak to form bound states whose color state is a product of color-singlets. Quantum Monte Carlo calculations of four, five, and six quarks with equal masses provide numerical evidence that exotic color configurations are higher energy than products of color-singlet hadrons, suggesting that equal-mass fully-heavy tetraquark, pentaquark, and hexaquark bound states do not exist at next-to-leading order in pNRQCD and at all orders in QCD-like theories in which all quark masses are asymptotically large. Mechanisms for generating hadron-hadron bound states are identified, which necessarily involve large quark-mass hierarchies, relativistic effects arising from the presence of sufficiently light quarks, or nonperturbative effects outside the scope of weakly-coupled pNRQCD.</description>

      <title>A Prediction for Maximum Supercooling in SU(N) Confinement Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermal confinement phase transition (PT) in $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory is first-order for $N\geq 3$, with bounce action scaling as $N^2$. Remarkably, lattice data for the action include a small coefficient whose presence likely strongly alters the PT dynamics. We give evidence, utilizing insights from softly-broken SUSY YM models, that the small coefficient originates from a deconfined phase instability just below the critical temperature. We predict the maximum achievable supercooling in $SU(N)$ theories to be a few percent, which can be tested on the lattice. We briefly discuss the potentially significant suppression of the associated cosmological gravitational wave signals.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Quantization of Electrodynamics and Linearized Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified stochastic framework in which a velocity- and helicity-reversing Poisson process gives rise to the Telegrapher's equation. Analytic continuation to the complex plane results in Dirac-like evolution equations for electromagnetic and linearized gravitational fields. A small but nonzero mass parameter is essential to enable helicity reversals. Yet, the correct massless wave equations are recovered as the physically relevant massless limit is approached smoothly, with the singular point excluded from the construction. Remarkably, probability does not enter as an external postulate as in the Born rule in standard quantum mechanics -- but is intrinsic to the stochastic process. This probabilistic structure becomes embedded in the wave fields through a natural rescaling by the Planck length.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a three variable series invariant $F_K (y,z,q)$ for plumbed knot complements associated with a Lie superalgebra $sl(2|1)$. The invariant is a generalization of the $sl(2|1)$-series invariant $\hat{Z}(q)$ for closed 3-manifolds introduced by Ferrari and Putrov and an extension of the two variable series invariant defined by Gukov and Manolescu (GM) to the Lie superalgebra. We derive a surgery formula relating $F_K (y,z,q)$ to $\hat{Z}(q)$ invariant. We find appropriate expansion chambers for certain infinite families of torus knots and compute explicit examples. Furthermore, we provide evidence for a non semisimple $Spin^c$ decorated TQFT from the three variable series. We observe that the super $F_K (y,z,q)$ itself and its results exhibit distinctive features compared to the GM series.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Evolving Dark Energy from LRG1 and Low-$z$ SNe Ia Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present observational evidences indicating that dark energy may be evolving with time, thereby challenging the core assumptions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Our investigation extends beyond the standard $\Lambda$CDM model by exploring a range of dynamical dark energy models. The analysis reveals that the matter density parameter, $\Omega_m$, changes with redshift, and this change is significantly influenced by the LRG1 datapoint from the DESI DR2 survey. We find that including LRG1 strongly affects the predictions of these models, especially for $\Omega_m$ and $\omega_0$, with the latter shifting from $-1$ to slightly higher values. This suggests that the evidence of evolving dark energy in the DESI DR2 data is driven by the LRG1 datapoint. When we exclude low-redshift supernovae data, particularly from the DES-SN5YR compilation, the model predictions are restored to the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. This effect is particularly evident in the GEDE model, where removing low-redshift supernovae data leads to $\Delta = 0$, effectively recovering $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. Our analysis confirms that the evidence for dynamical dark energy is substantial, particularly at low redshift ($z \lesssim 0.3$). The reconstruction of $\omega(z)$ and $f_{DE}(z)$, using a combination of DESI DR2 BAO measurements, CMB distance priors, and supernovae datasets, further supports the evolving nature dark energy. These results favor a dynamical dark-energy scenario characterized by $\omega_0&gt;-1$, $\omega_a&lt;0$, and $\omega_0+\omega_a&lt;-1$ (Quintom-B). Bayesian analysis of model evidence reveals that the inclusion of low-redshift supernovae data significantly strengthens the support for evolving dark energy models such as JBP and Mirage, while models revert to inconclusive or weak support when low-redshift data are excluded.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The latest observational data of Planck satellite shows nontrivial value of polarization rotation angle caused by cosmic birefringence in the early universe. Moreover, the asymmetry of baryons versus anti-baryons still remains mysterious. Both of them indicates that there should be hidden new physics such as fundamental symmetry breaking. In this paper, we try to interpret these two events in framework of nonmetricity modified gravity. We introduce an interaction term between nonmetricity-based function and matter current, and calculate both the rotation angle and baryon-to-photon ratio. We also constrain the model parameters using the current observational data. With some specific examples, we demonstrate that in nonmetricity gravity theory, these two events can be interpreted in a unified way.</description>

Abstract: We apply the general construction of a twist of bigraded Hopf algebras by skew bicharacters to obtain two-parameter quantum groups in the Drinfeld-Jimbo, new Drinfeld (for affine types), and FRT (for both finite and affine) presentations from their standard one-parameter versions. This yields new elementary proofs of the fundamental results on two-parameter quantum groups that appeared in the literature over the last two decades, and also leads to natural generalizations in the super and multiparameter cases.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Weyl-Einsteinian-Cubic Gravity as a Gauge Theory of Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a Weyl-Einsteinian-Cubic Gravity (ECG) as a cubic gauge theory of gravity via abelian gauge and properly tuned compensating real scalar fields. The model is free from any dimensionful parameters. The bare ECG emerges as the lower energy limit of the Weyl-ECG in the local {\it non}-conformal-invariant vacua (i.e., broken phase) in the maximally symmetric spacetimes fixing the vacuum expectation value of the scalar field to the Planck mass scale. Here, the natural presence of (anti-) de Sitter backgrounds spontaneously breaks Weyl's local conformal symmetry akin to the Higgs mechanism, while it is radiatively broken at the renormalization scale at the one-loop level in flat vacua through the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism. The model allows anti-de Sitter and flat spaces but does not allow de Sitter to be vacuum spacetime solutions. The properties of the model deserve further exploration, specifically, those of nonperturbative (e.g., instantons and/or anti-instantons) contributions, for example, in the resurgence or tachyon condensation context requires detailed study.</description>

Abstract: Quantum field theory on two- and three-dimensional fuzzy anti-de Sitter spaces is introduced and studied. We find a complete set of solutions to the fuzzy Klein-Gordon equation and identify the commutative limit in which they reduce to classical scalar field modes. After introducing the noncommutative boundary via semi-classical states, the fuzzy modes are used to obtain the boundary two-point function. In both two and three dimensions, this gives an interesting two-parameter deformation of the conformal two-point function. For the fuzzy AdS$_2$, the two-point function is given explicitly in terms of the Appell function $F_1$.</description>

      <title>Topological invariant for holographic Weyl-$\mathrm Z_2$ semimetal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12791v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The occurrence of a topological phase transition can be demonstrated by a direct observation of a change in the topological invariant. For holographic topological semimetals, a topological Hamiltonian method needs to be employed to calculate the topological invariants due to the strong coupling nature of the system. We calculate the topological invariants for the holographic Weyl semimetal and the holographic Weyl-$\mathrm Z_2$ semimetal, which correspond to the chiral charge and the spin-Chern number, respectively. This is achieved by probing fermions within the system and deriving the topological Hamiltonian from the zero-frequency Green's function. In both cases, we have identified an effective band structure characterized by an infinite number of Weyl or $\mathrm Z_2$ nodes, a distinctive feature of holographic systems different from weakly coupled systems. The topological invariants of these nodes are computed numerically and found to be nonzero, thereby confirming the topologically nontrivial nature of these nodes.</description>

      <title>Solving 1D crossing and QFT$_2$/CFT$_1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide an effective solution of the 1D crossing equation. We begin by arguing that crossing constraints can be recast in terms of bases of sum rules associated to special sets of CFT data -- extremal solutions -- which solve these constraints in a minimal way and naturally saturate positivity bounds on the space of CFTs. We conjecture, argue and check extensively that any extremal solution behaves as a generalized free field in the UV. This allows us to reconstruct the entirety of their CFT data using a rapidly convergent ``hybrid bootstrap'' method, which combines numerics and analytics. Strikingly, as we approach special corners in the space of extremal solutions we find that their CFT data can present non-trivial structure up to arbitrarily large energies. We interpret these corners as flat space limits of QFTs in AdS$_2$, which extremal solutions naturally describe. This picture allows us to bootstrap their CFT data in these limits in terms of 2d S-matrices, and conversely provide a microscopic CFT construction of the latter. Further evidence for this QFT in AdS description of extremal solutions comes from an explicit construction of bulk QFT operators solving an AdS locality problem. Concretly we show that it is possible to canonically associate one or more such operators to any extremal solution by explicitly solving for their BOE data. In the special case where this operator is the bulk stress-tensor we combine crossing and bulk locality constraints to derive stronger bounds on the OPE and BOE data, including an exact bootstrap lower bound on the central charge $C_T\geq 1/2$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometric Phases as a New Window on Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05881v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate how low-frequency gravitational waves (LFGWs), originating from distant astrophysical or cosmological sources, can induce purely quantum geometric phases in mesoscopic optomechanical systems. These phases represent subtle imprints with no classical counterpart, going beyond standard dynamical or Berry-type contributions that admit Hannay-angle analogues. Such ultra-weak waves couple to the motion of a mechanical mirror and generate distinctive phase shifts in the system's quantum state that cannot arise in any classical description. To access this effect, we propose a Ramsey-type interferometric protocol in which the photon-number states of a quantized optical mode become entangled with the mirror's center-of-mass motion, enabling a direct readout of the LFGW-induced geometric phase. This framework establishes a distinctly quantum approach for probing low-frequency gravitational wave modes, offering an alternative to conventional detection strategies based on spacetime strain.</description>

      <title>Exact Sum Rules and Zeta Generating Formulas from the ODE/IM correspondence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate exact sum rules (ESRs) and zeta generating formulas (ZGFs) for quantum mechanics defined by the ${\cal PT}$-symmetric potential $V_{\cal PT}(x) = x^{2K} (ix)^\varepsilon$ with $K,\varepsilon \in \mathbb{N}$, as well as the Hermitian potential $V_{\cal H}(x) = x^{2 K}$ with $K \in {\mathbb N} + 1$, based on the fusion relations of the $A_{2M-1}$ T-system in the framework of the ODE/IM correspondence. In this setup, the fusion relations on the integrable model (IM) side correspond to recurrence relations among quantization conditions on the ordinary differential equation (ODE) side, which we reformulate in terms of spectral zeta functions (SZFs), $\zeta_n(s) = \sum_{\alpha \in {\mathbb N}_0} E_{n,\alpha}^{-s}$, where $n$ denotes the fusion label. The ESRs yield algebraic relations among SZFs at fixed $n$, while the ZGFs establish explicit functional mappings between SZFs at different fusion labels. These structures are governed by a selection rule depending on both $M$ and $n$, induced in general by the combination of the structure of the Chebyshev polynomials appearing in the fusion relations and the $\mathbb{Z}_{2M+2}$ Symanzik rotational symmetry. Our results provide a novel spectral interpretation of the T-system in integrable models and point toward hidden algebraic structures governing global spectral data in $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric and Hermitian quantum mechanics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the thermodynamics especially the Joule-Thomson expansion of the $n$-dimensional FRW (Friedmann-Robertson-Walker) universe with a perfect fluid. We derive the thermodynamic equations of state $P=P(V, T)$ for the $n$-dimensional FRW universe in Einstein gravity and Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, where the thermodynamic pressure $P$ is defined by the work density $W$ of the perfect fluid, $i.e.$ $P\equiv W$. Furthermore, we present the Joule-Thomson expansion as an application of these equations of state to elucidate the cooling-heating properties of the $n$-dimensional FRW universe. We determine the inversion temperature and inversion pressure in the FRW universe with arbitrary dimensions for the first time, and illustrate the characteristics of inversion curves and isenthalpic curves in the $T$-$P$ plane. We also examine constraints on the perfect fluid in the FRW universe, as derived from the cooling-heating transition point. This study offers insights into deepening our comprehension of cooling and heating regions in the FRW universe, thereby revealing its expansion mechanisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lagrangians can differ by a total derivative without altering the equations of motion, thus encoding the same physics. This is in general true both classically and quantum mechanically. We show, however, that in the context of open quantum systems, two Lagrangians that differ by a total derivative can lead to different physical predictions. We then discuss the criterion that allows one to choose between such Lagrangians. Further, starting from the appropriate QED Lagrangian, we derive the master equation for the non-relativistic electron interacting with thermal photons upto second order in the interactions. This case study lends further phenomenological support to our proposed criterion.</description>

      <title>Cohomological vertex algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a family of algebraic structures as a higher-dimensional generalization of vertex algebras, which we term cohomological vertex algebras. The formal punctured 1-disk underlying a vertex algebra is replaced by a ring modeling the cohomology of certain schemes such as the formal punctured $n$-disk and the formal 1-disk with doubled origin. The latter scheme leads to the raviolo vertex algebras of Garner &amp; Williams. We prove several structural theorems for cohomological vertex algebras, as well as examine an appropriate Witt-like algebra and its central extensions, giving a definition of a cohomological vertex operator algebra. Using a reconstruction theorem for cohomological vertex algebras, we provide basic examples analogous to their vertex algebra counterparts.</description>

      <title>Study of Null Geodesics and their Stability in Horndeski Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the motion of particles in the background of a scalar-tensor theory of gravity in which the scalar field is kinetically coupled to the Einstein tensor and we present the null geodesic structure for asymptotically flat, AdS, and dS Horndeski black holes, studying the effect of the cosmological constant on the orbits. Also, we consider three classical test of the gravity in the solar system, such as, the bending of the light, the gravitational redshift, and the Shapiro time delay in order to constraint the coupling parameters of the scalar field to gravity. Calculating the Lyapunov exponent we explore the stability of these geodesics for various values of the cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Kinetically Modified Palatini Inflation Meets ACT Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23243v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the coexistence of a non-minimal coupling to gravity $f_{\mathcal{R}}=1+c{\mathcal{R}} \phi^{n/2}$ with a kinetic mixing of the form $f_K = f_{\mathcal{R}}^m$ -- where $n=2$ and 4 and $0.5 \le m \le 10$ -- reconciles chaotic inflation based on the $\phi^n$ potential with the recent ACT results, if we adopt the Palatini formulation of gravity. The attainment of inflation allows for subplanckian inflaton values and energy scales below the cut-off scale of the corresponding effective theory. The model can be also embedded in supergravity by introducing two chiral superfields and a monomial superpotential, linear with respect to the inflaton-accompanying field. Its stabilization is achieved thanks to a compact contribution to the Kaehler potential, whose the inflationary part includes an holomorphic logarithmic term and a real one multiplying a shift-symmetric quadratic polynomial term.</description>

      <title>Light PIDM in Warped Extra Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional Planckian Interacting Dark Matter (PIDM), which interacts exclusively through gravity, typically requires heavy DM candidates (with mass $10^3-10^{15}$ GeV) and very high reheating temperature ($T_{\rm rh}\gtrsim 10^{15}$ GeV). In this article, we explore a novel realization of PIDM in warped five-dimensions, consisting of an "Ultra Violet"$-$"Dark"$-$"Infra Red" (UV-DB-IR) brane setup, where the DM can be a Dark brane composite light state with mass 1 MeV $-$ 1 TeV. The DM sector is assumed to interact solely via gravity in five-dimensions. After orbifolding and performing a Kaluza-Klein (KK) decomposition, the DM is assumed to be localized onto the DB, which is positioned in the extra-dimension such that the DM interacts with both the massless graviton and its massive KK excitations, with suppressed couplings to remain consistent with the ethos of the PIDM framework. The light (heavy) Standard Model matter is assumed to be localized near UV (IR) branes for the geometric Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism, while their KK modes are localized close to the IR brane. We show that this construction allows for a viable and efficient freeze-in production mechanism for light composite PIDM, consistent with TeV-scale reheating temperature.</description>

      <title>ACT-Inspired Kaehler-Based Inflationary Attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a new class of cosmological attractors which are compatible with the recent ACT results. They are based on two types of fractional Kaehler potentials, K, for a gauge-singlet inflaton phi which reduce, along the inflationary path, to the form N/(1-phi^qM)^p with qM=1, 2 and 0.1&lt; p&lt;10. The combination of these K's with the chaotic potentials phi^n (where n=2, 4) within a non-linear sigma model leads to inflationary observables which are consistent with the current data and largely independent from qM and n. Endowing these K's with a shift symmetry we also offer a supergravity realization of our models introducing two chiral superfields and a monomial superpotential, linear with respect to the inflaton-accompanying field. The attainment of inflation with subplanckian inflaton values and the large values for the tensor-to-scalar ratio, which increases with N, are two additional attractive features of our proposal.</description>

      <title>Bias with a Timer: Axion Domain Wall Decay and Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the interplay of the post-inflationary QCD axion and a light scalar field for the axion domain wall decay and dark matter (DM). The scalar field possesses a nonzero vacuum expectation value (VEV) during inflation, so that its interaction with the axion effectively serves as an explicit Peccei-Quinn (PQ) violating term. At a temperature below the PQ phase transition, the effective PQ violating interaction generates the axion potential which generally contains multiple degenerate vacua leading to the formation of the axion string-domain wall networks. The following QCD phase transition provides another contribution to the axion potential making domain walls decay before they dominate the Universe. Later, the scalar field starts to relax to the minimum of its potential with a vanishing VEV, turning off the effective PQ violating interaction so that the axion potential is aligned with the QCD vacuum. We keep track of the evolution of the axion-scalar system and discuss the production of the axion DM through the domain wall decay and the (trapped) misalignment. We find that the string-wall network in some cases can decay due to its structural instability, rather than the volume pressure, and the correct axion DM abundance is realized with the decay constant larger than that of the conventional post-inflationary QCD axion without fine tuning.</description>
