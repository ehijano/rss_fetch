      <title>Evolving dark energy models: Current and forecast constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent results from Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), in combination with cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements, have focused renewed attention on dark energy models with a time-varying equation-of-state parameter, $w(z)$. In this paper, we describe the simplest, physically motivated models of evolving dark energy that are consistent with the recent data, a broad subclass of the so-called thawing scalar field models. We provide a quasi-universal, quasi-one-parameter functional fit to the scalar-field $w_\phi(z)$ that captures the behavior of these models more informatively than the standard $w_0w_a$ phenomenological parametrization; their behavior is completely described by the current value of the equation-of-state parameter, $w_0=w(z=0)$. Combining current data from SNe Ia (DES-SN5YR), BAO (SDSS + DESI Year 1), the CMB (Planck and ACT), large-scale structure (DES Year-3 $3\times2$pt), and strong lensing (TDCOSMO + SLACS), we obtain $w_0=-0.908\pm0.035$, 2.6$\sigma$ discrepant from the $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model. The Bayesian evidence ratio substantially favors this $w_\phi$CDM model over $\Lambda$CDM. The data combination that yields the strongest discrepancy with $\Lambda$CDM is SNe Ia+BAO, for which $w_0=-0.840^{+0.048}_{-0.050}$, $3.2\sigma$ discrepant from $\Lambda$CDM and with a Bayesian evidence ratio strongly in favor. We find that the so-called $S_8$ tension between the CMB and large-scale structure is slightly reduced in these models, while the Hubble tension is slightly increased. We forecast constraints on these models from near-future surveys (DESI-extension and the Vera Rubin Observatory LSST), showing that the current best-fit $w_\phi$CDM model will be distinguishable from $\Lambda$CDM at over 9$\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Searching for Inflationary Physics with the CMB Trispectrum: 3. Constraints from Planck</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Is there new physics hidden in the four-point function of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)? We conduct a detailed analysis of the Planck PR4 temperature and polarization trispectrum for $\ell\in[2,2048]$. Using the theoretical and computational tools developed in Paper 1 and Paper 2, we search for 33 template amplitudes, encoding a variety of effects from inflationary self-interactions to particle exchange. We find no evidence for primordial non-Gaussianity and set stringent constraints on both phenomenological amplitudes and couplings in the inflationary Lagrangian. Due to the use of optimal estimators and polarization data, our constraints are highly competitive. For example, we find $\sigma(g_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc})=4.8\times 10^4$ and $\tau_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc} &lt;1500$ (95\% CL), a factor of two improvement on Effective Field Theory amplitudes, and a $43\sigma$ detection of gravitational lensing. Many templates are analyzed for the first time, such as direction-dependent trispectra and the collapsed limit of the `cosmological collider', across a range of masses and spins. We perform a variety of validation tests; whilst our results are stable, the most relevant systematics are found to be lensing bias, residual foregrounds, and mismatch between simulations and data. The techniques discussed in this series can be extended to future datasets, allowing the primordial Universe to be probed at even higher sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Assessing subhalo finders in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological simulations are essential for inferring cosmological and galaxy population properties based on forward-modelling, but this typically requires finding the population of (sub)haloes and galaxies that they contain. The properties of said populations vary depending on the algorithm used to find them, which is concerning as it may bias key statistics. We compare how the predicted (sub)halo mass functions, satellite radial distributions and correlation functions vary across algorithms in the dark-matter-only and hydrodynamical versions of the FLAMINGO simulations. We test three representative approaches to finding subhaloes: grouping particles in configuration- (Subfind), phase- (ROCKSTAR and VELOCIraptor) and history-space (HBT-HERONS). We also present HBT-HERONS, a new version of the HBT+ subhalo finder that improves the tracking of subhaloes. We find 10%-level differences in the $M_{\mathrm{200c}}$ mass function, reflecting different field halo definitions and occasional miscentering. The bound mass functions can differ by 75% at the high mass end, even when using the maximum circular velocity as a mass proxy. The number of well-resolved subhaloes differs by up to 20% near $R_{\mathrm{200c}}$, reflecting differences in the assignment of mass to subhaloes and their identification. The predictions of different subhalo finders increasingly diverge towards the centres of the host haloes. The performance of most subhalo finders does not improve with the resolution of the simulation and is worse for hydrodynamical than for dark-matter-only simulations. We conclude that HBT-HERONS is the preferred choice of subhalo finder due to its low computational cost, self-consistently made and robust merger trees, and robust subhalo identification capabilities.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic methods and sub-resolution models for cosmological simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological simulations are powerful tools in the context of structure formation. They allow us to explore the assembly and clustering of dark matter halos, to validate or reject possible scenarios of structure formation, and to investigate the physical properties of evolving galaxies across time. Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations are especially key to study how the complex interstellar medium of forming galaxies responds to the most energetic processes during galaxy evolution, such as stellar feedback ensuing supernova explosions and feedback from AGN. Given the huge dynamical range of physical scales spanned by the astrophysical processes involved in cosmic structure formation and evolution, cosmological simulations resort to sub-resolution models to capture processes occurring below their resolution limit. The impact of different sub-grid prescriptions accounting for the same process is striking, though often overlooked. Some among the main aforementioned processes include: hot gas cooling, star formation and stellar feedback, stellar evolution and chemical enrichment, black hole growth and feedback. Producing simulations of cosmic structure formation and galaxy evolution in large computational volumes is key to shed light on what drives the formation of the first structures in the Universe, and their subsequent evolution. Not only are predictions from simulations crucial to compare with data from ongoing observational instruments, but they can also guide future observational campaigns. Besides, since we have entered the era of high-performance computing, it is fundamental to have numerical codes which are very efficient from the computational point of view. In this chapter, we review the main hydrodynamic methods used in cosmological simulations and the most common techniques adopted to include the astrophysical processes which drive galaxy formation and evolution (abridged).</description>

      <title>Expansion-history preferences of DESI and external data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the origin of the preference of DESI Year-1 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements and external data from cosmic microwave background (CMB) and type Ia supernovae (SNIa) that dark energy behavior departs from that expected in the standard cosmological model with vacuum energy ($\Lambda$CDM). In our analysis, we allow a flexible scaling of the expansion rate with redshift that nevertheless allows reasonably tight constraints on the quantities of interest, and adopt and validate a simple yet accurate compression of the CMB data that allows us to constrain our phenomenological model of the expansion history. We find that data consistently show a preference for a $\sim$3-5% increase in the expansion rate at $z\simeq 0.5$ relative to that predicted by the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, in excellent agreement with results from the less flexible $(w_0, w_a)$ parameterization which was used in previous analyses. Even though our model allows a departure from the best-fit $\Lambda$CDM model at zero redshift, we find no evidence for such a signal. We also find no evidence (at greater than 1$\sigma$ significance) for a departure of the expansion rate from the $\Lambda$CDM predictions at higher redshifts for any of the data combinations that we consider. Overall, our results strengthen the robustness of the findings using the combination of DESI, CMB, and SNIa data to dark-energy modeling assumptions.</description>

      <title>Planck PR4 (NPIPE) map-space cosmic birefringence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic birefringence is an effect where the plane of polarisation of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is rotated by an angle $\beta$ through coupling to a hypothetical parity-violating field. We analyse the Planck Public Release 4 (PR4 or NPIPE) data using a map-space analysis method and find $\beta=0.46^\circ\pm 0.04^\circ(\mathrm{stat.})\pm0.28^\circ(\mathrm{syst.})$ for SEVEM CMB maps and $\beta=0.48^\circ\pm 0.04^\circ(\mathrm{stat.})\pm 0.28^\circ(\mathrm{syst.})$ for Commander CMB maps. These values are slightly higher than previously published results, which may be explained by the fact that we have not attempted to remove any potential bias from miscalibration of the Planck polarimeters. The uncertainty in this miscalibration dominates the systematic uncertainty, which also means that our results are consistent with no parity violation. An advantage of the map-space analysis is that it is easy to investigate any variations on the sky, for example caused by foreground contamination. Our results for isotropic birefringence are fairly robust against different spatial data cuts, but there may be hints of a foreground systematic (north versus south hemispheres) or uncontrolled miscalibration effect (T peaks versus E peaks) that should be followed up in future studies. We additionally find no evidence of a cosmic birefringence dipole (anisotropic birefringence).</description>

      <title>Geometric Interpretations of the $k$-Nearest Neighbour Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $k$-Nearest Neighbour Cumulative Distribution Functions are measures of clustering for discrete datasets that are fast and efficient to compute. They are significantly more informative than the 2-point correlation function. Their connection to $N$-point correlation functions, void probability functions and Counts-in-Cells is known. However, the connections between the CDFs and other geometric and topological spatial summary statistics are yet to be fully explored in the literature. This understanding will be crucial to find optimally informative summary statistics to analyse data from stage 4 cosmological surveys. We explore quantitatively the geometric interpretations of the $k$NN CDF summary statistics. We establish an equivalence between the 1NN CDF at radius $r$ and the volume of spheres with the same radius around the data points. We show that higher $k$NN CDFs are equivalent to the volumes of intersections of $\ge k$ spheres around the data points. We present similar geometric interpretations for the $k$NN cross-correlation joint CDFs. We further show that the volume, or the CDFs, have information about the angles and arc lengths created at the intersections of spheres around the data points, which can be accessed through the derivatives of the CDF. We show this information is very similar to that captured by Germ Grain Minkowski Functionals. Using a Fisher analysis we compare the information content and constraining power of various data vectors constructed from the $k$NN CDFs and Minkowski Functionals. We find that the CDFs and their derivatives and the Minkowski Functionals have nearly identical information content. However, $k$NN CDFs are computationally orders of magnitude faster to evaluate. Finally, we find that there is information in the full shape of the CDFs, and therefore caution against using the values of the CDF only at sparsely sampled radii.</description>

      <title>Collective flavor conversions are interactions of neutrinos with quantized flavor waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective oscillations in dense neutrino gases (flavor waves) are notable for their instabilities that cause fast flavor conversion. We develop a quantum theory of interacting neutrinos and flavor wave quanta, which are analogous to plasmons, but also carry flavor. The emission or absorption of such flavor plasmons $\psi$, or flavomons, changes the neutrino flavor. When an angular crossing occurs, the process $\nu_\mu\to\nu_e+\psi$ is more rapid than its inverse along the direction of the crossing, triggering stimulated $\psi$ emission and fast instability. Calculating the rate via Feynman diagrams matches the fast instability growth rate. Our novel $\nu$ and $\psi$ kinetic equations, corresponding to quasi-linear theory, describe instability evolution without resolving the small scales of the flavomon wavelength, potentially overcoming the main challenge of fast flavor evolution.</description>

      <title>Three-Field String Inflation with Perturbative Corrections: Dynamics and Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we construct an explicit string motivated example of three-field inflation in a related, yet distinct from, the recently discovered perturbative large volume scenario (pLVS). Contrary to the usual constructions, in this set up, large volume is ensured by the interplay between the effects of $\alpha^{\prime 3}$, logarithmic loop and higher derivative $F^4$ corrections. After addressing a full moduli stabilization scenario, we move on to a detailed analysis of three-field model of inflation in a canonical basis. We conduct multiple consistency checks to establish a solid foundation for our model within the framework of the underlying 4D effective field theory (EFT). Our model differs from previous setups in three key aspects: first, the interaction between subleading corrections that drive full moduli stabilization follows a different pattern, second, the volume form of the underlying Calabi-Yau is different, and third, in our three-field inflation scenario, the second slow-roll parameter consistently dominates over the first by several orders of magnitude. The latter signals the possible presence of primordial features which can be verified by forthcoming ground and space based experiments. We can roughly distinguish two stages of inflation: the first stage mostly occurs in the steepest direction during horizon crossing giving us almost $55$ efolds of inflation-- once one of the inflatons falls off the ridge and then to its true minimum, the other two fields become active, giving us a truly multi-field behavior in the second stage -- adding few more efodls of inflation. We also confirm our claim by introducing the non-planar torsion in the inflationary trajectory -- this quantity becomes non-trivial in the second stage of inflation. Finally, we calculate the cosmological observables, which align with Planck data, and discuss potential directions for future research.</description>

      <title>The Weinberg no-go theorem for cosmological constant and nonlocal gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how a nonlocal gravitational interaction can circumvent the Weinberg no-go theorem on cosmological constant, which forbids the existence of any solution to the cosmological constant problem within the context of local field theories unless some fine-tuning is assumed. In particular, Infinite Derivative Gravity theories hint at a possible understanding of the cosmological constant as a nonlocal gravitational effect on very large scales. In this perspective, one can describe the observed cosmic acceleration in terms of an effective field theory without relying on the fine-tuning of parameters or additional matter fields.</description>

      <title>Modified theories of gravity at different curvature scales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General Relativity (GR) remains the cornerstone of gravitational physics, providing remarkable success in describing a wide range of astrophysical and cosmological phenomena. However, several challenges underscore the urgent need to explore modified gravity theories. GR struggles to reconcile with quantum mechanics, fails to provide fundamental explanations for dark matter and dark energy, and faces limitations in describing extreme regimes such as black hole singularities and the very early universe. This review provides an organized perspective on modified gravity theories by classifying them based on the principles of GR they preserve or violate. Specifically, we consider three broad categories: (1) metric theories that uphold local Lorentz invariance (LLI) and gauge invariance, (2) theories that break gauge invariance, LLI, or parity, and (3) beyond-metric theories that violate the Einstein's equivalence principle (EEP). This classification highlights the underlying assumptions of GR that these theories challenge or extend, providing a framework for understanding their motivations and implications. The review also discusses the current and upcoming experimental and observational tests of GR, including those probing its foundational principles, such as LLI, gauge invariance, and EEP. For each class of modified theories, we examine their ability to address critical open questions in cosmology and black hole physics. These include their potential to explain the accelerated expansion of the current universe, the nature of dark matter, and deviations in black hole dynamics from GR predictions. This review aims to provide a structured understanding of modified gravity theories and their observational implications in the multimessenger era by focusing on the principles preserved or violated.

      <title>Detectability of dark matter subhalo impacts in Milky Way stellar streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar streams are a promising way to probe the gravitational effects of low-mass dark matter (DM) subhalos. In recent years, there has been a remarkable explosion in the number of stellar streams detected in the Milky Way, and hundreds more may be discovered with future surveys such as LSST. Studies of DM subhalo impacts on streams have so far focused on a few of the thinnest and brightest streams, and it is not known how much information can be gained from the others. In this work, we develop a method to quickly estimate the minimum detectable DM subhalo mass of a given stream, where subhalo mass here refers to the total mass of a Plummer sphere. Our work is based on an analytic model for subhalo impacts on circular streams, which allows us to model streams with a wide range of properties including width, length, distance, and stellar density. We consider several observational scenarios, based on current and future surveys including Gaia, DESI, Via, and LSST. We find that at 95% confidence level, a stream like GD-1 has a minimum detectable subhalo mass of $\sim 6\times 10^6~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ in Gaia data and $\sim 8\times 10^5~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ with LSST 10 year sensitivity. Applying our results to confirmed Milky Way streams, we rank order them by their sensitivity to DM subhalos and identify promising ones for further study.</description>

      <title>Two-Field Quintessential Higgs model and the Swampland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a two-field model where a quintessence field with an exponential potential $e^{-\beta\phi/M_P}$ is coupled to the Higgs field. It is claimed that this model is consistent with the proposed Swampland conjecture. We check this claim by calculating its inflationary observables. Although, these observables are in good agreement with the latest CMB data, but we find an upper bound $\beta \lesssim 8\times 10^{-3}$ that strongly disfavors the Swampland conjecture.</description>

      <title>Calibrating the Absolute Magnitude of Type Ia Supernovae in Nearby Galaxies using [OII] and Implications for $H_{0}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present state of cosmology is facing a crisis where there is a fundamental disagreement in measurements of the Hubble constant ($H_{0}$), with significant tension between the early and late universe methods. Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are important to measuring $H_{0}$ through the astronomical distance ladder. However, there remains potential to better standardise SN Ia light curves by using known dependencies on host galaxy properties after the standard light curve width and colour corrections have been applied to the peak SN Ia luminosities. To explore this, we use the 5-year photometrically identified SNe Ia sample obtained by the Dark Energy Survey, along with host galaxy spectra obtained by the Australian Dark Energy Survey. Using host galaxy spectroscopy, we find a significant trend with the equivalent width (EW) of the [OII] $\lambda\lambda$ 3727, 29 doublet, a proxy for specific star formation rate, and Hubble residuals. We find that the correlation with [OII] EW is a powerful alternative to the commonly used mass step after initial light curve corrections. Applying this [OII] EW correction to 20 SNe Ia in calibrator galaxies observed with WiFeS, we examined the impact on SN Ia absolute magnitudes and $H_{0}$. Our [OII] EW corrections result in $H_{0}$ values ranging between 73.04 to 73.51 $\mathrm{km} \mathrm{s}^{-1} \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, with a combined statistical and systematic uncertainty of $\sim$1.31 $\mathrm{km} \mathrm{s}^{-1} \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. However, even with this additional correction, the impact of host galaxy properties in standardising SNe Ia appears limited in reducing the current tension ($\sim$5$\sigma$) with the CMB result for $H_{0}$.</description>

      <title>Dimensionality Reduction Techniques for Statistical Inference in Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02102v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore linear and non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques for statistical inference of parameters in cosmology. Given the importance of compressing the increasingly complex data vectors used in cosmology, we address questions that impact the constraining power achieved, such as: Are currently used methods effectively lossless? Under what conditions do nonlinear methods, typically based on neural nets, outperform linear methods? Through theoretical analysis and experiments with simulated weak lensing data vectors we compare three standard linear methods and neural network based methods. We propose two linear methods that outperform all others while using less computational resources: a variation of the MOPED algorithm we call e-MOPED and an adaptation of Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), which is a method new to cosmology but well known in statistics. Both e-MOPED and CCA utilize simulations spanning the full parameter space, and rely on the sensitivity of the data vector to the parameters of interest. The gains we obtain are significant compared to compression methods used in the literature: up to 30% in the Figure of Merit for $\Omega_m$ and $S_8$ in a realistic Simulation Based Inference analysis that includes statistical and systematic errors. We also recommend two modifications that improve the performance of all methods: First, include components in the compressed data vector that may not target the key parameters but still enhance the constraints on due to their correlations. The gain is significant, above 20% in the Figure of Merit. Second, compress Gaussian and non-Gaussian statistics separately -- we include two summary statistics of each type in our analysis.</description>

      <title>Constraints on $f(R)$ gravity from tSZE-selected SPT galaxy clusters and weak lensing mass calibration from DES and HST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present constraints on the $f(R)$ gravity model using a sample of 1,005 galaxy clusters in the redshift range $0.25 - 1.78$ that have been selected through the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (tSZE) from South Pole Telescope (SPT) data and subjected to optical and near-infrared confirmation with the Multi-component Matched Filter (MCMF) algorithm. We employ weak gravitational lensing mass calibration from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 3 data for 688 clusters at $z &lt; 0.95$ and from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) for 39 clusters with $0.6 &lt; z &lt; 1.7$. Our cluster sample is a powerful probe of $f(R)$ gravity, because this model predicts a scale-dependent enhancement in the growth of structure, which impacts the halo mass function (HMF) at cluster mass scales. To account for these modified gravity effects on the HMF, our analysis employs a semi-analytical approach calibrated with numerical simulations. Combining calibrated cluster counts with primary cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarization anisotropy measurements from the Planck2018 release, we derive robust constraints on the $f(R)$ parameter $f_{R0}$. Our results, $\log_{10} |f_{R0}| &lt; -5.32$ at the 95 % credible level, are the tightest current constraints on $f(R)$ gravity from cosmological scales. This upper limit rules out $f(R)$-like deviations from general relativity that result in more than a $\sim$20 % enhancement of the cluster population on mass scales $M_\mathrm{200c}&gt;3\times10^{14}M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>The Status of Neutrino Cosmology: Standard $\Lambda$CDM, Extensions, and Tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05451v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the performance of the six-parameter $\Lambda$CDM model and its extensions in light of recent cosmological observations, with particular focus on neutrino properties inferred from cosmology. Using a broad suite of nine combinations of datasets, with three separate analyses of the Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data, and three separate supernovae (SNe) survey data, plus the recent DESI baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale results, we derive constraints on the sum of neutrino masses ($\Sigma m_\nu$). Our results show upper limits in the range of $\Sigma m_\nu &lt; 76.9\,\mathrm{meV}$ to $\Sigma m_\nu &lt; 108\,\mathrm{meV}$ (95\% CL). The variation in the limits on $\Sigma m_\nu$ arises from the separate analyses of the Planck CMB data and the separate supernovae datasets, as they relate to the inferred matter density and its relation to the sensitivity of the BAO scale and CMB lensing to $\Sigma m_\nu$. In the context of hierarchical mass models in $\Lambda$CDM, we find a $1.47\sigma$ preference for normal ordering (NO) over inverted ordering (IO), with similar values of preference across all datasets. Despite the strong constraints, an inclination towards massless neutrinos over NO remains weak at $1.36\sigma$. We find that a ``negative'' neutrino mass, inferred from the shape of the likelihood in the physical regime, $\Sigma m_\nu &gt; 0$, is only present at less than $2\sigma$. We confirm that models allowing extra relativistic degrees of freedom, with $N_{\rm eff} \approx 3.5$, alleviate the Hubble tension. Significantly, we find a $3.3\sigma$ preference for a 0.1 eV partially thermalized sterile neutrino when the SH0ES $H_0$ measurement is included, a scale of interest in short-baseline oscillation experiment results.

      <title>A quantitative analysis of Gravitational Wave spectrum sourced from First-Order Chiral Phase Transition of QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological first-order chiral phase transition of QCD, and for the first time calculate its parameters which can fully determine the gravitational wave spectrum. With the state-of-the-art calculation from the functional QCD method, we found that the large chemical potential of QCD phase transition results in very weak and fast first-order phase transitions at the temperature lower than $\mathcal{O}(10^2)$ MeV. These results further suggest that the GW signals of NANOGrav are very unlikely sourced from the chiral phase transition of QCD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03725v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To investigate the model and extra frictional effects in standard siren simulation of $f(Q)$ cosmologies, we simulated three types of standard siren data based on different fiducial models ($\Lambda$CDM and $f(Q)$ models). Both effects are important in standard siren simulation. Explicitly, the $f(Q)_P$ and $f(Q)_E$ models need more observational data (e.g.growth factor) to further study. The $f(Q)_{PE}$ model could be ruled out by the EM data. And both the $f(Q)_{HT}$ models will be excluded by the future standard siren data.</description>

      <title>Interpreting Pulsar Timing Array data of Gravitational Waves with Ekpyrosis-Bouncing Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06582v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments have reported strong evidence of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). If interpreted as primordial Gravitational Waves (pGWs), the signal favors a strongly blue-tilted spectrum. On the other hand, the Ekpyrosis-bouncing cosmology with a strongly blue-tilted GW spectrum, i.e., $n_T \simeq 2$, offers a potential explanation for the observed SGWB signal. In this paper, we construct a concrete Ekpyrosis-bouncing model, and show its capacity to intepret the PTA result without pathologies. Both tensor and scalar perturbations are analysed with constraints from the current observations.</description>

      <title>The thermodynamic structure and large-scale structure filament in MACS J0717.5+3745</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the results of Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray imaging and spatially-resolved spectroscopy, as well as new MUSTANG2 90~GHz observations of the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect from MACS J0717.5+3745, an intermediate redshift ($z=0.5458$) and exceptionally massive ($3.5 \pm 0.6\ times 10^{15}~\rm M_\odot$) Frontier Fields cluster experiencing multiple mergers and hosting an apparent X-ray bright large scale structure filament. Thermodynamical maps are produced from Chandra, XMM-Newton, and ROSAT data using a new method for modeling the astrophysical and instrumental backgrounds. The temperature peak of $24 \pm 4$ keV is also the pressure peak of the cluster and closely correlates spatially with the Sunyaev-Zeldovich peak from the MUSTANG2 data. The cluster center hosts shock fronts to the north and south, for which we report estimates for the shock Mach numbers of $M = 1.6 \pm 0.4$ and $M = 1.9 \pm 0.3$, respectively. Bayesian X-ray Analysis methods were used to disentangle different projected spectral signatures for the filament structure, with Akaike and Bayes criteria being used to select the most appropriate model to describe the various temperature components. We report an X-ray filament temperature of $3.1_{-0.3}^{+0.6}$ keV and a density $(3.78\pm0.05)\times10^{-4}\,{\rm cm^{-3}}$, corresponding to an overdensity of $\sim400$ relative to the critical density of the Universe. We estimate the hot gas mass of the filament to be $\sim6.1\times10^{12}~\rm M_\odot$, while its total projected weak lensing measured mass is $\sim(6.8\pm2.7)\times10^{13}~\rm M_\odot$, indicating a hot baryon fraction of 4--10\%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09757v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the potential of gravitational waves (GWs) to probe the pre-BBN era of the early universe, focusing on the effects of energy injection. Specifically, we examine a hidden sector alongside the Standard Model that undergoes a strong first-order phase transition (FOPT), producing a GW signal. Once the phase transition has completed, energy injection initiates reheating in the hidden sector, which positions the hidden sector field so that additional phase transitions can occur. This can result in a total of three distinct phase transitions with a unique three-peak GW spectrum. Among these transitions, the first and third are of the standard type, while the intermediate second transition is inverted, moving from a broken to an unbroken phase. Using polynomial potentials as a framework, we derive analytical relations among the phase transition parameters and the resulting GW spectrum. Our results indicate that the second and third transitions generate GWs with higher amplitudes than the first, with a peak frequency ratio differing by up to an order of magnitude. This three-peak GW spectrum is detectable by upcoming facilities such as LISA, BBO, and UDECIGO. Notably, the phenomenon is robust across various potentials and model parameters, suggesting that hidden sector GWs provide a powerful tool for exploring new physics scenarios in the pre-BBN era.</description>

      <title>Towards cosmological inference on unlabeled out-of-distribution HI observational data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an approach that can be utilized in order to account for the covariate shift between two datasets of the same observable with different distributions. This helps improve the generalizability of a neural network model trained on in-distribution samples (IDs) when inferring cosmology at the field level on out-of-distribution samples (OODs) of {\it unknown labels}. We make use of HI maps from the two simulation suites in CAMELS, IllustrisTNG and SIMBA. We consider two different techniques, namely adversarial approach and optimal transport, to adapt a target network whose initial weights are those of a source network pre-trained on a labeled dataset. Results show that after adaptation, salient features that are extracted by source and target encoders are well aligned in the embedding space. This indicates that the target encoder has learned the representations of the target domain via the adversarial training and optimal transport. Furthermore, in all scenarios considered in our analyses, the target encoder, which does not have access to any labels ($\Omega_{\rm m}$) during adaptation phase, is able to retrieve the underlying $\Omega_{\rm m}$ from out-of-distribution maps to a great accuracy of $R^{2}$ score $\ge$ 0.9, comparable to the performance of the source encoder trained in a supervised learning setup. We further test the viability of the techniques when only a few out-of-distribution instances are available for training and find that the target encoder still reasonably recovers the matter density. Our approach is critical in extracting information from upcoming large scale surveys.</description>

      <title>Core to Cosmic Edge: SIMBA-C's New Take on Abundance Profiles in the Intragroup Medium at z = 0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ the SIMBA-C cosmological simulation to study the impact of its upgraded chemical enrichment model (Chem5) on the distribution of metals in the intragroup medium (IGrM). We investigate the projected X-ray emission-weighted abundance profiles of key elements over two decades in halo mass ($10^{13} \leq M_{500}/\mathrm{M_\odot} \leq 10^{15}$). Typically, SIMBA-C generates lower-amplitude abundance profiles than SIMBA with flatter cores, in better agreement with observations. For low-mass groups, both simulations over-enrich the IGrM with Si, S, Ca, and Fe compared to observations, a trend likely related to inadequate modeling of metal dispersal and mixing. We analyze the 3D mass-weighted abundance profiles, concluding that the lower SIMBA-C IGrM abundances are primarily a consequence of fewer metals in the IGrM, driven by reduced metal yields in Chem5, and the removal of the instantaneous recycling of metals approximation employed by SIMBA. Additionally, an increased IGrM mass in low-mass SIMBA-C groups is likely triggered by changes to the AGN and stellar feedback models. Our study suggests that a more realistic chemical enrichment model broadly improves agreement with observations, but physically motivated sub-grid models for other key processes, like AGN and stellar feedback and turbulent diffusion, are required to realistically reproduce observed group environments.</description>
