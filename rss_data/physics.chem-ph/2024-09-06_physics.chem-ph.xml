      <title>Nano-Scale Manipulation of Single-Molecule Conformational Transition Through Vibrational Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On-demand control of molecular actions is a crucial step toward the realization of single-molecule functional devices. Such a control can be achieved by manipulating interactions between individual molecules and their nanoscale environment. In this study, we induce and manipulate the conformational transition of a single molecular adsorbate by exciting its vibrations with tunneling electrons using scanning tunneling microscopy. Several transition pathways between two structural states of a pyrrolidine molecule on a Cu(100) surface have been identified as being driven by different molecular vibrations. Density functional theory simulations further determine the nuclear motions of these vibrational modes. The introduction of tip-induced van der Waals forces and intermolecular interactions allows for precise manipulation of the molecule-environment interaction, which shifts the vibrational energies and alters the transition probability through different channels between the two structural states. This work reveals how molecular conformational transitions can be modulated by external force fields in a tunable nano-cavity, highlighting the potential to deliberately engineer molecule-environment interactions for specific molecular functions.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic characterization of the ($H_{2}$ + $C_{3}H_{8}$) system significant for the hydrogen economy: Experimental ($p$, $\rho$, $T$) determination and equation-of-state modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the gradual introduction of hydrogen in the energy market, the study of the properties of mixtures of hydrogen with typical components of natural gas (NG) and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) is of great importance. This work aims to provide accurate experimental ($p$, $\rho$, $T$) data for three hydrogen-propane mixtures with nominal compositions (amount of substance, mol/mol) of (0.95$H_{2}$ + 0.05$C_{3}H_{8}$), (0.90$H_{2}$ + 0.10$C_{3}H_{8}$), and (0.83$H_{2}$ + 0.17$C_{3}H_{8}$), at temperatures of 250, 275, 300, 325, 350, and 375 K, and pressures up to 20 MPa. A single-sinker densimeter was used to determine the density of the mixtures. Experimental density data were compared to the densities calculated from two reference equations of state: the GERG-2008 and the AGA8-DC92. Relative deviations from the GERG-2008 EoS are systematically larger than those from the AGA8-DC92. They are within the $\pm$0.5% band for the mixture with 5% of propane, but deviations are higher than 0.5% for the mixtures with 10% and 17% of propane, especially at low temperatures and high pressures. Finally, the sets of new experimental data have been processed by the application of two different statistical equations of state: the virial equation of state, through the second and third virial coefficients, $B$($T$, $x$) and $C$($T$, $x$), and the PC-SAFT equation of state.</description>

      <title>Thermophysical properties of hydrogen mixtures relevant for the development of the hydrogen economy: Review of available experimental data and thermodynamic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate knowledge of the thermophysical and thermodynamic properties of pure hydrogen and hydrogen mixtures plays an important role in the design and operation of many processes involved in hydrogen production, transport, storage, and use. These data are needed for the development of theoretical models necessary for the introduction of hydrogen as a promising energy carrier in the near future. A literature survey on both the available experimental data and the theoretical models associated with the thermodynamic properties of hydrogen mixtures, within the operational ranges of industrial interest for composition, temperature, and pressure, is presented in this work. Considering the available experimental data and the requirements for the design and operation of hydrogen systems, the most relevant gaps in temperature, pressure and composition are identified.</description>

      <title>Speed of sound data and acoustic virial coefficients of two binary ($N_{2}$ + $H_{2}$) mixtures at temperatures between (260 and 350) K and at pressures between (0.5 and 20) MPa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work aims to address the technical concerns related to the thermodynamic characterization of gas mixtures blended with hydrogen for the implementation of hydrogen as a new energy vector. For this purpose, new experimental speed of sound measurements have been done in gaseous and supercritical phases of two binary mixtures of nitrogen and hydrogen using the most accurate technique available, i.e., the spherical acoustic resonator, yielding an experimental expanded ($k$ = 2) uncertainty of only 220 parts in $10^{6}$ (0.022%). The measurements cover the pressure range between (0.5 and 20) MPa, the temperature range between (260 and 350) K, and the composition range with a nominal mole percentage of hydrogen of (5 and 10) mol%, respectively. From the speed of sound data sets, thermophysical properties that are relevant for the characterization of the mixture, namely the second $\beta_{a}$ and third $\gamma_{a}$ acoustic virial coefficients, are derived. These results are thoroughly compared and discussed with the established reference mixture models valid for mixtures of nitrogen and hydrogen, such as the AGA8-DC92 EoS, the GERG-2008 EoS, and the recently developed adaptation of the GERG-2008 EoS, here denoted GERG-$H_{2}$_improved EoS. Special attention has been given to the effect of hydrogen concentration on those properties, showing that only the GERG-$H_{2}$_improved EoS is consistent with the data sets within the experimental uncertainty in most measuring conditions.</description>

      <title>How Crystalline is Low-Density Amorphous Ice?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-density amorphous ice (LDA) is one of the most common solid materials in the Universe and a key material for understanding the many famous anomalies of liquid water. Yet, despite its significance and its discovery dating nearly 90 years, the structure of LDA is debated. It is unclear if LDA is a glassy state representing a liquid or a heavily disordered crystal; indeed, two forms (LDA-I and LDA-II) have been discussed as amorphous and partially crystalline in the literature, respectively. Here, with two widely used water models, we show that the experimental structure factor of LDA is best reproduced computationally by a partially crystalline structure. Models for both LDA-I and LDA-II are highly similar, with differences only due to subtle differences in crystallinity and/or experimental error. Further support for this structural model of LDA comes from experiment: if LDA is partially crystalline, then its route to formation should result in different nanocrystallite cubicities, and thus give rise to different cubicities upon recrystallisation. This memory effect of LDA's creation route is observed and it is incompatible with a fully amorphous material. The results present a unified computational and experimental view that LDA is not fully amorphous but instead a partially crystalline material. This impacts LDA's many roles in nature and potentially our understanding of liquid water. Furthermore, the "re-identification" of such an intensely studied material highlights that great care will be needed when classifying the nature of glassy materials going forward.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Networks and Beyond: Enforcing Physical Constraints in Quantum Dissipative Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural networks (NNs) accelerate simulations of quantum dissipative dynamics. Ensuring that these simulations adhere to fundamental physical laws is crucial, but has been largely ignored in the state-of-the-art NN approaches. We show that this may lead to implausible results measured by violation of the trace conservation. To recover the correct physical behavior, we develop physics-informed NNs (PINNs) that mitigate the violations to a good extend. Beyond that, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware approach that enforces perfect trace conservation by design, surpassing PINNs.</description>

      <title>Rotational and Near-IR Spectra of PbF: Characterization of the Coupled $X_1\,^2\Pi_{1/2}$ and $X_2\,^2\Pi_{3/2}$ States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations of the rotational spectrum of lead monofluoride, PbF, have been extended up to transitions in the \textit{v} = 7 level for $^{208}$PbF in the lowest $X_1\,^2\Pi_{1/2}$ state of the radical and \textit{v} = 5 for the $^{207}$Pb and $^{206}$Pb isotopologues. The data also include a few measurements for $^{204}$PbF in \textit{v} = 0. These new measurements have been combined with existing near-IR measurements of the $X_2 - X_1$ fine-structure transition and a simultaneous multi-isotope fit of the data to an effective isotope-independent ro-vibronic Hamiltonian has been carried out. The resulting parameters fully characterize the vibrational, rotational and hyperfine structure of the combined $X_1 \, / \, X_2$ state of the radical. A pair of opposite parity levels with total angular momentum quantum number, $F=1/2$, in the lowest rotational level, $J=1/2$ of \PbF \,are close in energy and their spacing decreases with vibrational excitation. The experimental results show the spacing decreases to less than 20 MHz at $v=7$ and 8. The experimental work is complemented by new \textit{ab initio} calculations which support the results and allow predictions outside the experimental data range. The calculated radiative lifetimes of the relevant vibrationally excited states are of the order of 50 ms. This work was motivated by interest in using \PbF\, as a vehicle for future probes of the standard model of physics such as placing limits on the electron's electric dipole moment (\eEDM), molecular charge-parity non-conservation and Born-Oppenheimer breakdown effects for example.</description>

      <title>On the design space between molecular mechanics and machine learning force fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A force field as accurate as quantum mechanics (QM) and as fast as molecular mechanics (MM), with which one can simulate a biomolecular system efficiently enough and meaningfully enough to get quantitative insights, is among the most ardent dreams of biophysicists -- a dream, nevertheless, not to be fulfilled any time soon. Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) represent a meaningful endeavor towards this direction, where differentiable neural functions are parametrized to fit ab initio energies, and furthermore forces through automatic differentiation. We argue that, as of now, the utility of the MLFF models is no longer bottlenecked by accuracy but primarily by their speed (as well as stability and generalizability), as many recent variants, on limited chemical spaces, have long surpassed the chemical accuracy of $1$ kcal/mol -- the empirical threshold beyond which realistic chemical predictions are possible -- though still magnitudes slower than MM. Hoping to kindle explorations and designs of faster, albeit perhaps slightly less accurate MLFFs, in this review, we focus our attention on the design space (the speed-accuracy tradeoff) between MM and ML force fields. After a brief review of the building blocks of force fields of either kind, we discuss the desired properties and challenges now faced by the force field development community, survey the efforts to make MM force fields more accurate and ML force fields faster, envision what the next generation of MLFF might look like.</description>

      <title>Non-Iterative Disentangled Unitary Coupled-Cluster based on Lie-algebraic structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to their non-iterative nature, fixed Unitary Coupled-Cluster (UCC) ans\"atze are attractive for performing quantum chemistry Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) computations as they avoid pre-circuit measurements on a quantum computer. However, achieving chemical accuracy for strongly correlated systems with UCC requires further inclusion of higher-order fermionic excitations beyond triples increasing circuit depth. We introduce $k$-NI-DUCC, a fixed and Non-iterative Disentangled Unitary Coupled-Cluster compact ansatz, based on specific $"k"$ sets of "qubit" excitations, eliminating the needs for fermionic-type excitations. These elements scale linearly ($\mathcal{O}(n)$) by leveraging Lie algebraic structures, with $n$ being the number of qubits. The key excitations are screened through specific selection criteria, including the enforcement of all symmetries, to ensure the construction of a robust set of generators. NI-DUCC employs $"k"$ products of the exponential of $\mathcal{O}(n)$- anti-Hermitian Pauli operators, where each operator has a length $p$. This results in a fewer two-qubit CNOT gates circuit, $\mathcal{O}(knp)$, suitable for hardware implementations. Tested on LiH, H$_6$ and BeH$_2$, NI-DUCC-VQE achieves both chemical accuracy and rapid convergence even for molecules deviating significantly from equilibrium. It is hardware-efficient, reaching the exact Full Configuration Interaction energy solution at specific layers, while reducing significantly the VQE optimization steps. While NI-DUCC-VQE effectively addresses the gradient measurement bottleneck of ADAPT-VQE-like iterative algorithms, the classical computational cost of constructing the $\mathcal{O}(n)$ set of excitations increases exponentially with the number of qubits. We provide a first implementation for constructing the generators' set able to handle up to 20 qubits and discuss the efficiency perspectives.</description>
