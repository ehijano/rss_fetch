      <title>Green's function perspective on the nonlinear density response of quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive equations of motion for higher order density response functions using the theory of thermodynamic Green's functions. We also derive expressions for the higher order generalized dielectric functions and polarization functions. Moreover, we relate higher order response functions and higher order collision integrals within the Martin-Schwinger hierarchy. We expect our results to be highly relevant to the study of a variety of quantum many-body systems such as matter under extreme temperatures, densities, and pressures.</description>

      <title>Gapless dispersive continuum in a breathing kagome antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pursuit of quantum spin liquid (QSL) states in condensed matter physics has drawn attention to kagome antiferromagnets (AFM) where a two-dimensional corner-sharing network of triangles frustrates conventional magnetic orders. While quantum kagome AFMs based on Cu$^{2+}$ (3d$^9$, $s=\frac{1}{2}$) ions have been extensively studied, there is so far little work beyond copper-based systems. Here we present our bulk magnetization, specific heat and neutron scattering studies on single crystals of a new titanium fluoride Cs$_8$RbK$_3$Ti$_{12}$F$_{48}$ where Ti$^{3+}$ (3d$^1$, $s = \frac{1}{2}$) ions form a breathing quantum kagome antiferromagnet that does not order magnetically down to 1.5 K. Our comprehensive map of the dynamic response function $S(Q,\hbar\omega)$ acquired at 1.5 K where the heat capacity is T-linear reveals a dispersive continuum emanating from soft lines that extend along (100). The data indicate fractionalized spinon-like excitations with quasi-one-dimensional dispersion within a quasi-two-dimensional spin system.</description>

      <title>Atacamite Cu$_2$Cl(OH)$_3$ in High Magnetic Fields: Quantum Criticality and Dimensional Reduction of a Sawtooth-Chain Compound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an extensive high-field study of atacamite Cu$_2$Cl(OH)$_3$, a material realization of quantum sawtooth chains with weak interchain couplings, in continuous and pulsed magnetic fields up to 58 T. In particular, we have mapped the entropy landscape for fields as high as 35 T and have identified a field-induced quantum critical point at 21.9(1) T for $\mathbf{H} \parallel c$ axis. The quantum critical point separates field regions with and without magnetic order, evidenced by our thermodynamic study and $^1$H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, but lies far below full saturation of the magnetization. Corroborated by numerical results using density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations, we find this behavior associated with a decoupling of the sawtooth chain into two magnetic subsystems consisting of a spin-$1/2$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain (backbone of the sawtooth chain) in the presence of an exchange field produced by the remaining field-polarized spins.</description>

      <title>Pomeranchuk Instability Induced by an Emergent Higher-Order van Hove Singularity on the Distorted Kagome Surface of Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials hosting flat bands at the vicinity of the Fermi level promote exotic symmetry broken states. Common to many of these are van Hove singularities at saddle points of the dispersion or even higher-order van Hove singularities where the dispersion is flattened further. The band structure of kagome metals hosts both a flat band and two regular saddle points flanking a Dirac node. We investigate the kagome ferromagnetic metal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ using scanning tunneling spectroscopy. We identify a new mechanism by which a triangular distortion on its kagome Co$_3$Sn surface termination considerably flattens the saddle point dispersion, and induces an isolated higher-order van Hove singularity (HOvHS) with algebraically divergent density of states pinned to the Fermi energy. The distortion-induced HOvHS precipitates a Pomeranchuk instability of the Fermi surface, resulting in the formation of a series of nematic electronic states. We visualize the nematic order across an energy shell of about 100 meV in both real-, reciprocal-, and momentum-spaces, as a cascade of wavefunction distributions which spontaneously break the remaining rotational symmetry of the underlying distorted kagome lattice, without generating any additional translational symmetry breaking. It signifies the spontaneous removal of a subset of saddle points from the Fermi energy to lower energies. By tracking the electronic wavefunction structure across the deformed Fermi surface we further identify a charge pumping-like evolution of the wavefunction center of mass. The mechanism we find for the generation of higher-order saddle points under a kagome distortion may be common to other kagome materials, and potentially other lattice structures, suggesting a generic new avenue for inducing unconventional electronic instabilities towards exotic states of matter.</description>

      <title>Fermionic Mean-Field Theory as a Tool for Studying Spin Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Jordan--Wigner transformation permits one to convert spin $1/2$ operators into spinless fermion ones, or vice versa. In some cases, it transforms an interacting spin Hamiltonian into a noninteracting fermionic one which is exactly solved at the mean-field level. Even when the resulting fermionic Hamiltonian is interacting, its mean-field solution can provide surprisingly accurate energies and correlation functions. Jordan--Wigner is, however, only one possible means of interconverting spin and fermionic degrees of freedom. Here, we apply several such techniques to the XXZ and $J_1\text{--}J_2$ Heisenberg models, as well as to the pairing or reduced BCS Hamiltonian, with the aim of discovering which of these mappings is most useful in applying fermionic mean-field theory to the study of spin Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Topological superconductivity in a spin-orbit coupled Kondo lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the effect of spin-orbit coupling on a two-dimensional Kondo Lattice model, in which conduction electrons are antiferromagnetically coupled to a Yao-Lee spin liquid. When a Rashba spin-orbit interaction and a nearest-neighbor Kondo interaction is introduced, the low-energy Majorana bands become gapped and develop Chern numbers, protecting unidirectionally propagating Majorana edge modes. Our model describes a chiral topological superconductor with fractionalized charge-$e$ order parameter and spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry, which may be of interest for certain heavy fermion superconductors, such as UTe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Contrasting dynamical properties of single-Q and triple-Q magnetic orderings in a triangular lattice antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Q magnetic structures on triangular lattices, with their two-dimensional topological spin texture, have attracted significant interest. However, unambiguously confirming their formation by excluding the presence of three equally-populated single-Q domains remains challenging. In the metallic triangular lattice antiferromagnet Co1/3TaS2, two magnetic ground states have been suggested at different temperature ranges, with the low-temperature phase being a triple-Q structure corresponding to the highest-density Skyrmion lattice. Using inelastic neutron scattering (INS) and advanced spin dynamics simulations, we demonstrate a clear distinction in the excitation spectra between the single-Q and triple-Q phases of Co1/3TaS2 and, more generally, a triangular lattice. First, we refined the spin Hamiltonian by fitting the excitation spectra measured in its paramagnetic phase, allowing us to develop an unbiased model independent of magnetic ordering. Second, we observed that the two magnetically ordered phases in Co1/3TaS2 exhibit markedly different behaviors in their long-wavelength Goldstone modes. Our spin model, derived from the paramagnetic phase, confirms that these behaviors originate from the single-Q and triple-Q nature of the respective ordered phases, providing unequivocal evidence of the single-Q to triple-Q phase transition in Co1/3TaS2. Importantly, we propose that the observed contrast in the long-wavelength spin dynamics between the single-Q and triple-Q orderings is universal, offering a potentially unique way to distinguish a generic triple-Q ordering on a triangular lattice from its multi-domain single-Q counterparts. We describe its applicability with examples of similar hexagonal systems forming potential triple-Q orderings. (For the full abstract, please refer to the manuscript)</description>

      <title>Importance of the indirect exchange interaction $via$ $s$-states in altermagnetic HgMnO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electronic and magnetic properties of recently synthesized new perovskite phase of HgMnO$_3$ are studied. By means of $ab$ $initio$ DFT calculations this material was shown to be altermagnetic. We discuss features of its electronic structure and unveil the physical mechanism of anomalous suppression of antiferromagnetic exchange interaction in this material. While it is tempting to ascribe unexpectedly weak exchange interaction between nearest neighbors to crystal structure distortions, this is the indirect ferromagnetic exchange via Hg $6s$ states, which strongly affects the magnetic properties. This effect can be important not only for HgMnO$_3$, but also for many other transition metal compounds having empty $s$ states, placed not far above the Fermi level.</description>

      <title>The magnetic ground state of a non-symmorphic square-net lattice, TbAgSb2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated the magnetic properties of a non-symmorphic correlated material, TbAgSb2. It consists of a quasi-two-dimensional structure of Sb atoms which hosts topologically non-trivial fermions. We prepared high quality single crystals of the material. The magnetic and transport properties exhibit antiferromagnetic transition at 11.3 K. A strong magneto-crystalline anisotropy is observed with the magnetic moments preferentially aligned within the ab-plane at low temperatures. A broad peak in the magnetic susceptibility along H||c direction suggests influence of crystal electric field in magnetism, which is also manifested in the specific heat data. The temperature dependent electrical resistivity at high field shows interesting signature of field induced magnetic structure reorientation / superzone formation. These results highlight the significance of Sb square nets in a non-symmorphic correlated system exhibiting complex magnetism and electronic properties.</description>

      <title>Near room-temperature ferromagnetism from double-exchange in van der Waals material CrGeTe$_3$: evidence from optical conductivity under pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unexpected discovery of intrinsic ferromagnetism in layered van der Waals materials has sparked interest in both their fundamental properties and their potential for novel applications. Recent studies suggest near room-temperature ferromagnetism in the pressurized van der Waals crystal CrGeTe$_3$. We perform a comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigation of magnetism and electronic correlations in CrGeTe$_3$, combining broad-frequency reflectivity measurements with density functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory calculations. Our experimental optical conductivity spectra trace the signatures of developing ferromagnetic order and of the insulator-to-metal transition (IMT) as a function of temperature and hydrostatic pressure. With increasing pressure, we observe the emergence of a mid-infrared feature in the optical conductivity, indicating the development of strong orbital-selective correlations in the high-pressure ferromagnetic phase. We find a peculiar relationship between the plasma frequency and Curie temperature of CrGeTe$_3$, which strongly suggests that a double-exchange mechanism is responsible for the observed near room-temperature ferromagnetism. In contrast to previous studies, our results clearly demonstrate the existence of an optical gap in the metallic phase, ruling out the collapse of the charge transfer gap under pressure.</description>

      <title>Quantum many-body solver using artificial neural networks and its applications to strongly correlated electron systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the evolution of numerical methods, we are now aiming at not only qualitative understanding but also quantitative prediction and design of quantum many-body phenomena. As a novel numerical approach, machine learning techniques have been introduced in 2017 to analyze quantum many-body problems. Since then, proposed various novel approaches have opened a new era, in which challenging and fundamental problems in physics can be solved by machine learning methods. Especially, quantitative and accurate estimates of material-dependent physical properties of strongly correlated matter have now become realized by combining first-principles calculations with highly accurate quantum many-body solvers developed with the help of machine learning methods. Thus developed quantitative description of electron correlations will constitute a key element of materials science in the next generation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Restored Symmetry Protected Topological Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases are fundamental quantum many-body states of matter beyond Landau's paradigm. Here, we introduce the concept of quantum restored SPTs (QRSPTs), where the protecting symmetry is spontaneously broken at each instance in time, but restored after time average over quantum fluctuations, so that topological features re-emerge. To illustrate the concept, we study a one-dimensional fermionic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with fluctuating superconducting order. We solve this problem in several limiting cases using a variety of analytical methods and compare them to numerical (density matrix renormalization group) simulations which are valid throughout the parameter regime. We thereby map out the phase diagram and identify a QRSPT phase with topological features which are reminiscent from (but not identical to) the topology of the underlying free fermion system. The QRSPT paradigm thereby stimulates a new perspective for the constructive design of novel topological quantum many-body phases.</description>

      <title>Superselection Rules, Bosonization Duality in 1+1 Dimensions and Momentum-Space Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of the presence of conserved charges on the momentum-space entanglement of Quantum Field Theories (QFTs). We show that if a given model has superselection sectors, then it allows for different notions of momentum modes, each associated with a complete set of commuting observables. Applying this idea to investigate the entanglement of momentum degrees of freedom on both sides of the abelian Bosonization duality, we find that different tensor product partitions are mapped into each other and give explicit examples to sustain our findings. The conditions on which our conclusions may be generalized to other duality transformations, which require the introduction of a notion stricter than the most general possible, are laid and directions for further work are given.</description>

      <title>Electric and Magnetic Field-dependent Tunneling between Coupled Nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coupled quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) electron systems host rich emergent physics that cannot be accounted for by understanding isolated 1D electron systems alone. Open questions remain about how transport in these arrays can be manipulated by the application of external electric and magnetic fields. In this theoretical study, we consider a pair of coupled nanowires with non-interacting electrons. We find that a metal-insulator transition is induced by an out-of-plane magnetic field and a transverse potential bias on an array of such coupled wires. We demonstrate the existence of distinct conductance features and highlight the crucial role played by the field dependence of the interwire potential barrier on transport properties. These predictions agree well with transport experiments performed on coupled nanowires sketched on an LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface. Since our model makes minimal assumptions, we expect our predictions to hold for a wide class of coupled 1D systems.</description>

      <title>Magnetically Tuned Metal-Insulator Transition in LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ Nanowire Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A wide family of two dimensional (2D) systems, including stripe-phase superconductors, sliding Luttinger liquids, and anisotropic 2D materials, can be modeled by an array of coupled one-dimensional (1D) electron channels or nanowire arrays. Here we report experiments in arrays of conducting nanowires with gate and field tunable interwire coupling, that are programmed at the LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface. We find a magnetically-tuned metal-to-insulator transition in which the transverse resistance of the nanowire array increases by up to four orders of magnitude. To explain this behavior, we develop a minimal model of a coupled two-wire system which agrees well with observed phenomena. These nanowire arrays can serve as a model systems to understand the origin of exotic behavior in correlated materials via analog quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>Strongly Enhanced Electronic Bandstructure Renormalization by Light in Nanoscale Strained Regions of Monolayer MoS$_2$/Au(111) Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling the photoexcited quasiparticle (QP) dynamics in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides lays the foundation for exploring the strongly interacting, non-equilibrium 2D quasiparticle and polaritonic states in these quantum materials and for harnessing the properties emerging from these states for optoelectronic applications. In this study, scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy with light illumination at the tunneling junction is performed to investigate the QP dynamics in monolayer MoS$_2$ on an Au(111) substrate with nanoscale corrugations. The corrugations on the surface of the substrate induce nanoscale local strain in the overlaying monolayer MoS$_2$ single crystal, which result in energetically favorable spatial regions where photoexcited QPs, including excitons, trions, and electron-hole plasmas, accumulate. These strained regions exhibit pronounced electronic bandstructure renormalization as a function of the photoexcitation wavelength and intensity as well as the strain gradient, implying strong interplay among nanoscale structures, strain, and photoexcited QPs. In conjunction with the experimental work, we construct a theoretical framework that integrates non-uniform nanoscale strain into the electronic bandstructure of a monolayer MoS$_2$ lattice using a tight-binding approach combined with first-principle calculations. This methodology enables better understanding of the experimental observation of photoexcited QP localization in the nanoscale strain-modulated electronic bandstructure landscape. Our findings illustrate the feasibility of utilizing nanoscale architectures and optical excitations to manipulate the local electronic bandstructure of monolayer TMDs and to enhance the many-body interactions of excitons, which is promising for the development of nanoscale energy-adjustable optoelectronic and photonic technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define an index for invertible phases of two-dimensional fermionic and bosonic quantum spin systems without any additional symmetry. Conjecturally, it provides a microscopic definition of an invariant related to the chiral central charge of the boundary modes $c_- \bmod 24$ when the effective conformal field theory description is valid. Using this index, we prove that free fermionic systems with Chern number $\nu \bmod 48 \neq 0$ are in a non-trivial invertible phase.</description>

      <title>Low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum computation by gauging logical operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computation must be performed in a fault-tolerant manner to be realizable in practice. Recent progress has uncovered quantum error-correcting codes with sparse connectivity requirements and constant qubit overhead. Existing schemes for fault-tolerant logical measurement do not always achieve low qubit overhead. Here we present a low-overhead method to implement fault-tolerant logical measurement in a quantum error-correcting code by treating the logical operator as a symmetry and gauging it. The gauging measurement procedure introduces a high degree of flexibility that can be leveraged to achieve a qubit overhead that is linear in the weight of the operator being measured up to a polylogarithmic factor. This flexibility also allows the procedure to be adapted to arbitrary quantum codes. Our results provide a new, more efficient, approach to performing fault-tolerant quantum computation, making it more tractable for near-term implementation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological order is a promising basis for quantum error correction, a key milestone towards large-scale quantum computing. Floquet codes provide a dynamical scheme for this while also exhibiting Floquet-enriched topological order (FET) where anyons periodically undergo a measurement-induced automorphism that acts uniformly in space. We study deformed Floquet codes where automorphisms have a spatiotemporally heterogeneous distribution$\unicode{x2014}$the automorphisms "compete". We characterize the effect of this competition on Abelian-anyon FETs, showing how the evolution and loss of logical information are linked to the anyons that are invariant under the automorphisms' transition map or that localize at their boundaries. We present an example microscopic realization of this behavior using disorder in the dynamic automorphism color code. This naturally leads to a description of the space of its FETs, which we characterize by establishing when parameter-space paths connecting distinct FETs can preserve logical information. We also show that transitions between distinct FETs display criticality described by bond percolation. The perspective of competing automorphisms captures essential features of possible FETs and their transitions, and may elucidate key mechanisms involving topological order, automorphisms, and disorder.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first examples of topological phases of matter with uniform power for measurement-based quantum computation. This is possible thanks to a new framework for analyzing the computational properties of phases of matter that is more general than previous constructions, which were limited to short-range entangled phases in one dimension. We show that ground states of the toric code in an anisotropic magnetic field yield a natural, albeit non-computationally-universal, application of our framework. We then present a new model with topological order whose ground states are universal resources for MBQC. Both topological models are enriched by subsystem symmetries, and these symmetries protect their computational power. Our framework greatly expands the range of physical models that can be analyzed from the computational perspective.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.10754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, extended gapless phases with emergent SU(2)$_1$ conformal invariance occupying finite regions in the phase diagrams have been found in one-dimensional spin-1/2 models with nonsymmorphic $O_h$ symmetry groups. In this work, we investigate the question of whether the conditions for emergent SU(2)$_1$ invariance can be loosened. We find that besides the nonsymmorphic $O_h$ group, the other four smaller nonsymmorphic cubic groups including $O$, $T_h$, $T_d$ and $T$ can also give rise to emergent SU(2)$_1$ invariance. Minimal spin-1/2 models having these nonsymmorphic cubic groups as symmetry groups are constructed, and numerical evidences for the emergent SU(2)$_1$ invariance are provided. Our work is useful for understanding gapless phases in one-dimensional spin systems with nonsymmorphic symmetries.</description>

      <title>Lieb-Schultz-Mattis Theorem for 1D Quantum Magnets with Antiunitary Translation and Inversion Symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study quantum many-body systems in the presence of an exotic antiunitary translation or inversion symmetry involving time reversal. Based on a symmetry-twisting method and spectrum robustness, we propose that a half-integer spin chain that respects any of these two antiunitary crystalline symmetries in addition to the discrete $\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2$ global spin-rotation symmetry must either be gapless or possess degenerate ground states. This explains the gaplessness of a class of chiral spin models not indicated by the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem and its known extensions. Moreover, we present symmetry classes with minimal sets of generators that give nontrivial Lieb-Schultz-Mattis-type constraints, argued by the bulk-boundary correspondence in 2D symmetry-protected topological phases as well as lattice homotopy. Our results for detecting the ingappability of 1D quantum magnets from the interplay between spin-rotation symmetries and magnetic space groups are applicable to systems with a broader class of spin interactions, including Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and triple-product interactions.</description>

      <title>Unitary k-designs from random number-conserving quantum circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local random circuits scramble efficiently and accordingly have a range of applications in quantum information and quantum dynamics. With a global $U(1)$ charge however, the scrambling ability is reduced; for example, such random circuits do not generate the entire group of number-conserving unitaries. We establish two results using the statistical mechanics of $k$-fold replicated circuits. First, we show that finite moments cannot distinguish the ensemble that local random circuits generate from the Haar ensemble on the entire group of number-conserving unitaries. Specifically, the circuits form a $k_c$-design with $k_c = O(L^d)$ for a system in $d$ spatial dimensions with linear dimension $L$. Second, for $k &lt; k_c$, we derive bounds on the depth $\tau$ required for the circuit to converge to an approximate $k$-design. The depth is lower bounded by diffusion $k L^2 \ln(L) \lesssim \tau$. In contrast, without number conservation $\tau \sim \text{poly}(k) L$. The convergence of the circuit ensemble is controlled by the low-energy properties of a frustration-free quantum statistical model which spontaneously breaks $k$ $U(1)$ symmetries. We conjecture that the associated Goldstone modes set the spectral gap for arbitrary spatial and qudit dimensions, leading to an upper bound $\tau \lesssim k L^{d+2}$.</description>

      <title>On the feasibility of performing quantum chemistry calculations on quantum computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.02620v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum chemistry is envisioned as an early and disruptive application for quantum computers. Yet, closer scrutiny of the proposed algorithms shows that there are considerable difficulties along the way. Here, we propose two criteria for evaluating two leading quantum approaches for finding the ground state of molecules. The first criterion applies to the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. It sets an upper bound to the level of imprecision/decoherence that can be tolerated in quantum hardware as a function of the targeted precision, the number of gates and the typical energy contribution from states populated by decoherence processes. We find that decoherence is highly detrimental to the accuracy of VQE and performing relevant chemistry calculations would require performances that are expected for fault-tolerant quantum computers, not mere noisy hardware, even with advanced error mitigation techniques. Physically, the sensitivity of VQE to decoherence originates from the fact that, in VQE, the spectrum of the studied molecule has no correlation with the spectrum of the quantum hardware used to perform the computation.
  The second criterion applies to the quantum phase estimation (QPE) algorithm, which is often presented as the go-to replacement of VQE upon availability of (noiseless) fault-tolerant quantum computers. QPE requires an input state with a large enough overlap with the sought-after ground state. We provide a criterion to estimate quantitatively this overlap based on the energy and the energy variance of said input state. Using input states from a variety of state-of-the-art classical methods, we show that the scaling of this overlap with system size does display the standard orthogonality catastrophe, namely an exponential suppression with system size. This in turns leads to an exponentially reduced QPE success probability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01199v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically explore the interplay of fractal geometry and quantum entanglement by analyzing the von Neumann entropy (known as entanglement entropy) and the entanglement contour in the scaling limit. Adopting quadratic fermionic models on Sierpinski carpet, we uncover intriguing findings. For gapless ground states exhibiting a finite density of states at the chemical potential, we reveal a super-area law characterized by the presence of a logarithmic correction for area law in the scaling of entanglement entropy. This extends the well-established super-area law observed on translationally invariant Euclidean lattices where the Gioev-Klich-Widom conjecture regarding the asymptotic behavior of Toeplitz matrices holds significant influence. Furthermore, different from the fractal structure of the lattice, we observe the emergence of a novel self-similar and universal pattern termed an ``entanglement fractal'' in the entanglement contour data as we approach the scaling limit. Remarkably, this pattern bears resemblance to intricate Chinese paper-cutting designs. We provide general rules to artificially generate this fractal, offering insights into the universal scaling of entanglement entropy. Meanwhile, as the direct consequence of the entanglement fractal and beyond a single scaling behavior of entanglement contour in translation-invariant systems, we identify two distinct scaling behaviors in the entanglement contour of fractal systems. For gapped ground states, we observe that the entanglement entropy adheres to a generalized area law, with its dependence on the Hausdorff dimension of the boundary between complementary subsystems.</description>

      <title>Superluminal Propagation of Composite Collective Modes in Superconductor-Ferromagnet Heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconductor/ferromagnet/superconductor Josephson junctions are paradigmatic systems for studying the delicate interplay of superconductivity and magnetism via proximity effects as well as their composite excitations. Here, we analyse the collective modes (CM) in such a heterostructure by taking into account the interplay between the de-magnetisation field $H_{dem}$ and the field caused by the anisotropy of the ferromagnet $H_{an}$, which was previously neglected. It turns out that the spectrum of composite collective modes, $\omega(k)$, has a qualitatively different form in the case of $H_{dem}&lt;H_{an}$ and of $H_{dem}&gt;H_{an}$. In the first case, the dependence $\omega(k)$ has the same form as in previous studies, whereas in the second case, the spectrum looks completely different. In particular, for moderate or weak anisotropy in ferromagnet the group velocity of collective modes demonstrates inflection point where the group velocity become infinite and is superluminal. Furthermore, this point separates purely real and complex-conjugate solutions for the collective modes and is also {\it exception point}. We show that the difference of the CMs spectra can be revealed by Fiske experiment, i.\,e.\,by measuring the $I-V$ characteristics in the presence of magnetic field and voltage.</description>

Abstract: The chromium-trihalides (CrX3; X = Cl, Br, I) have long served as model systems for understanding magnetism and magneto-optics in ionic crystals, and they have recently also emerged as archetypes of magnetic two-dimensional (2D) Van der Waals materials. Although the physical properties of CrX3 compounds have now been explored in great depth, the use of impurity doping to generate new properties remains surprisingly underexplored. Here we report on the magnetic and magneto-optical properties of lanthanide-doped CrBr3, in which Yb3+ is introduced as a spin-bearing optical point defect. Narrow-line near-infrared dopant photoluminescence is efficiently sensitized by CrBr3-to-Yb3+ energy transfer. Magneto-optical measurements show facile spin manipulation of the paramagnetic Yb3+ impurities by the surrounding CrBr3 lattice. Photoluminescence data reveal that the Kramers spin degeneracies of the ground- and excited-state Yb3+ doublets are spontaneously lifted by strong magnetic exchange with neighboring Cr3+ ions, such that individual Yb3+ spin transitions are easily resolved even at zero external magnetic field. The temperature and field dependence of these splittings can be used to probe both local and long-range spin correlations. These results highlight the use of extrinsic optical impurities to add new spin-photonic functionality to this classic 2D Van der Waals magnet.</description>

Abstract: Super-moire materials represent a novel playground to engineer states of matter beyond the possibilities of conventional moire materials. However, from the computational point of view, understanding correlated matter in these systems requires solving models with several millions of atoms, a formidable task for state-of-the-art methods. Conventional wavefunction methods for correlated matter scale with a cubic power with the number of sites, a major challenge for super-moire materials. Here, we introduce a methodology capable of solving correlated states in super-moire materials by combining a kernel polynomial method with a quantics tensor cross matrix product state algorithm. This strategy leverages a mapping of the super-moire structure to a many-body Hilbert space efficiently sampled with a tensor cross matrix product state method, where individual evaluations are performed with a Chebyshev kernel polynomial algorithm. We demonstrate this approach with interacting super-moire systems with up to several millions of atoms, showing its ability to capture correlated states in moire-of-moire systems and domain walls between different moire systems. Our manuscript puts forward a widely applicable methodology to study correlated matter in ultra-long length scales, enabling rationalizing correlated super-moire phenomena.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo Simulation of Operator Dynamics and Entanglement in Dual-Unitary Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00953</link>

Abstract: We investigate operator dynamics and entanglement growth in dual-unitary circuits, a class of locally scrambled quantum systems that enables efficient simulation beyond the exponential complexity of the Hilbert space. By mapping the operator evolution to a classical Markov process,we perform Monte Carlo simulations to access the time evolution of local operator density and entanglement with polynomial computational cost. Our results reveal that the operator density converges exponentially to a steady-state value, with analytical bounds that match our simulations. Additionally, we observe a volume-law scaling of operator entanglement across different subregions,and identify a critical transition from maximal to sub-maximal entanglement growth, governed by the circuit's gate parameter. This transition, confirmed by both mean-field theory and Monte Carlo simulations, provides new insights into operator entanglement dynamics in quantum many-body systems. Our work offers a scalable computational framework for studying long-time operator evolution and entanglement, paving the way for deeper exploration of quantum information dynamics.</description>
