      <title>A Cold and Super-Puffy Planet on a Polar Orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of TOI-4507 b, a transiting sub-Saturn with a density $&lt;0.3$ g/cm$^3$ on a 105-day polar orbit around a $700$ Myr old F star. The transits were detected using data from TESS as well as the Antarctic telescope ASTEP. A joint analysis of the light curves and radial velocities from HARPS, FEROS, and CORALIE confirmed the planetary nature of the signal by limiting the mass to be below $30\,M_\oplus$ at $95\%$ confidence. The radial velocities also exhibit the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect and imply that the star's equatorial plane is tilted by $82.0_{-2.4}^{+2.6}$ deg with respect to the planet's orbital plane. With these characteristics, TOI-4507 b is one of longest-period planets for which the stellar obliquity has been measured, and is among the longest-period and youngest ''super-puff'' planets yet discovered.</description>

      <title>The OATMEAL Survey. III. An Aligned Transiting Warm Brown Dwarf and Evidence for Quiescent Brown Dwarf Migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first measurement of the sky-projected orbital obliquity of a benchmark transiting brown dwarf host, HIP 33609, as a part of the Orbital Architectures of Transiting Massive Exoplanets And Low-mass stars (OATMEAL) survey. HIP 33609 b is a highly eccentric, 68 $M_{\rm J}$ brown dwarf orbiting a 10,300 K, A-type star with an orbital period of 39 days. Its host star is a known member of the 150 Myr old MELANGE-6 moving group, making it an excellent laboratory for testing sub-stellar evolutionary models. Using in-transit spectra collected by the Planet Finder Spectrograph (PFS) on the Magellan II Clay 6.5 m telescope, we measured a sky-projected orbital obliquity of $|\lambda|= 12.7 \pm 1.3${\deg}. The mass of the brown dwarf is most consistent with a stellar-like fragmentation formation history followed by a period of migration. Given the high eccentricity ($e=0.557$) but low orbital obliquity of the brown dwarf, we claim that coplanar high eccentricity tidal migration seems to be the most plausible pathway, however, it remains difficult to conclusively rule out other migration mechanisms. The low orbital obliquity for HIP 33609 is consistent with previous measurements of high mass-ratio companions, and bears a striking resemblance to the obliquity distribution of transiting warm Jupiters. We suggest brown dwarfs may follow a dynamically quiescent migration pathway, consistent with them forming in isolated conditions.</description>

      <title>What's in Your Transit? Towards Reliably Getting $5\times$ More Science from Exoplanet Transit Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exoplanetary science heavily relies on transit depth ($D$) measurements. Yet, as instrumental precision increases, the uncertainty on $D$ appears to increasingly drift from expectations driven solely by photon-noise. Here we characterize this shortfall (the Transit-Depth Precision Problem, TDPP), by defining an amplification factor, $A$, quantifying the discrepancy between the measured transit-depth uncertainty and the measured baseline scatter on a same time bin size. While in theory $A$ should be $\sim\sqrt{3}$, we find that it can reach values $\gtrsim$10 notably due to correlations between $D$ and the limb-darkening coefficients (LDCs). This means that (1) the performance of transit-based exoplanet studies (e.g., atmospheric studies) can be substantially improved with reliable priors on LDCs and (2) low-fidelity priors on the LDCs can yield substantial biases on $D$--potentially affecting atmospheric studies due to the wavelength-dependence of such biases. For the same reason, biases may emerge on stellar-density and planet-shape/limb-asymmetry measurements. With current photometric precisions, we recommend using a 3$^{\rm rd}$-order polynomial law and a 4$^{\rm th}$-order non-linear law, as they provide an optimal compromise between bias and $A$, while testing the fidelity for each parametrization. While their use combined with existing LDC priors (10-20% uncertainty) currently implies $A\sim10$, we show that targeted improvements to limb-darkening models can bring $A$ down to $\sim2$. Improving stellar models and transit-fitting practices is thus essential to fully exploit transit datasets, and reliably increasing their scientific yield by $5\times$, thereby enabling the same science with up to $25\times$ fewer transits.</description>

      <title>Semianalytical Accretion-Tracer Emission: Forming Planets Are Intrinsically Faint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct-imaging surveys have looked for accreting planets through their accretion tracers such as H alpha but have been less fruitful than expected. However, up to now, hydrogen-line emission at accreting planets has been estimated primarily with extrapolations of stellar-scaling relationships or with theoretical spherically-symmetric computations. To predict the line emission intensity during the formation phase, we wish to follow the consequences of angular momentum conservation of the material accreting onto a gas giant in a protoplanetary disc. We focus on the limiting case that magnetospheric accretion does not occur, which yields a conservative estimate of the line emission and might correspond to certain epochs during formation. We extend but simplify an existing analytical description of the multidimensional gas flow onto an accreting gas giant, the ballistic infall model, and combine this with detailed shock emission models. Applying this to data from a global planet formation model, we confirm that the line-emitting accretion rate is a minuscule fraction of the gas inflow into the Hill sphere. Also, forming planets are mostly fainter than PDS 70 b and c or WISPIT 2 b, with a maximum H alpha line luminosity Lline near 1e-7 Lsol, roughly independent of planet mass. Most surveys have not been sensitive to such faint planets. Other hydrogen lines in the NIR are fainter by 1--2 dex. This implies that accreting planets are fainter than from past estimates, such that the non-detections are not as constraining as thought. Accreting super-Jupiters may well be present, and a deeper look and closer in to the host stars could well reveal many forming planets.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Model Comparison and Significance: Widespread Errors and how to Correct Them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayes factors have become a popular tool in exoplanet spectroscopy for testing atmosphere models against one another. We show that the commonly used method for converting these values into significance "sigmas" is invalid. The formula is neither justified nor recommended by its original paper, and overestimates the confidence of results. We use simple examples to demonstrate the invalidity and prior sensitivity of this approach. We review the standard Bayesian interpretation of the Bayes factor as an odds ratio and recommend its use in conjunction with the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or Bayesian Predictive Information Criterion Simplified (BPICS) in future analyses (Python implementations are included) . As a concrete example, we refit the WASP-39 b NIRSpec transmission spectrum to test for the presence of SO$_2$. The prevalent, incorrect significance calculation gives $3.67\sigma$ whereas the standard Bayesian interpretation yields a null model probability $p(\mathcal{B}|y)=0.0044$. Surveying the exoplanet atmosphere literature, we find widespread use of the erroneous formula. In order to avoid overstating observational results and estimating observation times too low, the community should return to the standard Bayesian interpretation.</description>

      <title>Icy or Rocky? Convective or Stable? New interior models of Uranus and Neptune</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new framework for constructing agnostic and yet physical models for planetary interiors and apply it to Uranus and Neptune. Unlike previous research that either impose rigid assumptions or rely on simplified empirical profiles, our approach bridges both paradigms. Starting from randomly generated density profiles, we apply an iterative algorithm that converges toward models that simultaneously satisfy hydrostatic equilibrium, match the observed gravitational moments, and remain thermodynamically and compositionally consistent. The inferred interior models for Uranus and Neptune span a wide range of possible interior structures, in particular encompassing both water-dominated and rock-dominated configurations (rock-to-water mass ratios between 0.04-3.92 for Uranus and 0.20-1.78 for Neptune). All models contain convective regions with ionic water and have temperature-pressure profiles that remain above the demixing curves for hydrogen-helium-water mixtures. This offers both a plausible explanation for the observed non-dipolar magnetic fields and indicates that no hydrogen-helium-water demixing occurs. We find a higher H-He mass fraction in the outermost convection zones for Uranus (0.62-0.73) compared to Neptune (0.25-0.49) and that Uranus' magnetic field is likely generated deeper in the interior compared to Neptune. We infer upper limits of 0.69-0.74 (Uranus) vs. 0.78-0.92 (Neptune) for the outer edges of the dynamo regions in units of normalised radii. Overall, our findings challenge the conventional classification of Uranus and Neptune as "ice giants" and underscore the need for improved observational data or formation constraints to break compositional degeneracy.</description>

      <title>A planetary system with a sub-Neptune planet in the habitable zone of TOI-2093</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. We aim to confirm and measure the mass of the transiting planet candidate around the K5V star TOI-2093, previously announced by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) project. Methods. We combined photometric data from 32 sectors between 2019 and 2024 with 86 radial velocity measurements obtained with the CARMENES spectrograph over a period of 2.4 years, along with a series of ground-based, broadband photometric monitoring campaigns to characterize the host star and the transiting planet candidate, as well as to search for additional planets in the system. Our data indicate that TOI-2093 is a main-sequence star located at a distance of 83 pc, with solar metallicity, and a rotation period of 43.8 +- 1.8 d. Results. We have confirmed the planetary nature of the TESS transiting planet candidate, named TOI-2093 c, through the detection of its Keplerian signal in the spectroscopic data. We measured a planetary radius of 2.30 +- 0.12 Rearth, a Neptune-like mass of 15.8 +- 3.7 Mearth, and an orbital period of 53.81149 +- 0.00017 d. This makes TOI-2093 c the smallest exoplanet known in the habitable zone of a main-sequence FGK star. Given its size and relatively high density, TOI-2093 c belongs to a class of planets with no analog in the Solar System. In addition, the CARMENES data revealed the presence of a second planet candidate with a minimum mass of 10.6 +- 2.5 Mearth and an orbital period of 12.836 +- 0.021 d. This inner planet, which we designated TOI-2093 b, shows no detectable photometric transit in the TESS light curves. The orbital planes of the two planets are misaligned by more than 1.6 deg despite the near 4:1 mean-motion resonance of their orbital periods.</description>

      <title>Exoplanets beyond the Conservative Habitable Zone: I. Habitability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Habitable Zone (HZ) is defined by the possibility of sustaining liquid water on a planetary surface. In the Solar System, the HZ for a conservative climate model extends approximately between the orbits of Earth and Mars. We elaborate on earlier HZ models and apply an analytical climate model of the temperature distribution on tidally-locked planets to extend the HZ. We show that planets orbiting M- and K-dwarf stars may maintain liquid water on their night side, significantly closer to their host star than the inner border of the conservative HZ. We calculate the extended borders of the HZ in the flux-effective temperature diagram. This extension may explain the presence of water vapor and other volatile gases in the transmission spectra of warm Super-Earth-sized exoplanets closely orbiting M dwarfs, recently detected by JWST. We also mention the HZ extension outwards, due to subglacial liquid water in the form of intra-glacial lakes or subglacial melting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the extension of the Habitable Zone (HZ) due to the presence of liquid water on the night side of tidally locked planets, modelled in this and earlier works, significantly increases the number of potentially habitable planets. We calculate the occurrence of habitable planets orbiting M-, K-, and G-dwarf stars within the conservative and extended HZ, beyond the inner and outer boundaries of the conservative HZ. Integrating over the phase space in the HZ diagram and normalizing our calculation to relatively recent analyses of the Kepler data, we show that potentially habitable planets may be as much as 50 times more abundant than in the lower estimate, limited to the conservative HZ of G-type stars only. For an intermediate heat transport rate on tidally locked planets, we find that the extended HZ could imply more than one habitable planet per star, and hundreds of habitable planets within 10 pc from Earth.</description>

      <title>Powerful lightning on Venus constrained by atmospheric NO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Signs of lightning on Venus have long been sought, including by space missions and ground-based telescopes searching for optical flashes, plasma waves, or radio signatures. These efforts have yielded conflicting findings regarding the presence or absence of lightning in Venus's atmosphere. In this study we adopt an indirect approach to constrain the prevalence of lightning on Venus, using the chemical by-products it produces in Venus's atmosphere. Nitric oxide (NO) is a key tracer species of lightning, being exclusively generated by lightning in Venus's lower atmosphere. By calculating the present rate of atmospheric destruction of NO in Venus's atmosphere through photochemical-kinetic modelling, we constrain the lightning power required to sustain the estimated NO abundances on modern Venus. The reported NO constraints require lightning to generate at-least three times the power released on Earth; consistent with either a higher rate of strikes, or greater energy per strike, or a combination of both. Limited detections of optical flashes within the clouds could point to lightning striking deeper in the atmosphere and nearer the surface -- with the result that its optical flashes are obscured by the clouds -- driven by triboelectric charging during volcanic eruptions or wind interactions with surface sediments. Our findings underscore the importance for future missions of confirming lightning on Venus, either by verifying the below-cloud NO abundance, or by detecting another unambiguous lightning signature, to provide the first definitive evidence of lightning on a rocky planet other than Earth.</description>

      <title>Technosignatures of Self-Replicating Probes in the Solar System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a much-neglected area of SETI: solar system techno-signatures. As our cursory solar system exploration consolidates into commercial industrialisation, it is crucial that we determine what to look for and where. We first consider the rationale for interstellar self-replicating probes and their implications for the Fermi paradox. Whether for defensive or exploratory reasons, self-replicating probes are a rational strategy for Galactic investigation. We determine that self-replicating probes will systematically explore the Galaxy by tracking resources of sufficient metallicity. We focus on the resource requirements of a self-replicating interstellar probe that may have visited our solar system. After considering asteroid resources, we suggest that evidence of asteroidal processing will be difficult to discern from natural processes given the constraints imposed by self-replication. We further determine that the Moon is an ideal base of manufacturing operations. We suggest that nuclear reactors, such as the Magnox reactor model, can feasibly be constructed from lunar resources which will have left isotopic ratio signatures of Th-232/Nd-144 and/or Th-232/Ba-137. We further suggest that in anticipatory economic trade for resources, a self-replicating probe may have left artefacts buried with asteroidal resources on the Moon. Such gifts would be detectable and accessible only once a threshold of technological sophistication has been achieved. An obvious gift in trade for the resources utilised would be a universal constructor.</description>

      <title>Imaging Venus' surface at night in the near-IR from above its clouds: New analytical models for the effective spatial resolution, illustrated with new Parker Solar Probe data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.07848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are a handful of spectral windows in the near-IR through which we can see down to Venus' surface on the night side of the planet. The surface of our sister planet has thus been imaged by sensors on Venus-orbiting platforms (Venus Express, Akatsuki) and during fly-by with missions to other planets (Galileo, Cassini). The most tantalizing finding, so far, is the hint of possible active volcanism. However, the thermal radiation emitted by Venus' searing surface (c. 475 degrees C) has to get through the opaque clouds between 50 and 70 km altitude, as well as the sub-cloud atmosphere. In the clouds, the light is not absorbed but scattered, indeed, many times. This results in blurring the surface imagery to the point where the smallest discernible feature is roughly 100 km in size, full-width half-max (FWHM), and this has been reproduced using numerical models. We propose a new analytical modeling framework for predicting the width of the atmospheric point-spread function (APSF) that determines the effective resolution of surface imaging from space. Our best estimates of the APSF width for the 1-to-1.2 micron spectral range are clustered around 130 km FWHM. Interestingly, this is somewhat larger than the accepted value of 100 km based on both visual image inspection and detailed numerical simulations. Lastly, we apply the new modeling framework to the fly-by imaging by the Parker Solar Probe in a somewhat shorter wavelength band.</description>

      <title>Badminton Birdie-Like Aerodynamic Alignment of Drifting Dust Grains by Subsonic Gaseous Flows in Protoplanetary Disks</title>

Abstract: Recent (sub)millimeter polarization observations of protoplanetary disks reveal toroidally aligned, effectively prolate dust grains large enough (at least ~100 $\mu$m) to efficiently scatter millimeter light. The alignment mechanism for these grains remains unclear. We explore the possibility that gas drag aligns grains through gas-dust relative motion when the grain's center of mass is offset from its geometric center, analogous to a badminton birdie's alignment in flight. A simple grain model of two non-identical spheres illustrates how a grain undergoes damped oscillations from flow-induced restoring torques which align its geometric center in the flow direction relative to its center of mass. Assuming specular reflection and subsonic flow, we derive an analytical equation of motion for spheroids where the center of mass can be shifted away from the spheroid's geometric center. We show that a prolate or an oblate grain can be aligned with the long axis parallel to the gas flow when the center of mass is shifted along that axis. Both scenarios can explain the required effectively prolate grains inferred from observations. Application to a simple disk model shows that the alignment timescales are shorter than or comparable to the orbital time. The grain alignment direction in a disk depends on the disk (sub-)structure and grain Stokes number (St) with azimuthal alignment for large St grains in sub-Keplerian smooth gas disks and for small St grains near the gas pressure extrema, such as rings and gaps.</description>

      <title>Revising the Giant Planet Mass-Metallicity Relation: Deciphering the Formation Sequence of Giant Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20428</link>

Abstract: The rate at which giant planets accumulate solids and gas is a critical component of planet formation models, yet it is extremely challenging to predict from first principles. Characterizing the heavy element (everything other than hydrogen and helium) content of giant planets provides important clues about their provenance. Using thermal evolution models with updated H-He EOS and atmospheric boundary condition that varies with envelope metallicity, we quantify the bulk heavy element content of 147 warm ($&lt; 1000$ K) giant planets with well-measured masses and radii, more than tripling the sample size studied in Thorngren et al. 2016. These measurements reveal that the population's heavy element mass follows the relation $M_{\rm Z} = M_{\rm core} + f_Z (M_{\rm p} - M_{\rm core})$, with $M_{\rm core} = 14.7^{+1.8}_{-1.6}$ Earth masses (M$_\oplus$), $f_Z = 0.09 \pm 0.01$, and an astrophysical scatter of $0.66 \pm 0.08 \times M_Z$. The classical core-accretion scenario ($Z_{\rm p} = 1$ at 10 M$_\oplus$ and $Z_{\rm p} = 0.5$ at 20 M$_\oplus$) is inconsistent with the population. At low planet masses ($&lt;&lt; 150$ M$_\oplus$), $M_{\rm Z} \sim M_{\rm core}$ and as a result, $Z_{\rm p} = M_{\rm Z} / M_{\rm p}$ declines linearly with $M_{\rm p}$. However, bulk metallicity does not continue to decline with planet mass and instead flattens out at $f_Z \sim 0.09$ ($\sim 7 \times$ solar metallicity). When normalized by stellar metallicity, $Z_{\rm p} / Z_\star$ flattens out at $3.3 \pm 0.5$ at high planet masses. This explicitly shows that giant planets continue to accrete material enriched in heavy elements during the gas accretion phase.</description>

      <title>A quantitative analysis of Galilei's observations of Jupiter satellites from the Sidereus Nuncius</title>

Abstract: We present a new careful and comprehensive analysis the observations of the satellites of Jupiter from the Sidereus Nuncius that extends and complements previous similar studies. Each observation is compared to the predictions obtained using a modern sky simulator, verifying and trying to understand them individually. The work considers both the information that can be extracted from the sketches and the angular measurements reported by Galilei. Angular measurements allow assessing the absolute accuracy in relation to modern ephemerides. We evaluate the performances of the telescope in terms of separation power of close-by satellites and the inefficiency in the detection connected to the proximity to the disk. A sinusoidal fit of the data, allows measuring the relative major semi-axes of the satellites' orbits and their periods with a statistical precision of 2-4\% and 0.1-0.3\% respectively. The posterior fit error is used to estimate the measurements precision. We show that with this data one can infer in a convincing way the third law of Kepler for the Jupiter system. The 1:2:4 orbital resonance between the periods of Io and Europa/Ganymede can be determined with \% precision. In order to obtain these results it is important to separate the four datasets. This operation was an extremely difficult task for Galilei. Nevertheless we show how some indication on the periods emerge from the using the modern Lomb-Scargle technique on the full data-set. We briefly extend the use of the simulator to verify the accuracy in the seven observations of the Moon and the performance in reproducing the Pleiades, the Orion belt, the Orion head and the Beehive cluster. Finally we present images obtained with a replica of the telescope that highlights the challenges of these observations thus confirming the excellence underlying this amazing set of early scientific data.</description>

      <title>Multi-directional investigations on quiet time suprathermal ions measured by ASPEX-STEPS on-board Aditya L1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin, acceleration and anisotropy of suprathermal ions in the interplanetary medium during quiet periods have remained poorly understood issues in solar wind physics. To address these aspects, we derive the spectral indices for the quiet time suprathermal ions based on the measurements by the four directionally separated sensors that are part of the Supra-Thermal and Energetic Particle Spectrometer (STEPS) of Aditya Solar Wind Particle EXperiment (ASPEX) on-board Aditya L1 spacecraft. Three out of four STEPS sensors Parker Spiral (PS), Inter-Mediate (IM), Earth Pointing (EP) are in one plane (nearly aligned with the ecliptic plane) while the fourth sensor North Pointing (NP) is in a mutually orthogonal plane. The energy ranges covered by the PS, IM, EP and NP sensors are 0.36-1.32 MeV, 0.14-1.22 MeV, 0.39-1.33 MeV and 0.12-1.23 MeV respectively. The quiet intervals are identified during January November, 2024 and the derived spectral indices (differential directional flux versus energy) are found to be in the range of 2.0 for all directions in the time scale of a few days revealing isotropic nature of their distribution. Further analysis of elemental abundance ratios (3He/4He, Fe/O, and C/O) during the same quiet intervals obtained from the Ultra-Low Energy Isotope Spectrometer (ULEIS) on board the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) spacecraft suggests possible contributions from the leftover ions from the previous impulsive (Solar flares) and gradual events (CMEs) in the quiet time suprathermal ion pool.</description>
