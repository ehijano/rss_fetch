      <title>Characterizing control between interacting subsystems with deep Jacobian estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological function arises through the dynamical interactions of multiple subsystems, including those between brain areas, within gene regulatory networks, and more. A common approach to understanding these systems is to model the dynamics of each subsystem and characterize communication between them. An alternative approach is through the lens of control theory: how the subsystems control one another. This approach involves inferring the directionality, strength, and contextual modulation of control between subsystems. However, methods for understanding subsystem control are typically linear and cannot adequately describe the rich contextual effects enabled by nonlinear complex systems. To bridge this gap, we devise a data-driven nonlinear control-theoretic framework to characterize subsystem interactions via the Jacobian of the dynamics. We address the challenge of learning Jacobians from time-series data by proposing the JacobianODE, a deep learning method that leverages properties of the Jacobian to directly estimate it for arbitrary dynamical systems from data alone. We show that JacobianODEs outperform existing Jacobian estimation methods on challenging systems, including high-dimensional chaos. Applying our approach to a multi-area recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on a working memory selection task, we show that the "sensory" area gains greater control over the "cognitive" area over learning. Furthermore, we leverage the JacobianODE to directly control the trained RNN, enabling precise manipulation of its behavior. Our work lays the foundation for a theoretically grounded and data-driven understanding of interactions among biological subsystems.</description>

      <title>An Uncertainty-Aware Dynamic Decision Framework for Progressive Multi-Omics Integration in Classification Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background and Objective: High-throughput multi-omics technologies have proven invaluable for elucidating disease mechanisms and enabling early diagnosis. However, the high cost of multi-omics profiling imposes a significant economic burden, with over reliance on full omics data potentially leading to unnecessary resource consumption. To address these issues, we propose an uncertainty-aware, multi-view dynamic decision framework for omics data classification that aims to achieve high diagnostic accuracy while minimizing testing costs. Methodology: At the single-omics level, we refine the activation functions of neural networks to generate Dirichlet distribution parameters, utilizing subjective logic to quantify both the belief masses and uncertainty mass of classification results. Belief mass reflects the support of a specific omics modality for a disease class, while the uncertainty parameter captures limitations in data quality and model discriminability, providing a more trustworthy basis for decision-making. At the multi omics level, we employ a fusion strategy based on Dempster-Shafer theory to integrate heterogeneous modalities, leveraging their complementarity to boost diagnostic accuracy and robustness. A dynamic decision mechanism is then applied that omics data are incrementally introduced for each patient until either all data sources are utilized or the model confidence exceeds a predefined threshold, potentially before all data sources are utilized. Results and Conclusion: We evaluate our approach on four benchmark multi-omics datasets, ROSMAP, LGG, BRCA, and KIPAN. In three datasets, over 50% of cases achieved accurate classification using a single omics modality, effectively reducing redundant testing. Meanwhile, our method maintains diagnostic performance comparable to full-omics models and preserves essential biological insights.</description>

      <title>cp_measure: API-first feature extraction for image-based profiling workflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological image analysis has traditionally focused on measuring specific visual properties of interest for cells or other entities. A complementary paradigm gaining increasing traction is image-based profiling - quantifying many distinct visual features to form comprehensive profiles which may reveal hidden patterns in cellular states, drug responses, and disease mechanisms. While current tools like CellProfiler can generate these feature sets, they pose significant barriers to automated and reproducible analyses, hindering machine learning workflows. Here we introduce cp_measure, a Python library that extracts CellProfiler's core measurement capabilities into a modular, API-first tool designed for programmatic feature extraction. We demonstrate that cp_measure features retain high fidelity with CellProfiler features while enabling seamless integration with the scientific Python ecosystem. Through applications to 3D astrocyte imaging and spatial transcriptomics, we showcase how cp_measure enables reproducible, automated image-based profiling pipelines that scale effectively for machine learning applications in computational biology.</description>

      <title>BioMARS: A Multi-Agent Robotic System for Autonomous Biological Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) have the potential to transform biological research by enabling autonomous experimentation. Yet, their application remains constrained by rigid protocol design, limited adaptability to dynamic lab conditions, inadequate error handling, and high operational complexity. Here we introduce BioMARS (Biological Multi-Agent Robotic System), an intelligent platform that integrates LLMs, VLMs, and modular robotics to autonomously design, plan, and execute biological experiments. BioMARS uses a hierarchical architecture: the Biologist Agent synthesizes protocols via retrieval-augmented generation; the Technician Agent translates them into executable robotic pseudo-code; and the Inspector Agent ensures procedural integrity through multimodal perception and anomaly detection. The system autonomously conducts cell passaging and culture tasks, matching or exceeding manual performance in viability, consistency, and morphological integrity. It also supports context-aware optimization, outperforming conventional strategies in differentiating retinal pigment epithelial cells. A web interface enables real-time human-AI collaboration, while a modular backend allows scalable integration with laboratory hardware. These results highlight the feasibility of generalizable, AI-driven laboratory automation and the transformative role of language-based reasoning in biological research.</description>

      <title>A Real-Time Digital Twin for Type 1 Diabetes using Simulation-Based Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately estimating parameters of physiological models is essential to achieving reliable digital twins. For Type 1 Diabetes, this is particularly challenging due to the complexity of glucose-insulin interactions. Traditional methods based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo struggle with high-dimensional parameter spaces and fit parameters from scratch at inference time, making them slow and computationally expensive. In this study, we propose a Simulation-Based Inference approach based on Neural Posterior Estimation to efficiently capture the complex relationships between meal intake, insulin, and glucose level, providing faster, amortized inference. Our experiments demonstrate that SBI not only outperforms traditional methods in parameter estimation but also generalizes better to unseen conditions, offering real-time posterior inference with reliable uncertainty quantification.</description>

      <title>A computational pipeline for clustering left atrial appendage morphology via elastic shape analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08685v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Morphological variations in the left atrial appendage (LAA) are associated with different levels of ischemic stroke risk for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Studying LAA morphology can elucidate mechanisms behind this association and lead to the development of advanced stroke risk stratification tools. However, current categorical descriptions of LAA morphologies are qualitative and inconsistent across studies, which impedes advancements in our understanding of stroke pathogenesis in AF. To mitigate these issues, we introduce a quantitative pipeline that combines elastic shape analysis with unsupervised learning for the categorization of LAA morphology in AF patients. As part of our pipeline, we compute pairwise elastic distances between LAA meshes from a cohort of 20 AF patients, and leverage these distances to cluster our shape data. We demonstrate that our method clusters LAA morphologies based on distinctive shape features, overcoming the innate inconsistencies of current LAA categorization systems, and paving the way for improved stroke risk metrics using objective LAA shape groups.</description>

      <title>Drug Discovery SMILES-to-Pharmacokinetics Diffusion Models with Deep Molecular Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in every stage of drug development. One challenge facing drug discovery AI is that drug pharmacokinetic (PK) datasets are often collected independently from each other, often with limited overlap, creating data overlap sparsity. Data sparsity makes data curation difficult for researchers looking to answer research questions in poly-pharmacy, drug combination research, and high-throughput screening. We propose Imagand, a novel SMILES-to-Pharmacokinetic (S2PK) diffusion model capable of generating an array of PK target properties conditioned on SMILES inputs. We show that Imagand-generated synthetic PK data closely resembles real data univariate and bivariate distributions, and improves performance for downstream tasks. Imagand is a promising solution for data overlap sparsity and allows researchers to efficiently generate ligand PK data for drug discovery research. Code is available at https://github.com/bing1100/Imagand.</description>

      <title>Inherited or produced? Inferring protein production kinetics when protein counts are shaped by a cell's division history</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09374v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inferring protein production kinetics for dividing cells is complicated due to protein inheritance from the mother cell. For instance, fluorescence measurements -- commonly used to assess gene activation -- may reflect not only newly produced proteins but also those inherited through successive cell divisions. In such cases, observed protein levels in any given cell are shaped by its division history. As a case study, we examine activation of the glc3 gene in yeast involved in glycogen synthesis and expressed under nutrient-limiting conditions. We monitor this activity using snapshot fluorescence measurements via flow cytometry, where GFP expression reflects glc3 promoter activity. A na\"ive analysis of flow cytometry data ignoring cell division suggests many cells are active with low expression. Explicitly accounting for the (non-Markovian) effects of cell division and protein inheritance makes it impossible to write down a tractable likelihood -- a key ingredient in physics-inspired inference, defining the probability of observing data given a model. The dependence on a cell's division history breaks the assumptions of standard (Markovian) master equations, rendering traditional likelihood-based approaches inapplicable. Instead, we adapt conditional normalizing flows (a class of neural network models designed to learn probability distributions) to approximate otherwise intractable likelihoods from simulated data. In doing so, we find that glc3 is mostly inactive under stress, showing that while cells occasionally activate the gene, expression is brief and transient.</description>
