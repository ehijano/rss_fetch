      <title>Running Markov Chain Monte Carlo on Modern Hardware and Software</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Today, cheap numerical hardware offers huge amounts of parallel computing power, much of which is used for the task of fitting neural networks to data. Adoption of this hardware to accelerate statistical Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) applications has been much slower. In this chapter, we suggest some patterns for speeding up MCMC workloads using the hardware (e.g., GPUs, TPUs) and software (e.g., PyTorch, JAX) that have driven progress in deep learning over the last fifteen years or so. We offer some intuitions for why these new systems are so well suited to MCMC, and show some examples (with code) where we use them to achieve dramatic speedups over a CPU-based workflow. Finally, we discuss some potential pitfalls to watch out for.</description>

      <title>Conjugate gradient methods for high-dimensional GLMMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) are a widely used tool in statistical analysis. The main bottleneck of many computational approaches lies in the inversion of the high dimensional precision matrices associated with the random effects. Such matrices are typically sparse; however, the sparsity pattern resembles a multi partite random graph, which does not lend itself well to default sparse linear algebra techniques. Notably, we show that, for typical GLMMs, the Cholesky factor is dense even when the original precision is sparse. We thus turn to approximate iterative techniques, in particular to the conjugate gradient (CG) method. We combine a detailed analysis of the spectrum of said precision matrices with results from random graph theory to show that CG-based methods applied to high-dimensional GLMMs typically achieve a fixed approximation error with a total cost that scales linearly with the number of parameters and observations. Numerical illustrations with both real and simulated data confirm the theoretical findings, while at the same time illustrating situations, such as nested structures, where CG-based methods struggle.</description>

      <title>Survival of the Notable: Gender Asymmetry in Wikipedia Collective Deliberations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Communities on the web rely on open conversation forums for a number of tasks, including governance, information sharing, and decision making. However these forms of collective deliberation can often result in biased outcomes. A prime example are Articles for Deletion (AfD) discussions on Wikipedia, which allow editors to gauge the notability of existing articles, and that, as prior work has suggested, may play a role in perpetuating the notorious gender gap of Wikipedia. Prior attempts to address this question have been hampered by access to narrow observation windows, reliance on limited subsets of both biographies and editorial outcomes, and by potential confounding factors. To address these limitations, here we adopt a competing risk survival framework to fully situate biographical AfD discussions within the full editorial cycle of Wikipedia content. We find that biographies of women are nominated for deletion faster than those of men, despite editors taking longer to reach a consensus for deletion of women, even after controlling for the size of the discussion. Furthermore, we find that AfDs about historical figures show a strong tendency to result into the redirecting or merging of the biography under discussion into other encyclopedic entries, and that there is a striking gender asymmetry: biographies of women are redirected or merged into biographies of men more often than the other way round. Our study provides a more complete picture of the role of AfD in the gender gap of Wikipedia, with implications for the governance of the open knowledge infrastructure of the web.</description>

      <title>Parallelizing MCMC with Machine Learning Classifier and Its Criterion Based on Kullback-Leibler Divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the era of Big Data, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, which are currently essential for Bayesian estimation, face significant computational challenges owing to their sequential nature. To achieve a faster and more effective parallel computation, we emphasize the critical role of the overlapped area of the posterior distributions based on partitioned data, which we term the reconstructable area. We propose a method that utilizes machine learning classifiers to effectively identify and extract MCMC draws obtained by parallel computations from the area based on posteriors based on partitioned sub-datasets, approximating the target posterior distribution based on the full dataset. This study also develops a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based criterion. It does not require calculating the full-posterior density and can be calculated using only information from the sub-posterior densities, which are generally obtained after implementing MCMC. This simplifies the hyperparameter tuning in training classifiers. The simulation studies validated the efficacy of the proposed method. This approach contributes to ongoing research on parallelizing MCMC methods and may offer insights for future developments in Bayesian computation for large-scale data analyses.</description>

      <title>Adaptively Robust and Sparse K-means Clustering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While K-means is known to be a standard clustering algorithm, its performance may be compromised due to the presence of outliers and high-dimensional noisy variables. This paper proposes adaptively robust and sparse K-means clustering (ARSK) to address these practical limitations of the standard K-means algorithm. For robustness, we introduce a redundant error component for each observation, and this additional parameter is penalized using a group sparse penalty. To accommodate the impact of high-dimensional noisy variables, the objective function is modified by incorporating weights and implementing a penalty to control the sparsity of the weight vector. The tuning parameters to control the robustness and sparsity are selected by Gap statistics. Through simulation experiments and real data analysis, we demonstrate the proposed method's superiority to existing algorithms in identifying clusters without outliers and informative variables simultaneously.</description>

      <title>A Nonparametric Clustering Stopping Rule Based on Spatial Median</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a nonparametric clustering stopping rule algorithm based on the spatial median. Our proposed method aims to achieve the balance between the homogeneity within the clusters and the heterogeneity between clusters. The proposed algorithm maximises the ratio of the variation between clusters and the variation within clusters while adjusting for the number of clusters and number of observations. The proposed algorithm is robust against distributional assumptions and the presence of outliers. Simulations have been used to validate the algorithm. We further evaluated the stability and the efficacy of the proposed algorithm using three real-world datasets. Moreover, we compared the performance of our model with 13 other traditional algorithms for determining the number of clusters. We found that the proposed algorithm outperformed 11 of the algorithms considered for comparison in terms of clustering number determination. The finding demonstrates that the proposed method provides a reliable alternative to determine the number of clusters for multivariate data.</description>

      <title>An efficient likelihood-free Bayesian inference method based on sequential neural posterior estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12530v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sequential neural posterior estimation (SNPE) techniques have been recently proposed for dealing with simulation-based models with intractable likelihoods. Unlike approximate Bayesian computation, SNPE techniques learn the posterior from sequential simulation using neural network-based conditional density estimators by minimizing a specific loss function. The SNPE method proposed by Lueckmann et al. (2017) used a calibration kernel to boost the sample weights around the observed data, resulting in a concentrated loss function. However, the use of calibration kernels may increase the variances of both the empirical loss and its gradient, making the training inefficient. To improve the stability of SNPE, this paper proposes to use an adaptive calibration kernel and several variance reduction techniques. The proposed method greatly speeds up the process of training and provides a better approximation of the posterior than the original SNPE method and some existing competitors as confirmed by numerical experiments. We also manage to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method for a high-dimensional model with real-world dataset.</description>

      <title>Sampling metastable systems using collective variables and Jarzynski-Crooks paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18160v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of sampling a high dimensional multimodal target probability measure. We assume that a good proposal kernel to move only a subset of the degrees of freedoms (also known as collective variables) is known a priori. This proposal kernel can for example be built using normalizing flows. We show how to extend the move from the collective variable space to the full space and how to implement an accept-reject step in order to get a reversible chain with respect to a target probability measure. The accept-reject step does not require to know the marginal of the original measure in the collective variable (namely to know the free energy). The obtained algorithm admits several variants, some of them being very close to methods which have been proposed previously in the literature. We show how the obtained acceptance ratio can be expressed in terms of the work which appears in the Jarzynski-Crooks equality, at least for some variants. Numerical illustrations demonstrate the efficiency of the approach on various simple test cases, and allow us to compare the variants of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>A geometric approach to informed MCMC sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Riemannian geometric framework for Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is developed where using the Fisher-Rao metric on the manifold of probability density functions (pdfs), informed proposal densities for Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithms are constructed. We exploit the square-root representation of pdfs under which the Fisher-Rao metric boils down to the standard $L^2$ metric on the positive orthant of the unit hypersphere. The square-root representation allows us to easily compute the geodesic distance between densities, resulting in a straightforward implementation of the proposed geometric MCMC methodology. Unlike the random walk MH that blindly proposes a candidate state using no information about the target, the geometric MH algorithms move an uninformed base density (e.g., a random walk proposal density) towards different global/local approximations of the target density, allowing effective exploration of the distribution simultaneously at different granular levels of the state space. We compare the proposed geometric MH algorithm with other MCMC algorithms for various Markov chain orderings, namely the covariance, efficiency, Peskun, and spectral gap orderings. The superior performance of the geometric algorithms over other MH algorithms like the random walk Metropolis, independent MH, and variants of Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithms is demonstrated in the context of various multimodal, nonlinear, and high dimensional examples. In particular, we use extensive simulation and real data applications to compare these algorithms for analyzing mixture models, logistic regression models, spatial generalized linear mixed models and ultra-high dimensional Bayesian variable selection models. A publicly available R package accompanies the article.</description>
