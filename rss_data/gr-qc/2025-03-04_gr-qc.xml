      <title>Self-Interacting Gravitational Exciton Condensates from Extra-Dimensional Stabilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of gravitational exciton dynamics arising from higher-dimensional theories, with a focus on establishing a robust effective framework that incorporates self-interactions, higher-derivative corrections, and quantum effects. Starting from a \( D \)-dimensional Einstein--Hilbert action on a warped product manifold, we perform a systematic dimensional reduction to obtain a four-dimensional effective action in the Einstein frame. Our formulation extends the classical potential by including self-interacting moduli fields and RG-improved parameters via the Coleman--Weinberg mechanism, thereby accounting for both matter and graviton loop corrections. The resulting renormalization group flow modifies the effective mass and coupling constants, which in turn plays a critical role in moduli stabilization and the low-energy phenomenology. Taking the non-relativistic limit, we derive a Gross-Pitaevskii equation that governs the dynamics of the gravitational exciton condensate, and couple it self-consistently with Poisson's equation to capture gravitational backreaction. Through both variational and numerical analyses, we obtain stationary solutions in spherically symmetric, rotating, and anisotropic configurations, and perform a linear stability analysis using the Bogoliubov-de Gennes formalism. Our results reveal a Bogoliubov dispersion relation that exhibits a phonon-like linear regime at low momenta, transitioning to quadratic free-particle behavior at high momenta.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Lensing Phenomena of Ellis-Bronnikov-Morris-Thorne Wormhole with Global Monopole and Cosmic String</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we theoretically investigate gravitational lensing within the space-time framework of traversable wormholes, focusing on the combined effects of a global monopole and a cosmic string. Specifically, we examine the Ellis-Bronnikov-Morris-Thorne wormhole metric and analyze how these topological defects influence photon trajectories. By considering the weak-field limit, we derive analytical expressions for the photon deflection angle, highlighting how factors such as the wormhole throat radius, the global monopole charge, and the cosmic string influence the gravitational lensing phenomenon. We also examine the weak-field limit of lensing phenomena for a zero wormhole throat radius and derive an analytical expression for the deflection angle of photon light in this scenario.</description>

      <title>Gauge-dependence of Scalar Induced Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this review we look into the gauge-dependence of scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) that are second-order tensors produced by first-order scalar-modes. The method includes deriving the background, first- and second-order Einstein field equations without imposing a gauge. We address the gauge-invariant approach and study the source-term of SIGWs in three different gauges, synchronous, Poisson and uniform curvature gauge. We find that numerically computed kernels in all three gauges behave closely with minimal discrepancy. As expected, when going in sub-horizon modes, $x\gg1$, the discrepancy decreases and the behavior matches, pointing to a gauge-invariant observable.</description>

      <title>A Thermodynamic Model for Dark Energy Including Particle Creation or Destruction Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermodynamic analyses of dark energy as a relativistic fluid indicates that this intriguing component of the universe mimics a bulk viscous pressure when the parameter of its barotropic equation of state varies with time. Since in cosmology bulk viscosity and creation or destruction of matter are closely linked processes, we propose in this work a brief thermodynamic study of dark energy considering that particles can be created or destroyed in the fluid. We derive new expressions for quantities such as particle density, entropy density etc. that have been shown to be sensitive to this new ingredient. We also obtain new thermodynamic constraints and compare them with those where the number of particles is conserved. In particular, we found that in the presence of a sink, dark energy tends towards the cosmological constant over time regardless of the sign of its chemical potential and without violating the laws of thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Assessment of universal relations among second-order moments of relativistic stars via reformulated perturbation equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We assess the universal relations among second-order moments of relativistic stars, namely the moment of inertia, tidal deformability, and spin-induced quadrupole moment, via reformulated perturbation equations. After constructing the spherical background configuration by solving two ordinary differential equations as usual, these three moments are obtained by solving four additional ordinary differential equations. They are solved numerically from the stellar center to the surface, and we do not need to derive homogeneous solutions for obtaining the quadrupole moment. This small number of ordinary differential equations to be solved enables us to identify the primary variable for each second-order moment. Investigating the profile of these variables in the star, we speculate that their nonmonotonic behavior, enhanced typically for soft equations of state and/or high compactnesses, introduces the variety to the relations among these second-order moments unless the black-hole limit is approached.</description>

      <title>Backreaction of perturbations around a stable Light Ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light rings (LRs) - closed circular orbits of null geodesics - are key features of both black holes and horizonless ultracompact objects. While unstable LRs are relevant for the observation of black hole images, stable LRs have been suspected to trigger instabilities, namely in exotic compact objects that could mimic black holes. The underlying mechanism behind this instability remains poorly understood, but a key missing piece is how the backreaction of a perturbation around the stable LR modifies the surrounding spacetime. In this work, some progress in this direction is provided by examining a conceptually simple, yet instructive, toy model: continuum-shell stars, supported solely by tangential pressures. Using both analytical and numerical methods, we show how perturbations around the stable LR deepen the geodesic potential and shifts its location inward, potentially amplifying any instability associated with the LR. By then extending the analysis to more general stars with nonzero radial pressure, we find that the same phenomenon can be expected to persist under reasonable assumptions.</description>

      <title>Spin precession and neutrino helicity flip under the influence of a gravitational plane wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We recently studied spin precession in various stationary and axisymmetric spacetimes and applied it to the case of neutrinos propagating in those spacetimes. In this paper, the study of spin precession is extended to the case of a spinning particle propagating within the spacetime of a time-dependent gravitational plane wave. First, the angular velocity of spin precession of a particle propagating in a geodesic along an arbitrary direction relative to the gravitational wave is derived. Our general result is then used to derive the helicity flip probability for neutrinos freely propagating along such an arbitrary direction within the gravitational wave.</description>

      <title>The problem of reconstruction for static spherically-symmetric $4d$ metrics in scalar-Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the $4d$ gravitational model with scalar field $\varphi$, Einstein and Gauss-Bonnet terms. The action of the model contains potential term $U(\varphi)$, Gauss-Bonnet coupling function $f(\varphi)$ and parameter $\varepsilon = \pm1 $, where $\varepsilon = 1$ corresponds to ordinary scalar field and $\varepsilon = -1 $ - to phantom one. Inspired by recent works of Nojiri and Nashed, we explore a reconstruction procedure for a generic static spherically symmetric metric written in Buchdal parametrisation: $ds^2 = \left(A(u)\right)^{-1}du^2 - A(u)dt^2 + C(u)d\Omega^2$, with given $A(u) &gt; 0$ and $C(u) &gt; 0$. The procedure gives the relations for $U(\varphi(u))$, $f(\varphi(u))$ and $d\varphi/du$, which lead to exact solutions to equations of motion with a given metric. A key role in the approach play the solutions to a second order linear differential equation for the function $f(\varphi(u))$. The formalism is illustrated by two examples when: a) Schwarzschild metric and b) Ellis wormhole metric, are chosen as a starting point. For the first case a) the black hole solution with ``trapped ghost'' is found which describes an ordinary scalar field outside the photon sphere and phantom scalar field inside the photon sphere (``trapped ghost''). For the second case b) the sEGB-extension of the Ellis wormhole solution is found when the coupling function reads: $f(\varphi) = c_1 + c_0 ( \tan ( \varphi) + \frac{1}{3} (\tan ( \varphi))^3)$, where $c_1$ and $c_0$ are constants.</description>

      <title>Classical and quantum cosmology of $f(R)$ gravity's rainbow in Schutz's formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the classical and quantum dynamics of $f(R)$ gravity's rainbow in the presence of a perfect fluid, employing Schutz's formalism to establish a well-defined notion of time. In the classical regime, we derive and solve the equations of motion, obtaining both analytical and numerical solutions. Through canonical quantisation, we formulate the Schr\"{o}dinger-Wheeler-DeWitt (SWD) equation for the quantum model. By solving its eigenfunctions, we construct the wave function of the Universe and obtain analytical solutions in scenarios dominated by stiff matter. Our results highlight the impact of rainbow gravity on quantum evolution, particularly in modifying the structure of the wave function and shaping the transition from the quantum to the classical regime.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Implications of $f(R,\Sigma, T)$ Gravity: A Unified Approach Using OHD and SN Ia Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the cosmological implications of the modified gravity framework known as $f(R,\Sigma, T)$ gravity, focusing on its potential to unify and extend current cosmological models. The theory, introduced by Bakry and Ibraheem in 2023, combines the Ricci scalar, a scalar parameter representing torsion or other geometric properties, and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. By analyzing observational Hubble data (OHD) and the Pantheon compilation of Type Ia Supernovae (SN Ia), we explore how this framework provides the accelerated expansion of the universe, the nature of dark energy, and phenomena like the Big Rip singularity. Employing the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) metric and solving the modified field equations, we derive key cosmological parameters such as the Hubble constant and matter energy density parameter. These parameters are constrained through statistical analysis of observational data, yielding and from OHD, and and from SN Ia. The evolution of the equation of state (EoS) parameter, isotropic pressure, and energy density is also investigated. By considering energy conditions and stability criteria, the study highlights the viability of gravity as an alternative framework to General Relativity and models. Our findings affirm the model's compatibility with current observational evidence and its potential to the universe's past and future dynamics.</description>

      <title>Testing Multipole Moments of compact objects beyond Kerr paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multipole moments are related to the physical properties of compact gravitating objects; therefore, understanding their structure is useful in accessing the nature of compact objects. We look into gravitational wave observables for black holes with charge, black holes on the brane, black holes with torsion, and regular black holes to see if and how they are correlated to the black hole hairs, which are related to the multipole moments. We find that the gravitational wave observables are indeed related to the hairs of non-vacuum spacetimes (for instance, charge $Q$ in the case of Kerr-Newman black holes). We also constrain the black hole hairs for change in gravitational wave phasing to see if the dependencies are significant and can be observed. The results from the analysis imply that the charge $Q$ in Kerr-Newman black holes should be detectable; thus, we provide a constraint to $Q^2/M^2$ given the spin and mass ratio of an ideal EMRI system for which future detectors like LISA can detect the change in gravitational wave observables. We also look into an analytical approach to find multipole moments of non-vacuum black hole spacetimes, mainly using the Improved Twist Vector approach for the Geroch-Hansen multipole moments and the Thorne formalism. The necessary analytics are computed, and the multipole moments are obtained for various non-vacuum spacetimes. However, the multipole moments don't contain any information about the black hole hairs, and we have commented on this observation in our paper.</description>

      <title>Observational properties of black hole in quantum fluctuation modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the properties of the thin accretion disk around a black hole in quantum fluctuation modified gravity (QFMGBH) using the Novikov-Thorne model. We restrict the parameter \( \alpha \) characterizing the quantum fluctuation of metric and compute the ISCO radius, examining its effect on the energy flux, the radiation temperature, the luminosity spectrum, the energy efficiency, and the shadow size for various values of the parameter \( \omega \) characterizing the matter around the black hole. Our findings show that the ISCO radius increases with \( \alpha \) for \( \omega = 1/3, 0, -2/3 \), but decreases for \( \omega = -4/3 \). As \( \alpha \) increases, the energy flux and the temperature show distinct trends, with changes in the luminosity spectrum and the efficiency. The shadow size increases for \( \omega = 1/3, 0, -2/3 \), and decreases for \( \omega = -4/3 \). The accretion disk around the QFMGBH is smaller, hotter, and brighter than that surrounded the Schwarzschild BH in GR, suggesting that the observable differences can potentially distinguish quantum fluctuation modified gravity from standard GR.</description>

      <title>Spherical black hole perturbations in EFT of scalar-tensor gravity with timelike scalar profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study linear even-parity perturbations of static and spherically symmetric black holes with a timelike scalar profile by use of the effective field theory (EFT) approach. For illustrative purposes, we consider a simple subclass of the EFT that accommodates ghost condensate, namely the k-essence model along with the so-called scordatura term, and focus on the spherical (monopole) perturbations about an approximately stealth Schwarzschild solution. The scordatura effect is introduced to avoid the strong coupling problem that typically happens in the scalar sector around stealth solutions with a timelike scalar profile. We argue that the scalar perturbation is decoupled from the metric perturbations at the leading order in the scordatura effect under a particular gauge choice. We stress that this is an important step in understanding the dynamics of even-parity perturbations, paving the way towards deriving a set of master equations -- the generalized Zerilli and the scalar-field equations -- for generic multipoles.</description>

      <title>Classification of ten-dimensional symmetric embeddings for the spatially flat Friedman model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All possible variants of symmetric embedding of the metric of the spatially flat Friedman model into a ten-dimensional ambient space are analyzed. It is shown that only two such embeddings exist: the five-dimensional embedding found by Robertson in 1933 and a new eight-dimensional embedding proposed in this work. The new embedding can be utilized in developing the idea of explaining dark matter as fictitious matter arising in the description of gravity within the embedding theory approach. Some results in this direction are presented. Additionally, the possibility of constructing embeddings of the spatially flat Friedman model whose symmetry is lower than that of the metric itself is discussed. Two such embeddings are constructed.</description>

      <title>Computation of the semiclassical outflux emerging from a collapsing spherical null shell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a minimally coupled, massless quantum scalar field $\hat{\Phi}$ propagating in the background geometry of a four-dimensional black hole formed by the collapse of a spherical thin null shell, with a Minkowski interior and a Schwarzschild exterior. The field is taken in the natural ``in'' vacuum state, namely, the quantum state in which no excitations arrive from past null infinity. Within the semiclassical framework, we analyze the vacuum polarization $\left\langle\hat{\Phi}^{2}\right\rangle _{\text{ren}}$ and the energy outflux density $\left\langle \hat{T}_{uu}\right\rangle _{\text{ren}}$ (where $u$ is the standard null Eddington coordinate) just outside the shell. Using the point-splitting method, we derive closed-form analytical expressions for both these semiclassical quantities. In particular, our result for $\left\langle \hat{T}_{uu}\right\rangle _{\text{ren}}$ reveals that it vanishes like $(1-2M_{0}/r_{0})^{2}$ as the shell collapses toward the event horizon, where $M_{0}$ is the shell's mass and $r_{0}$ is the value of the area coordinate $r$ at the evaluation point. This confirms that, along a late-time outgoing null geodesic (i.e., one that emerges from the shell very close to the event horizon and propagates toward future null infinity), the outflux gradually evolves (from virtually zero) up to its final Hawking-radiation value while the geodesic traverses the strong-field region (rather than the Hawking-radiation outflux being emitted entirely from the collapsing shell, which would lead to significant backreaction effects).</description>

      <title>Black holes surrounded by massive vector fields in Kaluza-Klein gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an exact black hole solution surrounded by massive vector fields predicted by Kaluza-Klein (KK) gravity. KK gravity in four dimensions (4D) is of particular interest, as it predicts a tower of particle states, including gravitons with spin-0 and spin-1 components, in addition to the massless spin-2 gravitons of general relativity. The extra degrees of freedom in the gravitational sector modify the law of gravity, allowing the theory to explain the effects attributed to dark matter in the universe. In this paper, we construct a black hole solution surrounded by massive spin-1 gravitons within KK theory. In addition to the influence of the massive vector fields, we incorporate an interaction term between the black hole and the massive vector field. The black hole solution is affected by the mass of the spin-1 graviton and an additional parameter that encodes corrections to Newton's constant, as well as the coupling between the massive vector field and the black hole mass. We find that the coupling between the massive vector field and the black hole mimics the effect of an electric charge. To this end, we investigate the accretion disk, quasinormal modes (QNMs), and the stability of the black hole spacetime. Finally, we use Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of Sgr A* to constrain the black hole parameters.</description>

      <title>A new black hole coupled with nonlinear electrodynamics surrounded by quintessence: Thermodynamics, Geodesics, and Regge-Wheeler Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new exact solution to the gravitational field equations, where nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED) serves as the matter source in the presence of a quintessence field (QF). This solution describes a static, spherically symmetric black hole in the context of Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space, with the black hole (BH) surrounded by quintessence matter. The resulting black hole solution generalizes the AdS Schwarzschild-Kiselev black hole and reduces to the standard AdS-Schwarzschild black hole in the appropriate limits. Additionally, under certain conditions, this solution recovers the Bardeen-Kiselev regular black hole. We further explore the horizon structure and thermodynamic properties of this new black hole spacetime, accounting for the contributions from both NLED and the QF, including the state parameter of the QF. These contributions modify the spacetime geometry, thereby altering the thermodynamic behavior of the black hole. Moreover, we analyze the geodesic equations and show how NLED and the QF influence the effective potential for massless photon particles. Finally, we study the Regge-Wheeler (RW) potential for this regular black hole and demonstrate how variations in the parameters (NLED and QF) affect the RW potential for fields of different spins: spin-zero ($S=0$), spin-one ($S=1$), and spin-two ($S=2$). To illustrate the effects, we provide graphical representations of the RW potential for both multipole numbers $\ell=0$ and $\ell=1$.</description>

      <title>The static charged black holes with Weyl corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates static charged black holes with Weyl corrections to the Einstein-Maxwell action. By extending the classical solutions, we incorporate the influence of the Weyl tensor coupling with the electromagnetic field tensor, deriving novel black hole solutions under this framework. The characteristics of the derived spacetimes, including their geometrical structure and physical properties, are meticulously examined. Key features explored include geodesics, photon spheres, and quasinormal modes, providing insights into the stability and dynamics around such black holes. Additionally, the deflection of light and the corresponding shadow cast by these black holes are analyzed, revealing the modifications induced by Weyl corrections. This study aims to enrich the understanding of how higher-order tensor interactions can influence observable astrophysical phenomena in the vicinity of compact objects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational wave (GW) spectrum from the first-order phase transition can be characterized by a few phenomenological parameters but with high degeneracies in model/data distinguishments. In this paper, we look into the high-frequency power law of the GW spectrum with preliminary numerical simulations for both quantum and semi-classical pictures of vacuum decay. We first reveal an anti-correlation of the high-frequency power law to a certain power of the ratio between the wall thickness and bubble radius at the onset of bubble collisions, which can be further approximated analytically by some other phenomenological model characteristics to break the model degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Pure Shape Dynamics: Relational General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Pure Shape Dynamics (PSD) formulation of General Relativity (GR), which implements full relationalism by eliminating absolute scale and external time references from the fundamental description of gravity. Starting from the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) formulation, we derive a decoupled dynamical system that governs the evolution of the spatial conformal geometry and relational matter degrees of freedom, while eliminating the total volume and York time as independent dynamical variables. This results in an autonomous subsystem describing an unparametrized trajectory in the conformal superspace of metric and matter configurations, with its evolution encoded in an equation of state that characterises the intrinsic geometric properties of the curve in shape space. We show that this equation of state is structurally analogous to the corresponding PSD description of the Newtonian $N$-body problem, reinforcing the fundamental similarity between gravity and relational particle dynamics. Our framework is applied to the homogeneous Bianchi IX cosmological model, demonstrating that the Janus point evolution through the Big Bang, as previously found in a symmetry-reduced setting, is a generic feature of the full inhomogeneous PSD description. This work establishes PSD as a fully scale- and reparametrization-invariant formulation of classical gravity and lays the foundation for addressing key open questions that are discussed at the end of the paper.</description>

      <title>The continuous spectrum of quasinormal modes in a Schwarzschild black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasinormal modes dominate the dynamics of Schwarzschild black holes. By definition, these modes are purely outgoing at infinite distances. It is believed that the quasinormal mode spectrum is discrete, but the derivation assumes purely outgoing modes at finite distances. We prove that the spectrum is continuous, within the usual definition. Any frequency corresponds to a valid quasinormal mode, and each frequency is two-fold degenerate. Although it is imbedded in a continuum containing less-damped modes, the least-damped discrete mode should play a dominant role in the dynamics, due to its lack of an incoming component at finite distances. On the other hand, we question the physical significance of the discrete overtones relative to the continuum modes, since all highly-damped modes have very small incoming components. Furthermore, it seems likely that the continuous spectrum of quasinormal modes is complete.</description>

      <title>Running vacuum and H^4-inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies of QFT in cosmological spacetime indicate that the speeding up of the present universe may not just be associated with a rigid cosmological term but with a running one that evolves with the expansion rate: $\Lambda=\Lambda(H)$. This running is inherited from the cosmic evolution of the vacuum energy density (VED), $\rho_{\rm vac}$, which is sensitive to quantum effects in curved spacetime that ultimately trigger that running. The VED is a function of the Hubble rate and its time derivatives: $\rho_{\rm vac}=\rho_{\rm vac}(H, \dot{H},\ddot{H},...)$. Two nearby points of the cosmic evolution during the FLRW epoch are smoothly related as $\delta\rho_{\rm vac}\sim {\cal O}(H^2)$. In the very early universe, in contrast, the higher powers of the Hubble rate take over and bring about a period of fast inflation. They originate from quantum effects on the effective action of vacuum, which we compute. Herein we focus on the lowest possible power for inflation to occur: $H^4$. During the inflationary phase, $H$ remains approximately constant and very large. Subsequently, the universe enters the usual FLRW radiation epoch. This new mechanism (`RVM-inflation') is not based on any supplementary `inflaton' field, it is fueled by pure QFT effects on the dynamical background and is different from Starobinsky's inflation, in which $H$ is never constant.</description>

      <title>Extended thermodynamic analysis of a charged Horndeski black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform the thermodynamic analysis of a charged Horndeski black hole (CHB) with mass $m$ and charge $q$ obtained from the Einstein-Horndeski-Maxwell theory. There are two solution branches: one is for the CHB and the other is for the naked singularity (NS). Thermodynamic behavior for the CHB is similar to that for the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole but its Helmholtz free energy is always positive. If the NS point is included as an extremal point, then the Helmholtz free energy is always negative, implying that the globally stable region is achieved anywhere. For the NS, its temperature has a maximum point, its heat capacity remains negative without having Davies point, and its free energy decreases without limitation as the charge $q$ increases.</description>

      <title>Bias-Corrected Importance Sampling for Inferring Beyond Vacuum-GR Effects in Gravitational Wave Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The upcoming gravitational wave (GW) observatory LISA will measure the parameters of sources like extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) to exquisite precision. These measurements will also be sensitive to perturbations to the vacuum, GR-consistent evolution of sources, which might be caused by astrophysical environments or deviations from general relativity (GR). Previous studies have shown such ``beyond vacuum-GR'' perturbations to potentially induce severe biases ($\gtrsim 10\sigma$) on recovered parameters under the ``null'' vacuum-GR hypothesis. While Bayesian inference can be performed under the null hypothesis using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers, it is computationally infeasible to repeat for more than a modest subset of all possible beyond vacuum-GR hypotheses. We introduce bias-corrected importance sampling, a generic inference technique for nested models that is informed by the null hypothesis posteriors and the linear signal approximation to correct any induced inference biases. For a typical EMRI source that is significantly influenced by its environment but has been inferred only under the null hypothesis, the proposed method efficiently recovers the injected (unbiased) source parameters and the true posterior at a fraction of the expense of redoing MCMC inference under the full hypothesis. In future GW data analysis using the output of the proposed LISA global-fit pipeline, such methods may be necessary for the feasible and systematic inference of beyond vacuum-GR effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrical resistivity plays a fundamental role in many astrophysical systems, influencing the evolution of the magnetic field and energy dissipation processes. During the coalescence of two neutron stars, resistive effects can significantly affect the dynamics and gravitational and electromagnetic signatures associated with these events, such as gamma-ray bursts and kilonova emission. Here, we present our new code, named MIR. Developed within the EinsteinToolkit framework, MIR solves the general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic equations in 3D Cartesian coordinates and on a dynamical spacetime using the 3+1 Eulerian formalism, in both the ideal and resistive regimes, filling a crucial gap in the toolkit's capabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a class of solutions of multidimensional gravity which are formally related to black-hole solutions but can observationally look like compact stars whose surface reflects back all particles or signals getting there. Some particular examples of such solutions are presented and studied, including those with a magnetic field in Maxwell or nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) in five dimensions. For NED as a possible source for magnetic mirror stars, we formulate a methodology of solving the 5D Einstein-NED equations and point out the conditions under which there always exist mirror star solutions. We also note that some of the Einstein-Maxwell solutions under consideration are discussed in the literature and called ``topological stars'' due to the circular topology of the fifth dimension.</description>

      <title>Cosmological phase-space analysis of $f(G)$-theories of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01620v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of topological terms that modify the Hilbert-Einstein action is here explored by virtue of a further $f(G)$ contribution. In particular, we investigate the phase-space stability and critical points of an equivalent scalar field representation that makes use of a massive field, whose potential is function of the topological correction. To do so, we introduce to the gravitational Action Integral a Lagrange multiplier and model the modified Friedmann equations by virtue of new non-dimensional variables. We single out dimensionless variables that permit \emph{a priori} the Hubble rate change of sign, enabling regions in which the Hubble parameter either vanishes or becomes negative. In this respect, we thus analyze the various possibilities associated with a universe characterized by such topological contributions and find the attractors, saddle points and regions of stability, in general. The overall analysis is carried out considering the exponential potential first and then shifting to more complicated cases, where the underlying variables do not simplify. We compute the eigenvalues of our coupled differential equations and, accordingly, the stability of the system, in both a spatially-flat and non-flat universe. Quite remarkably, regardless of the spatial curvature, we show that a stable de Sitter-like phase that can model current time appears only a small fraction of the entire phase-space, suggesting that the model under exam is unlikely in describing the whole universe dynamics, i.e., the topological terms appear disfavored in framing the entire evolution of the universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Halilsoy and Chandrasekhar cylindrical standing gravitational waves correspond to two different classes of solutions to the vacuum Einstein equations. Both families satisfy the definition of standing gravitational waves proposed by Stephani, but only the latter class fulfills the stricter definition introduced by Chandrasekhar. The aim of this research is to compare both classes of solutions within the linear regime. We discover that the linearized Halilsoy and Chandrasekhar standing waves are gravitational analogues of two different types of electromagnetic polarization standing waves - a phenomenon not previously discussed in the literature for exact solutions to the Einstein equations</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effect of tidal forces on transport within a relic accretion disk in binary black holes is studied here with a suite of two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. As the binary contracts due to the emission of gravitational waves, the accretion disk is truncated, and a two-armed spiral wave is excited, which remains stationary in the rotating reference frame of the coalescing binary. Such spiral waves lead to increased transport of mass and angular momentum. Our findings suggest that even in the case of weakly ionized accretion disks, spiral density waves will drain the disk long before the orbit of the two black holes decays enough for them to merge, thus dimming prospects for a detectable electromagnetic counterpart.</description>

      <title>How to Create a Flat Ten or Eleven Dimensional Space-time in the Interior of an Asymptotically Flat Four Dimensional String Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By taking large mass and charge limit of a black hole in string theory we can create arbitrarily large regions where the space-time is approximately flat, but the moduli fields take values different from their asymptotic values. In this paper we describe a special case of this where black hole solutions in a four dimensional string theory, in the large mass and charge limit, can have an arbitrarily large region outside the horizon where a local observer will experience string theory in flat ten dimensional space-time. The curvature and other field strengths remain small everywhere between the asymptotic four dimensional observer and the ten dimensional region. By going to a different region of space, we can also get a large region where a local observer experiences M-theory in flat eleven dimensional space-time.</description>

      <title>Low-Energy Neutrinos from Primordial Black Holes: A New Possibility for Observing Hawking Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of primordial black holes (PBHs) and the Hawking radiation they produce represents a significant step toward understanding the role of these phenomena in the cosmological evolution of the Universe. PBHs could be a component of dark matter, the seeds of supermassive black holes, and sources of Hawking radiation, which, unlike the radiation from other black holes, might be observable. Over the course of the evolution of the Universe from the Big Bang to the present day, PBHs have lost a substantial portion of their mass through neutrino radiation. This occurs because, for black holes with masses $M\lesssim10^{23}\,$g, the radiation of the lightest massive particles - neutrinos - becomes significant alongside the emission of photons. This neutrino radiation eventually dominates the emission process. By the present time ($t_0=13.8$ Gyr), only black holes with masses $\lesssim 10^{15}\,$g have largely evaporated, meaning that the total emission spectrum of PBHs is now dominated by the neutrino component. In this paper, we present new estimates of the neutrino spectra emitted by PBHs of various masses, with a particular focus on low-energy radiation ($E_{kin} \in [0.01 \div 1]\, $eV) for the first time. Our calculations demonstrate that black holes in the mass range $[10^{9}\div10^{11}]\,$g emit neutrinos with intensities that exceed the background fluxes from known astrophysical sources in the low-energy range. In contrast, in the high-energy range, the emission remains below the background level, consistent with observational constraints. These findings open new avenues for the potential detection of PBH radiation and could stimulate advancements in neutrino detection technologies, particularly in the low-energy regime. The observation of neutrinos in this energy range represents one of the few opportunities to confirm the existence of Hawking radiation.</description>

      <title>The Role of the Schwinger Effect in Superradiant Axion Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superradiance can cause the axion cloud around a rotating black hole to reach extremely high densities, and the decay of these axions can produce a powerful laser. The electric field of these lasers is strong enough that the Schwinger effect may become significant, resulting in the production of an electron-positron plasma. We explore the dynamics between axion lasers and this electron-positron plasma. While there are several mechanisms by which the inclusion of a plasma can impact the laser's behavior, the most significant of these mechanisms is that the electron-positron plasma imparts an effective mass on the photon. As the plasma frequency increases, axion decay becomes energetically unfavorable, up to the point where the axion no longer decays into photons, shutting off the laser. We find that the impact of the electron-positron plasma on the dynamics of the system depend heavily on the parameters, specifically the axion mass $m_\phi$ and the superradiant coupling $\alpha$, and that we may divide parameter space into three regimes: the unenhanced, enhanced, and unstable regimes. In the unenhanced and enhanced regime, the system will eventually settle into an equilibrium state, emitting a laser of constant luminosity while the number of axions remains constant. In the unenhanced regime, this equilibrium state can be calculated while neglecting the effects of Schwinger production; in the enhanced regime, the equilibrium luminosity is slightly larger than what it would be without Schwinger production. In the unstable regime, the electron-positron plasma suppresses axion decay to the point where the system is never able to reach equilibrium; instead, the axions continue to grow superradiantly. In all three cases, the production of superradiant axions will eventually cause the black hole to spin down to the point where superradiance ceases.</description>

      <title>Magnetar structure in nonlinear electrodynamics with mixed poloidal-toroidal fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetars have inferred polar field strengths in excess of the Schwinger limit, where nonlinear electromagnetic effects can be significant. Their internal fields may be even stronger, suggesting that Maxwellian characterisations of hydromagnetic structure may require revision. A generalised Grad-Shafranov equation, describing static and axisymmetric fluid stars with mixed poloidal-toroidal fields, is introduced and subsequently solved in a perturbative scheme to calculate quadrupolar deformations. In the Born-Infeld theory, we show that the toroidal field has a maximum strength set by the scale parameter, $b$, implying an upper limit to the stellar prolateness, $|\epsilon_{\rm max}| \sim 10^{-5} \left(b/10^{16}\text{ G}\right)^2$, that is independent of field specifics. Observations of magnetar phenomena that are interpreted as evidence for ellipticity, such as precession, can thus implicitly constrain post-Maxwellian parameters in a way that complements terrestrial experiments. Toroidal ceilings also have implications for dynamo theory and gravitational waves, which we revisit together with field evolution in crusts abiding by beyond-Maxwell physics.</description>

      <title>Amplitude prescriptions in field theories with complex poles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of field theories with complex poles, we scrutinize four inequivalent ways of defining the scattering amplitudes, each forfeiting one or more tenets of standard quantum field theory while preserving the others: (i) a textbook Wick rotation by analytic continuation of the external momenta from Euclidean to Lorentzian signature (no optical theorem), (ii) the Lee-Wick-Nakanishi prescription, integrating along a certain contour in the complex energy plane (no Lorentz invariance), (iiii) the fakeon prescription, where, in addition, spatial momenta are integrated on a complex path defined by the locus of singularities of the loop integrand (no analyticity of the amplitude) and (iv) to work directly on Minkowski spacetime, which violates the optical theorem and also bars power-counting renormalizability. In general, mixed Euclidean-Lorentzian prescriptions for internal and external momenta in loop integrals break Lorentz invariance, regardless of the type of masses involved. We conclude that, of the above four options, only the fakeon prescription is physically viable and can have applications to quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Understanding $\Omega_\mathrm{gw}(f)$ in Gravitational Wave Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09745</link>
      <description>arXiv:1911.09745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a comprehensive derivation of the energy density in the stochastic gravitational-wave background $\Omega_\mathrm{gw}(f)$, and show how this quantity is measured in ground-based detectors such as Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), space-based Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), and Pulsar Timing Arrays. By definition $\Omega_\mathrm{gw}(f) \propto S_h(f)$ -- the power spectral density (PSD) of the Fourier modes of the gravitational-wave background. However, this is often confused with the PSD of the strain signal, which we call $S_\mathrm{gw}(f)$, and is a detector-dependent quantity. This has led to confusing definitions of $\Omega_\mathrm{gw}(f)$ in the literature which differ by factors of up to 5 when written in a detector-dependent way. In addition to clarifying this confusion, formulas presented in this paper facilitate easy comparison of results from different detector groups, and how to convert from one measure of the strength of the background (or an upper limit) to another.

      <title>Impact of calibration uncertainties on Hubble constant measurements from gravitational-wave sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.03614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave (GW) detections of electromagnetically bright compact binary coalescences can provide an independent measurement of the Hubble constant $H_0$. In order to obtain a measurement that could help arbitrate the existing tension on $H_0$, one needs to fully understand any source of systematic biases for this approach. In this study, we aim to understand the impact of instrumental calibration errors (CEs) on the measurements of the luminosity distance, $D_L$, and the inferred $H_0$ value. We simulate binary neutron star mergers (BNSs), as detected by a network of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo interferometers at their design sensitivity. We artificially add CEs equal to exceptionally large values experienced in LIGO-Virgo's third observing run (O3). We find that for individual BNSs at a network signal-to-noise ratio of 50, the systematic errors on $D_L$ - and hence $H_0$ - are still smaller than the statistical uncertainties. The biases become more significant when we combine multiple events to obtain a joint posterior on $H_0$. In the rather unrealistic case that the data around each detection is affected by the same CEs corresponding to the worst offender of O3, the true $H_0$ value would be excluded from the 90% credible interval after we combine $\sim$40 sources. If instead, 10% of the sources suffer from severe CEs, the true value of $H_0$ is included in the 90% credible interval even after 100 sources.</description>

      <title>Identifying thermal effects in neutron star merger remnants with model-agnostic waveform reconstructions and third-generation detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02493v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We probe the intrinsic differences in simulated gravitational-wave signals from binary neutron star (BNS) mergers, arising from varying approaches to incorporating thermal effects in numerical-relativity modeling. We consider a hybrid approach in which the equation of state (EOS) comprises a cold, zero-temperature, piecewise-polytropic part and a thermal part described by an ideal gas, and a tabulated approach based on self-consistent, microphysical, finite-temperature EOS. We use time-domain waveforms corresponding to BNS merger simulations with four different EOSs. Those are injected into Gaussian noise given by the sensitivity of the third-generation detector Einstein Telescope and reconstructed using BayesWave, a Bayesian data-analysis algorithm that recovers the signals through a model-agnostic approach. The two representations of thermal effects result in different dominant peak frequencies in the spectra of the postmerger signals, for both the quadrupole fundamental mode and the late-time inertial modes. For some of the EOSs investigated those differences are large enough to be told apart, especially in the early postmerger phase when the signal amplitude is the loudest. Our results suggest that a self-consistent treatment of thermal effects in BNS postmerger modeling is essential to prevent significant parameter biases in upcoming gravitational-wave detections.</description>

      <title>Effect of Gravitational Waves on Yang-Mills condensates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12330v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the interactions of a Yang-Mills (YM) wave fluctuation of a classical isotropic, homogeneous YM condensate, which models gluon plasma, with a Gravitational Wave (GW). We re-analyse the study of fluctuations of the gluon plasma using vector decomposition of the gauge field into scalar, longitudinal, and transverse modes. We find that there is an energy transfer between isotropic gluon condensate and plasmon modes, but the effect is delayed, and dependent on the initial conditions. We also studied quarks in the background of YM condensate and GW. We find that the quarks break the isotropy of the condensate and the GW couples quarks of different flavours of the SU(2) group. The GW induces flavour fluctuations, and this has interesting implications for experimental observations and quark-gluon plasma physics.</description>

Abstract: Recently it was shown that essentially all regular black hole models constructed so far can be obtained as solutions of vacuum gravity equations, upon considering an infinite series of quasi-topological higher curvature corrections. Here we show that such a construction can be upgraded to yield regular black holes with vanishing inner horizon surface gravity. In four dimensions, such a condition is necessary for the absence of classical instabilities associated with mass inflation on the inner horizon.</description>

Abstract: In this brief article, we pursue the systematic investigation of possible gravitational wave sources in the gigahertz band. We focus on hyperbolic encounters of light black holes and evaluate precisely the expected signal when accounting for the detailed characteristics of haloscope experiments. Considering the GraHal setup as a benchmark, we insist on the correct signal-to-noise ratio expression, taking into account the appropriate timescales resulting from both physical and instrumental constraints. The associated maximum distance - of the order of a hundredth of an astronomical unit - at which an event can be detected is calculated for optimal, suboptimal, and general trajectories. The main conclusion is that detection seems clearly out of reach.</description>

      <title>KG- oscillators in a spinning cosmic string spacetime and an external magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Klein-Gordon (KG) oscillators in a spinning cosmic string spacetime and an external magnetic field. The corresponding KG-equation is shown to admit a solution in the form of the confluent hypergeometric functions/polynomials. Consequently, the corresponding energies are shown to be given in a quadratic equation of a delicate nature that has to be solved in an orderly manner (for it involves the energies for KG-particles/antiparticles, $E=E_{\pm}=\pm\left\vert E\right\vert $ along with the magnetic quantum number $m=m_{\pm }=\pm |m|$). Following a case-by-case strategy allowed us to clearly observe the effects of the spinning cosmic string on the spectroscopic structure of the KG-oscillators. We have observed that, under some parametric settings, whilst the Landau-like energies of the KG-particles ($E=E_{+}$), with $m=m_{+}$, have no explicit dependence on the spinning string parameter or wedge parameter $\alpha$, the KG-antiparticles ($E=E_{-}$), with $m=m_{-}$, have such explicit dependence. Interestingly, the co-existence of a spinning cosmic string and external magnetic field eliminates the effect of the wedge parameter ( a byproduct of the string) for KG-particles ($E=E_{+}$), with $m=m_{+}$, but not for the KG-antiparticles ($E=E_{-}$), with $m=m_{-}$. Such co-existence is observed to break the symmetry of the energies of the KG-particles and antiparticles about $E=0$ for KG-oscillators. However, for KG-particles ($E=E_{+}$), with $m=m_{-}$, and KG-antiparticles ($E=E_{-}$), with $m=m_{+}$, are observed to be unfortunate for being indeterminable. Moreover, for the spinning parameter $\beta &gt;&gt;1$, clustering of the energy levels is observed eminent to indicate that there is no distinction between energy levels at such values of $\beta $.</description>

      <title>Resonant behavior and stability of a linear three-mirror cavity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The implementation of Fabry-Perot cavities in gravitational-wave detectors has been pivotal to improving their sensitivity, allowing the observation of an increasing number of cosmological events with higher signal-to-noise ratio. Notably, Fabry-Perot cavities play a key role in the frequency-dependent squeezing technique, which provides a reduction of quantum noise over the whole observation frequency spectrum. In this context, linear three-mirror cavities could be of interest because of the additional control that they can provide.
  In this paper, we develop a complete model to describe the stability behavior and the properties of transmitted and reflected fields of a linear three-mirror cavity aiming to be used for design purposes. In particular, simulations are carried out to show the evolution of the characteristic "double-peak" as a function of cavity parameters, which is one of the key features of this system. We show that the double-peak shape is almost freely adjustable, either in terms of spacing between maxima, their relative height and their intrinsic width. This is made possible by changing the mirrors' reflectivity coefficients and their spacing. However, the amount of achievable realistic configurations is limited by the stability conditions of the cavity. In particular, if the middle mirror is not close enough to the center of the cavity, it could be difficult to obtain a stable three-mirror cavity. Different geometries have been studied to obtain a stable cavity system.</description>

      <title>Canonical quantization of the dark positive-energy Dirac field and time asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16545v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform canonical quantization of the single-component, spin-zero field that was introduced by Dirac in 1971 and recently suggested as a candidate for dark matter by Bogomolny. The massive and massless cases are treated separately. Since in the massive case only positive-frequency modes are normalizable and regarded as physical, the mode expansion for the field involves annihilation operators only, making the quantization procedure particularly simple. The corresponding Hamiltonian turns out to be unambiguous, with no need for normal ordering. The positive-energy requirement imposed on the second-quantized system leads to equally acceptable Bose and Fermi choices for particle statistics. This suggests a simple extension of original Dirac's theory in which Bose and Fermi single-component positive-energy Dirac fields are combined into a doublet whose members can transform into each other. The model includes a Landau-Anderson-Higgs type potential that allows spontaneous selection of the direction in the internal bose-fermi space. The bosonic sector of the theory hints at the possibility of a dark, background spacetime condensate that could endow the universe with its cosmological temporal asymmetry. In the massless case of Dirac's original theory, we explore the possibility of allowing the field expansion to involve both positive- and negative-frequency modes. This leads to the anticommutation relations for creation and annihilation operators associated with the negative energy solutions, resulting in supersymmetric behavior of the single-component field in the ultrarelativistic limit. Finally, we speculate on the possibility for the positive-energy Dirac particles to obey some exotic (such as non-abelian, Clifford) statistics in which the particles are neither created nor destroyed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Various generalizations of the scalar, axisymmetric "horizon hair" for extremal black holes have recently appeared in the literature. In this paper, we propose an expression for a non-axisymmetric gravitational "charge" and its potentially observable imprint at a finite distance from the horizon (Ori-coefficient) in extremal Kerr black hole backgrounds. Using a hyperboloidal foliation, we offer strong and robust numerical evidence for the potential existence of this horizon hair and its properties. Specifically, we consider the time evolution of horizon penetrating, quadrupolar and (subdominant) octupolar gravitational perturbations with compact support on extremal Kerr (EK) spacetime. We do this by numerically solving the Teukolsky equation and determining the conserved charge values on the horizon and at a finite distance from the black hole.</description>

      <title>Timelike transitions in an atom by a mirror in light cone and Kruskal-Szekeres regions: a status of quantum equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the timelike transitions in a two-level atom in the presence of an infinite reflecting mirror in the future-past light cone regions of a Minkowski spacetime as well as in the region interior of a $(1+1)$ dimensional Schwarzschild black hole. In particular, when considering the light cone regions, two specific scenarios are dealt with -- $(i)$ a static mirror is synchronized with Minkowski time while the static atom is using a frame in the light cone, $(ii)$ a static atom is using Minkowski time, and the mirror is using the light cone frame. Analogous scenarios in the black hole spacetime are -- the static mirror uses future Kruskal frame while the static atom uses the Schwarzschild coordinates, defined inside the black hole, and vice-versa. The calculations, depending upon the frame of the atom, are respectively done within the light cone, Minkowski, Schwarzschild, and Kruskal time-interaction pictures. In all of these scenarios, we observe that the excitation probabilities contain a thermal factor and are periodic on the separation between the atom and the mirror, contrasting the uniform acceleration scenario. The above two scenarios in $(1+1)$ dimensional Minkowski-light cone regions appear to be the same when we equate the field and atomic frequencies. However, the same is not true when we consider the $(3+1)$ dimensional Minkowski-light cone or the Schwarzschild interior regions. We also estimate the de-excitation probabilities and encounter similar situations. However, we observe that the ratio between the excitation and corresponding de-excitation probabilities resembles the classical equivalence in motion at the quantum level. The excitation to de-excitation ratios (EDRs) corresponding to analogous scenarios are equal for equal atomic and field frequencies. This bolsters our earlier proposal on the relevance of EDRs in the context of the equivalence principle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective loop quantum gravity dynamics are derived for spherically symmetric spacetimes with a perfect fluid matter content. For homogeneous spacetimes, the effective dynamics agree with the standard results of loop quantum cosmology, while the equations for static solutions give an effective Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation. There exist solutions to the effective Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation that have a mass of the order of the Planck mass, a Planckian radius, and no horizon; these miniature stars could potentially contribute to dark matter, and could be an end state for an evaporating black hole.</description>

      <title>Vanishing of Quadratic Love Numbers of Schwarzschild Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The induced conservative tidal response of self-gravitating objects in general relativity is parametrized in terms of a set of coefficients, which are commonly referred to as Love numbers. For asymptotically-flat black holes in four spacetime dimensions, the Love numbers are notoriously zero in the static regime. In this work, we show that this result continues to hold upon inclusion of nonlinearities in the theory for Schwarzschild black holes. We first solve the quadratic Einstein equations in the static limit to all orders in the multipolar expansion, including both even and odd perturbations. We show that the second-order solutions take simple analytic expressions, generically expressible in the form of finite polynomials. We then define the quadratic Love numbers at the level of the point-particle effective field theory. By performing the matching with the full solution in general relativity, we show that quadratic Love number coefficients are zero to all orders in the derivative expansion, like the linear ones.</description>

      <title>Next-to-leading order corrections to scalar perturbations of Kerr-anti-de Sitter black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The small Kerr-anti-de Sitter black hole demonstrates instability due to the superradiance of either a massive or massless scalar field. Previous leading-order approximations of the spectrum are inefficient. In particular, the leading-order real part of the eigenfrequency is insensitive to the spin of the black hole. In this work, we improve the analysis by including the next-to-leading-order contribution. Compared to the numerical calculation, the new spin-dependent real part presents significantly better agreement, and the error in the imaginary part is also reduced to less than 60% for most black hole spins.</description>

      <title>Slow-roll approximations in Einstein--Gauss--Bonnet gravity formulated in terms of e-folding numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16194v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the Einstein--Gauss--Bonnet (EGB) gravity models, the slow-roll approximation has been extended by taking into account the first-order slow-roll parameter $\delta_1 =-2\,H^2\,\xi^\prime/U_0$, which is proportional to the first derivative of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling function $\xi$ with respect to the e-folding number. These extensions lead to the question of the accuracy of effective potential reconstruction during the generalization of attractors in EGB gravity. We have reconstructed models using the extended slow-roll approximations and compared them with the exact expressions and the standard slow-roll approximation.</description>

      <title>Zero Mass limit of Kerr-MOG Black Hole Equals Wormhole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been argued in existing literature that the zero mass limit of Kerr spacetime corresponds to either flat Minkowski spacetime or a wormhole exhibiting a locally flat geometry. In this study, we examine that the zero mass limit of the Kerr-MOG black hole is equivalent to a wormhole. Moreover, we derive the Kerr-Schild form of the Kerr-MOG black hole through specific coordinate transformations. We further investigate the physical and topological characteristics of the Kerr-MOG black hole within the framework of modified gravity. Our analysis also includes a discussion of the wormhole using cylindrical coordinates, which comprises two distinct coordinate patches. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to the Kerr-Newman black hole and show that the \emph{zero mass limit of the Kerr-Newman black hole does not yield a wormhole}. However, if we impose an additional criterion such that \emph{both the mass parameter and the charge parameters are equal to zero}, then the Kerr-Newman black hole will be a wormhole.</description>

      <title>Parameterized Deceleration in $f(Q,C)$ Gravity: A Logarithmic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores a distinctive logarithmic parameterization of the deceleration parameter within the $f(Q, C)$ gravity framework, incorporating a nonlinear functional form $f(Q, C) = \gamma_1 Q^n + \gamma_2 C$, where $Q$ and $C$ denote the nonmetricity scalar and boundary term, respectively, and $n \geq 1$. This approach provides a unique perspective on the universe's accelerated expansion without resorting to exotic fields. Using observational data from Hubble measurements (OHD) and the Pantheon+SH0ES Type Ia supernovae dataset, the model parameters were constrained through a $\chi^2$ minimization technique. The analysis reveals a transition from deceleration to acceleration in the expansion history of the universe, with the transition redshifts $z_t \approx 0.98$ (OHD) and $z_t \approx 0.76$ (Pantheon+SH0ES). The model demonstrates consistency with observations, offering insights into the dynamics of dark energy and alternative gravity theories, while effectively modeling cosmic evolution across epochs.</description>

      <title>Higgs Inflation Model with Small Non-Minimal Coupling Constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15597v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the "Higgs field+gravity" model, the selfconsistency of equations obtained from the original action has the form of an algebraic constraint defining the scalar $\zeta$ as a function of the Higgs field $\varphi$ and its first derivatives. The scalar $\zeta$ is present in all equations of motion and has a significant effect on the dynamics. Transition to the Einstein frame is carried out in equations of motions. Due to the constraint, the original model parameters are converted into $\varphi$-dependent classical effective parameters. In particular, the effective potential has the form $U_{eff}=\frac{\lambda}{4\xi^2}M_P^4 F(\varphi) \tanh^4(\frac{\sqrt{\xi}\varphi}{M_P})$, where $F(\varphi)$ is a smooth function. The constant $\xi$ of non-minimal coupling to scalar curvature can be chosen as small as desired. If $\xi =1/6$, then to ensure agreement with CMB observational data, the Higgs field selfcoupling parameter $\lambda$ in the original action must be of the order of $\sim 10^{-11}$. During cosmological evolution after the end of inflation, the decrease of $\varphi$ leads to a change in the sign of the effective Higgs mass term. This effect provides an answer to the mystery of the Higgs potential structure and leads to SSB. As $\varphi$ approaches VEV, the scalar function $\zeta(\varphi)$ changes in such a way that the classical effective selfcoupling parameter $\lambda_{eff}(\zeta(\varphi))$ increases by 10 orders of magnitude compared to $\lambda$, which is necessary for the implementation of the GWS theory. Applying the model to the very beginning of the classical evolution of the Universe shows that under certain initial conditions, cosmological dynamics can begin with a phantom regime preceding inflation.However, if evolution begins with normal dynamics, then it proceeds only as inflation, and the problem of initial conditions for the onset of inflation does not arise.</description>

Abstract: We show that the horizon shapes of static Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton (EMD) black holes can be deformed through an approach analogous to those observed in novel topological black hole solutions supported by two massless axion fields. Particularly, the radial part of the spacetime remains unchanged, while the angular part has a non-constant Ricci scalar, signaling the presence of anisotropy. We further explore the implications of this anisotropy for the thermodynamic properties of the black hole. The validity of the Misner-Sharp (MS) mass and the unified first law are also addressed in this study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the results of a search for nonlinear gravitational wave memory in the NANOGrav 15-year data set. We find no significant evidence for memory signals in the dataset, with a maximum Bayes factor of 3.1 in favor of a model including memory. We therefore place upper limits on the strain of potential gravitational wave memory events as a function of sky location and observing epoch. We find upper limits that are not always more constraining than previous NANOGrav results. We show that it is likely due to the increase in common red noise between the 12.5-year and 15-year NANOGrav datasets.</description>

      <title>Nyquist-resolving gravitational waves via orbital frequency-based refinement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adaptive mesh refinement efficiently facilitates the computation of gravitational waveforms in numerical relativity. However, determining precisely when, where, and to what extent to refine when solving the Einstein equations poses challenges; several ad hoc refinement criteria have been explored in the literature. This work introduces an optimized resolution baseline derived in situ from the inspiral trajectory (ORBIT). This method uses the binary's orbital frequency as a proxy for anticipated gravitational waves to dynamically refine the grid, satisfying the Nyquist frequency requirements on grid resolution up to a specified spin weighted spherical harmonic order. ORBIT sustains propagation of gravitational waves while avoiding the more costly alternative of maintaining high resolution across an entire simulation, both spatially and temporally. We find that enabling ORBIT decreases waveform noise by an order of magnitude and better resolves high-order wave amplitudes through merger. Combined with WAMR and other improvements, updates to Dendro-GR decrease waveform noise, decrease constraint violations, and boost refinement efficiency each by factors of $\mathcal{O}(100)$, while reducing computational cost by a factor of four. ORBIT and other recent improvements to Dendro-GR begin to prepare us for gravitational wave science with next-generation detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate an investigation into features of vacuum entanglement as probed by accelerated quantum probes in curved spacetime. Focussing specifically on de Sitter (dS) spacetime with curvature $\Lambda$, we obtain several exact results corresponding to different kinematical set-up of the probes. The interaction with the quantum field creates a non-local correlation between initially uncorrelated probes accelerating in different directions. It is well known that a single quantum probe in dS spacetime with uniform acceleration $a$ responds exactly as a quantum probe in Minkowski spacetime with "effective" acceleration $q \equiv\sqrt{a^2+\Lambda}$. However, no such mapping generically exists for the entanglement between probes. Our results suggest that entanglement exhibits independent variations with changes in acceleration and curvature depending on different configurations of detector motion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10394v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: String geometry theory is one of the candidates of the non-perturbative formulation of string theory. In this paper, in the bosonic closed sector of string geometry theory, we identify string background configurations, which include general string backgrounds in bosonic closed string theory. From fluctuations around these configurations, we derive the path-integrals of perturbative strings on the string backgrounds up to any order. Furthermore, the identification of the string background configurations enables us to obtain differential equations that determine a potential for string backgrounds. We obtain a potential for perturbative vacua in string theory by substituting the string background configurations into the classical potential in string geometry theory and imposing the differential equations by the method of Lagrange multipliers. We also solve these differential equations and obtain a potential explicitly up to the second order without Lagrange multipliers.</description>

      <title>Inertial Torsion Noise in Matter-Wave Interferometers for Gravity Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matter-wave interferometry is susceptible to non-inertial noise sources, which can induce dephasing and a resulting loss of interferometric visibility. Here, we focus on inertial torsion noise (ITN), which arises from the rotational motion of the experimental apparatus suspended by a thin wire and subject to random external torques. We provide analytical expressions for the ITN noise starting from generalized Langevin equations describing the experimental box which can then be used together with the transfer function to obtain the dephasing factor. We verify the theoretical modelling and the validity of the approximations using Monte Carlo simulations, obtaining good agreement between theory and numerics. As an application, we estimate the size of the effects for the next generation of interferometry experiments with femtogram particles, which could be used as the building block for entanglement-based tests of the quantum nature of gravity. We find that the ambient gas is a weak source of ITN, posing mild restrictions on the ambient pressure and temperature. We discuss the general ITN constraints by assuming a Langevin equation parameterized by three phenomenological parameters.</description>

      <title>On the lapse contour in the gravitational path integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10307v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational path integral is usually implemented with a covariant action by analogy with other gauge field theories, but the gravitational case is different in important ways. A key difference is that the integrand has an essential singularity, which occurs at zero lapse where the spacetime metric degenerates. The lapse integration contour required to impose the local time reparametrization constraints must run from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$, yet must not pass through zero. This raises the question: what is the correct integration contour, and why? We study that question by starting with the reduced phase space path integral, which involves no essential singularity. We observe that if the momenta are to be integrated before the lapse, to obtain a configuration space path integral, the lapse contour should pass below the origin in the complex lapse plane. This contour is also consistent with the requirement that quantum field fluctuation amplitudes have the usual short distance vacuum form, and with obtaining the Bekenstein-Hawking horizon entropy from a Lorentzian path integral. We close with a discussion of related issues, including potential obstacles to deriving a nonperturbative covariant gravitational path integral.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Suppression of Cosmic Rays' Flux in $\boldsymbol{f(R)}$ and $\boldsymbol{f(Q)}$ Theories of Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of magnetic diffusion on the spectrum of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) from a cosmological perspective. To this end, we consider two modified theories of gravity (MTGs), namely, the $f(R)$ gravity and a symmetric teleparallel gravity, also known as $f(Q)$ gravity. Utilizing these two MTGs, we calculate the suppression in the flux of UHECRs for a collection of sources. Non-evolution (NE) and cosmic star formation rate (SFR) scenarios have been considered in our calculation of the suppression factor. This study also includes a mixed composition scenario involving the nuclei upto iron (Fe). Furthermore, we provide a parameterization of the suppression factor for the proton and also for the mixed compositions within the $f(R)$ and $f(Q)$ theories, considering both NE and SFR scenarios. The influence of the turbulent magnetic field on the suppression factor is also incorporated in our work. Comparative analysis of all our results with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model reveals significant effects of MTGs on the suppression factor that the $f(R)$ power-law model predicts the lowest suppression factor, while the $f(Q)$ model predicts the highest, and interestingly the results from the standard model fall within the range predicted by these two cosmological models.</description>

      <title>Warped AdS$_3$ black hole thermodynamics and the charged Cardy formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the thermodynamic properties of black holes with warped AdS$_3$ asymptotics in topologically massive gravity. The holographically dual theory, often referred to as warped CFT$_2$, exhibits a single copy of the Virasoro-Kac-Moody algebra. Consequently, the asymptotic density of states in the right-moving sector is described by the charged Cardy formula that we review in detail. By defining specific linear combinations of the gravitational thermodynamic potentials, we are able to present the gravitational left- and right-moving on-shell actions directly in the grand-canonical ensemble. This allows us to demonstrate that, apart from the charged Cardy behavior in the right-moving sector, the dual field theory exhibits an additional frozen left-moving state giving rise to non-zero entropy contribution. Our findings elucidate the nature of warped CFTs and reveal subtle yet fundamental differences from the existing literature.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Sharpness of the Curvature Power Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the fact that a sharply peaked curvature spectrum is often considered in the literature, we examine theoretical constraints on the sharpness of such a spectrum. In particular, we show that the sharply peaked curvature power spectrum, originating from the enhancement of subhorizon perturbations during inflation, is significantly constrained by energy conservation. While the constraints do not depend on the exact form of inflaton potential, we also study concrete inflaton potentials that realize a sharply peaked curvature spectrum and how theoretical limits are saturated in these cases.</description>

      <title>Inflation with the Trace Anomaly Action and Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study inflation in a recently proposed gravitational effective field theory describing the trace anomaly. The theory requires an additional scalar which is massless in the early universe. This scalar -- referenced as an anomalyon -- couples to the familiar matter and radiation through the gauge field trace anomaly. We derive a class of cosmological solutions that deviate from the standard inflationary ones only slightly, in spite of the fact that the anomalyon has a sizable time dependent background. On the other hand, the scalar cosmological perturbations in this theory are different from the conventional inflationary perturbations. The inflaton and anomalyon perturbations mix, and one of the diagonal combinations gives the standard nearly scale-invariant adiabatic spectrum, while the other combination has a blue power spectrum at short distance scales. We argue that this blue spectrum can lead to the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) at distance scales much shorter than the ones tested in CMB observations. The resulting PBHs can be heavy enough to survive to the present day universe. For natural values of the parameters involved the PBHs would constitute only a tiny fraction of the dark matter, but with fine-tunings perhaps all of dark matter could be accounted by them. We also show that the theory predicts primordial gravitational waves which are almost identical to the standard inflationary ones.</description>

      <title>Re(l)ality: The View From Nowhere vs. The View From Everywhere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20520v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the fiber bundle framework, this work investigates the conceptual and mathematical foundations of reference frames in General Relativity by contrasting two paradigms. The View from Nowhere interprets frame representations as perspectives on an invariant equivalence class, while the View from Everywhere posits each frame representation as constituting a complete reality itself. What emerges is a conception of reality that I term "Relality". The paper critically examines the philosophical and practical implications of these views, with a focus on reconciling theory with experimental practice. Central to the discussion is the challenge of providing a perspicuous characterisation of ontology. The View from Nowhere aligns with the so-called sophisticated approach on symmetries and it complicates the empirical grounding of theoretical constructs. In contrast, the View from Everywhere offers a relational ontology that avoids the abstraction of equivalence classes.</description>

      <title>On the Gauge Invariance of Secondary Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Second-order tensor perturbations induced by primordial fluctuations play a crucial role in probing small-scale physics, but gauge dependence of their energy density has remained a fundamental challenge in cosmological perturbation theory. We address this issue by introducing a boundary condition-based filtering method that extracts physical radiation through the Sommerfeld criterion. We demonstrate that after filtering non-physical modes, the energy density of secondary gravitational waves becomes gauge-invariant and exhibits physically consistent behavior in the sub-horizon limit. This approach provides a unified framework for both adiabatic and isocurvature perturbations, enhancing theoretical predictions and observational signatures of early universe physics.</description>

      <title>WilloWISPs: A New Dark Growth Channel for Black Holes Suggests a Full-Spectrum Hierarchical MACHO Mass Function for Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evidence of neutron stars with deconfined quark-matter cores suggest a new pathway for the evolution of black holes. New theories about the cores of neutron stars support the idea that quarkonium is likely to grow there as the neutron star ages. Surveys of stellar remnants have shown that there is no major mass gap between neutron stars and black holes. Black holes, specifically primordial ones (PBHs), have been suggested as an explanation for dark matter before. However, the way that very large black holes can form in the lifetime of the visible universe has only recently been explained with a promising solution to The Final Parsec Problem. If neutron stars can become exotic stars or black holes surrounded by axions, then they may allow Intermediate-Mass Black Holes (IMBH) and Supermassive Black Holes (SMBH) to form quickly enough via coalescence. We find that a hierarchical clustering of Massive and Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs) with axion-dominated mini-halos can help to explain all of the missing dark matter. The model presented here suggests that this type of MACHO is likely equivalent to black holes above an unknown critical mass, which is less than ~1 $M_{\odot}$, and that they ought to be quark stars below this mass. If quark stars are a transition state between neutron stars and black holes, then black holes ought to be equivalent to boson stars, after all the residual quark material has formed a Bose-Einstein condensate of strange mesons.</description>

      <title>Weak mixing angle under $\text{U}(1, 3)$ colored gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Colored gravity, based on $\text{U}(1,3)$ symmetry, emerges naturally in the complexification of Lorentzian manifolds and integrates U(1) electromagnetism as a subcase. This work explores the viability of also including strong and electroweak interactions under the $\text{U}(1,3)$ gauge group of colored gravity. We identify specific generators linked to leptonic and quark interactions and embed the standard Higgs mechanism. Crucially, the weak mixing angle ($\sin^2\theta_W$) is predicted to exhibit about $\sim0.231$ for lepton-lepton interactions (close to observations) and $\sim0.222$ for hadron-lepton interactions, which is in 3$\sigma$ tension with some observations. These findings open pathways for reconciling experimental data with colored gravity and suggest avenues for quantum correction studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity path integral of the trumpet can be interpreted as a transition amplitude from an older black hole to a younger one, accompanied by the emission of a baby universe, represented by the geodesic boundary of the trumpet. However, this interpretation becomes less straightforward for geometries with higher genus and multiple geodesic boundaries. In this paper, we examine the path integral for these more complex geometries and find that maintaining this interpretation requires accounting for a portion of the moduli space.</description>

      <title>Observation of the quantum equivalence principle for matter-waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14535v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Einstein's general theory of relativity is based on the principle of equivalence - in essence, dating back to Galileo - which asserts that, locally, the effect of a gravitational field is equivalent to that of an accelerating reference frame, so that the local gravitational field is eliminated in a freely-falling frame. Einstein's theory enables this principle to extend to a global description of relativistic space-time, at the expense of allowing space-time to become curved, realising a consistent frame-independent description of nature at the classical level. Einstein's theory has been confirmed to great accuracy for astrophysical bodies. However, in the quantum domain the equivalence principle has been predicted to take a unique form involving a gauge phase that is observable if the wavefunction - fundamental to quantum descriptions - allows an object to interfere with itself after being simultaneously at rest in two differently accelerating frames, one being the laboratory (Newtonian) frame and the other in the freely-falling (Einsteinian) frame. To measure this gauge phase we realise a novel cold-atom interferometer in which one wave packet stays static in the laboratory frame while the other is in free fall. We follow the relative-phase evolution of the wave packets in the two frames, confirming the equivalence principle in the quantum domain. Our observation is yet another fundamental test of the interface between quantum theory and gravity. The new interferometer also opens the door for further probing of the latter interface, as well as to searches for new physics.</description>
