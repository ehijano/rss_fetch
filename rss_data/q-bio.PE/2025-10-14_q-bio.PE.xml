      <title>Bigger is Faster in the Adaptive Immune Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zoonotic pathogens represent a growing global risk, yet the speed of adaptive immune activation across mammalian species remains poorly understood. Despite orders-of-magnitude differences in size and metabolic rate, we show that the time to initiate adaptive immunity is remarkably consistent across species. To understand this invariance, we analyse empirical data showing how the numbers and sizes of lymph nodes scale with body mass, finding that larger animals have both more and larger lymph nodes. Using scaling theory and our mathematical model, we show that larger lymph nodes enable faster search times, conferring an advantage to larger animals that otherwise face slower biological times. This enables mammals to maintain, or even accelerate, the time to initiate the adaptive immune response as body size increases. We validate our analysis in simulations and compare it to empirical data.</description>

      <title>Observer-Based Source Localization in Tree Infection Networks via Laplace Transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of localizing the source of infection in an undirected, tree-structured network under a susceptible-infected outbreak model. The infection propagates with independent random time increments (i.e., edge-delays) between neighboring nodes, while only the infection times of a subset of nodes can be observed. We show that a reduced set of observers may be sufficient, in the statistical sense, to localize the source and characterize its identifiability via the joint Laplace transform of the observers' infection times. Using the explicit form of these transforms in terms of the edge-delay probability distributions, we propose scale-invariant least-squares estimators of the source. We evaluate their performance on synthetic trees and on a river network, demonstrating accurate localization under diverse edge-delay models. To conclude, we highlight overlooked technical challenges for observer-based source localization on networks with cycles, where standard spanning-tree reductions may be ill-posed.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Public Goods Game in Dynamical Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolutionary mechanisms of cooperative behavior represent a fundamental topic in complex systems and evolutionary dynamics. Although recent advances have introduced real-world stochasticity in nonlinear public goods game (PGG), such stochasticity remains static, neglecting its origin in the external environment as well as the coevolution of system stochasticity and cooperative behavior driven by environmental dynamics. In this work, we introduce a dynamic environment feedback mechanism into the stochastic nonlinear PGG framework, establishing a coevolutionary model that couples environmental states and individual cooperative strategies. Our results demonstrate that the interplay among environment feedback, nonlinear effects, and stochasticity can drive the system toward a wide variety of steady-state structures, including full defection, full cooperation, stable coexistence, and periodic limit cycles. Further analysis reveals that asymmetric nonlinear parameters and environment feedback rates exert significant regulatory effects on cooperation levels and system dynamics. This study not only enriches the theoretical framework of evolutionary game theory, but also provides a foundation for the management of ecological systems and the design of cooperative mechanisms in society.</description>

      <title>Once bitten, twice shy: A modeling framework for incorporating heterogeneous mosquito biting into transmission models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The risk of mosquito-borne disease outbreaks is tightly linked to the frequency at which mosquitoes feed on blood, also known as the biting rate. However, standard models of mosquito-borne disease transmission inherently assume that mosquitoes bite only once per reproductive cycle -- an assumption commonly violated in nature. Drivers of multiple biting also affect the mosquito gonotrophic cycle duration (GCD), the quantity customarily used to estimate biting rates. Here, we present a novel framework for incorporating more complex mosquito biting behaviors into transmission models, accounting for heterogeneity and linkages between mosquito biting rates and multiple biting. We provide general formulas for the basic offspring number, $\mathcal{N}_0$, and basic reproduction number, $\mathcal{R}_0$, threshold measures for mosquito population and pathogen transmission persistence, respectively. To exhibit its flexibility, we expand on specific models derived from the framework that arise from empirical, phenomenological, or mechanistic modeling perspectives. Using the gonotrophic cycle duration as a standard quantity to make comparisons among the models, we show that assumptions about the biting process strongly affect the relationship between GCD and $\mathcal{R}_0$. While under the standard assumption of one bite per reproductive cycle, $\mathcal{R}_0$ is an increasing linear function of the inverse of the GCD, alternative models of the biting process can exhibit saturating or concave relationships. Critically, from a mechanistic perspective, decreases in the GCD can lead to substantial decreases in $\mathcal{R}_0$. This work highlights the importance of incorporating the behavioral dynamics of mosquitoes into transmission models and provides a method for evaluating how individual-level interventions against mosquito biting scale up to determine population-level mosquito-borne disease risk.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing Phylogenetic Level-2 Networks with Quartets and Inter-Taxon Quartet Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inference of phylogenetic networks, which model complex evolutionary processes including hybridization and gene flow, remains a central challenge in evolutionary biology. Until now, statistically consistent inference methods have been limited to phylogenetic level-1 networks, which allow no interdependence between reticulate events. In this work, we establish the theoretical foundations for a statistically consistent inference method for a much broader class: semi-directed level-2 networks that are outer-labeled planar and galled. We precisely characterize the features of these networks that are distinguishable from the topologies of their displayed quartet trees. Moreover, we prove that an inter-taxon distance derived from these quartets is circular decomposable, enabling future robust inference of these networks from quartet data, such as concordance factors obtained from gene tree distributions under the Network Multispecies Coalescent model. Our results also have novel identifiability implications across different data types and evolutionary models, applying to any setting in which displayed quartets can be distinguished.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Network Surrogates to leverage Mechanistic Expert Knowledge towards Reliable and Immediate Pandemic Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06500v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: During the COVID-19 crisis, mechanistic models have guided evidence-based decision making. However, time-critical decisions in a dynamical environment limit the time available to gather supporting evidence. We address this bottleneck by developing a graph neural network (GNN) surrogate of a spatially and demographically resolved mechanistic metapopulation simulator. This combined approach advances classical machine learning approaches which are often black box. Our design of experiments spans outbreak and persistent-threat regimes, up to three contact change points, and age-structured contact matrices on a 400-node spatial graph. We benchmark multiple GNN layers and identify an ARMAConv-based architecture that offers a strong accuracy-runtime trade-off. Across 30-90 day horizons and up to three contact change points, the surrogate attains 10-27 % mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) while delivering (near) constant runtime with respect to the forecast horizon. Our approach accelerates evaluation by up to 28,670 times compared with the mechanistic model, allowing responsive decision support in time-critical scenarios and straightforward web integration. These results show how GNN surrogates can translate complex metapopulation models into immediate, reliable tools for pandemic response.</description>

      <title>Fused Lasso Improves Accuracy of Co-occurrence Network Inference in Grouped Samples</title>

Abstract: Co-occurrence network inference algorithms have significantly advanced our understanding of microbiome communities. However, these algorithms typically analyze microbial associations within samples collected from a single environmental niche, often capturing only static snapshots rather than dynamic microbial processes. Previous studies have commonly grouped samples from different environmental niches together without fully considering how microbial communities adapt their associations when faced with varying ecological conditions. Our study addresses this limitation by explicitly investigating both spatial and temporal dynamics of microbial communities. We analyzed publicly available microbiome abundance data across multiple locations and time points, to evaluate algorithm performance in predicting microbial associations using our proposed Same-All Cross-validation (SAC) framework. SAC evaluates algorithms in two distinct scenarios: training and testing within the same environmental niche (Same), and training and testing on combined data from multiple environmental niches (All). To overcome the limitations of conventional algorithms, we propose fuser, an algorithm that, while not entirely new in machine learning, is novel for microbiome community network inference. It retains subsample-specific signals while simultaneously sharing relevant information across environments during training. Unlike standard approaches that infer a single generalized network from combined data, fuser generates distinct, environment-specific predictive networks. Our results demonstrate that fuser achieves comparable predictive performance to existing algorithms such as glmnet when evaluated within homogeneous environments (Same), and notably reduces test error compared to baseline algorithms in cross-environment (All) scenarios.</description>
