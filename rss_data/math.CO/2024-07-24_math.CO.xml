      <title>Kida's formula for graphs with ramifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently Iwasawa theory for graphs is developing. A significant achievement includes an analogue of Iwasawa class number formula, which describes the asymptotic growth of the numbers of spanning trees for $\mathbb{Z}_p$-coverings of graphs. Moreover, an analogue of Kida's formula concerning the behavior of the $\lambda$- and $\mu$-invariants is obtained for unramified coverings. In this paper, we establish Kida's formula for possibly ramified coverings.</description>

      <title>Number of Subgraphs and Their Converses in Tournaments and New Digraph Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An oriented graph $D$ is converse invariant if, for any tournament $T$, the number of copies of $D$ in $T$ is equal to that of its converse $-D$. El Sahili and Ghazo Hanna [J. Graph Theory 102 (2023), 684-701] showed that any oriented graph $D$ with maximum degree at most 2 is converse invariant. They proposed a question: Can we characterize all converse invariant oriented graphs?
  In this paper, we introduce a digraph polynomial and employ it to give a necessary condition for an oriented graph to be converse invariant. This polynomial serves as a cornerstone in proving all the results presented in this paper. In particular, we characterize all orientations of trees with diameter at most 3 that are converse invariant. We also show that all orientations of regular graphs are not converse invariant if $D$ and $-D$ have different degree sequences. In addition, in contrast to the findings of El Sahili and Ghazo Hanna, we prove that every connected graph $G$ with maximum degree at least $3$, admits an orientation $D$ of $G$ such that $D$ is not converse invariant. We pose one conjecture.</description>

Abstract: We study the two statistics, the inversion number and the major index, on Catalan combinatorial objects such as $r$-Dyck paths, $r$-Stirling permutations, non-crossing partitions, Dyck tilings, and symmetric Dyck paths. We show that they are equidistributed with the inversion number or the major index on Dyck paths.</description>

      <title>Convex hull lattices point generated</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simplest way to generate a lattice of convex sets is to consider an initial set of points and draw segments, triangles, and any convex hull from it, then intersect them to obtain new points, and so forth. The result is an infinite lattice for most sets, while only a few initial sets of points perform a finite lattice. By giving an adequate notion of the configuration of points, we identify which sets in the plane define a finite convex hull lattice: four regular families and one sporadic configuration. We explore configurations in the space and higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>On the Boundary of the Harter-Heighway dragon curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we apply an L-system to prove a recurrence formula for the length of the boundary of iterands of the well known Harter-Heighway dragon curve, a space filling curve with fractal boundary. This leads to finding formulas for related sequences of certain binary strings and ternary matrices. This proves some long standing conjectures for the recurrence relation for the number of terms in the boundary of the dragon curve, first stated in unpublished work Daykin and Tucker in 1975.</description>

      <title>Improving the Caro-Wei bound and applications to Tur\'{a}n stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that if $G$ is a graph and $f(v) \leq 1/(d(v) + 1/2)$ for each $v\in V(G)$, then either $G$ has an independent set of size at least $\sum_{v\in V(G)}f(v)$ or $G$ contains a clique $K$ such that $\sum_{v\in K}f(v) &gt; 1$. This result implies that for any $\sigma \leq 1/2$, if $G$ is a graph and every clique $K\subseteq V(G)$ has at most $(1 - \sigma)(|K| - \sigma)$ simplicial vertices, then $\alpha(G) \geq \sum_{v\in V(G)} 1 / (d(v) + 1 - \sigma)$. Letting $\sigma = 0$ implies the famous Caro-Wei Theorem, and letting $\sigma = 1/2$ implies that if fewer than half of the vertices in each clique of $G$ are simplicial, then $\alpha(G) \geq \sum_{v\in V(G)}1/(d(v) + 1/2)$, which is tight for the 5-cycle. When applied to the complement of a graph, this result implies the following new Tur\' an stability result. If $G$ is a $K_{r + 1}$-free graph with more than $(1 - 1/r)n^2/2 - n/4$ edges, then $G$ contains an independent set $I$ such that at least half of the vertices in $I$ are complete to $G - I$. Applying this stability result iteratively provides a new proof of the stability version of Tur\' an's Theorem in which $K_{r + 1}$-free graphs with close to the extremal number of edges are $r$-partite.</description>

      <title>Distance Reconstruction of Sparse Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the distance query model, we are given access to the vertex set of a $n$-vertex graph $G$, and an oracle that takes as input two vertices and returns the distance between these two vertices in $G$. We study how many queries are needed to reconstruct the edge set of $G$ when $G$ is sampled according to the $G(n,p)$ Erd\H{o}s-Renyi-Gilbert distribution. Our approach applies to a large spectrum of values for $p$ starting slightly above the connectivity threshold: $p \geq \frac{2000 \log n}{n}$. We show that there exists an algorithm that reconstructs $G \sim G(n,p)$ using $O( \Delta^2 n \log n )$ queries in expectation, where $\Delta$ is the expected average degree of $G$. In particular, for $p \in [\frac{2000 \log n}{n}, \frac{\log^2 n}{n}]$ the algorithm uses $O(n \log^5 n)$ queries.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M_k$ be a $2n$-vertex graph with $n$ pairwise disjoint edges and let $\mathcal{H}^{(p,s)}(n)$ be the family of subsets of $V(M_n)$ that span exactly $p$ edges and $s$ isolated vertices. We prove that for $n\ge 2p+s$ this family has the Erd\H{o}s--Ko--Rado property: the size of the largest intersecting family equals to the number of sets containing a fixed vertex. The bound $n\ge 2p+s$ is the best possible, improving a recent theorem with $n\ge 2p+2s$ by Fuentes and Kamat.</description>

      <title>A note on the probability of a groupoid having deficient sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A subset $X$ of a groupoid is said to be deficient if $|X \cdot X|\leq |X|$. It is well-known that the probability that a random groupoid has a deficient $t$-element set with $t\geq 3$ is zero. However, as conjectured in [4], we show that the probability is not zero in the case of sets of two elements and calculate the exact value. We explore some generalisations on deficient sets and their likelihoods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a model of tree-rooted planar maps weighted by their number of $2$-connected blocks. We study its enumerative properties and prove that it undergoes a phase transition. We give the distribution of the size of the largest $2$-connected blocks in the three regimes (subcritical, critical and supercritical) and further establish that the scaling limit is the Brownian Continuum Random Tree in the critical and supercritical regimes, with respective rescalings $\sqrt{n/\log(n)}$ and $\sqrt{n}$.</description>

      <title>Fractional coloring with local demands and applications to degree-sequence bounds on the independence number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.11806</link>
      <description>arXiv:1811.11806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a fractional coloring, vertices of a graph are assigned measurable subsets of the real line and adjacent vertices receive disjoint subsets; the fractional chromatic number of a graph is at most $k$ if it has a fractional coloring in which each vertex receives a subset of $[0, 1]$ of measure at least $1/k$. We introduce and develop the theory of "fractional colorings with local demands" wherein each vertex "demands" a certain amount of color that is determined by local parameters such as its degree or the clique number of its neighborhood. This framework provides the natural setting in which to generalize degree-sequence type bounds on the independence number. Indeed, by Linear Programming Duality, all of the problems we study have an equivalent formulation as a problem concerning weighted independence numbers, and they often imply new bounds on the independence number.
  Our results and conjectures are inspired by many of the most classical results and important open problems concerning the independence number and the chromatic number, often simultaneously. We conjecture a local strengthening of both Shearer's bound on the independence number of triangle-free graphs and the fractional relaxation of Molloy's recent bound on their chromatic number, as well as a longstanding problem of Ajtai et al.\ on the independence number of $K_r$-free graphs and the fractional relaxations of Reed's $\omega, \Delta, \chi$ Conjecture and the Total Coloring Conjecture. We prove an approximate version of the first two, and we prove "local demands" versions of Vizing's Theorem and of some $\chi$-boundedness results.</description>

      <title>Counting oriented trees in digraphs with large minimum semidegree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $T$ be an oriented tree on $n$ vertices with maximum degree at most $e^{o(\sqrt{\log n})}$. If $G$ is a digraph on $n$ vertices with minimum semidegree $\delta^0(G)\geq(\frac12+o(1))n$, then $G$ contains $T$ as a spanning tree, as recently shown by Kathapurkar and Montgomery (in fact, they only require maximum degree $o(n/\log n)$). This generalizes the corresponding result by Koml\'os, S\'ark\"ozy and Szemer\'edi for graphs. We investigate the natural question how many copies of $T$ the digraph $G$ contains. Our main result states that every such $G$ contains at least $|Aut(T)|^{-1}(\frac12-o(1))^nn!$ copies of $T$, which is optimal. This implies the analogous result in the undirected case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A widely open conjecture proposed by Bollob\'as, Erd\H{o}s, and Tuza in the early 1990s states that for any $n$-vertex graph $G$, if the independence number $\alpha(G) = \Omega(n)$, then there is a subset $T \subseteq V(G)$ with $|T| = o(n)$ such that $T$ intersects all maximum independent sets of $G$. In this paper, we prove that this conjecture holds for graphs that do not contain an induced $K_{s,t}$ for fixed $t \ge s$. Our proof leverages the probabilistic method at an appropriate juncture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If taken seriously, the advice in the title leads to interesting combinatorics. Consider N people moving between M rooms as follows: at each step, simultaneously, the smartest person in each room moves to a different room of their choice, while no one else moves. The process repeats. Let G(N,M) be the directed graph with vertices representing the M^N possible configurations and edges representing possible moves. We classify the pairs (N,M) such that every configuration can be reached from every other. More precisely, we prove that the graph G(N,M) is strongly connected if and only if M&gt;=N+1 (one extra room for maneuvering is both required and sufficient). In the case M&lt;=N, we explicitly describe strongly and weakly connected components. Proofs are either impossibility arguments, or explicit algorithms based on subgroups generated by derangements.</description>

      <title>Operational Umbral Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of almost purely operational methods in the study of umbral calculus. To accomplish this goal, we systematically reconstruct the theory operationally, offering new proofs and results throughout. Our approach is applied to the study of invertible power series, where we notably offer a concise two-line proof of Lagrange's inversion theorem and derive formulas for both fractional and regular compositional iterates, for which the latter is new. In addition, we will develop several new insights into umbral operators, including their fractional exponents and novel expressions, in connection with the previously discussed applications. Finally, we will elaborate on both established and new concepts and examples, such as pseudoinverses of delta operators and a natural generalization of the Laguerre polynomials.</description>

      <title>Zero-One Laws for Random Feasibility Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13133v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general random model of a combinatorial optimization problem with geometric structure that encapsulates both linear programming and integer linear programming. Let $Q$ be a bounded set called the feasible set, $E$ be an arbitrary set called the constraint set, and $A$ be a random linear transform. We define and study the $\ell^q$-margin, $M_q := d_q(AQ, E)$. The margin quantifies the feasibility of finding $y \in AQ$ satisfying the constraint $y \in E$. Our contribution is to establish strong concentration of the margin for any $q \in (2,\infty]$, assuming only that $E$ has permutation symmetry. The case of $q = \infty$ is of particular interest in applications -- specifically to combinatorial ``balancing'' problems -- and is markedly out of the reach of the classical isoperimetric and concentration-of-measure tools that suffice for $q \le 2$.
  Generality is a key feature of this result: we assume permutation symmetry of the constraint set and nothing else. This allows us to encode many optimization problems in terms of the margin, including random versions of: the closest vector problem, integer linear feasibility, perceptron-type problems, $\ell^q$-combinatorial discrepancy for $2 \le q \le \infty$, and matrix balancing. Concentration of the margin implies a host of new sharp threshold results in these models, and also greatly simplifies and extends some key known results.</description>

      <title>On the structure of EFX orientations on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fair division is the problem of allocating a set of items among agents in a fair manner. One of the most sought-after fairness notions is envy-freeness (EF), requiring that no agent envies another's allocation. When items are indivisible, it ceases to exist, and envy-freeness up to any good (EFX) emerged as one of its strongest relaxations. The existence of EFX allocations is arguably the biggest open question within fair division. Recently, Christodoulou, Fiat, Koutsoupias, and Sgouritsa (EC 2023) showed that EFX allocations exist for the case of graphical valuations where an instance is represented by a graph: nodes are agents, edges are goods, and each agent values only her incident edges. On the other hand, they showed NP-hardness for checking the existence of EFX orientation where every edge is allocated to one of its incident vertices, and asked for a characterization of graphs that exhibit EFX orientation regardless of the assigned valuations. In this paper, we make significant progress toward answering their question. We introduce the notion of strongly EFX orientable graphs -- graphs that have EFX orientations regardless of how much agents value the edges. We show a surprising connection between this property and the chromatic number $\chi(G)$ of the graph $G$. In particular, we show that graphs with $\chi(G)\le 2$ are strongly EFX orientable, and those with $\chi(G)&gt;3$ are not strongly EFX orientable. We provide examples of strongly EFX orientable and non-strongly EFX orientable graphs of $\chi(G)=3$ to prove tightness. Finally, we give a complete characterization of strong EFX orientability when restricted to binary valuations.</description>

      <title>The directed landscape from Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define an almost sure bijection which constructs the directed landscape from a sequence of infinitely many independent Brownian motions. This is the analogue of the RSK correspondence in this setting. The Brownian motions arise as a marginal of the extended Busemann process for the directed landscape, and the inverse map gives an explicit and natural coupling where Brownian last passage percolation converges in probability to the directed landscape. We use this map to prove that the directed landscape on a strip can be reconstructed from the Airy line ensemble. Along the way, we describe two more new versions of RSK in the semi-discrete setting, build a general theory of sorting via Pitman operators, and construct extended Busemann processes for the directed landscape and Brownian last passage percolation.</description>

      <title>On Ramsey degrees, compactness and approximability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02007v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the consequences of the Compactness Principle in structural Ramsey theory is that the small Ramsey degrees cannot exceed the corresponding big Ramsey degrees, thereby justifying the choice of adjectives. However, it is unclear what happens in the realm of dual Ramsey degrees due to the lack of the compactness argument that applies to that setting. In this paper we present a framework within which both "direct" and dual Ramsey statements can be stated and reasoned about in a uniform fashion. We introduce the notion of approximability which yields a general compactness argument powerful enough to prove statements about both "direct" and dual Ramsey phenomena. We conclude the paper with an application of the new strategies by generalizing Voigt's $\star$-version of the Infinite Ramsey Theorem to a large class of relational structures and deriving a Ramsey statement for "loose colorings" of enumerated Fra\"{\i}ss\'{e} limits.</description>
