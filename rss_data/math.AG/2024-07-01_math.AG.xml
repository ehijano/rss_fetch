      <title>Conics on smooth quartic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the maximal number of conics, a priori irreducible of reducible, on a smooth spatial quartic surface is 800, realized by a unique quartic. We also classify quartics with many (at least 720) conics. The maximal number of real conics on a real quartics is between 656 and 718.</description>

      <title>Geometry of syzygies of sheaves on $\mathbb{P}^2$ via interpolation and Bridgeland stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the minimal free resolution of a general semi-stable sheaf $U$ on $\mathbb{P}^2$ contains a subcomplex that determines an extremal ray of the cone of effective divisors of its moduli space. We provide evidence that this is part of a general phenomenon in which minimal free resolutions, for distinct Betti tables, contain subcomplexes depending on wall-crossing. From this viewpoint, we provide new computations of the movable cones and Mori decompositions of some moduli spaces of sheaves using syzygies.</description>

      <title>Projective closure of Gorenstein monomial curves and the Cohen-Macaulay property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $C({\bf a})$ be a Gorenstein non-complete intersection monomial curve in the 4-dimensional affine space. There is a vector ${\bf v} \in \mathbb{N}^{4}$ such that for every integer $m \geq 0$, the monomial curve $C({\bf a}+m{\bf v})$ is Gorenstein non-complete intersection whenever the entries of ${\bf a}+m{\bf v}$ are relatively prime. In this paper, we study the arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay property of the projective closure of $C({\bf a}+m{\bf v})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let F be the function field of a curve over a complete discretely valued field K. Let G be a semisimple simply connected linear algebraic group over F of type An. We give a description of the obstruction to local global principle for principal homogeneous spaces under G over F with respect to discrete valuations of F in terms of R-equivalence classes of G over some suitable over fields. Using this description we prove that this obstruction vanishes under some conditions on the residue field K.</description>

      <title>Good moduli spaces for boundary polarized Calabi-Yau surface pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct projective asymptotically good moduli spaces parametrizing boundary polarized CY surface pairs, which are projective slc Calabi-Yau pairs $(X,D)$ such that $D$ is ample and $X$ has dimension two. The moduli space provides a wall crossing between certain KSBA and K-moduli spaces and is the ample model of the Hodge line bundle. In the case of K3 surfaces with a non-symplectic automorphism, the moduli space gives a modular interpretation for the Baily--Borel compactification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and describe the "regular quotient" for the Hitchin fibration for symmetric spaces and explain some basic consequences for Higgs bundles. We include an invariant theoretic approach to spectral covers in this setting for the particular space $\mathrm{GL}_{2n}/(\mathrm{GL}_n\times \mathrm{GL}_n)$. We also include a study of the regular centralizer group scheme for quasisplit pairs, including a Galois description of a closely related group scheme. We collect some basic consequences for Hitchin systems associated to such pairs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the companion matrix construction for $\mathrm{GL}_n$ to build canonical sections of the Chevalley map $[\mathfrak{g}/G]\to \mathfrak{g}/\!/ G$ for classical groups $G$ as well as the group $G_2$. To do so, we construct canonical tensors on the associated spectral covers. As an application, we make explicit lattice descriptions of affine Springer fibers and Hitchin fibers for classical groups and $G_2$.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the direct image of an anti-ample vector bundle is anti-ample under any finite flat morphism of non-singular projective varieties. In the second part we prove some properties of big and nef vector bundles. In particular it is shown that the tensor product of a nef vector bundle with a nef and big vector bundle is again nef and big. This generalizes a result of Schneider.</description>

      <title>On moduli spaces of canonical threefolds with small genera and minimal volumes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the canonical model of a $3$-fold of general type with geometric genus $2$ and with minimal canonical volume $\frac{1}{3}$ must be a hypersurface of degree $16$ in $\mathbb{P}(1,1,2,3,8)$, which gives an explicit description of its canonical ring. This implies that the coarse moduli space $\mathcal{M}_{\frac{1}{3}, 2}$, parametrizing all canonical $3$-folds with canonical volume $\frac{1}{3}$ and geometric genus $2$, is an irreducible variety of dimension $189$. Parallel studies show that $\mathcal{M}_{1, 3}$ is irreducible as well and is of dimension $236$, and that $\mathcal{M}_{2, 4}$ is irreducible and is of dimension $270$. As being conceived, every member in these 3 families is simply connected. Additionally, our method yields the expected Noether inequality $\textrm{Vol}&gt;\frac{4}{3}p_g-\frac{10}{3}$ for $3$-folds of general type with $p_g=5$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Beilinson--Bloch heights and Abel--Jacobian periods of homologically trivial Chow cycles in families. For the Beilinson--Bloch heights, we show that for any $g\ge 2$, there is a Zariski open dense subset $U$ of $\mathcal{M}_g$, the coarse moduli of curves of genus $g$ over rationals, such that the heights of Ceresa cycles and Gross--Schoen cycles over $U$ satisfy the Northcott property. For the Abel--Jacobi periods, we provide an algebraic criterion for the existence of a Zariski open dense subset of any family such that all cycles not defined over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ are non-torsion and verify that this criterion holds for Ceresa cycles and Gross--Schoen cycles.</description>

      <title>Tannakian fundamental groups of blended extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A_1, A_2,A_3$ be semisimple objects in a neutral tannakian category over a field of characteristic zero. Let $L$ be an extension of $A_2$ by $A_1$, and $N$ an extension of $A_3$ by $A_2$. Let $M$ be a blended extension (extension panach\'ee) of $N$ by $L$. Under very mild and natural hypotheses, we study the unipotent radical of the tannakian fundamental group of $M$. Examples where our results apply include the unipotent radicals of motivic Galois groups of any mixed motive with three weights.
  As an application, we give a proof of the unipotent part of the Hodge-Nori conjecture for 1-motives (which is now a theorem of Andr\'e in the setting of Nori motives) in the setting of any tannakian category of motives where the group $Ext^1(1,\mathbb{Q}(1))$ is as expected.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct abelian categories of integral Nori motivic sheaves over a scheme of characteristic zero. The first step is to study the presentable derived category of Nori motives over a field. Next we construct an algebra in \'etale motives such that modules over it afford a t-structure that restricts to constructible objects. This category of integral Nori motives has the six operations and arc-descent. We finish by providing analogous constructions and results for mixed Hodge modules on schemes over the reals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to extend the quiver Grassmannian description of certain degenerations of Grassmann varieties to the symplectic case. We introduce a symplectic version of quiver Grassmannians studied in our previous papers and prove a number of results on these projective algebraic varieties. First, we construct a cellular decomposition of the symplectic quiver Grassmannians in question and develop combinatorics needed to compute Euler characteristics and Poincar\'e polynomials. Second, we show that the number of irreducible components of our varieties coincides with the Euler characteristic of the classical symplectic Grassmannians. Third, we describe the automorphism groups of the underlying symplectic quiver representations and show that the cells are the orbits of this group. Lastly, we provide an embedding into the affine flag varieties for the affine symplectic group.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the triply-graded Khovanov-Rozansky homology of the $(m,n)$ torus knot can be recovered from the finite-dimensional representation $\mathrm{L}_{m/n}$ of the rational Cherednik algebra at slope $m/n$, endowed with the Hodge filtration coming from the cuspidal character D-module. Our approach involves expressing the associated graded of the cuspidal character D-module in terms of a dg module closely related to the action of the shuffle algebra on the equivariant K-theory of the Hilbert scheme of points on the plane, thereby proving the rational master conjecture. As a corollary, we identify the Hodge filtration with the inductive and algebraic filtrations on $\mathrm{L}_{m/n}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the decomposition into irreducible components of the fixed point locus under the action of $\Gamma$ a finite subgroup of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ of the smooth Nakajima quiver variety of the Jordan quiver. The quiver variety associated with the Jordan quiver is either isomorphic to the punctual Hilbert scheme in $\mathbb{C}^2$ or to the Calogero-Moser space. We describe the irreducible components using quiver varieties of McKay's quiver associated with the finite subgroup $\Gamma$ and we have given a general combinatorial model of the indexing set of these irreducible components in terms of certain elements of the root lattice of the affine Lie algebra associated with $\Gamma$. Finally, we prove that for every projective, symplectic resolution of a wreath product singularity, there exists an irreducible component of the fixed point locus of the punctual Hilbert scheme in the plane that is isomorphic to the resolution.</description>

      <title>Thick subcategories on weighted projective curves and nilpotent representations of quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue the study of thick triangulated subcategories, started in arXiv:2007.02134, and consider thick subcategories in the derived category of a weighted projective curve and corresponding abelian thick subcategories. Our main result is that any thick subcategory on a weighted projective curve either is equivalent to the derived category of nilpotent representations of some quiver (we call such categories quiver-like) or is the orthogonal to an exceptional collection of torsion sheaves (we call such subcategories big). We provide several equivalent descriptions of big subcategories and explain that they can be explicitly classified. We give some results clarifying the structure of thick subcategories: in particular, for weighted projective lines we prove that any admissible subcategory is generated by an exceptional collection and any exceptional collection is a part of a full one. Apart from the above, we study general properties of quiver-like categories. In particular, we extend and simplify results from arXiv:2007.02134 providing sufficient criteria for a triangulated or abelian category to be quiver-like.</description>

      <title>The Quantum $A_{\infty}$-Relations on the Elliptic Curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.07940</link>
      <description>arXiv:1711.07940v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define and prove the existence of the Quantum $A_{\infty}$-relations on the Fukaya category of the elliptic curve, using the notion of the Feynman transform of a modular operad, as defined by Getzler and Kapranov. Following Barannikov, these relations may be viewed as defining a solution to the quantum master equation of Batalin-Vilkovisky geometry.</description>

      <title>Birational geometry of sextic double solids with a compound $A_n$ singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.00501v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sextic double solids, double covers of $\mathbb P^3$ branched along a sextic surface, are the lowest degree Gorenstein Fano 3-folds, hence are expected to behave very rigidly in terms of birational geometry. Smooth sextic double solids, and those which are $\mathbb Q$-factorial with ordinary double points, are known to be birationally rigid. In this article, we study sextic double solids with an isolated compound $A_n$ singularity. We prove a sharp bound $n \leq 8$, describe models for each $n$ explicitly and prove that sextic double solids with $n &gt; 3$ are birationally non-rigid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.01118v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study algebraic cycles on complex Gushel-Mukai (GM) varieties. We prove the generalised Hodge conjecture, the (motivated) Mumford-Tate conjecture, and the generalised Tate conjecture for all GM varieties. We compute all integral Chow groups of GM varieties, except for the only two infinite-dimensional cases (1-cycles on GM fourfolds and 2-cycles on GM sixfolds). We prove that if two GM varieties are generalised partners or generalised duals, their rational Chow motives in middle degree are isomorphic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.03035v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define an enrichment of the logarithmic derivative of the zeta function of a variety over a finite field to a power series with coefficients in the Grothendieck--Witt group. We show that this enrichment is related to the topology of the real points of a lift. For cellular schemes over a field, we prove a rationality result for this enriched logarithmic derivative of the zeta function as an analogue of part of the Weil conjectures. We also compute several examples, including toric varieties, and show that the enrichment is a motivic measure.</description>

      <title>Maps to toric varieties and toric degenerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.13137v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study and construct maps to toric varieties. In the process, we generalize torus embeddings to the non-projective case. Moreover, we give an analog of Cox's construction of toric varieties as GIT quotients of affine spaces for the non-normal case after T. Kajiwara.
  The main focus of the paper is an application to toric degenerations, (proper) families whose special fibers are not-necessarily-normal toric varieties. We give a negative answer to a question of I. Dolgachev and K. Kaveh as to whether a toric degeneration can be constructed as a degeneration by projection. In the classical topology over the complex numbers, we recover an alternative construction of integral systems as was done by Harada--Kaveh in M. Harada and K. Kaveh. "Integrable systems, toric degenerations and okounkov bodie" using a deformation retract. In particular, we have an analogue of a moment map from a variety admitting a toric degeneration to its Newton--Okounkov polytope.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the notion of rational singularities for any reflexive sheaf of rank $1$, link our notion of rational singularities with the notion of rational singularities in [Kov11], and prove generalizations of standard facts about rational singularities. Moreover, by using a definition of non-rational locus, we introduce the notion of $(B_{q+1})$ as a dual notion of well-known Serre's notion of $(S_{q+1})$, and prove a theorem about $q$-birational morphisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.12311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the complete classification of Chow motives of projective homogeneous varieties for $p$-inner semi-simple algebraic groups, with coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$. Our results involve a new motivic invariant, the Tate trace of a motive, defined as a pure Tate summand of maximal rank. They apply more generally to objects of the Tate subcategory generated by upper motives of irreducible, geometrically split varieties satisfying the nilpotence principle. Using Chernousov-Gille-Merkurjev decompositions and their interpretation through Bialynicki-Birula-Hesselink-Iversen filtrations due to Brosnan, we then generalize the characterization of the motivic equivalence of inner semi-simple groups through the higher Tits $p$-indexes. We also define the motivic splitting pattern and the motivic splitting towers of a summand of the motive of a projective homogeneous variety, which correspond for quadrics to the classical splitting pattern and Knebusch tower of the underlying quadratic form.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In [CS01, Page 109] Grothendieck sketches the construction of a complex J_*(X) or commutative pro-algebraic groups, associated to a smooth variety X, and for which each J_i(X) is a product of local factors called the local generalized jacobians. The purpose of this note is to recast this construction in the setting of higher algebraic group stacks for the fppf topology. For this, we introduce a notion of algebraic homology associated to a scheme which is a universal object computing fppf cohomology with coefficients in group schemes. We endow this algebraic homology with a filtration by dimension of supports, and prove that, when X is smooth, J_*(X) appears as the E1-page of the corresponding spectral sequence. In a final part we partially extends our constructions and results over arbitrary bases.</description>

      <title>Automorphisms and quotients of Calabi-Yau threefolds of type $A$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of the paper is to investigate the only two families $\mathcal{F}^A_{G}$ of Calabi-Yau $3$-folds $A/G$ with $A$ an abelian $3$-fold and $G\le \text{Aut}(A)$ a finite group acting freely: one in constructed by Catanese and Demleitner and the other is presented here. We provide a complete classification of the automorphism group of $X\in \mathcal{F}^A_{G}$. Additionally, we construct and classify the quotients $X/\Upsilon$ for any $\Upsilon\le \text{Aut}(X)$. Specifically, for those groups $\Upsilon$ that preserve the volume form of $X$ then $X/\Upsilon$ admits a desingularization $Y$ which is a Calabi-Yau $3$-fold: we compute the Hodge numbers and the fundamental group of these $Y$, thereby determining all topological in-equivalent Calabi-Yau $3$-folds obtained in this way.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we give a simple closed formula for an arbitrary product, landing in dimension 0, of boundary classes on the Deligne--Mumford moduli space M_0,n-bar. For any such boundary strata $X_{T_1}, \ldots, X_{T_\ell}$, we show the intersection product $\int \prod_{i=1}^\ell [X_{T_i}]$ is either a signed product of multinomial coefficients, or zero, and provide a simple criterion for determining when it is nonzero.
  We do not claim originality for our product formula, but to our knowledge it does not appear elsewhere in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let k be a field finitely generated over its prime subfield. We prove that the quotient of the Brauer group of a product of varieties over k by the Brauer groups of factors has finite exponent. The bulk of the proof concerns p-primary torsion in characteristic p. Our approach gives a more direct proof of the boundedness of the p-primary torsion of the Brauer group of an abelian variety, as recently proved by D'Addezio. We show that the transcendental Brauer group of a Kummer surface over k has finite exponent, but can be infinite when k is an infinite field of positive characteristic. This answers a question of Zarhin and the author.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we develop a theory of diminished multiplier ideals on singular varieties which was introduced by Hacon, and developed by Lehmann. We prove a result regarding the termination of certain type of flips with scaling of an ample divisor if the Cartier index is bounded, and if $\kappa_{\sigma}(K_X+\Delta)\ge \dim X-1$ holds. The proof uses a theory of diminished multiplier ideal.</description>

Abstract: We develop a theory of tdos and twisted $\mathcal D$-modules over general base schemes with a focus on functorial aspects. In particular, we introduce a flat base change functor and establish its compatibility with globalization and direct image functors. We also study forms of closed $K$-orbits of $\theta$-stable parabolic subgroups in the total flag variety. We apply these two developed theories to give a geometric construction of half-integral models of cohomologically induced modules. With a view towards arithmetic applications, we further demonstrate desirable properties of the constructed half-integral models, such as projectivity over the base and torsion-free relative Lie algebra cohomology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.06022v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a simple Lie algebra: its dual space $\mathfrak{g}^*$ is a Poisson variety. It is well known that for each nilpotent element $f$ in $\mathfrak{g}$, it is possible to construct a new Poisson structure by Hamiltonian reduction which is isomorphic to some subvariety of $\mathfrak{g}^*$, the Slodowy slice $S_f$. Given two nilpotent elements $f_1$ and $f_2$ with some compatibility assumptions, we prove Hamiltonian reduction by stages: the slice $S_{f_2}$ is the Hamiltonian reduction of the slice $S_{f_1}$. We also state an analogous result in the setting of finite W-algebras, which are quantizations of Slodowy slices. These results were conjectured by Morgan in his PhD thesis. As corollary in type A, we prove that any hook-type W-algebra can be obtained as Hamiltonian reduction from any other hook-type one. As an application, we establish a generalization of the Skryabin equivalence. Finally, we make some conjectures in the context of affine W-algebras.</description>

Abstract: Let $A$ be an abelian variety defined over a field $K.$ We study finite generation properties of the profinite group $\mathrm{Gal}(\Omega/K)$ and of certain closed normal subgroups thereof, where $\Omega$ is the torsion field of $A$ over $K$. In fact, we establish more general finite generation properties for monodromy groups attached to smooth projective varieties via \'etale cohomology. We apply this in order to give an independent proof and generalizations of a recent result of Checcoli and Dill about small exponent subfields of $\Omega/K$ in the number field case. We also give an application of our finite generation results in the realm of permanence principles for varieties with the weak Hilbert property.</description>

Abstract: This paper concerns the characteristic-$p$ fibers of $\mathsf{GU}(q-2,2)$ Shimura varieties, which classify abelian varieties with additional structure. These Shimura varieties admit two stratifications of interest: the Ekedahl-Oort stratification, based on the isomorphism class of the $p$-torsion subgroup scheme, and the Newton stratification, based on the isogeny class of the $p$-divisible group. It is natural to ask which Ekedahl-Oort strata intersect the unique closed Newton stratum, called the supersingular locus. In this paper, we present several novel techniques that give information about the interaction between the two stratifications for general signature $(q-2,2)$, and as an application, we completely answer this question for the signature $(3,2)$.</description>

Abstract: Denote by $J_m$ the Jacobian variety of the hyperelliptic curve defined by the affine equation $y^2=x^m+1$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, where $m \geq 3$ is a fixed positive integer. We compute several interesting arithmetic invariants of $J_m$: its decomposition up to isogeny into simple abelian varieties, the minimal field $\mathbb{Q}(\operatorname{End}(J_m))$ over which its endomorphisms are defined, its connected monodromy field $\mathbb{Q}(\varepsilon_{J_m})$, and its Sato-Tate group. Currently, there is no general algorithm that computes these last two invariants. Furthermore, for large enough values of $m$, the abelian varieties $J_m$ provide non-trivial examples of high-dimensional phenomena, such as degeneracy and the non-triviality of the extension $\mathbb{Q}(\varepsilon_{J_m})/\mathbb{Q}(\operatorname{End}(J_m))$. We also describe the Sato-Tate group of an abelian variety, generalizing existing results that apply only to non-degenerate varieties, and prove an extension of a well-known formula of Gross-Koblitz that relates values of the classical and $p$-adic gamma functions at rational arguments.</description>
