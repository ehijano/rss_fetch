      <description>arXiv:2410.16313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the fascinating world of Circumacenes, a unique family of organic molecules. Our research demonstrarates the calculation of essential topological indices, including the first and second-Zagreb indices, as well as related generalized indices, and their relationship with the structure of these molecules. We also indicate how these indices can help predict crucial thermodynamic properties, such as gap energy and electron affinity energy, using an innovative method called the Topological Indices Method (TIM).</description>

      <title>Neural network distillation of orbital dependent density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) offers a desirable balance between quantitative accuracy and computational efficiency in practical many-electron calculations. Its central component, the exchange-correlation energy functional, has been approximated with increasing levels of complexity ranging from strictly local approximations to nonlocal and orbital-dependent expressions with many tuned parameters. In this work, we formulate a general way of rewriting complex density functionals using deep neural networks in a way that allows for simplified computation of Kohn-Sham potentials as well as higher functional derivatives through automatic differentiation, enabling access to highly nonlinear response functions and forces. These goals are achieved by using a recently developed class of robust neural network models capable of modeling functionals, as opposed to functions, with explicitly enforced spatial symmetries. Functionals treated in this way are then called global density approximations and can be seamlessly integrated with existing DFT workflows. Tests are performed for a dataset featuring a large variety of molecular structures and popular meta-GGA density functionals, where we successfully eliminate orbital dependencies coming from the kinetic energy density, and discover a high degree of transferability to a variety of physical systems. The presented framework is general and could be extended to more complex orbital and energy dependent functionals as well as refined with specialized datasets.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical Nonadiabatic Molecular Dynamics for Molecular Exciton-Polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When the interaction between a molecular system and confined light modes in an optical or plasmonic cavity is strong enough to overcome the dissipative process, hybrid light-matter states (polaritons) emerge as the fundamental excitations in the system. Mixing the light and matter characters modifies molecules' photophysical and photochemical properties. It was reported that polaritonic states can be employed to control photochemical reactions, charge and energy transfer, and other processes. In addition, according to recent studies, vibrational strong coupling can be employed to enhance thermally activated chemical reactions resonantly. This work adopts a coherent state-based many-body state as the basis function to expand the light-matter Hamiltonian. The corresponding nonadiabatic Molecular Dynamics scheme is derived and implemented in the NEXMD package based on the semiclassical Ab Initio Multiple Cloning (AIMC) protocol. The scheme is demonstrated via a model system, pyridine, to demonstrate its validity. Our numerical results show that coherence and decoherence processes are distinguishable during the initial relaxation time in the AIMC simulations, while such dynamics are missing in the mixed quantum-classical surface hopping approach. Additionally, our results show that the light-matter coupling has smaller impact on the dynamics in surface hopping simulations. In the AIMC simulations, on the other hand, the relaxation time is increased, leading to a slower internal conversion and decreased equilibrium population build-up in the lowest electronically excited state. This highlights the importance of proper treatment of coherence in simulating exciton polaritons dynamics.</description>

      <title>Directing the Electrode-Electrolyte Interface Towards Active Nickel-Based Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive understanding of the electrode-electrolyte interface in energy conversion systems remains challenging due to the complex and multifaceted nature of interfacial processes. This complexity hinders the development of more efficient electrocatalysts. In this work, we propose a hybrid approach to the theoretical description of the OER process on nickel-iron-based oxyhydroxides ($\gamma$-Ni$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$OOH) electrodes in alkaline media as a model system. Multiple reaction pathways represented by the single- and dual-site mechanisms were investigated by taking into account the realistic structure of the catalyst, the doping, and the solvation effects using a simple and computationally feasible strategy. Accounting for the variable solvation effects considerably affects the predicted overpotential in a roughly linear relationship between overpotential and dielectric constant. By incorporating quantum chemical simulations with kinetic modeling, we demonstrate that tuning the local solvation environment can significantly enhance the OER activity, opening new routine ways for elucidation of the emerging issues of OER processes on transition metal oxide surfaces and design of cost-effective, efficient electrocatalytic systems.</description>

      <title>Chiral polaritonics: cavity-mediated enantioselective excitation condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Separation of the two mirror images of a chiral molecule, the enantiomers, is a historically complicated problem of major relevance for biological systems. Since chiral molecules are optically active, it has been speculated that strong coupling to circularly polarized fields may be used as a general procedure to unlock enantiospecific reactions. In this work, we focus on how chiral cavities can be used to drive asymmetry in the photochemistry of chiral molecular systems. We first show that strong coupling to circularly polarized fields leads to enantiospecific Rabi splittings, an effect that displays a collective behavior in line with other strong coupling phenomena. Additionally, entanglement with circularly polarized light generates an asymmetry in the enantiomer population of the polaritons, leading to a condensation of the excitation on a preferred molecular configuration. These results confirm that chiral cavities represent a tantalizing opportunity to drive asymmetric photochemistry in enantiomeric mixtures.</description>

      <title>ExoMol line lists -- LXV. Mid-Infrared rovibronic spectroscopy of isotopologues of NiH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: New line lists for four isotopologues of nickel monohydride, $^{58}$NiH, $^{60}$NiH, $^{62}$NiH, and $^{58}$NiD are presented covering the wavenumber range $&lt;10000$ cm$^{-1}$ ($\lambda &gt; 1$ $\mu$m), $J$ up to 37.5 for transitions within and between the three lowest-lying electronic states, ${X}\,^{2}\Delta$, ${W}\,^{2}\Pi$, and ${V}\,^{2}\Sigma^{+}$. The line lists are applicable for temperatures up to 5000 K. The line lists calculations are based on a recent empirical NiH spectroscopic model [Havalyova et al. J. Quant. Spectrosc. Radiat. Transf., 272, 107800, (2021)] which is adapted for the variational nuclear-motion code Duo. The model consists of potential energy curves, spin-orbit coupling curves, electronic angular momentum curves, spin-rotation coupling curves, $\Lambda$-doubling correction curve for $^2\Pi$ states and Born-Oppenheimer breakdown (BOB) rotational correction curves. New ab initio dipole moment curves, scaled to match the experimental dipole moment of the ground state, are used to compute Einstein A coefficients. The BYOT line lists are included in the ExoMol database at www.exomol.com.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear semiclassical spectroscopy of ultrafast molecular polariton dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a theoretical framework that allows for the systematic and efficient description of the ultrafast nonlinear response of molecular polaritons, i.e., hybrid light-matter states, in the collective regime of large numbers of molecules $\mathcal N$ coupled to the cavity photon mode. Our approach is based on a semiclassical, mean-field evolution of the molecular Hamiltonian and the cavity field, which is complemented by a perturbative expansion of both light and matter counterparts in the input fields entering the cavity. In addition, expansion in terms of the pulse phases enables us to disentangle different excitation pathways in Liouville space, thereby distinguishing contributions to the nonlinear response. The formalism extends traditional free-space nonlinear spectroscopy by incorporating the feedback of matter onto the light field via the induced polarization. We demonstrate the utility of the framework by applying it to the calculation of pump-probe polariton spectra and show how, by storing the pulses, the cavity facilitates additional excitation pathways which are not possible in free space. Our method, which does not scale with $\mathcal N$, is broadly applicable and can be extended to a wide range of current experiments investigating the dynamical nonlinear response of hybrid light-matter states.</description>

      <title>Single particle tracking of polymer aggregates inside disordered porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The diffusion motions of individual polymer aggregates in disordered porous media were visualized using the single particle tracking (SPT) method because the motions inside porous media play important roles in various fields of science and engineering. The aggregates diffused on the surfaces of pores; continuous adsorption and desorption processes were obserbed. The relationship between the size of the aggregates and pore size was analysed based on diffusion coefficients, moment scaling spectrum (MSS) slope, and diffusion anisotropy analyisies. The obtained diffusion coefficients were different for different the aggregate and pore sizes. The MSS Slope analysis indicated that more than 85% of the aggregates were confined diffusion for all the conditions investigated. The diffusion anisotropies analysis suggested that the diffusions of the aggregates were anisotropic. The interactions between the aggregates and the pores were complex and exhibited different motions than surface diffusion of smooth surfaces.</description>

      <title>An evaluation of machine learning/molecular mechanics end-state corrections with mechanical embedding to calculate relative protein-ligand binding free energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of machine-learning (ML) potentials offers significant accuracy improvements compared to molecular mechanics (MM) because of the inclusion of quantum-mechanical effects in molecular interactions. However, ML simulations are several times more computationally demanding than MM simulations, so there is a trade-off between speed and accuracy. One possible compromise are hybrid machine learning/molecular mechanics (ML/MM) approaches with mechanical embedding that treat the intramolecular interactions of the ligand at the ML level and the protein-ligand interactions at the MM level. Recent studies have reported improved protein-ligand binding free energy results based on ML/MM with mechanical embedding, arguing that intramolecular interactions like torsion potentials of the ligand are often the limiting factor for accuracy. This claim is evaluated based on 108 relative binding free energy calculations for four different benchmark systems. As an alternative strategy, we also tested a tool that fits the MM dihedral potentials to the ML level of theory. Overall, the relative binding free energy results from MM with Open Force Field 2.2.0, MM with ML-fitted torsion potentials, and the corresponding ML/MM end-state corrected simulations show no statistically significant differences in the mean absolute errors (between 0.8 and 0.9 kcal/mol). Therefore, a well-parameterized force field is on a par with simple mechanical embedding ML/MM simulations for protein-ligand binding. In terms of computational costs, the reparametrization of poor torsional potentials is preferable over employing computationally intensive ML/MM simulations of protein-ligand complexes with mechanical embedding. Also, the refitting strategy leads to lower variances of the protein-ligand binding free energy results than the ML/MM end-state corrections.</description>

      <title>Interpreting tunneling spectroscopic maps of a dinuclear Co(II) complex on gold</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scanning tunneling microscope data from a dinuclear Co(II) complex adsorbed on Au(111) are analysed using density functional theory calculations. We find that the interaction with the substrate substantially changes the geometry of the non-planar molecule. Its electronic states, however, remain fairly similar to those calculated for a gas-phase molecule. The calculations reproduce intriguing contrasts observed in experimental maps of the differential conductance dI/dV and reveal the relative importance of geometric and electronic factors that impinge on the image contrasts. For a meaningful comparison, it is important that the calculations closely mimic the experimental mode of measurement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autocatalysis, the ability of a chemical system to make more of itself, is a crucial feature in metabolism and is speculated to have played a decisive role in the origin of life. Nevertheless, how autocatalytic systems behave far from equilibrium remains unexplored. In this work, we elaborate on recent advances regarding the stoichiometric characterization of autocatalytic networks, particularly their absence of mass-like conservation laws, to study how this topological feature influences their nonequilibrium behavior. Building upon the peculiar topology of autocatalytic networks, we derive a decomposition of the chemical fluxes, which highlights the existence of productive modes in their dynamics. These modes produce the autocatalysts in net excess and require the presence of external fuel/waste species to operate. Relying solely on topology, the fluxes decomposition holds under broad conditions and, in particular, do not require steady-state or elementary reactions. Additionally, we show that once externally controlled, the non-conservative forces brought by the external species do not act on these productive modes. This must be considered when one is interested in the thermodynamics of open autocatalytic networks. Specifically, we show that an additional term must be added to the semigrand free-energy. Finally, from the thermodynamic potential, we derive the thermodynamic cost associated with the production of autocatalysts.</description>

Abstract: The abundant demand for deep learning compute resources has created a renaissance in low precision hardware. Going forward, it will be essential for simulation software to run on this new generation of machines without sacrificing scientific fidelity. In this paper, we examine the precision requirements of a representative kernel from quantum chemistry calculations: calculation of the single particle density matrix from a given mean field Hamiltonian (i.e. Hartree-Fock or Density Functional Theory) represented in an LCAO basis. We find that double precision affords an unnecessarily high level of precision, leading to optimization opportunities. We show how an approximation built from an error-free matrix multiplication transformation can be used to potentially accelerate this kernel on future hardware. Our results provide a road map for adapting quantum chemistry software for the next generation of High Performance Computing platforms.</description>

      <title>A New Angle on Benchmarking Noncovalent Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For noncovalent interactions (NCIs), the CCSD(T) coupled cluster method is widely regarded as the `gold standard'. With localized orbital approximations, benchmarks for ever larger NCI complexes are being published; yet tantalizing evidence from quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) results appears to indicate that as the system size grows, CCSD(T) overbinds NCIs by progressively larger amounts, particularly when $\pi$-stacking is involved. Alas, post-CCSD(T) methods like CCSDT(Q) are cost-prohibitive, which requires us to consider alternative means of estimating post-CCSD(T) contributions. In this work, we take a step back by considering the evolution of the correlation energy with respect to the number of subunits for such $\pi$-stacked sequences as acene dimers and alkadiene dimers. We show it to be almost perfectly linear, and propose the slope of the line as a probe for the behavior of a given electron correlation method. By comparison with rank-reduced CCSDT(Q) results for benzene and naphthalene dimers, we show that while CCSD(T) does slightly overbind, it does not at the level suggested by the QMC results.</description>

      <title>Non-Stationary Long-Term Dynamics via Selected Incomplete Dual Bases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating the dynamics of non-stationary, long-term many-body quantum systems poses significant challenges due to the large size of the state space. We are examining how traditional basis sets struggle to accurately represent long-term dynamics when using incomplete sets. To address this issue, we propose using an SU(2) coherent state basis and deriving equations of motion for both time-independent and time-dependent Hamiltonian. This methodology involves a sampling approach, where a subset of relevant configurations is chosen based on energy criteria, and a projection method is used to enhance the accuracy of wavefunction propagation while reducing computational cost. We evaluate this method through numerical simulations of a seven-qubit system, calculating key physical observables such as state probabilities and domain-wall densities. Our results indicate that while complete basis sets offer accurate dynamics, selected incomplete sets can recover essential features, especially with the assistance of a projector. Our conclusion suggests that the selected incomplete dual basis method can efficiently capture both short-term and long-term dynamics.</description>

      <title>Extending Radiowave Frequency Detection Range with Dressed States of Solid-State Spin Ensembles</title>

Abstract: Quantum sensors using solid-state spin defects excel in the detection of radiofrequency (RF) fields, serving various purposes in communication, ranging, and sensing. For this purpose, pulsed dynamical decoupling (PDD) protocols are typically applied, which enhance sensitivity to RF signals. However, these methods are limited to frequencies of a few megahertz, which poses a challenge for sensing higher frequencies. We introduce an alternative approach based on a continuous dynamical decoupling (CDD) scheme involving dressed states of nitrogen vacancy (NV) ensemble spins driven within a microwave resonator. We compare the CDD methods to established PDD protocols and demonstrate the detection of RF signals up to $\sim$ 85 MHz, about ten times the current limit imposed by the PDD approach under identical conditions. Implementing the CDD method in a heterodyne synchronized protocol combines the high frequency detection with high spectral resolution. This advancement extends to various domains requiring detection in the high frequency (HF) and very high frequency (VHF) ranges of the RF spectrum, including spin sensor-based magnetic resonance spectroscopy at high magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Ionization potential of radium monofluoride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14673v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ionization potential (IP) of radium monofluoride (RaF) was measured to be 4.969(2)[10] eV, revealing a relativistic enhancement in the series of alkaline earth monofluorides. The results are in agreement with a relativistic coupled-cluster prediction of 4.969[7] eV, incorporating up to quantum electrodynamics corrections. Using the same computational methodology, an improved calculation for the dissociation energy ($D_{0}$) of 5.54[5] eV is presented. This confirms that radium monofluoride joins the small group of diatomic molecules for which $D_{0}&gt;\mathrm{IP}$, paving the way for precision control and interrogation of its Rydberg states.</description>
