      <title>Predicting Liquidity-Aware Bond Yields using Causal GANs and Deep Reinforcement Learning with LLM Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Financial bond yield forecasting is challenging due to data scarcity, nonlinear macroeconomic dependencies, and evolving market conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages Causal Generative Adversarial Networks (CausalGANs) and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) reinforcement learning (RL) to generate high-fidelity synthetic bond yield data for four major bond categories (AAA, BAA, US10Y, Junk). By incorporating 12 key macroeconomic variables, we ensure statistical fidelity by preserving essential market properties. To transform this market dependent synthetic data into actionable insights, we employ a finetuned Large Language Model (LLM) Qwen2.5-7B that generates trading signals (BUY/HOLD/SELL), risk assessments, and volatility projections. We use automated, human and LLM evaluations, all of which demonstrate that our framework improves forecasting performance over existing methods, with statistical validation via predictive accuracy, MAE evaluation(0.103%), profit/loss evaluation (60% profit rate), LLM evaluation (3.37/5) and expert assessments scoring 4.67 out of 5. The reinforcement learning-enhanced synthetic data generation achieves the least Mean Absolute Error of 0.103, demonstrating its effectiveness in replicating real-world bond market dynamics. We not only enhance data-driven trading strategies but also provides a scalable, high-fidelity synthetic financial data pipeline for risk &amp; volatility management and investment decision-making. This work establishes a bridge between synthetic data generation, LLM driven financial forecasting, and language model evaluation, contributing to AI-driven financial decision-making.</description>

      <title>A unifying view on the irreversible investment exercise boundary in a stochastic, time-inhomogeneous capacity expansion problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.09878v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper devises a way to solve by the Bank and El Karoui Representation Theorem a quite complex stochastic, continuous time capacity expansion problem with irreversible investment on the finite time interval $[0, T]$ in the presence of a state dependent scrap value at the terminal time $T$. Standard variational methods are not feasible but the functional to be maximized admits a supergradient, hence the optimal control satisfies some first order conditions which are solved by means of the Representation Theorem. The devise introduced is new in singular stochastic control and of interest in its own right. As far as we know the Representation Theorem has never been applied to this extent. Contrary to the no scrap value case, a non integral term depending on the initial capacity $y$ arises in the supergradient making non trivial the application of the Representation Theorem and the existence of the so-called base capacity $l^{\star}_y(t)$, a positive level depending on $y$ which the optimal investment process is shown to become active at. In the special case of deterministic coefficients, the base capacity equals the boundary ${\hat y}(t)$ obtained by variational methods but only under a further assumption that allows to obtain monotonicity and positiveness of ${\hat y}(t)$ by means of probabilistic methods. Therefore getting a unifying view on the curve at which is optimal to invest is possible even in the presence of scrap value but it requires adding some extra conditions. The advantage is that the integral equation of the base capacity may then be used to characterize ${\hat y}(t)$.</description>
