      <title>New generation of cavity microscope for quantum simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the design and assembly of a cavity microscope for quantum simulations with ultracold atoms. The system integrates a high-finesse optical cavity with a pair of high-numerical aperture lenses sharing a common optical axis, enabling simultaneous operation with light close-to-atomic resonance. The system keeps the advantages of a rigid, single-block structure holding the lenses and cavity together, and improves over existing designs by using most of the solid angle left free by the cavity mode for imaging and atomic manipulation purposes. The cavity has a length of $19.786$mm, a finesse of $2.35\times 10^4$ and operates $214\mu\text{m}$ away from the concentric limit, deep in the strong coupling regime. The two lenses offer a numerical aperture of $0.52$ each and maximal optical access in all directions transverse to the cavity axis, compatible with applications in quantum-gas microscopes, micro-tweezer arrays or few-fermions systems, as well as future cavity-assisted quantum simulation protocols demanding sub-cavity-mode control of the atom-cavity coupling.</description>

      <title>The fate of the Fermi surface coupled to a single-wave-vector cavity mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electromagnetic field of standing-wave or ring cavities induces a spatially modulated, infinite-range interaction between atoms in an ultracold Fermi gas, with a single wavelength comparable to the Fermi length. This interaction has no analog in other systems of itinerant particles and has so far been studied only in the regime where it is attractive at zero distance. Here, we fully solve the problem of competing instabilities of the Fermi surface induced by single-wavelength interactions. We find that while the density-wave (superradiant) instability dominates on the attractive side, it is absent for repulsive interactions, where the competition is instead won by non-superradiant superfluid phases at low temperatures, with Fermion pairs forming at both vanishing and finite center-of-mass momentum. Moreover, even in the absence of such symmetry-breaking instabilities, we find the Fermi surface to be always nontrivially deformed from an isotropic shape. We estimate this full phenomenology to be within reach of dedicated state-of-the-art experimental setups.</description>

      <title>Walsh-Floquet Theory of Periodic Kick Drives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Periodic kick drives are ubiquitous in digital quantum control, computation, and simulation, and are instrumental in studies of chaos and thermalization for their efficient representation through discrete gates. However, in the commonly used Fourier basis, kick drives lead to poor convergence of physical quantities. Instead, here we use the Walsh basis of periodic square-wave functions to describe the physics of periodic kick drives. In the strongly kicked regime, we find that it recovers Floquet dynamics of single- and many-body systems more accurately than the Fourier basis, due to the shape of the system's response in time. To understand this behavior, we derive an extended Sambe space formulation and an inverse-frequency expansion in the Walsh basis. We explain the enhanced performance within the framework of single-particle localization on the frequency lattice, where localization is correlated with small truncation errors. We show that strong hybridization between states of the kicked system and Walsh modes gives rise to Walsh polaritons that can be studied on digital quantum simulators. Our work lays the foundations of Walsh-Floquet theory, which is naturally implementable on digital quantum devices and suited to Floquet state manipulation using discrete gates.</description>

      <title>Second roton feature in the strongly coupled electron liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present extensive \emph{ab initio} path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) results for the dynamic properties of the finite temperature uniform electron gas (UEG) over a broad range of densities, $2\leq r_s\leq300$. We demonstrate that the direct analysis of the imaginary-time density--density correlation function (ITCF) allows for a rigorous assessment of the density and temperature dependence of the previously reported roton-type feature [T.~Dornheim, \emph{Phys.~Rev.~Lett.}~\textbf{121}, 255001 (2018)] at intermediate wavenumbers. We clearly resolve the emergence of a second roton at the second harmonic of the original feature for $r_s\gtrsim100$, which we identify as an incipient phonon dispersion. Finally, we use our highly accurate PIMC results for the ITCF as the basis for an analytic continuation to compute the dynamic structure factor, which additionally substantiates the existence of the second roton in the strongly coupled electron liquid. Our investigation further elucidates the complex interplay between quantum delocalization and Coulomb coupling in the UEG. All PIMC results are freely available online and provide valuable benchmarks for other theoretical methodologies and approximations.</description>

      <title>Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometry with trapped polariton condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the indistinguishability of polaritons in optically trapped Bose Einstein condensates by implementing Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interferometry and test the limitations of two-polariton interference in the coherent, limit-cycle and thermal statistical regimes. We observe that the HOM dynamics of a circularly polarized condensate follows the condensate coherence time with the characteristic HOM-dip approaching the classical limit. Linearly polarized condensates exhibit a combined effect of polariton bunching and two-polariton interference. Under elliptically polarized excitation, the temporal evolution of the spinor condensate results in the revival of the HOM-dip at the spinor Larmor precession frequency.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive exploration of interaction networks reveals a connection between entanglement and network structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body systems are typically studied assuming translational symmetry in the interaction network. Recent experimental advances in various platforms for quantum simulators have enabled the realization of irregular interaction networks, which are intractable to implement with conventional crystal lattices. Another hallmark of these advances is the ability to observe the time-dependent behaviour of quantum many-body systems. However, the relationship between irregular interaction networks and quantum many-body dynamics remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate the connection between the structure of the interaction network and the eigenstate entanglement of the quantum Ising model by exploring all possible interaction networks up to seven spins. We find that the eigenstate entanglement depends on the structure of the Hilbert space diagram, particularly the structure of the equienergy subgraph. We further reveal a correlation linking the structure of the Hilbert space diagram to the number of unconstrained spin pairs. Our results demonstrate that the minimum eigenstate entanglement of the quantum Ising model is governed by the specific structure of the interaction network. We anticipate that our findings provide a starting point for exploring quantum many-body systems with arbitrary interactions and finite system size. Moreover, our approach may be applicable to other quantum many-body systems, such as the Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>Provably Efficient Simulation of 1D Long-Range Interacting Systems at Any Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a method that ensures efficient computation of one-dimensional quantum systems with long-range interactions across all temperatures. Our algorithm operates within a quasi-polynomial runtime for inverse temperatures up to $\beta={\rm poly}(\ln(n))$. At the core of our approach is the Density Matrix Renormalization Group algorithm, which typically does not guarantee efficiency. We have created a new truncation scheme for the matrix product operator of the quantum Gibbs states, which allows us to control the error analytically. Additionally, our method can be applied to simulate the time evolution of systems with long-range interactions, achieving significantly better precision than that offered by the Lieb-Robinson bound.</description>

      <title>A universal scaling of condensation temperature in quantum fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The phenomena of superconductivity and superfluidity are believed to originate from the same underlying physics, namely the condensation of either bosons or pairs of fermions (Cooper pairs). In this work I complied and analyzed literature data for a number of quantum fluids and showed that indeed they all follow the same simple scaling law. The critical temperature for condensation T$_c$ is found to scale with the condensate coherence length $\xi$ and the effective mass of condensing particles m$^{\ast}$. The scaling plot includes members of most known classes of superconductors, as well as a number of superfluids and condensates, such as $^3$He, $^4$He, dilute Bose and Fermi gases, excitons, polaritons, neutron superfluid and proton superconductor in neutron stars, nuclear pairing, quark--antiquark condensate and Higgs condensate. The scaling plot spans more that 24 orders of magnitude of critical temperatures, albeit the scaling exponent is not the one predicted by theory. The plot might help the search for a QCD axion.</description>

      <title>General Hamiltonian description of nonreciprocal interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05246v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a vast class of systems, which includes members as diverse as active colloids and bird flocks, interactions do not stem from a potential, and are in general nonreciprocal. Thus, it is not possible to define a conventional energy function, nor to use analytical or numerical tools that rely on it. Here, we overcome these limitations by constructing a Hamiltonian that includes auxiliary degrees of freedom; when subject to a constraint, this Hamiltonian yields the original non-reciprocal dynamics. We show that Glauber dynamics based on the constrained Hamiltonian reproduces the steady states of the original Langevin dynamics, as we explicitly illustrate for dissipative XY spins with vision-cone interactions. Further, the symplectic structure inherent to our construction allows us to apply the well-developed notions of Hamiltonian engineering, which we demonstrate by varying the amplitude of a periodic drive to tune the spin interactions between those of a square and a chain lattice geometry. Overall, our framework for generic nonreciprocal pairwise interactions paves the way for bringing to bear the full conceptual and methodological power of conventional statistical mechanics and Hamiltonian dynamics to nonreciprocal systems.</description>

      <title>Unconventional superconductivity of an altermagnetic metal: Polarized BCS and inhomogeneous Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the superconductivity of two-dimensional spin-1/2 Fermi systems with $d$-wave altermagnetism under external magnetic field near zero temperature. At large altermagnetic coupling without magnetic field, we show that altermagnetism drives a second-order phase transition from the standard Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) state to an inhomogeneous Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state. The inclusion of magnetic field turns the BCS state into a long-sought polarized BCS superconductor with spin-population imbalance. It also shrinks the parameter window of the FFLO state and eventually leads to a nontrivial quantum tri-critical Lifshitz point, where two second-order phase transition lines between the polarized BCS, FFLO and normal states intersect. At small altermagnetic coupling, we find the usual route to the FFLO state driven by magnetic field. The presence of the altermagnetic coupling narrows the phase window of the FFLO state and creates another quantum Lifshitz point, where a first-order transition curve meets a second-order transition line. Between the two Lifshitz points, the transition from the polarized BCS state to the normal state is smooth. Our predicted rich phase diagram is relevant to some recently discovered unconventional magnets, including RuO$_{2}$ that exhibits a relatively high superconducting temperature in the thin film limit under applied strain. Our results of unconventional superfluidity are also testable in ultracold atom laboratories, where a spin-1/2 altermagnetic Fermi gas might be realizable upon loading into two-dimensional Hubbard lattices.</description>

      <title>Quantum Lifshitz points in an altermagnetic metal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We predict the existence of two tri-critical quantum Lifshitz points in recently discovered $d$-wave altermagnetic metals subjected to an external magnetic field. These points connect a spatially modulated Fulde--Ferrell--Larkin--Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phase, a uniform polarized Bardeen--Cooper--Schrieffer (BCS) superconducting phase, and the normal metallic phase in a nontrivial manner. Depending on whether the FFLO state is primarily induced by the magnetic field or by $d$-wave altermagnetism, we classify the corresponding Lifshitz points as field-driven or altermagnetism-driven, respectively. Notably, the two types exhibit distinct behaviors: the transition from the FFLO phase to the polarized BCS phase is first-order near the field-driven Lifshitz point, as might be expected, whereas it becomes continuous near the altermagnetism-driven Lifshitz point. We further explore the effects of finite temperature and find that the altermagnetism-driven Lifshitz point is significantly more sensitive to thermal fluctuations.</description>
