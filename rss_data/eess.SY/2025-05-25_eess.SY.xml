      <title>IAE Optimized PID Tuning via Second Order Step Response Target Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents SOSTIAE (Second-Order System Target IAE), a novel PID tuning method that combines IAE minimization with explicit transient response shaping for practical control applications. The algorithm generates optimal PID parameters by matching the closed-loop response to a target second-order system with user-defined settling time (T_s) and percent overshoot (PO), while maintaining the conventional IAE performance metric. Comparative evaluations on first to third-order systems demonstrate that SOSTIAE consistently outperforms MATLAB's proprietary pidtune() function, achieving 47-67% lower overshoot and up to 26% better IAE performance for higher-order plants. The constrained optimization framework ensures physically realizable controllers by enforcing non-negative PID gains and stability criteria, addressing known limitations of unconstrained IAE methods. Results indicate that SOSTIAE provides engineers with a systematic alternative for PID tuning when transient specifications and practical implementation constraints are critical.</description>

      <title>Navigating Polytopes with Safety: A Control Barrier Function Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collision-free motion is a fundamental requirement for many autonomous systems. This paper develops a safety-critical control approach for the collision-free navigation of polytope-shaped agents in polytope-shaped environments. A systematic method is proposed to generate control barrier function candidates in closed form that lead to controllers with formal safety guarantees. The proposed approach is demonstrated through simulation, with obstacle avoidance examples in 2D and 3D, including dynamically changing environments.</description>

      <title>Control of Renewable Energy Communities using AI and Real-World Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electrification of transportation and the increased adoption of decentralized renewable energy generation have added complexity to managing Renewable Energy Communities (RECs). Integrating Electric Vehicle (EV) charging with building energy systems like heating, ventilation, air conditioning (HVAC), photovoltaic (PV) generation, and battery storage presents significant opportunities but also practical challenges. Reinforcement learning (RL), particularly MultiAgent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) algorithms, have shown promising results in simulation, outperforming heuristic control strategies. However, translating these successes into real-world deployments faces substantial challenges, including incomplete and noisy data, integration of heterogeneous subsystems, synchronization issues, unpredictable occupant behavior, and missing critical EV state-of-charge (SoC) information. This paper introduces a framework designed explicitly to handle these complexities and bridge the simulation to-reality gap. The framework incorporates EnergAIze, a MADDPG-based multi-agent control strategy, and specifically addresses challenges related to real-world data collection, system integration, and user behavior modeling. Preliminary results collected from a real-world operational REC with four residential buildings demonstrate the practical feasibility of our approach, achieving an average 9% reduction in daily peak demand and a 5% decrease in energy costs through optimized load scheduling and EV charging behaviors. These outcomes underscore the framework's effectiveness, advancing the practical deployment of intelligent energy management solutions in RECs.</description>

      <title>State of health prediction of lithium-ion batteries for driving conditions based on full parameter domain sparrow search algorithm and dual-module bidirectional gated recurrent unit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aiming at the state of health (SOH) prediction of lithium-ion batteries (LiBs) for electric vehicles (EVs), this paper proposes a fusion model of a dual-module bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU) and sparrow search algorithm (SSA) with full parameter domain optimization. With the help of Spearman correlation analysis and ablation experiments, the indirect health indicator (HI) that can characterize the battery degradation is extracted first based on the incremental capacity (IC) curves of the Oxford battery dataset, which simulates the driving conditions. On this basis, the filtered one-dimensional HI is inputted into the dual-module BiGRU for learning the pre- and post-textual information of the input sequence and extracting the sequence features. In order to combine the different hyperparameters in the dual-module BiGRU, SSA is used to optimize the hyperparameters in the full parameter domain. The proposed SSA-BiGRU model combines the advantages and structures of SSA and BiGRU to achieve the highly accurate SOH prediction of LiBs. Studies based on the Oxford battery dataset have shown that the SSA-BiGRU model has higher accuracy, better robustness and generalization ability. Moreover, the proposed SSA-BiGRU model is tested on a real road-driven EV charging dataset and accurate SOH prediction are obtained.</description>

      <title>A Dynamic Phasor Framework for Analysis of Grid-Forming Converter Connected to Series-Compensated Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A dynamic phasor (DP) framework for time-domain and frequency-domain analyses of grid-forming converters (GFCs) connected to series-compensated transmission lines is proposed. The proposed framework can capture the behavior of GFCs subjected to unbalanced short circuit faults in presence of different current limiting strategies. Moreover, the linearizability and time invariance of this framework allows us to perform eigen decomposition, which is a powerful tool for root-cause analysis and control design. We show that a certain degree of series compensation may result in poorly-damped oscillations in presence of the grid-forming converter. A participation factor analysis using the DP model reveals that the point of interconnection voltage angle is dominant in this mode. Eigenvalue sensitivity analysis of controller parameters shows that reducing the power-frequency droop coefficient is most effective in stabilizing the poorly-damped mode. Detailed validation with electromagnetic transient model demonstrates the accuracy of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Circular Drift Control for 4WD-4WS Vehicles Without Precomputed Drifting Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under extreme conditions, autonomous drifting enables vehicles to follow predefined paths at large slip angles, significantly enhancing the control system's capability to handle hazardous scenarios. Four-wheel-drive and four-wheel-steering (4WD-4WS) vehicles, which have been extensively studied, offer superior path-following precision and enhanced maneuverability under challenging driving conditions. In this paper, a hierarchical drifting controller is proposed for 4WD-4WS vehicles to track both path and velocity without relying on precomputed drifting equilibrium. The controller is structured into two layers: a trajectory tracking layer and an actuator regulation layer. The first layer generates the desired tire forces in the vehicle body frame, while the second layer converts these desired tire forces into steering angle commands and torque commands for the front and rear motors. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed controller are validated through simulation.</description>

      <title>Risk-based approach to the Optimal Transmission Switching problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the secure Optimal Transmission Switching (OTS) problem in situations where the TSO is forced to accept the risk that some contingencies may result in the de-energization of parts of the grid to avoid the violation of operational limits. This operational policy, which mainly applies to subtransmission systems, is first discussed. Then, a model of that policy is proposed that complements the classical MILP model of the N-1 secure OTS problem. It comprises a connectivity and notably a partial grid loss analysis for branch outage contingencies. Finally, its application to the IEEE 14-bus system is presented. Solutions similar to those observed in operation are reached by the algorithm, notably revealing the preventive-openings-cascade phenomenon.</description>

      <title>HRSim: An agent-based simulation platform for high-capacity ride-sharing services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of ride-sharing services presents a promising solution to urban transportation challenges, such as congestion and carbon emissions. However, developing efficient operational strategies, such as pricing, matching, and fleet management, requires robust simulation tools that can replicate real-world dynamics at scale. Existing platforms often lack the capacity, flexibility, or open-source accessibility needed to support large-scale, high-capacity ride-sharing services. To address these gaps, we introduce HRSim, an open-source, agent-based High-capacity Ride-sharing Simulator. HRSim integrates real-world road networks and demand data to simulate dynamic ride-sharing operations, including pricing, routing, matching, and repositioning. Its module design supports both ride-sharing and solo-hailing service modes. Also, it includes a visualization module for real-time performance analysis. In addition, HRSim incorporates integer linear programming and heuristic algorithms, which can achieve large-scale simulations of high-capacity ride-sharing services. Applications demonstrate HRSim's utility in various perspectives, including quantifying carbon emissions, scaling ride-sharing performance, evaluating new strategies, etc. By bridging the gap between theoretical research and practical implementation, HRSim serves as a versatile testbed for policymakers and transportation network companies to optimize ride-sharing systems for efficiency and sustainability.</description>

      <title>Periodic Regulation of Linear Time-Delay Systems via Youla-Ku\v{c}era Parametrization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper proposes an alternative way to achieve the Internal Model Principle (IMP) in contrast to the standard way, where a model of the signal one wishes to track/reject is directly substituted into the closed-loop. The proposed alternative approach relies on an already-existing stabilizing controller, which can be further augmented with a Youla-Ku\v{c}era parameter to let it implicitly admit a model of a signal without altering its stabilizing feature. Thus, with the proposed method, the standard design steps of realizing IMP are reversed. The validity and potential of the proposed approach are demonstrated by considering three different types of time-delay systems. It is shown through simulations that all considered unstable systems, despite the infinite-dimensional closed-loop, can be straightforwardly periodically regulated by augmenting their stabilizing PI controllers. Thanks to a specifically chosen structure for the Youla-Ku\v{c}era parameter, the required tuning can be done by solving a set of linear equations.</description>

      <title>Sufficient Conditions for Detectability of Approximately Discretized Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many sampled-data applications, observers are designed based on approximately discretized models of continuous-time systems, where usually only the discretized system is analyzed in terms of its detectability. In this paper, we show that if the continuous-time system satisfies certain linear matrix inequality (LMI) conditions, and the sampling period of the discretization scheme is sufficiently small, then the whole family of discretized systems (parameterized by the sampling period) satisfies analogous discrete-time LMI conditions that imply detectability. Our results are applicable to general discretization schemes, as long as they produce approximate models whose linearizations are in some sense consistent with the linearizations of the continuous-time ones. We explicitly show that the Euler and second-order Runge-Kutta methods satisfy this condition. A batch-reactor system example is provided to highlight the usefulness of our results from a practical perspective.</description>

      <title>Selection Mechanisms for Sequence Modeling using Linear State Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in language modeling tasks have been driven by architectures such as Transformers and, more recently, by Selective State Space Models (SSMs). In this paper, we introduce an alternative selection mechanism inspired by control theory methodologies. Specifically, we propose a novel residual generator for selection, drawing an analogy to fault detection strategies in Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems. Unlike Mamba, which utilizes Linear Time-Varying (LTV) systems, our approach combines multiple LTI systems, preserving their beneficial properties during training while achieving comparable selectivity. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture, we test its performance on synthetic tasks. While these tasks are not inherently critical, they serve as benchmarks to test the selectivity properties of different cores architecture. This work highlights the potential of integrating theoretical insights with experimental advancements, offering a complementary perspective to deep learning innovations at the intersection of control theory and machine learning.</description>

      <title>Preliminary Characterization of Bio-inspired Dog-Nose Sampler for Aerosol Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Before aerosols can be sensed, sampling technologies must capture the particulate matter of interest. To that end, for systems deployed in open environments where the location of the aerosol is unknown, extending the reach of the sampler could lessen the precision required in sensor placement or reduce the number of sensors required for full spatial coverage. Inspired by the sensitivity of the canine olfactory system, this paper presents a rudimentary sampler that mimics the air flow of a dog's nose. The design consists of speed-controlled inhalation jets, as well as exhalation jets that are angled down and to the side. We tested this design on volatile organic compounds (VOC) in a small number of scenarios to validate the concept and understand how the system behaves. We show that in preliminary testing this dog-nose setup provides improvements over passive and solely inhalation sensing.</description>

      <title>Transient Slack Capability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of Transient Slack Capability (TSC), a set of three necessary device-level conditions to ensure stability under sustained power perturbations. TSC states that a device must (1) possess sufficient stored energy; (2) a controlled input power; and (3) maintain internal energy balance and synchronization. The paper shows that the relation among the time-scales of storage, control, and power perturbation is at the core of the TSC concept. Using the port-Hamiltonian (PH) framework, these conditions are formalized and validated via simulations on an adapted model of the WSCC 9-bus system. Case studies demonstrate that TSC is achievable in both Grid-Following (GFL) and Grid-Forming (GFM) converter control schemes, provided the conditions above are satisfied. Sensitivity analysis serves to identify storage and power reserve requirements to meet Conditions 1 and 2; the impact of converter current limiters on Condition 3; and inertia-less solutions able to achieve TSC.</description>

      <title>ConvoyNext: A Scalable Testbed Platform for Cooperative Autonomous Vehicle Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advancement of cooperative autonomous vehicle systems depends heavily on effective coordination between multiple agents, aiming to enhance traffic efficiency, fuel economy, and road safety. Despite these potential benefits, real-world testing of such systems remains a major challenge and is essential for validating control strategies, trajectory modeling methods, and communication robustness across diverse environments. To address this need, we introduce ConvoyNext, a scalable, modular, and extensible platform tailored for the real-world evaluation of cooperative driving behaviors. We demonstrate the capabilities of ConvoyNext through a series of experiments involving convoys of autonomous vehicles navigating complex trajectories. These tests highlight the platform's robustness across heterogeneous vehicle configurations and its effectiveness in assessing convoy behavior under varying communication conditions, including intentional packet loss. Our results validate ConvoyNext as a comprehensive, open-access testbed for advancing research in cooperative autonomous vehicle systems.</description>

      <title>Construction of an Impedance Control Test Bench</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling the physical interaction with the environment or objects, as humans do, is a shared requirement across different types of robots. To effectively control this interaction, it is necessary to control the power delivered to the load, that is, the interaction force and the interaction velocity. However, it is not possible to control these two quantities independently at the same time. An alternative is to control the relation between them, with Impedance and Admittance control, for example. The Impedance Control 2 Dimensions (IC2D) bench is a test bench designed to allow the performance analysis of different actuators and controllers at the joint level. Therefore, it was designed to be as versatile as possible, to allow the combination of linear and/or rotational motions, to use electric and/or hydraulic actuators, with loads known and defined by the user. The bench adheres to a set of requirements defined by the demands of the research group, to be a reliable, backlash-free mechatronic system to validate system dynamics models and controller designs, as well as a valuable experimental setup for benchmarking electric and hydraulic actuators. This article presents the mechanical, electrical, and hydraulic configurations used to ensure the robustness and reliability of the test bench. Benches similar to this one are commonly found in robotics laboratories around the world. However, the IC2D stands out for its versatility and reliability, as well as for supporting hydraulic and electric actuators.</description>

      <title>UAV Control with Vision-based Hand Gesture Recognition over Edge-Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gesture recognition presents a promising avenue for interfacing with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) due to its intuitive nature and potential for precise interaction. This research conducts a comprehensive comparative analysis of vision-based hand gesture detection methodologies tailored for UAV Control. The existing gesture recognition approaches involving cropping, zooming, and color-based segmentation, do not work well for this kind of applications in dynamic conditions and suffer in performance with increasing distance and environmental noises. We propose to use a novel approach leveraging hand landmarks drawing and classification for gesture recognition based UAV control. With experimental results we show that our proposed method outperforms the other existing methods in terms of accuracy, noise resilience, and efficacy across varying distances, thus providing robust control decisions. However, implementing the deep learning based compute intensive gesture recognition algorithms on the UAV's onboard computer is significantly challenging in terms of performance. Hence, we propose to use a edge-computing based framework to offload the heavier computing tasks, thus achieving closed-loop real-time performance. With implementation over AirSim simulator as well as over a real-world UAV, we showcase the advantage of our end-to-end gesture recognition based UAV control system.</description>

      <title>ExARNN: An Environment-Driven Adaptive RNN for Learning Non-Stationary Power Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-stationary power system dynamics, influenced by renewable energy variability, evolving demand patterns, and climate change, are becoming increasingly complex. Accurately capturing these dynamics requires a model capable of adapting to environmental factors. Traditional models, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), lack efficient mechanisms to encode external factors, such as time or environmental data, for dynamic adaptation. To address this, we propose the External Adaptive RNN (ExARNN), a novel framework that integrates external data (e.g., weather, time) to continuously adjust the parameters of a base RNN. ExARNN achieves this through a hierarchical hypernetwork design, using Neural Controlled Differential Equations (NCDE) to process external data and generate RNN parameters adaptively. This approach enables ExARNN to handle inconsistent timestamps between power and external measurements, ensuring continuous adaptation. Extensive forecasting tests demonstrate ExARNN's superiority over established baseline models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research proposes methods for formulating and guaranteeing the resilience of long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, which can serve as a key technology in AI system quality assurance. We introduce a novel methodology applying incremental input-to-state stability ($\delta$ISS) to mathematically define and evaluate the resilience of LSTM against input perturbations. Key achievements include the development of a data-independent evaluation method and the demonstration of resilience control through adjustments to training parameters. This research presents concrete solutions to AI quality assurance from a control theory perspective, which can advance AI applications in control systems.</description>

      <title>TransDF: Time-Series Forecasting Needs Transformed Label Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training time-series forecasting models presents unique challenges in designing effective learning objectives. Existing methods predominantly utilize the temporal mean squared error, which faces two critical challenges: (1) label autocorrelation, which leads to bias from the label sequence likelihood; (2) excessive amount of tasks, which increases with the forecast horizon and complicates optimization. To address these challenges, we propose Transform-enhanced Direct Forecast (TransDF), which transforms the label sequence into decorrelated components with discriminated significance. Models are trained to align the most significant components, thereby effectively mitigating label autocorrelation and reducing task amount. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TransDF achieves state-of-the-art performance and is compatible with various forecasting models. Code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/TransDF-88CF.</description>

      <title>Automata Learning of Preferences over Temporal Logic Formulas from Pairwise Comparisons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many preference elicitation algorithms consider preference over propositional logic formulas or items with different attributes. In sequential decision making, a user's preference can be a preorder over possible outcomes, each of which is a temporal sequence of events. This paper considers a class of preference inference problems where the user's unknown preference is represented by a preorder over regular languages (sets of temporal sequences), referred to as temporal goals. Given a finite set of pairwise comparisons between finite words, the objective is to learn both the set of temporal goals and the preorder over these goals. We first show that a preference relation over temporal goals can be modeled by a Preference Deterministic Finite Automaton (PDFA), which is a deterministic finite automaton augmented with a preorder over acceptance conditions. The problem of preference inference reduces to learning the PDFA. This problem is shown to be computationally challenging, with the problem of determining whether there exists a PDFA of size smaller than a given integer $k$, consistent with the sample, being NP-Complete. We formalize the properties of characteristic samples and develop an algorithm that guarantees to learn, given a characteristic sample, the minimal PDFA equivalent to the true PDFA from which the sample is drawn. We present the method through a running example and provide detailed analysis using a robotic motion planning problem.</description>

      <title>Analysis on Energy Efficiency of RIS-Assisted Multiuser Downlink Near-Field Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the energy efficiency (EE) optimization and analysis of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted multiuser downlink near-field communications. Specifically, we conduct a comprehensive study on several key factors affecting EE performance, including the number of RIS elements, the types of reconfigurable elements, reconfiguration resolutions, and the maximum transmit power. To accurately capture the power characteristics of RISs, we adopt more practical power consumption models for three commonly used reconfigurable elements in RISs: PIN diodes, varactor diodes, and radio frequency (RF) switches. These different elements may result in RIS systems exhibiting significantly different energy efficiencies (EEs), even when their spectral efficiencies (SEs) are similar. Considering discrete phases implemented at most RISs in practice, which makes their optimization NP-hard, we develop a nested alternating optimization framework to maximize EE, consisting of an outer integer-based optimization for discrete RIS phase reconfigurations and a nested non-convex optimization for continuous transmit power allocation within each iteration. Extensive comparisons with multiple benchmark schemes validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework. Furthermore, based on the proposed optimization method, we analyze the EE performance of RISs across different key factors and identify the optimal RIS architecture yielding the highest EE.</description>

Abstract: Splitting algorithms are well-established in convex optimization and are designed to solve large-scale problems. Using such algorithms to simulate the behavior of nonlinear circuit networks provides scalable methods for the simulation and design of neuromorphic systems. For circuits made of linear capacitors and inductors with nonlinear resistive elements, we propose a splitting that breaks the network into its LTI lossless component and its static resistive component. This splitting has both physical and algorithmic advantages and allows for separate calculations in the time domain and in the frequency domain. To demonstrate the scalability of this approach, a network made from one hundred neurons modeled by the well-known FitzHugh-Nagumo circuit with all-to-all diffusive coupling is simulated.</description>

      <title>Conformal Robust Control of Linear Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16250v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: End-to-end engineering design pipelines, in which designs are evaluated using concurrently defined optimal controllers, are becoming increasingly common in practice. To discover designs that perform well even under the misspecification of system dynamics, such end-to-end pipelines have now begun evaluating designs with a robust control objective in place of the nominal optimal control setup. Current approaches of specifying such robust control subproblems, however, rely on hand specification of perturbations anticipated to be present upon deployment or margin methods that ignore problem structure, resulting in a lack of theoretical guarantees and overly conservative empirical performance. We, instead, propose a novel methodology for LQR systems that leverages conformal prediction to specify such uncertainty regions in a data-driven fashion. Such regions have distribution-free coverage guarantees on the true system dynamics, in turn allowing for a probabilistic characterization of the regret of the resulting robust controller. We then demonstrate that such a controller can be efficiently produced via a novel policy gradient method that has convergence guarantees. We finally demonstrate the superior empirical performance of our method over alternate robust control specifications, such as $H_{\infty}$ and LQR with multiplicative noise, across a collection of engineering control systems.</description>

      <title>A complex spatial frequency approach to optimal control of finite-extent linear evolution systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) for one-dimensional linear evolution partial differential equations (PDEs) on a finite interval in space. The control is applied as an additive forcing term to PDEs. Existing methods for closed-form optimal control only apply to homogeneous (zero) boundary conditions, often resulting in series representations. In this paper, we consider general smooth boundary conditions. We use the unified transform, namely the Fourier transform restricted to the bounded spatial domain, to decouple PDEs into a family of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) parameterized by complex spatial frequency variables. Then, optimal control in the frequency domain is derived using LQR theory for ODEs. The inverse Fourier transform leads to non-causal terms in optimal control corresponding to integrals, over the real line, of future values of unspecified boundary conditions. To eliminate this non-causality, we deform the integrals to well-constructed contours in the complex plane along which the contribution of unknowns vanishes. For the reaction-diffusion equation, we show that the integral representation can be reformulated as a series representation, which leads to a state-feedback convolution form for optimal control, with the boundary conditions appearing as an additive term. In numerical experiments, we illustrate the computational advantages of the integral representation in comparison to the series representation and structural properties of the convolution kernel.</description>

      <title>SINDyG: Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems from Graph-Structured Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04463v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The combination of machine learning (ML) and sparsity-promoting techniques is enabling direct extraction of governing equations from data, revolutionizing computational modeling in diverse fields of science and engineering. The discovered dynamical models could be used to address challenges in climate science, neuroscience, ecology, finance, epidemiology, and beyond. However, most existing sparse identification methods for discovering dynamical systems treat the whole system as one without considering the interactions between subsystems. As a result, such models are not able to capture small changes in the emergent system behavior. To address this issue, we developed a new method called Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems from Graph-structured data (SINDyG), which incorporates the network structure into sparse regression to identify model parameters that explain the underlying network dynamics. We showcase the application of our proposed method using several case studies of neuronal dynamics, where we model the macroscopic oscillation of a population of neurons using the extended Stuart-Landau (SL) equation and utilize the SINDyG method to identify the underlying nonlinear dynamics. Our extensive computational experiments validate the improved accuracy and simplicity of discovered network dynamics when compared to the original SINDy approach.</description>

      <title>Safe PDE Boundary Control with Neural Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The physical world dynamics are generally governed by underlying partial differential equations (PDEs) with unknown analytical forms in science and engineering problems. Neural network based data-driven approaches have been heavily studied in simulating and solving PDE problems in recent years, but it is still challenging to move forward from understanding to controlling the unknown PDE dynamics. PDE boundary control instantiates a simplified but important problem by only focusing on PDE boundary conditions as the control input and output. However, current model-free PDE controllers cannot ensure the boundary output satisfies some given user-specified safety constraint. To this end, we propose a safety filtering framework to guarantee the boundary output stays within the safe set for current model-free controllers. Specifically, we first introduce a neural boundary control barrier function (BCBF) to ensure the feasibility of the trajectory-wise constraint satisfaction of boundary output. Based on the neural operator modeling the transfer function from boundary control input to output trajectories, we show that the change in the BCBF depends linearly on the change in input boundary, so quadratic programming-based safety filtering can be done for pre-trained model-free controllers. Extensive experiments under challenging hyperbolic, parabolic and Navier-Stokes PDE dynamics environments validate the plug-and-play effectiveness of the proposed method by achieving better general performance and boundary constraint satisfaction compared to the vanilla and constrained model-free controller baselines. The code is available at https://github.com/intelligent-control-lab/safe-pde-control.</description>

      <title>Toward Near-Globally Optimal Nonlinear Model Predictive Control via Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving global optimality in nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) is challenging due to the non-convex nature of the underlying optimization problem. Since commonly employed local optimization techniques depend on carefully chosen initial guesses, this non-convexity often leads to suboptimal performance resulting from local optima. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel diffusion model-based approach for near-globally optimal NMPC consisting of an offline and an online phase. The offline phase employs a local optimizer to sample from the distribution of optimal NMPC control sequences along generated system trajectories through random initial guesses. Subsequently, the generated diverse dataset is used to train a diffusion model to reflect the multi-modal distribution of optima. In the online phase, the trained model is leveraged to efficiently perform a variant of random shooting optimization to obtain near-globally optimal control sequences without relying on any initial guesses or online NMPC solving. The effectiveness of our approach is illustrated in a numerical simulation indicating high performance benefits compared to direct neural network approximations of NMPC and significantly lower computation times than online solving NMPC using global optimizers.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed machine learning for building performance simulation-A review of a nascent field</title>

Abstract: Building performance simulation (BPS) is critical for understanding building dynamics and behavior, analyzing performance of the built environment, optimizing energy efficiency, improving demand flexibility, and enhancing building resilience. However, conducting BPS is not trivial. Traditional BPS relies on an accurate building energy model, mostly physics-based, which depends heavily on detailed building information, expert knowledge, and case-by-case model calibrations, thereby significantly limiting their scalability. With the development of sensing technology and increased data availability, there is a growing attention and interest in data-driven BPS. However, purely data-driven models often suffer from limited generalization ability and a lack of physical consistency, resulting in poor performance in real-world applications. To address these limitations, recent studies have started to incorporate physics priors into data-driven models, a methodology called physics-informed machine learning (PIML). PIML is an emerging field with the definitions, methodologies, evaluation criteria, application scenarios, and future directions that remain open. To bridge those gaps, this study systematically reviews the state-of-art PIML for BPS, offering a comprehensive definition of PIML, and comparing it to traditional BPS approaches regarding data requirements, modeling effort, performance and computation cost. We also summarize the commonly used methodologies, validation approaches, application domains, available data sources, open-source packages and testbeds. In addition, this study provides a general guideline for selecting appropriate PIML models based on BPS applications. Finally, this study identifies key challenges and outlines future research directions, providing a solid foundation and valuable insights to advance R&amp;D of PIML in BPS.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of undiscouted infinite-horizon optimal control for deterministic systems where the classic value iteration does not converge. For such systems, we propose to use the Ces\`aro mean to define the infinite-horizon optimal control problem and the corresponding infinite-horizon value function. Moreover, for this value function, we introduce the Ces\`aro value iteration and prove its convergence for the special case of systems with periodic optimal operating behavior.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Processes in Power Systems: Techniques, Applications, and Future Works</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing integration of renewable energy sources (RESs) and distributed energy resources (DERs) has significantly heightened operational complexity and uncertainty in modern power systems. Concurrently, the widespread deployment of smart meters, phasor measurement units (PMUs) and other sensors has generated vast spatiotemporal data streams, enabling advanced data-driven analytics and decision-making in grid operations. In this context, Gaussian processes (GPs) have emerged as a powerful probabilistic framework, offering uncertainty quantification, non-parametric modeling, and predictive capabilities to enhance power system analysis and control. This paper presents a comprehensive review of GP techniques and their applications in power system operation and control. GP applications are reviewed across three key domains: GP-based modeling, risk assessment, and optimization and control. These areas serve as representative examples of how GP can be utilized in power systems. Furthermore, critical challenges in GP applications are discussed, and potential research directions are outlined to facilitate future power system operations.</description>

      <title>The Barzilai-Borwein Method for Distributed Optimization over Unbalanced Directed Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11469v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies optimization problems over multi-agent systems, in which all agents cooperatively minimize a global objective function expressed as a sum of local cost functions. Each agent in the systems uses only local computation and communication in the overall process without leaking their private information. Based on the Barzilai-Borwein (BB) method and multi-consensus inner loops, a distributed algorithm with the availability of larger stepsizes and accelerated convergence, namely ADBB, is proposed. Moreover, owing to employing only row-stochastic weight matrices, ADBB can resolve the optimization problems over unbalanced directed networks without requiring the knowledge of neighbors' out-degree for each agent. Via establishing contraction relationships between the consensus error, the optimality gap, and the gradient tracking error, ADBB is theoretically proved to converge linearly to the globally optimal solution. A real-world data set is used in simulations to validate the correctness of the theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Model Predictive Inferential Control of Neural State-Space Models for Autonomous Vehicle Motion Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08045v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) has proven useful in enabling safe and optimal motion planning for autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we investigate how to achieve MPC-based motion planning when a neural state-space model represents the vehicle dynamics. As the neural state-space model will lead to highly complex, nonlinear and nonconvex optimization landscapes, mainstream gradient-based MPC methods will be computationally too heavy to be a viable solution. In a departure, we propose the idea of model predictive inferential control (MPIC), which seeks to infer the best control decisions from the control objectives and constraints. Following the idea, we convert the MPC problem for motion planning into a Bayesian state estimation problem. Then, we develop a new particle filtering/smoothing approach to perform the estimation. This approach is implemented as banks of unscented Kalman filters/smoothers and offers high sampling efficiency, fast computation, and estimation accuracy. We evaluate the MPIC approach through a simulation study of autonomous driving in different scenarios, along with an exhaustive comparison with gradient-based MPC. The results show that the MPIC approach has considerable computational efficiency, regardless of complex neural network architectures, and shows the capability to solve large-scale MPC problems for neural state-space models.</description>

      <title>Koopman Operators in Robot Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Koopman operator theory offers a rigorous treatment of dynamics and has been emerging as an alternative modeling and learning-based control method across various robotics sub-domains. Due to its ability to represent nonlinear dynamics as a linear (but higher-dimensional) operator, Koopman theory offers a fresh lens through which to understand and tackle the modeling and control of complex robotic systems. Moreover, it enables incremental updates and is computationally inexpensive, thus making it particularly appealing for real-time applications and online active learning. This review delves deeply into the foundations of Koopman operator theory and systematically builds a bridge from theoretical principles to practical robotic applications. We begin by explaining the mathematical underpinnings of the Koopman framework and discussing approximation approaches for incorporating inputs into Koopman-based modeling. Foundational considerations, such as data collection strategies as well as the design of lifting functions for effective system embedding, are also discussed. We then explore how Koopman-based models serve as a unifying tool for a range of robotics tasks, including model-based control, real-time state estimation, and motion planning. The review proceeds to a survey of cutting-edge research that demonstrates the versatility and growing impact of Koopman methods across diverse robotics sub-domains: from aerial and legged platforms to manipulators, soft-bodied systems, and multi-agent networks. A presentation of more advanced theoretical topics, necessary to push forward the overall framework, is included. Finally, we reflect on some key open challenges that remain and articulate future research directions that will shape the next phase of Koopman-inspired robotics. To support practical adoption, we provide a hands-on tutorial with executable code at https://shorturl.at/ouE59.</description>

      <title>Robust Nash equilibrium seeking based on semi-Markov switching topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a distributed robust Nash Equilibrium (NE) seeking problem in fluctuating environments. Specifically, the players, subject to the second-order dynamics, are considered to be influenced by external disturbances and uncertain dynamics while communicating via semi-Markov switching topologies. In such constantly changing network circumstances, the existence of disturbances and uncertain dynamics may directly affect the performance of most existing NE seeking algorithms. Moreover, the semi-Markov switching topologies may cause communication uncertainty, which are considered in NE seeking for the first time. To accommodate the above concerns, the following targets require to be reached simultaneously: (1) Disturbances and uncertain dynamics rejection in finite time; (2) Distributed estimation on unknown information required for players' cost functions; (3) A reasonable estimation consensus protocol under semi-Markov switching; (4) NE seeking for the second-order players. By combining supertwisting-based Integral Sliding-Mode Control (ISMC) with average consensus tracking, a novel robust NE seeking algorithm is constructed, incorporating an effective leader-follower consensus protocol. Furthermore, to lessen dispensable information transmission, a sampled-data-based event-triggered mechanism is introduced. Incorporating the advantages of both semi-Markov switching and event-triggered mechanism, another NE seeking algorithm is proposed. Through designing an appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, it is shown that the leader-follower consensus can be achieved in the mean-square sense under event-triggered mechanism. Finally, a connectivity control game is formulated to illustrate the validity of the designed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Model Identification Adaptive Control with $\rho$-POMDP Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate system modeling is crucial for safe, effective control, as misidentification can lead to accumulated errors, especially under partial observability. We address this problem by formulating informative input design and model identification adaptive control (MIAC) as belief space planning problems, modeled as partially observable Markov decision processes with belief-dependent rewards ($\rho$-POMDPs). We treat system parameters as hidden state variables that must be localized while simultaneously controlling the system. We solve this problem with an adapted belief-space iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (BiLQR). We demonstrate it on fully and partially observable tasks for cart-pole and steady aircraft flight domains. Our method outperforms baselines such as regression, filtering, and local optimal control methods, even under instantaneous disturbances to system parameters.</description>
