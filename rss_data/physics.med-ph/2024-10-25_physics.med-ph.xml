      <title>First performance of hybrid spectra CT reconstruction: a general Spectrum-Model-Aided Reconstruction Technique (SMART)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid spectral CT integrates energy integrating detectors (EID) and photon counting detectors (PCD) into a single system, combining the large field-of-view advantage of EID with the high energy and spatial resolution of PCD. This represents a new research direction in spectral CT imaging. However, the different imaging principles and inconsistent geometric paths of the two detectors make it difficult to reconstruct images using data from hybrid detectors. In addition, the quality reconstructed images considering spectrum is affected by the accuracy of spectral estimation and the scattered photons. In this work, Firstly, we propose a general hybrid spectral reconstruction method that takes into account both the spectral CT imaging principles of the two different detectors and the influence of scattered photons in the forward process modelling. Furthermore, we also apply volume fraction constraints to the results reconstructed from the two detector data. By alternately solving the spectral estimation and the spectral image reconstruction by the ADMM method, the estimated spectra and the reconstructed images reinforce each other, thus improving the accuracy of the spectral estimation and the quality of the reconstructed images. The proposed method is the first to achieve hybrid spectral CT reconstruction for both detectors, allowing simultaneous recovery of spectrum and image reconstruction from hybrid spectral data containing scattering. In addition, the method is also applicable to spectral CT imaging using a single type of detector. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed method through numerical experiments and successfully performed the first hybrid spectral CT reconstruction experiment on our self-developed hybrid spectral CT system.</description>

      <title>A diffusion MRI model for random walks confined on cylindrical surfaces: Towards non-invasive quantification of myelin sheath radius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying the myelin sheath radius of myelinated axons in vivo is important for understanding, diagnosing, and monitoring various neurological disorders. Despite advancements in diffusion MRI (dMRI) microstructure techniques, models specifically designed to estimate myelin sheath radii remain unavailable. In this proof-of-concept theoretical study, we present two novel dMRI models that characterize the signal from water diffusion confined to cylindrical surfaces, approximating myelin water diffusion. We derive their spherical mean signals, which conveniently eliminate fiber orientation and dispersion effects. These models are further extended to account for multiple concentric cylinders, mimicking the layered structure of myelin. Additionally, we introduce a method to convert histological distributions of axonal inner radii from the literature into myelin sheath radius distributions and derive analytical expressions to estimate the effective myelin sheath radius expected from these distributions. Monte Carlo (MC) simulations conducted in cylindrical and spiral geometries validate the models, demonstrating agreement with analytical predictions across various diffusion regimes and significant correlations between the effective radii estimated from the histological distributions and the effective radius obtained by fitting the resulting dMRI signal to a single-cylinder model. These models may be integrated into existing multi-compartment dMRI techniques, opening the door to non-invasive, in vivo assessments of myelin sheath radii in MRI scanners equipped with strong diffusion gradients that enable measurements with short echo times. Further work is required to validate the technique with real dMRI data.</description>

      <title>Separating edges from microstructure in X-ray dark-field imaging: Evolving and devolving perspectives via the X-ray Fokker-Planck equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key contribution to X-ray dark-field (XDF) is X-ray diffusion by sample structures smaller than the imaging system's spatial resolution. However, some XDF techniques report that resolvable sample edges also generate XDF. Speckle-based X-ray imaging (SBXI) extracts XDF by analyzing sample-imposed changes to a reference speckle pattern's visibility. We present an algorithm for SBXI (a variant of our Multimodal Intrinsic Speckle-Tracking (MIST) algorithm) capable of separating these two distinct XDF contrast mechanisms. The algorithm uses the 'devolving' X-ray Imaging Fokker-Planck equation as its forward model and then solves the associated multimodal inverse problem, to retrieve sample attenuation, phase, and XDF. Previous MIST variants were based on the evolving Fokker-Planck equation, which considers how a reference-speckle image is modified by introducing a sample. The devolving perspective instead considers how the image collected in the presence of the sample and speckle membrane optically flows in reverse, to generate the reference-speckle image when the sample is removed from the system. We compare single- and multiple-exposure multimodal retrieval algorithms from the two Fokker-Planck perspectives. We demonstrate that the devolving perspective can distinguish between two physically different XDF contrast mechanisms; unresolved microstructure- and sharp-edge-induced XDF. This was verified by applying the retrieval algorithms to two experimental data sets. We anticipate that this work will be useful in: Yielding a pair of complementary XDF images that separate sharp-edge diffuse scatter from unresolved microstructure diffuse scatter. XDF computed tomography, where the strong edge XDF can lead to tainting streaking artefacts. Sample preparation, as samples will not need to be embedded since the strong XDF edge signal seen between the sample and air can be separated out.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Error correlations in Evidential Deep Learning models for biomedical segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we examine the effectiveness of an uncertainty quantification framework known as Evidential Deep Learning applied in the context of biomedical image segmentation. This class of models involves assigning Dirichlet distributions as priors for segmentation labels, and enables a few distinct definitions of model uncertainties. Using the cardiac and prostate MRI images available in the Medical Segmentation Decathlon for validation, we found that Evidential Deep Learning models with U-Net backbones generally yielded superior correlations between prediction errors and uncertainties relative to the conventional baseline equipped with Shannon entropy measure, Monte-Carlo Dropout and Deep Ensemble methods. We also examined these models' effectiveness in active learning, finding that relative to the standard Shannon entropy-based sampling, they yielded higher point-biserial uncertainty-error correlations while attaining similar performances in Dice-Sorensen coefficients. These superior features of EDL models render them well-suited for segmentation tasks that warrant a critical sensitivity in detecting large model errors.</description>

      <title>Considerations and recommendations from the ISMRM Diffusion Study Group for preclinical diffusion MRI: Part 2 -- Ex vivo imaging: added value and acquisition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.13371v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The value of preclinical diffusion MRI (dMRI) is substantial. While dMRI enables in vivo non-invasive characterization of tissue, ex vivo dMRI is increasingly used to probe tissue microstructure and brain connectivity. Ex vivo dMRI has several experimental advantages including higher signal-to-noise ratio and spatial resolution compared to in vivo studies, and enabling more advanced diffusion contrasts. Another major advantage of ex vivo dMRI is the direct comparison with histological data as a methodological validation. However, there are a number of considerations that must be made when performing ex vivo experiments. The steps from tissue preparation, image acquisition and processing, and interpretation of results are complex, with decisions that not only differ dramatically from in vivo imaging of small animals, but ultimately affect what questions can be answered using the data. This work represents "Part 2" of a 3-part series of recommendations and considerations for preclinical dMRI. We describe best practices for dMRI of ex vivo tissue, with a focus on the value that ex vivo imaging adds to the field of dMRI and considerations in ex vivo image acquisition. We give general considerations and foundational knowledge that must be considered when designing experiments. We describe differences in specimens and models and discuss why some may be more or less appropriate for different studies. We then give guidelines for ex vivo protocols, including tissue fixation, sample preparation, and MR scanning. In each section, we attempt to provide guidelines and recommendations, but also highlight areas for which no guidelines exist (and why), and where future work should lie. An overarching goal herein is to enhance the rigor and reproducibility of ex vivo dMRI acquisitions and analyses, and thereby advance biomedical knowledge.</description>

      <title>An Example of Microwave Diagnosis for Knee Osteophyte by 3D Parallel FD-FDTD Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A parallel 3-D Frequency Dependent Finite Difference Time Domain (FD-FDTD) method was implemented based on the Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD) technique to analyze the feasibility of microwave diagnosis for the human knees. The parallel algorithm efficiently accelerates the FDTD computation for a large 3-D numerical knee model derived from a real human. Examinations in the frequency domain and time domain were applied to investigate the penetration of the electromagnetic (EM) waves into the knee. Results show that the attenuation of the microwave signal allows for a several-Gigahertz-bandwidth signal to be used for ultra-wide band microwave diagnosis. Knee osteophyte detection was undertaken as an example of the knee disease diagnosis to verify this technique. A small abnormal growth in the knee joint was successfully detected by the microwave imaging approach.</description>
