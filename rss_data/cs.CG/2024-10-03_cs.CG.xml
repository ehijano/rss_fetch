      <title>Influence of control polygon on the generalization of the conversion between ANCF and B-spline surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this study is to establish a general transformation matrix between B-spline surfaces and ANCF surface elements. This study is a further study of the conversion between the ANCF and B-spline surfaces. In this paper, a general transformation matrix between the Bezier surfaces and ANCF surface element is established. This general transformation matrix essentially describes the linear relationship between ANCF and Bezier surfaces. Moreover, the general transformation matrix can help to improve the efficiency of the process to transfer the distorted configuration in the CAA back to the CAD, an urgent requirement in engineering practice. In addition, a special Bezier surface control polygon is given in this study. The Bezier surface described with this control polygon can be converted to an ANCF surface element with fewer d.o.f.. And the converted ANCF surface element with 36 d.o.f. was once addressed by Dufva and Shabana. So the special control polygon can be regarded as the geometric condition in conversion to an ANCF surface element with 36 d.o.f. Based on the fact that a B-spline surface can be seen as a set of Bezier surfaces connected together, the method to establish a general transformation matrix between the ANCF and lower-order B-spline surfaces is given. Specially, the general transformation is not in a recursive form, but in a simplified form.</description>

      <title>General Conversion between ANCF and B-spline Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, general conversion equations are derived between Absolute Nodal Coordinates Formulation (ANCF) finite surface elements and B-spline surfaces, an extension of our previous work on the conversion between ANCF cable elements and B-spline curves. The derivation of the conversion equations is the discovery of the geometric invariance of the ANCF displacement field before and after the conversion. Our study starts from proposing the conversion equation between ANCF finite surface elements and Bezier surfaces which are the special cases of B-spline surfaces, followed by establishing a general conversion equation between ANCF finite surface elements and Bezier surfaces. This general conversion equation has functionalities (1) to realize the one-step direct conversion between ANCF and Bezier surfaces (2) to convert ANCF finite surface elements directly to Bezier surfaces provided the ANCF nodal coordinates are not independent. The direct conversion from a conditional ANCF finite surface to Bezier surfaces enhances the efficiency and ability to control and store data in computers during the conversion process.
  The conversion between ANCF finite surface elements and B-spline surfaces is derived from a conversion of B-spline surfaces to a more general conversion of B-spline surfaces. B-spline basis functions are utilized in the non-recursive form, from which a more efficient conversion equation is obtained compared with an intuitive conversion semantics where one converts firstly B-spline surfaces to composite Bezier surfaces by inserting knot and converts to ANCF finite surface elements afterward. The obtained conversion equations between ANCF and B-spline surfaces realize the one-step direct conversion.</description>

      <title>A fast algorithm for computing a planar support for non-piercing rectangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a hypergraph $\mathcal{H}=(X,\mathcal{E})$ a \emph{support} is a graph $G$ on $X$ such that for each $E\in\mathcal{E}$, the induced subgraph of $G$ on the elements in $E$ is connected. If $G$ is planar, we call it a planar support. A set of axis parallel rectangles $\mathcal{R}$ forms a non-piercing family if for any $R_1, R_2 \in \mathcal{R}$, $R_1 \setminus R_2$ is connected. Given a set $P$ of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and a set $\mathcal{R}$ of $m$ \emph{non-piercing} axis-aligned rectangles, we give an algorithm for computing a planar support for the hypergraph $(P,\mathcal{R})$ in $O(n\log^2 n + (n+m)\log m)$ time, where each $R\in\mathcal{R}$ defines a hyperedge consisting of all points of $P$ contained in~$R$. We use this result to show that if for a family of axis-parallel rectangles, any point in the plane is contained in at most $k$ pairwise \emph{crossing} rectangles (a pair of intersecting rectangles such that neither contains a corner of the other is called a crossing pair of rectangles), then we can obtain a support as the union of $k$ planar graphs.</description>

      <title>ClassContrast: Bridging the Spatial and Contextual Gaps for Node Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have revolutionized the domain of graph representation learning by utilizing neighborhood aggregation schemes in many popular architectures, such as message passing graph neural networks (MPGNNs). This scheme involves iteratively calculating a node's representation vector by aggregating and transforming the representation vectors of its adjacent nodes. Despite their effectiveness, MPGNNs face significant issues, such as oversquashing, oversmoothing, and underreaching, which hamper their effectiveness. Additionally, the reliance of MPGNNs on the homophily assumption, where edges typically connect nodes with similar labels and features, limits their performance in heterophilic contexts, where connected nodes often have significant differences. This necessitates the development of models that can operate effectively in both homophilic and heterophilic settings.
  In this paper, we propose a novel approach, ClassContrast, grounded in Energy Landscape Theory from Chemical Physics, to overcome these limitations. ClassContrast combines spatial and contextual information, leveraging a physics-inspired energy landscape to model node embeddings that are both discriminative and robust across homophilic and heterophilic settings. Our approach introduces contrast-based homophily matrices to enhance the understanding of class interactions and tendencies. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that ClassContrast outperforms traditional GNNs in node classification and link prediction tasks, proving its effectiveness and versatility in diverse real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Robust Bichromatic Classification using Two Lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02897v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given two sets $R$ and $B$ of $n$ points in the plane, we present efficient algorithms to find a two-line linear classifier that best separates the "red" points in $R$ from the "blue" points in $B$ and is robust to outliers. More precisely, we find a region $\mathcal{W}_B$ bounded by two lines, so either a halfplane, strip, wedge, or double wedge, containing (most of) the blue points $B$, and few red points. Our running times vary between optimal $O(n\log n)$ and around $O(n^3)$, depending on the type of region $\mathcal{W}_B$ and whether we wish to minimize only red outliers, only blue outliers, or both.</description>

      <title>On the orthogonal Gr\"unbaum partition problem in dimension three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01504v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gr\"unbaum's equipartition problem asked if for any measure $\mu$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$ there are always $d$ hyperplanes which divide $\mathbb{R}^d$ into $2^d$ $\mu$-equal parts. This problem is known to have a positive answer for $d\le 3$ and a negative one for $d\ge 5$. A variant of this question is to require the hyperplanes to be mutually orthogonal. This variant is known to have a positive answer for $d\le 2$ and there is reason to expect it to have a negative answer for $d\ge 3$. In this note we exhibit measures that prove this. Additionally, we describe an algorithm that checks if a set of $8n$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ can be split evenly by $3$ mutually orthogonal planes. To our surprise, it seems the probability that a random set of $8$ points chosen uniformly and independently in the unit cube does not admit such a partition is less than $0.001$.</description>

      <title>Theory and Explicit Design of a Path Planner for an SE(3) Robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider path planning for a rigid spatial robot with 6 degrees of freedom (6 DOFs), moving amidst polyhedral obstacles. A correct, complete and practical path planner for such a robot has never been achieved, although this is widely recognized as a key challenge in robotics. This paper provides a complete "explicit" design, down to explicit geometric primitives that are easily implementable.
  Our design is within an algorithmic framework for path planners, called Soft Subdivision Search (SSS). The framework is based on the twin foundations of $\epsilon$-exactness and soft predicates, which are critical for rigorous numerical implementations. The practicality of SSS has been previously demonstrated for various robots including 5-DOF spatial robots.
  In this paper, we solve several significant technical challenges for SE(3) robots: (1) We first ensure the correct theory by proving a general form of the Fundamental Theorem of the SSS theory. We prove this within an axiomatic framework, thus making it easy for future applications of this theory. (2) One component of $SE(3) = R^3 \times SO(3)$ is the non-Euclidean space SO(3). We design a novel topologically correct data structure for SO(3). Using the concept of subdivision charts and atlases for SO(3), we can now carry out subdivision of SO(3). (3) The geometric problem of collision detection takes place in $R^3$, via the footprint map. Unlike sampling-based approaches, we must reason with the notion of footprints of configuration boxes, which is much harder to characterize. Exploiting the theory of soft predicates, we design suitable approximate footprints which, when combined with the highly effective feature-set technique, lead to soft predicates. (4) Finally, we make the underlying geometric computation "explicit", i.e., avoiding a general solver of polynomial systems, in order to allow a direct implementation.</description>
