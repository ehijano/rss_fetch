      <title>General non-linear fragmentation with discontinuous Galerkin methods</title>

Abstract: Dust grains play a significant role in several astrophysical processes, including gas/dust dynamics, chemical reactions, and radiative transfer. Replenishment of small-grain populations is mainly governed by fragmentation during pair-wise collisions between grains. The wide spectrum of fragmentation outcomes, from complete disruption to erosion and/or mass transfer, can be modelled by the general non-linear fragmentation equation. Efficiently solving this equation is crucial for an accurate treatment of the dust fragmentation in numerical modelling. However, similar to dust coagulation, numerical errors in current fragmentation algorithms employed in astrophysics are dominated by the numerical over-diffusion problem -- particularly in 3D hydrodynamic simulations where the discrete resolution of the mass density distribution tends to be highly limited. With this in mind, we have derived the first conservative form of the general non-linear fragmentation with a mass flux highlighting the mass transfer phenomenon. Then, to address cases of limited mass density resolution, we applied a high-order discontinuous Galerkin scheme to efficiently solve the conservative fragmentation equation with a reduced number of dust bins. An accuracy of 0.1 -1% is reached with 20 dust bins spanning a mass range of 9 orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Energetic particle acceleration and transport with the novel Icarus$+$PARADISE model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rise of satellites and mankind's growing dependence on technology, there is an increasing awareness of space weather phenomena related to high-energy particles. Shock waves driven by coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and corotating interaction regions (CIRs) occasionally act as potent particle accelerators, generating hazardous solar energetic particles (SEPs) that pose risks to satellite electronics and astronauts. Numerical simulation tools capable of modelling and predicting large SEP events are thus highly demanded. We introduce the new Icarus$+$PARADISE model as an advancement of the previous EUHFORIA$+$PARADISE model. Icarus, based on the MPI-AMRVAC framework, is a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic code that models solar wind configurations from 0.1 au onwards, encompassing transient structures like CMEs or CIRs. Differing from EUHFORIA's uniform-only grid, Icarus incorporates solution adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) and grid stretching. The particle transport code PARADISE propagates energetic particles as test particles through these solar wind configurations by solving the focused transport equation in a stochastic manner. We validate our new model by reproducing EUHFORIA+PARADISE results. This is done by modelling the acceleration and transport of energetic particles in a synthetic solar wind configuration containing an embedded CIR. Subsequently, we illustrate how the simulation results vary with grid resolution by employing different levels of AMR. The resulting intensity profiles illustrate increased particle acceleration with higher levels of AMR in the shock region, better capturing the effects of the shock.</description>

      <title>Computation of the Distribution of the Absorption Time of the Drifted Diffusion with Stochastic Resetting and Mixed Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03939v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article introduces two techniques for computing the distribution of the first passage or absorption time of a drifted Wiener diffusion with Poisson resetting times, in presence of an upper hard wall reflection and a lower absorbing barrier. The first method starts with the Pad\'e approximation to the Laplace transform of the first passage time, which is then inverted through the partial fraction decomposition. The second method, which we call "multiresolution algorithm", is a Monte Carlo technique that exploits the properties of the Wiener process in order to generate Brownian bridges at increasing resolution levels. This technique allows to approximate the first passage time at any level of accuracy. An intensive numerical study reveals that the multiresolution algorithm has higher accuracy than standard Monte Carlo, whereas the faster method based on the Pad\'e approximation provides sufficient accuracy in specific circumstances only. Besides these two numerical approximations, this article provides a closed-form expression for the expected first passage time.</description>

      <title>Beacon, a lightweight deep reinforcement learning benchmark library for flow control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the increasing use of deep reinforcement learning for flow control problems has led to a new area of research, focused on the coupling and the adaptation of the existing algorithms to the control of numerical fluid dynamics environments. Although still in its infancy, the field has seen multiple successes in a short time span, and its fast development pace can certainly be partly imparted to the open-source effort that drives the expansion of the community. Yet, this emerging domain still misses a common ground to (i) ensure the reproducibility of the results, and (ii) offer a proper ad-hoc benchmarking basis. To this end, we propose Beacon, an open-source benchmark library composed of seven lightweight 1D and 2D flow control problems with various characteristics, action and observation space characteristics, and CPU requirements. In this contribution, the seven considered problems are described, and reference control solutions are provided. The sources for the following work are available at https://github.com/jviquerat/beacon.</description>

      <title>An introduction to infinite projected entangled-pair state methods for variational ground state simulations using automatic differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12358v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensor networks capture large classes of ground states of phases of quantum matter faithfully and efficiently. Their manipulation and contraction has remained a challenge over the years, however. For most of the history, ground state simulations of two-dimensional quantum lattice systems using (infinite) projected entangled pair states have relied on what is called a time-evolving block decimation. In recent years, multiple proposals for the variational optimization of the quantum state have been put forward, overcoming accuracy and convergence problems of previously known methods. The incorporation of automatic differentiation in tensor networks algorithms has ultimately enabled a new, flexible way for variational simulation of ground states and excited states. In this work we review the state-of-the-art of the variational iPEPS framework, providing a detailed introduction to automatic differentiation, a description of a general foundation into which various two-dimensional lattices can be conveniently incorporated, and demonstrative benchmarking results.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Global Natural Orbital Functional Approximation on Model Systems with Strong Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03554v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the past decade, natural orbital functional (NOF) approximations have emerged as prominent tools for characterizing electron correlation. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches, which rely on natural orbitals and their associated occupation numbers, often require hybridization with other methods to fully account for all correlation effects. Recently, a global NOF (GNOF) has been proposed [Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 233001 (2021)] to comprehensively address both dynamic and static correlations. This study evaluates the performance of GNOF on strongly correlated model systems, including comparisons with highly accurate Full Configuration Interaction (FCI) calculations for hydrogen atom clusters in one, two, and three dimensions. Additionally, the investigation extends to a BeH2 reaction, involving the insertion of a beryllium atom into a hydrogen molecule along a C2v pathway. According to the results obtained using GNOF, consistent behavior is observed across various correlation regions, encompassing a range of occupation and orbital schemes. Furthermore, distinctive features are identified when varying the dimensionality of the system.</description>
