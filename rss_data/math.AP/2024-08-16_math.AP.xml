      <description>arXiv:2408.07775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By developing a unified approach based on integral representations, we establish sharp quantitative stability estimates for critical points of the fractional Sobolev inequalities induced by the embedding $\dot{H}^s({\mathbb R}^n) \hookrightarrow L^{2n \over n-2s}({\mathbb R}^n)$ in the whole range of $s \in (0,\frac{n}{2})$.</description>

      <title>Long time derivation of Boltzmann equation from hard sphere dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a rigorous derivation of Boltzmann's kinetic equation from the hard-sphere system for rarefied gas, that is valid for arbitrarily long time as long as a solution to the Boltzmann equation exists. This is a crucial step in resolving Hilbert's sixth problem, and also extends Lanford's landmark theorem (1975) which justifies such derivation for sufficiently short time.
  The general strategy follows the paradigm introduced by the first two authors for the long-time derivation of the wave kinetic equation in wave turbulence theory. This is based on proving a long-time cumulant ansatz, which keeps memory of the full collision history of the particle system. At the heart of the matter is a reduction to combinatorial estimates for the Feynman diagrams (referred to as Collision History (CH) molecules), which are then proved by devising an elaborate cutting algorithm, a major novelty of this work.</description>

      <title>Flexibility of Two-Dimensional Euler Flows with Integrable Vorticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new convex integration scheme in fluid mechanics, and we provide an application to the two-dimensional Euler equations. We prove the flexibility and nonuniqueness of $L^\infty L^2$ weak solutions with vorticity in $L^\infty L^p$ for some $p&gt;1$, surpassing for the first time the critical scaling of the standard convex integration technique.
  To achieve this, we introduce several new ideas, including:
  (i) A new family of building blocks built from the Lamb-Chaplygin dipole.
  (ii) A new method to cancel the error based on time averages and non-periodic, spatially-anisotropic perturbations.</description>

      <title>A new blowup criterion for the 3D barotropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations with vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the blowup criterion of the barotropic compressible viscous fluids for the Cauchy problem, Dirichlet problem and Navier-slip boundary condition. The main novelty of this paper is two-fold: First, for the Cauchy problem and Dirichlet problem, we prove that a strong or smooth solution exists globally, provided that the vorticity of velocity satisfies Serrin's condition and the maximum norm of the divergence of the velocity is bounded. Second, for the Navier-slip boundary condition, we show that if both the maximum norm of the vorticity of velocity and the maximum norm of the divergence of velocity are bounded, then the solution exists globally. In particular, this criterion extends the well-known Beale-Kato-Majda's blowup criterion for the 3D incompressible Euler equations (Comm. Math. Phys. 94(1984):61-66) to the 3D barotropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations, and can be regarded as a complement for the work by Huang-Li-Xin (Comm. Math. Phys. 301(2011):23-35). The vacuum is allowed to exist here.</description>

      <title>Interior pointwise $C^{1}$ and $C^{1,1}$ regularity of solutions for general semilinear elliptic equation in nondivergence form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain $C^{1}$ and $C^{1,1}$ regularity of $L^{n}$-viscosity solutions for general semilinear elliptic equation in nondivergence form under some more weaker assumptions, which generalize the result for equations with nonhomogeneous term $f(x)$ to $f(x,u)$. In particular, the nonhomogeneous term $f(x,u)$ is assumed optimally to satisfy unform Dini continuity condition in $u$ and modified $C^{1,1}$ Newtonian potential condition in $x$. For unbounded coefficients, if $a_{ij}$ is $C_{n}^{-1,1}$ at $x_{0}\in\Omega$ with small modulus, $b_{i}\in L^{q}(\Omega)$ for some $q&gt;n$, the solution is $C^{1}$ at $x_{0}$. Furthermore, if $a_{ij},~b_{i}$ are Dini continuous at $x_{0}$, the solution is $C^{1,1}$ at $x_{0}$.</description>

      <title>The inverse obstacle problem for nonlinear inclusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Monotonocity Principle states a monotonic relationship between a possibly non-linear material property and a proper corresponding boundary operator. The Monotonicity Principle (MP) has attracted great interest in the field of inverse problems, because of its fundamental role in developing real time imaging methods. Recently, with quite general assumptions, a MP in the presence of non linear materials has been established for elliptic PDE, such as those governing Electrical Resistance Tomography.
  Together with recently introduced imaging methods and algorithms based on MP, arises a fundamental question related to the Converse (of the MP). Indeed, the Converse of the MP is fundamental to define the theoretical limits of applicability of imaging methods and algorithms. Specifically, the Converse of the MP guarantees that the outer boundary of a nonlinear anomaly can be reconstructed by means of MP based imaging methods.
  In this paper, the Converse of the Monotonicity Principle for nonlinear anomaly embedded in a linear material is proved. The results is provided in a quite general setting for Electrical Resistance Tomography. Moreover, the nonlinear electrical conductivity of the anomaly, as function of the electric field, can be either bounded or not bounded from infinity and/or zero.</description>

      <title>Normal operators for momentum ray transforms, II: Saint Venant operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The momentum ray transform $I_m^k$ integrates a rank $m$ symmetric tensor field $f$ on ${\mathbb R}^n$ over lines with the weight $t^k$, $I_m^kf(x,\xi)=\int_{-\infty}^\infty t^k\langle f(x+t\xi),\xi^m\rangle\,\mathrm{d}t$. Let $N^k_m=(I^k_m)^*I^k_m$ be the normal operator of $I_m^k$. To what extent is a symmetric $m$-tensor field $f$ determined by the data $(N_m^0f,\dots,N_m^rf)$ given for some $0\le r\le m$? The Saint Venant operator $W^r_m$ is a linear differential operator of order $m-r$ with constant coefficients on the space of symmetric $m$-tensor fields. We derive an explicit formula expressing $W^r_mf$ in terms of $(N_m^0f,\dots,N_m^rf)$. The tensor field $W^r_mf$ represents the full local information on $f$ that can be extracted from the data $(N_m^0f,\dots,N_m^rf)$.</description>

      <title>The free boundary for the singular obstacle problem with logarithmic forcing term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the previous work [Interfaces Free Bound., 19, 351-369, 2017], de Queiroz and Shahgholian investigated the regularity of the solution to the obstacle problem with singular logarithmic forcing term
  \begin{equation*}
  -\Delta u = \log u \, \chi_{\{u&gt;0\}} \quad \text{in} \quad \Omega,
  \end{equation*}
  where $\chi_{\{u&gt;0\}}$ denotes the characteristic function of the set $\{u&gt;0\}$ and $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ ($n \geq 2$) is a smooth bounded domain. The solution solves the minimum problem for the following functional,
  \begin{equation*}
  \mathscr{J}(u):=\int_{\Omega}\left(\frac{|\nabla u|^2}{2}-u^+ (\log u-1)\right) \, dx,
  \end{equation*}
  where $u^+=\max{\{0,u\}}$. In this paper, based on the regularity of the solution, we establish the $C^{1,\alpha}$ regularity of the free boundary $\Omega \cap \partial\{u&gt;0\}$ near the regular points for some $\alpha\in (0,1)$.
  The logarithmic forcing term becomes singular near the free boundary $\Omega\cap\partial\{u&gt;0\}$ and lacks the scaling properties, which are very crucial in studying the regularity of the free boundary. Despite these challenges, we draw inspiration for our overall strategy from the "epiperimetric inequality" method introduced by Weiss in 1999 [Invent. Math., 138, 23-50, 1999]. Central to our approach is the introduction of a new type of energy contraction. This allows us to achieve energy decay, which in turn ensures the uniqueness of the blow-up limit, and subsequently leads to the regularity of the free boundary.</description>

      <title>Ill-posedness of the Boltzmann-BGK model in the exponential class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: BGK (Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook) model is a relaxation-type model of the Boltzmann equation, which is popularly used in place of the Boltzmann equation in physics and engineering. In this paper, we address the ill-posedness problem for the BGK model, in which the solution instantly escapes the initial solution space. For this, we propose two ill-posedness scenarios, namely, the homogeneous and the inhomogeneous ill-posedness mechanisms. In the former case, we find a class of spatially homogeneous solutions to the BGK model, where removing the small velocity part of the initial data triggers ill-posedness by increasing temperature. For the latter, we construct a spatially inhomogeneous solution to the BGK model such that the local temperature constructed from the solution has a polynomial growth in spatial variable. These ill-posedness properties for the BGK model pose a stark contrast with the Boltzmann equation for which the solution map is, at least for a finite time, stable in the corresponding solution spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a global pseudodifferential calculus on asymptotically conic manifolds that generalizes (anisotropic versions of) Shubin's classical global pseudodifferential calculus on Euclidean space to this class of noncompact manifolds. Fully elliptic operators are shown to be Fredholm in an associated scale of Sobolev spaces, and to have parametrices in the calculus.</description>

      <title>Stability of bound states for regularized nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the stability of bound-state solutions of a family of regularized nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations which were introduced by Dumas, Lannes and Szeftel as models for the propagation of laser beams. Among these bound-state solutions are ground states, which are defined as solutions of a variational problem. We give a sufficient condition for existence and orbital stability of ground states, and use it to verify that ground states exist and are stable over a wider range of nonlinearities than for the nonregularized nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. We also give another sufficient and almost necessary condition for stability of general bound states, and show that some stable bound states exist which are not ground states.</description>

      <title>The Calder\'on problem for the Schr\"odinger equation in transversally anisotropic geometries with partial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the partial data Calder\'on problem for the anisotropic Schr\"{o}dinger equation
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eq: a1}
  (-\Delta_{\widetilde{g}}+V)u=0\text{ in }\Omega\times (0,\infty),
  \end{equation}
  where $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ is a bounded smooth domain, $\widetilde{g}=g_{ij}(x)dx^{i}\otimes dx^j+dy\otimes dy$ and $V$ is translationally invariant in the $y$ direction. Our goal is to recover both the metric $g$ and the potential $V$ from the (partial) Neumann-to-Dirichlet (ND) map on $\Gamma\times \{0\}$ with $\Gamma\Subset \Omega$. Our approach can be divided into three steps:
  Step 1. Boundary determination. We establish a novel boundary determination to identify $(g,V)$ on $\Gamma$ with help of suitable approximate solutions for the Schr\"odinger equation with inhomogeneous Neumann boundary condition.
  Step 2. Relation to a nonlocal elliptic inverse problem. We relate inverse problems for the Schr\"odinger equation with the nonlocal elliptic equation
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eq: a2}
  (-\Delta_g+V)^{1/2}v=f\text{ in }\Omega,
  \end{equation}
  via the Caffarelli--Silvestre type extension, where the measurements are encoded in the source-to-solution map. The nonlocality of this inverse problem allows us to recover the associated heat kernel.
  Step 3. Reduction to an inverse problem for a wave equation. Combining the knowledge of the heat kernel with the Kannai type transmutation formula, we transfer the inverse problem for the nonlocal equation to an inverse problem for the wave equation
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eq: a3}
  (\partial_t^2-\Delta_g+V)w=F\text{ in }\Omega\times (0,\infty),
  \end{equation}
  where the measurement operator is also the source-to-solution map. We can finally determine $(g,V)$ on $\Omega\setminus\Gamma$ by solving the inverse problem for the wave equation.</description>

      <title>Nonexistence of minimizers for the second conformal eigenvalue near the round sphere in low dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of minimizing the second conformal eigenvalue of the conformal Laplacian in a conformal class of metrics with renormalized volume. We prove, in dimensions $n\in\left\{3,\dotsc,10\right\}$, that a minimizer for this problem does not exist for metrics sufficiently close to the round metric on the sphere. This is in striking contrast with the situation in dimensions $n \ge 11$, where Ammann and Humbert obtained the existence of minimizers for the second conformal eigenvalue on any smooth closed non-locally conformally flat manifold. As a byproduct of our techniques, we also obtain a lower bound on the energy of sign-changing solutions of the \nobreak Yamabe equation in dimensions 3, 4 and 5, which extends a result obtained by Weth in the case of the round sphere.</description>

      <title>Sharp Quartic Pinching for the Mean Curvature Flow in the Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a sharp quartic curvature pinching for the mean curvature flow in $\mathbb{S}^{n+m}$, $m\ge2$, which generalises Pu's work on the convergence of submanifolds in $\mathbb{S}^{n+m}$ to a round point. Using a blow up argument, we prove a codimension and a cylindrical estimate, where in regions of high curvature, the submanifold becomes approximately codimension one, quantitatively, and is weakly convex and moves by translation or is a self shrinker. With a decay estimate, the rescaling converges smoothly to a totally geodesic limit in infinite time, without using Stampacchia iteration or integral analysis.</description>

      <title>Reaction-diffusion equations with transport noise and critical superlinear diffusion: Global well-posedness of weakly dissipative systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.06897v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the global well-posedness of reaction-diffusion systems with transport noise on the $d$-dimensional torus. We show new global well-posedness results for a large class of scalar equations (e.g. the Allen-Cahn equation), and dissipative systems (e.g. equations in coagulation dynamics). Moreover, we prove global well-posedness for two weakly dissipative systems: Lotka-Volterra equations for $d\in\{1, 2, 3, 4\}$ and the Brusselator for $d\in \{1, 2, 3\}$. Many of the results are also new without transport noise. The proofs are based on maximal regularity techniques, positivity results, and sharp blow-up criteria developed in our recent works, combined with energy estimates based on It\^o's formula and stochastic Gronwall inequalities. Key novelties include the introduction of new $L^{\zeta}$-coercivity/dissipativity conditions and the development of an $L^p(L^q)$-framework for systems of reaction-diffusion equations, which are needed when treating dimensions $d\in \{2, 3\}$ in the case of cubic or higher order nonlinearities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this short note, we consider an inverse problem to a mean-field games system where we are interested in reconstructing the state-independent running cost function from observed value-function data. We provide an elementary proof of a uniqueness result for the inverse problem using the standard multilinearization technique. One of the main features of our work is that we insist that the population distribution be a probability measure, a requirement that is not enforced in some of the existing literature on theoretical inverse mean-field games.</description>

      <title>A refined uniqueness result of Leray's problem in an infinite-long pipe with the Navier-slip boundary</title>

Abstract: We consider the generalized Leray's problem with the Navier-slip boundary condition in an infinite pipe $\mathcal{D}=\Sigma\times\mathbb{R}$. We show that if the flux $\Phi$ of the solution is no larger than a critical value that is \emph{independent with the friction ratio} of the Navier-slip boundary condition, the solution to the problem must be the parallel Poiseuille flow with the given flux. Compared with known related 3D results, this seems to be the first conclusion with the size of critical flux being uniform with the friction ratio $\alpha\in]0,\infty]$, and it is surprising since the prescribed uniqueness breaks down immediately when $\alpha=0$, even if $\Phi=0$.
  Our proof relies primarily on a refined gradient estimate of the Poiseuille flow with the Navier-slip boundary condition. Additionally, we prove the critical flux $\Phi_0\geq\frac{\pi}{16}$ provided that $\Sigma$ is a unit disk.</description>

      <title>Gradient estimates of nonlinear equation on complete noncompact metric measure space with compact boundary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.12600v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, firstly, we study gradient estimates for positive solution of the following equation \begin{equation*} \Delta_\xi(u)-\partial_t u- q u =A(u),t\in (-\infty,\infty) \end{equation*} on metric measure space $ (M,g,e^{-\xi}\mathrm{d} v_g)$ with boundary , where $ \Delta_\xi=\Delta +\left \langle \nabla\cdot , \nabla \xi\right \rangle $. For this equation, we derive Li-Yau type gradient estimates and Hamilton's type gradient estimates. Secondly, we obtain gradient estimates for positive solution of the following elliptical type equation \begin{equation} \Delta_\xi(u)- q u =A(u)\end{equation} on complete noncompact metric measure space $(M,g,e^{-\xi}\mathrm{d} v_g)$ with boundary.</description>

Abstract: In the paper, we derive Li-Yau gradient estimates and Souplet Zhang type estimates of the following equation \begin{equation*} \begin{split} u_t= \Delta_\xi p+\lambda u+A(u) , \end{split} \end{equation*} on complete noncompact metric measure space $ (M, g,e^{-\xi}dv_g) $ with compact boundary. We will also give the local gradient estimates of the equation \begin{equation*} \Delta_\xi(u^p)+\lambda u+A(u)=0, \end{equation*} on complete noncompact manifold with compact boundary.</description>

      <title>Mean-field limits for Consensus-Based Optimization and Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For algorithms based on interacting particle systems that admit a mean-field description, convergence analysis is often more accessible at the mean-field level. In order to transpose convergence results obtained at the mean-field level to the finite ensemble size setting, it is desirable to show that the particle dynamics converge in an appropriate sense to the corresponding mean-field dynamics. In this paper, we prove quantitative mean-field limit results for two related interacting particle systems: Consensus-Based Optimization and Consensus-Based Sampling. Our approach extends Sznitman's classical argument: in order to circumvent issues related to the lack of global Lipschitz continuity of the coefficients, we discard an event of small probability, the contribution of which is controlled using moment estimates for the particle systems.</description>

      <title>Poisson stability of solutions for stochastic evolution equations driven by fractional Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of Poisson stability of solutions for stochastic semi-linear evolution equation driven by fractional Brownian motion \mathrm{d} X(t)= \left( AX(t) + f(t, X(t)) \right) \mathrm{d}t + g\left(t, X(t)\right)\mathrm{d}B^H_{Q}(t), where A is an exponentially stable linear operator acting on a separable Hilbert space \mathbb{H}, coefficients f and g are Poisson stable in time, and B^H_Q (t) is a Q-cylindrical fBm with Hurst index H. First, we establish the existence and uniqueness of the solution for this equation. Then, we prove that under the condition where the functions f and g are sufficiently "small", the equation admits a solution that exhibits the same character of recurrence as f and g. The discussion is further extended to the asymptotic stability of these Poisson stable solutions. Finally, we include an example to validate our results.</description>
