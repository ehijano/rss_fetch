      <title>Boundaries of universality of thermal collisions for atom-atom scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal rate coefficients for some atomic collisions have been observed to be remarkably independent of the details of interatomic interactions at short range. This makes these rate coefficients universal functions of the long-range interaction parameters and masses, which was previously exploited to develop a self-defining atomic sensor for ambient pressure. Here, we employ rigorous quantum scattering calculations to examine the response of thermally averaged rate coefficients for atom-atom collisions to changes in the interaction potentials. We perform a comprehensive analysis of the universality, and the boundaries thereof, by treating the quantum scattering observables as probabilistic predictions determined by a distribution of interaction potentials. We show that there is a characteristic change of the resulting distributions of rate coefficients, separating light, few-electron atoms and heavy, polarizable atoms. We produce diagrams that illustrate the boundaries of the thermal collision universality at different temperatures and provide guidance for future experiments seeking to exploit the universality.</description>

      <title>An extrapolation method for polarizability assessments of ion-based optical clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a numerical method for extrapolating polarizability measurements to dc as done in the assessment of blackbody radiation shifts for ion-based clocks. The method explicitly accounts for the frequency dependence of relevant atomic transitions without introducing an ad hoc modelling function. It incorporates \emph{a priori} atomic structure calculations, which allows measurements to be augmented by calculations if there is insufficient data to make a purely measurement based estimate. The method also provides indicators of inconsistencies between theory and experiment or inadequacies of the data for making an extrapolation. We use results from Al$^+$, Lu$^+$, and Yb$^+$ to illustrate features of the method.</description>

      <title>Second-order hyperfine structure in strontium and impact on new physics searches using isotope shift spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent precision isotope shift spectroscopy experiments have reported King plot non-linearities that may uncover previously hidden nuclear properties or hint at new force-carrying bosons. Interpreting the data requires many isotope pairs, but sufficient stable spin-zero nuclei are not always available. In this Letter we consider the use of isotopes with non-zero nuclear spin for these studies. We show that observed King plot non-linearity in strontium is explained by second-order hyperfine shift in the fermionic nucleus, and we discuss the limitations of using Yb isotopes with non-zero spin in King plot studies.</description>

      <title>Simulating strong-field electron-hole dynamics in solids probed by attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the ultrafast electron dynamics of a model of a wide-bandgap material with inner, valence, and conduction bands excited by an intense few-femtosecond pump and monitored by a delayed attosecond extreme-ultraviolet probe pulse. Complementary computational methods are utilized and compared, based on the semiconductor Bloch equations (SBEs) and time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). TDDFT is employed to study a finite-size system, while the SBEs are utilized to investigate the corresponding solid with periodic boundary conditions imposed, with the crystal-momentum-dependent energy bands and interband couplings calculated in the parallel-transport structure gauge. The resulting strong-field electron dynamics are employed to predict experimentally accessible attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (ATAS) signals as a function of the probe-pulse frequency and pump-probe interpulse delay. Both simulation protocols similarly capture the time-delay-dependent spectral features in the ATAS signals. The very good agreement between our TDDFT and SBE-based results allows us to interpret the ab-initio TDDFT simulations in terms of SBEs' interband couplings, validating our SBE-based model and corroborating its conclusions.</description>

      <title>INTENTAS -- An entanglement-enhanced atomic sensor for microgravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The INTENTAS project aims to develop an atomic sensor utilizing entangled Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in a microgravity environment. This key achievement is necessary to advance the capability for measurements that benefit from both entanglement-enhanced sensitivities and extended interrogation times. The project addresses significant challenges related to size, weight, and power management (SWaP) specific to the experimental platform at the Einstein-Elevator in Hannover. The design ensures a low-noise environment essential for the creation and detection of entanglement. Additionally, the apparatus features an innovative approach to the all-optical creation of BECs, providing a flexible system for various configurations and meeting the requirements for rapid turnaround times. Successful demonstration of this technology in the Einstein-Elevator will pave the way for a future deployment in space, where its potential applications will unlock high-precision quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>TALOS (Total Automation of LabVIEW Operations for Science): A framework for autonomous control systems for complex experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern physics experiments are frequently very complex, relying on multiple simultaneous events to happen in order to obtain the desired result. The experiment control system plays a central role in orchestrating the measurement setup: However, its development is often treated as secondary with respect to the hardware, its importance becoming evident only during the operational phase. Therefore, the AEgIS (Antimatter Experiment: Gravity, Interferometry, Spectroscopy) collaboration has created a framework for easily coding control systems, specifically targeting atomic, quantum, and antimatter experiments. This framework, called Total Automation of LabVIEW Operations for Science (TALOS), unifies all the machines of the experiment in a single entity, thus enabling complex high-level decisions to be taken, and it is constituted by separate modules, called MicroServices, that run concurrently and asynchronously. This enhances the stability and reproducibility of the system while allowing for continuous integration and testing while the control system is running. The system demonstrated high stability and reproducibility, running completely unsupervised during the night and weekends of the data-taking campaigns. The results demonstrate the suitability of TALOS to manage an entire physics experiment in full autonomy: being open-source, experiments other than the AEgIS experiment can benefit from it.</description>

      <title>Achieving ultra-high anisotropy in thermal conductivity of plastic crystal through megapascal pressure of hot pressing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plastic crystals, owing to their exceptional properties, are gradually finding applications in solid-state refrigeration and ferroelectric fields. However, their inherently low thermal conductivity restricts their utilization in electronic devices. This study demonstrates that applying megapascal pressure of hot pressing can enhance the thermal conductivity of plastic crystal films. Most importantly, it induces significant anisotropy in thermal conductivity. Such anisotropy in thermal conductivity is beneficial for specialized thermal management applications, such as directing heat flow paths in electronic devices. In this study, [(CH3)4N][FeCl4] PCs films were prepared by hot pressing. At a pressure of 16 MPa, the ratio of in-plane to cross-plane thermal conductivity in the film reaches a remarkable 5.5. This is attributed to the preferential orientation along the (002) crystal plane induced by uniaxial pressure, leading to the formation of a layered structure and the creation of a flat and dense film. Furthermore, according to molecular dynamics simulations, the thermal conductivity along the [100] and [010] directions (parallel to the (002) crystal plane) is higher than in other directions. Therefore, significant modulation of anisotropy in thermal conductivity is achieved in [(CH3)4N][FeCl4] films by applying uniaxial hot pressing pressure. This phenomenon has the potential to greatly broaden the application of plastic crystals in the field of flexible electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Low Duty Cycle Pulsed UV Technique for Spectroscopy of Aluminum Monochloride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel technique to minimize UV-induced damage in experiments that employ second-harmonic generation cavities. The principle of our approach is to reduce the duty cycle of the UV light as much as possible to prolong the lifetime of the used optics. The low duty cycle is achieved by ramping the cavity into resonance for a short time during the experimental cycle when the light is used and tuning it to an off-resonant state otherwise. The necessary fast ramp and length-stabilization control of the cavity is implemented with the FPGA-based STEMlab platform. We demonstrate the utility of this method by measuring the isotope shift of the electronic transition ($X^1\Sigma \leftarrow A^1\Pi$) in AlCl at 261.5 nm in a pulsed molecular beam experiment.</description>

      <title>Evanescent Electron Wave Spin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.17325v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study demonstrates the existence of an evanescent electron wave outside both finite and infinite quantum wells by solving the Dirac equation and ensuring the continuity of the spinor wavefunction at the boundaries. We show that this evanescent wave shares the spin characteristics of the wave confined within the well, as indicated by analytical expressions for the current density across all regions. Our findings suggest that the electron cannot be confined to a mathematical singularity and that quantum information, or quantum entropy, can leak through any confinement. These results emphasize that the electron wave, fully characterized by Lorentz-invariant charge and current densities, should be considered the true and sole entity of the electron.</description>

      <title>Entanglement generation via single-qubit rotations in a torn Hilbert space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an efficient yet simple protocol to generate arbitrary symmetric entangled states with only global single-qubit rotations in a torn Hilbert space. The system is based on spin-1/2 qubits in a resonator such as atoms in an optical cavity or superconducting qubits coupled to a main bus. By sending light or microwave into the resonator, it induces AC Stark shifts on particular angular-momentum eigenstates (Dicke states) of qubits. Then we are able to generate barriers that hinder transitions between adjacent Dicke states and tear the original Hilbert space into pieces. Therefore, a simple global single-qubit rotation becomes highly non-trivial, and thus generates entanglement among the many-body system. By optimal control of energy shifts on Dicke states, we are able to generate arbitrary symmetric entangled states. We also exemplify that we can create varieties of useful states with near-unity fidelities in only one or very few steps, including W states, spin-squeezed states (SSS), and Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states. Particularly, the SSS can be created by only one step with a squeezing parameter $\xi_R^2\sim1/N^{0.843}$ approaching the Heisenberg limit (HL). Our finding establishes a way for universal entanglement generations with only single-qubit drivings where all the multiple-qubit controls are integrated into simply switching on/off microwave. It has direct applications in the variational quantum optimizer which is available with existing technology.</description>

      <title>Probing Goldstino excitation through the tunneling transport in a Bose-Fermi mixture with explicitly broken supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14524v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the tunneling transport in a repulsively interacting ultracold Bose-Fermi mixture. A two-terminal model is applied to such a mixture and the supersymmetric-like tunneling current through the junction can be induced by the bias of fermion chemical potential between two reservoirs. The Goldstino, which is the Nambu-Goldstone fermionic mode associated with the spontaneous sypersymmetry breaking and appears as a gapped mode in the presence of the explicit supersymmetry breaking in existing Bose-Fermi mixtures, is found to contribute to the tunneling transport as a supercharge exchanging process. Our study provides a potential way to detect the Goldstino transport in cold atom experiments.</description>

      <title>A Python GPU-accelerated solver for the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and applications to many-body cavity QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14401v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: TorchGPE is a general-purpose Python package developed for solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE). This solver is designed to integrate wave functions across a spectrum of linear and non-linear potentials. A distinctive aspect of TorchGPE is its modular approach, which allows the incorporation of arbitrary self-consistent and time-dependent potentials, e.g., those relevant in many-body cavity QED models. The package employs a symmetric split-step Fourier propagation method, effective in both real and imaginary time. In our work, we demonstrate a significant improvement in computational efficiency by leveraging GPU computing capabilities. With the integration of the latter technology, TorchGPE achieves a substantial speed-up with respect to conventional CPU-based methods, greatly expanding the scope and potential of research in this field.</description>

      <title>New Spin Structure Constraints on Hyperfine Splitting and Proton Size</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 1S hyperfine splitting in hydrogen is measured to an impressive ppt precision and will soon be measured to ppm precision in muonic hydrogen. The latter measurement will rely on theoretical predictions, which are limited by knowledge of the proton polarizability effect $\Delta_\text{pol}$. Data-driven evaluations of $\Delta_\text{pol}$ have long been in significant tension with baryon chiral perturbation theory. Here we present improved results for $\Delta_\text{pol}$ driven by new spin structure data, reducing the long-standing tension between theory and experiment and halving the dominating uncertainty in hyperfine splitting calculations.</description>

Abstract: The programs described in this article and distributed with it aim (1) at integrating the optical Bloch equations governing the time evolution of the density matrix representing the quantum state of an atomic system driven by laser or microwave fields, and (2) at integrating the 1D Maxwell-Bloch equations for one or two laser fields co-propagating in an atomic vapour. The rotating wave approximation is assumed. These programs can also be used for more general quantum dynamical systems governed by the Lindblad master equation. They are written in Fortran 90; however, their use does not require any knowledge of Fortran programming. Methods for solving the optical Bloch equations in the rate equations limit, for calculating the steady-state density matrix and for formulating the optical Bloch equations in the weak probe approximation are also described.</description>
