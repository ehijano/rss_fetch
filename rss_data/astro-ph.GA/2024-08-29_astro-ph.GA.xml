      <title>Aggressively-Dissipative Dark Dwarfs: The Effects of Atomic Dark Matter on the Inner Densities of Isolated Dwarf Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first suite of cosmological hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations of isolated dwarf galaxies for a dark sector that consists of Cold Dark Matter and a strongly-dissipative sub-component. The simulations are implemented in GIZMO and include standard baryons following the FIRE-2 galaxy formation physics model. The dissipative dark matter is modeled as Atomic Dark Matter (aDM), which forms a dark hydrogen gas that cools in direct analogy to the Standard Model. Our suite includes seven different simulations of $\sim 10^{10} M_{\odot}$ systems that vary over the aDM microphysics and the dwarf's evolutionary history. We identify a region of aDM parameter space where the cooling rate is aggressive and the resulting halo density profile is universal. In this regime, the aDM gas cools rapidly at high redshifts and only a small fraction survives in the form of a central dark gas disk; the majority collapses centrally into collisionless dark "clumps", which are clusters of sub-resolution dark compact objects. These dark clumps rapidly equilibrate in the inner galaxy, resulting in an approximately isothermal distribution that can be modeled with a simple fitting function. Even when only a small fraction ($\sim 5\%$) of the total dark matter is strongly dissipative, the central densities of classical dwarf galaxies can be enhanced by over an order of magnitude, providing a sharp prediction for observations.</description>

      <title>Arkenstone -- II. A model for unresolved cool clouds entrained in galactic winds in cosmological simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arkenstone is a new scheme that allows multiphase, stellar feedback-driven winds to be included in coarse resolution cosmological simulations. The evolution of galactic winds and their subsequent impact on the circumgalactic medium are altered by exchanges of mass, energy, momentum, and metals between their component phases. These exchanges are governed by complex, small-scale physical processes that cannot be resolved in cosmological simulations. In this second presentation paper, we describe Arkenstone's novel cloud particle approach for modelling unresolvable cool clouds entrained in hot, fast winds. This general framework allows models of the cloud-wind interaction, derived from state-of-the-art high-resolution simulations, to be applied in a large-scale context. In this work, we adopt a cloud evolution model that captures simultaneous cloud mass loss to and gain from the ambient hot phase via turbulent mixing and radiative cooling, respectively. We demonstrate the scheme using non-cosmological idealized simulations of a galaxy with a realistic circumgalactic medium component, using the Arepo code. We show that the ability of a high-specific energy wind component to perform preventative feedback may be limited by heavy loading of cool clouds coupled into it. We demonstrate that the diverging evolution of clouds of initially differing masses leads to a complex velocity field for the cool phase and a cloud mass function that varies both spatially and temporally in a non-trivial manner. These latter two phenomena can manifest in the simulation because of our choice of a Lagrangian discretisation of the cloud population, in contrast to other proposed schemes. This is a Learning the Universe publication.</description>

      <title>Are Stars Really Ingesting their Planets? Examining an Alternative Explanation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous stars exhibit surprisingly large variations in their refractory element abundances, often interpreted as signatures of planetary ingestion events. In this study, we propose that differences in the dust-to-gas ratio near stars during their formation can produce similar observational signals. We investigate this hypothesis using a suite of radiation-dust-magnetohydrodynamic STARFORGE simulations of star formation. Our results show that the distribution of refractory abundance variations ($\rm \Delta [X/H]$) has extended tails, with about 10-30% of all stars displaying variations around $\sim$0.1 dex. These variations are comparable to the accretion of $2-5 \rm M_\oplus$ of planetary material into the convective zones of Sun-like stars. The width of the distributions increases with the incorporation of more detailed dust physics, such as radiation pressure and back-reaction forces, as well as with larger dust grain sizes and finer resolutions. Furthermore, our simulations reveal no correlation between $\rm \Delta [X/H]$ and stellar separations, suggesting that dust-to-gas fluctuations likely occur on scales smaller than those of wide binaries. These findings highlight the importance of considering dust dynamics as a potential source of the observed chemical enrichment in stars.</description>

      <title>Evidence for a Fast Soft X-ray Wind in M82 from XMM-RGS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starburst wind models predict that metals and energy are primarily carried out of the disk by hot gas ($T &gt; 10^{6}$ K), but the low energy resolution of X-ray CCD observations results in large uncertainties on the mass and energy loading. Here, we present evidence for a fast soft X-ray wind from the prototypical starburst galaxy M82 using deep archival observations from the Reflection Grating Spectrometer on XMM-Newton. After characterizing the complex line-spread function for the spatially extended outflow ($\approx 4'$), we perform emission-line fitting to measure the velocity dispersion, $\sigma_{\text{v}}$, from OVIII (0.65, 0.77 keV), NeX (1.02 keV), and MgXII (1.47 keV). For the $T \approx 3 \times 10^{6}$ K gas, OVIII yields a velocity dispersion of $\sigma_{\text{v}} = 1160^{+100}_{-90}$ km s$^{-1}$, implying a wind speed that is significantly above the escape velocity ($v_{\text{esc}} \lesssim 450$ km s$^{-1}$). NeX ($\sigma_{\text{v}} = 550^{+130}_{-150}$ km s$^{-1}$) and MgXII ($\sigma_{\text{v}} &lt; 370$ km s$^{-1}$) show less velocity broadening than OVIII, hinting at a lower wind speed or smaller opening angle on the more compact spatial scales traced by the $T \approx (0.6 - 1) \times 10^{7}$ K gas. Alternatively, these higher energy emission lines may be dominated by shock-heated gas in the interstellar medium. Future synthesis of these measurements with Performance Verification observations of the $E = 2 - 12$ keV wind in M82 from the Resolve microcalorimeter on the X-ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission will inform the phase structure and energy budget of the hot starburst wind.</description>

      <title>Revealing Potential Initial Mass Function variations with metallicity: JWST observations of young open clusters in a low-metallicity environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the substellar mass function of star-forming clusters ($\simeq$0.1 Myr old) in a low-metallicity environment ($\simeq$$-$0.7 dex). We performed deep JWST/NIRCam and MIRI imaging of two star-forming clusters in Digel Cloud 2, a star-forming region in the Outer Galaxy ($R_G \gtrsim 15$ kpc). The very high sensitivity and spatial resolution of JWST enable us to resolve cluster members clearly down to a mass detection limit of 0.02 $M_\odot$, enabling the first detection of brown dwarfs in low-metallicity clusters. Fifty-two and ninety-one sources were extracted in mass-$A_V$-limited samples in the two clusters, from which Initial mass functions (IMFs) were derived by model-fitting the F200W band luminosity function, resulting in IMF peak masses (hereafter $M_C$) $\log M_C / M_\odot
  \simeq -1.5 \pm 0.5$ for both clusters. Although the uncertainties are rather large, the obtained $M_C$ values are lower than those in any previous study ($\log M_C / M_\odot \sim -0.5$). Comparison with the local open clusters with similar ages to the target clusters ($\sim$$10^6$-$10^7$ yr) suggests a metallicity dependence of $M_C$, with lower $M_C$ at lower metallicities, while the comparison with globular clusters, similarly low metallicities but considerably older ($\sim$$10^{10}$ yr), suggests that the target clusters have not yet experienced significant dynamical evolution and remain in their initial physical condition. The lower $M_C$ is also consistent with the theoretical expectation of the lower Jeans mass due to the higher gas density under such low metallicity. The $M_C$ values derived from observations in such an environment would place significant constraints on the understanding of star formation.</description>

      <title>Unveiling accretion in the massive YSO G033.3891. Spatial and kinematic constraints from the CO bandhead emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inner parts of the hot discs surrounding massive young stellar objects (MYSOs) are still barely explored due to observational limitations in terms of angular resolution, scarcity of diagnostic lines and the embedded and rare nature of these targets. We present the first K-band spectro-interferometric observations toward the MYSO G033.3891, which based on former kinematic evidence via the CO bandhead emission is known to host an accreting disc. Using the high spectral resolution mode (R$\sim$4000) of the GRAVITY/VLTI, we spatially resolve the emission of the inner dusty disc and the crucial gaseous interface between the star and the dusty disc. Using detailed modelling on the K-band dust continuum and tracers known to be associated with the ionised and molecular gaseous interface (Br$\gamma$, CO), we report on the smallest scales of accretion/ejection. The new observations in combination with our geometric and kinematic models employed to fit former high spectral resolution observations on the source (R$\sim$30,000; CRIRES/VLTI) allow us to constrain the size of the inner gaseous disc both spatially and kinematically via the CO overtone emission at only 2 au. Our models reveal that both Br$\gamma$ and CO emissions are located well within the dust sublimation radius (5~au) as traced by the hot 2.2~$\mu$m dust continuum. Our paper provides the first case study where the tiniest scales of gaseous accretion around the MYSO G033.3891 are probed both kinematically and spatially via the CO bandhead emission. This analysis of G033.3891 stands as only the second instance of such investigation within MYSOs, underscoring the gradual accumulation of knowledge regarding how massive young stars gain their mass, while further solidifying the disc nature of accretion at the smallest scales of MYSOs.</description>

      <title>FAUST XIX. D$_2$CO in the outflow cavities of NGC\,1333 IRAS\,4A: recovering the physical structure of its original prestellar core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular deuteration is a powerful diagnostic tool for probing the physical conditions and chemical processes in astrophysical environments. In this work, we focus on formaldehyde deuteration in the protobinary system NGC\,1333 IRAS\,4A, located in the Perseus molecular cloud. Using high-resolution ($\sim$\,100\,au) ALMA observations, we investigate the [D$_2$CO]/[HDCO] ratio along the cavity walls of the outflows emanating from IRAS\,4A1. Our analysis reveals a consistent decrease in the deuteration ratio (from $\sim$\,60-20\% to $\sim$\,10\%) with increasing distance from the protostar (from $\sim$\,2000\,au to $\sim$\,4000\,au). Given the large measured [D$_2$CO]/[HDCO], both HDCO and D$_2$CO are likely injected by the shocks along the cavity walls into the gas-phase from the dust mantles, formed in the previous prestellar phase. We propose that the observed [D$_2$CO]/[HDCO] decrease is due to the density profile of the prestellar core from which NGC\,1333 IRAS\,4A was born. When considering the chemical processes at the base of formaldehyde deuteration, the IRAS\,4A's prestellar precursor had a predominantly flat density profile within 3000\,au and a decrease of density beyond this radius.</description>

      <title>Narrow line AGN selection in CEERS: spectroscopic selection, physical properties, X-ray and radio analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we spectroscopically select narrow-line AGN (NLAGN) among the $\sim 300$ publicly available medium-resolution spectra of the CEERS Survey. Using both traditional and newly identified emission line NLAGN diagnostics diagrams, we identified 52 NLAGN at $2\lesssim z\lesssim 9$ on which we performed a detailed multiwavelength analysis. We also identified 4 new $z\lesssim 2$ broad-line AGN (BLAGN), in addition to the 8 previously reported high-$z$ BLAGN. We found that the traditional BPT diagnostic diagrams are not suited to identify high-$z$ AGN, while most of the high-$z$ NLAGN are selected using the recently proposed AGN diagnostic diagrams based on the [OIII]$\lambda$4363 auroral line or high-ionization emission lines. We compared the emission line velocity dispersion and the obscuration of the sample of NLAGN with those of the parent sample without finding significant differences between the two distributions, suggesting a population of AGN heavily buried and not significantly impacting the host galaxies' physical properties, as further confirmed by SED-fitting. The bolometric luminosities of the high-$z$ NLAGNs selected in this work are well below those sampled by surveys before JWST, potentially explaining the weak impact of these AGN. Finally, we investigate the X-ray properties of the selected NLAGN and of the sample of high-$z$ BLAGN. We find that all but 4 NLAGN are undetected in the deep X-ray image of the field, as well as all the high-$z$ BLAGN. We do not obtain a detection even by stacking the undetected sources, resulting in an X-ray weakness of $\sim 1-2$ dex from what is expected based on their bolometric luminosities. To discriminate between a heavily obscured AGN scenario or an intrinsic X-ray weakness of these sources, we performed a radio stacking analysis, which did not reveal any detection leaving open the questions about the origin of the X-ray weakness.</description>

      <title>Casting Light on Degeneracies: A Comprehensive Study of Lightcurve Variations in Microlensing Events OGLE-2017-BLG-0103 and OGLE-2017-BLG-0192</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates orbital parallax in gravitational microlensing events, focusing on OGLE-2017-BLG-0103 and OGLE-2017-BLG-0192. For events with timescales $\leq$ 60 days, a Jerk Parallax degeneracy arises due to high Jerk velocity ($\tilde{v_{j}}$), causing a four-fold continuous parallax degeneracy. OGLE-2017-BLG-0103, after incorporating orbital parallax, reveals four discrete degenerate parallax solutions, while OGLE-2017-BLG-0192 exhibits four discrete solutions without degeneracy. {The asymmetric light curve of OGLE-2017-BLG-0103 suggests a more probable model where xallarap is added to the parallax model, introducing tension. The galactic model analysis predicts a very low mass stellar lens for OGLE-2017-BLG-0192. For OGLE-2017-BLG-0103, degenerate solutions suggest a low-mass star or a darker lens in the disc, while the Xallarap+Parallax model also predicts a stellar lens in the bulge, with the source being a solar-type star orbited by a dwarf star.} This study presents five degenerate solutions for OGLE-2017-BLG-0103, emphasizing the potential for confirmation through high-resolution Adaptive Optics (AO) observations with Extremely Large Telescopes in the future. The complexities of degenerate scenarios in these microlensing events underscore the need to analyze special single-lens events in the Roman Telescope Era.</description>

      <title>Identifying the Mechanisms of Water Maser Variability During the Accretion Burst in NGC6334I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HMYSOs gain most of their mass in short bursts of accretion. Maser emission is an invaluable tool in discovering and probing accretion bursts. We observed the 22 GHz water maser response induced by the accretion burst in NGC6334I-MM1B and identified the underlying maser variability mechanisms. We report seven epochs of VLBI observations of 22 GHz water masers in NGC6334I with the VERA array, from 2014 to 2016, spanning the onset of the accretion burst in 2015.1. We also report 2019 ALMA observations of 321 GHz water masers and 22 GHz maser monitoring by HartRAO. We analyze variability patterns and use proper motions with the 22 GHz to 321 GHz line ratio to distinguish between masers in C-shocks and J-shocks. We also calculated the burst-to-quiescent variance ratio of the single-dish time series. The constant mean proper motion before and after the burst indicates that maser variability is due to excitation effects from variable radiation rather than jet ejecta. We find that the flux density variance ratio in the single-dish time series can identify maser efficiency variations in 22 GHz masers. The northern region, CM2-W2, is excited in C-shocks and showed long-term flaring with velocity-dependent excitation of new maser features. We propose that radiative heating of H2 due to high-energy radiation from the accretion burst be the mechanism for the flaring in CM2-W2. The southern regions are excited by J-shocks and have short-term flaring and dampening of water masers. We attributed the diverse variability patterns in the southern regions to the radiative transfer of the burst energy in the source. Our results indicate that the effects of source geometry, shock type, and incident radiation spectrum are fundamental factors affecting 22 GHz maser variability. Investigating water masers in irradiated shocks will improve their use as a diagnostic in time-variable radiation environments.</description>

      <title>Automated Mixture Analysis via Structural Evaluation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The determination of chemical mixture components is vital to a multitude of scientific fields. Oftentimes spectroscopic methods are employed to decipher the composition of these mixtures. However, the sheer density of spectral features present in spectroscopic databases can make unambiguous assignment to individual species challenging. Yet, components of a mixture are commonly chemically related due to environmental processes or shared precursor molecules. Therefore, analysis of the chemical relevance of a molecule is important when determining which species are present in a mixture. In this paper, we combine machine-learning molecular embedding methods with a graph-based ranking system to determine the likelihood of a molecule being present in a mixture based on the other known species and/or chemical priors. By incorporating this metric in a rotational spectroscopy mixture analysis algorithm, we demonstrate that the mixture components can be identified with extremely high accuracy (&gt;97%) in an efficient manner.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a detailed study of the physical properties of seven C IV absorbers identified at z_abs = 0.68-1.28 along the line of sight toward QSO PG 1522+101 (z_QSO = 1.330). The study leverages high-quality QSO spectra from HST COS and STIS, and Keck HIRES to resolve component structures and to constrain the gas density and elemental abundances of individual components. Under the assumption of photoionization equilibrium (PIE), five of the 12 C IV components require a mixture of high- and low-density phases to fully explain the observed relative abundances between low-, intermediate-, and high-ionization species. In addition, galaxy surveys carried out using VLT MUSE and Magellan LDSS3c are utilized to characterize the galaxy environments. The results of this analysis are summarized as follows: (1) no luminous galaxies (&gt; 0.1 L*) are found within 100 kpc in projected distance from the C IV absorbers; (2) the C IV selection preferentially targets high-metallicity (near solar) and chemically-evolved gas (~ solar [C/O] elemental abundances) in galaxy halos; (3) the observed narrow line widths of individual C IV components, places a stringent limit on the gas temperature (&lt; 5e4 K) and supports a photoionization origin; (4) additional local ionizing sources beyond the UV ionizing background may be necessary for at least one absorber based on the observed deficit of He I relative to H I; and (5) a PIE assumption may not apply when the gas metallicity exceeds the solar value and the component line width implies a warmer temperature than expected from PIE models.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the H$\beta$ Size-Luminosity Relation Using a Uniform Reverberation-Mapping Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the relation between active galactic nucleus (AGN) broad-line region (BLR) size and luminosity by conducting a uniform H$\beta$ reverberation-mapping analysis for 212 AGNs with archival light curves. Our analysis incorporates three different lag measurement methods, including the interpolated cross-correlation function (ICCF), JAVELIN, and PyROA, alongside a consistently defined lag searching window and an alias removal procedure. We find that ICCF, albeit with larger uncertainties compared to other methods, is the most reliable method based on our visual inspection of the matches between H$\beta$ and the shifted continuum light curves. Combining this sample with the 32 AGNs from the Seoul National University AGN Monitoring Project, we obtain the best-fit relation between the BLR size ($R_{\rm BLR}$) and the continuum luminosity at 5100$\r{A}$ ($L_{5100}$) with a slope significantly flatter than 0.5. By selecting a subsample of 157 AGNs with the best-quality lag measurements using a set of quantitative criteria and visual inspection, we find a consistent slope and a slightly decreased intrinsic scatter. We further investigate the effect of luminosity tracers, including $L_{5100}$, H$\beta$ luminosity ($L_{\rm H\beta}$), ${\rm [O\,\mathrm{III}]}$ luminosity ($L_{\rm [O\,\mathrm{III}]}$), and 2 to 10 keV hard X-ray luminosity ($L_{\rm 2\unicode{x2013}10\,keV}$). We find that sub-Eddington and super-Eddington AGNs exhibit systematic offsets in both $R_{\rm BLR}$$\unicode{x2013}$$L_{5100}$ and $R_{\rm BLR}$$\unicode{x2013}$$L_{\rm H\beta}$ relation, but are comparable in the $R_{\rm BLR}$$\unicode{x2013}$$L_{\rm [O\,\mathrm{III}]}$ and $R_{\rm BLR}$$\unicode{x2013}$$L_{\rm 2\unicode{x2013}10\,keV}$ relation. We discuss the potential causes for these different deviations when employing different luminosity tracers.</description>

      <title>Windy or not: Radio pc-scale evidence for a broad-line region wind in radio-quiet quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Does a broad-line region (BLR) wind in radio-quiet (RQ) active galactic nuclei (AGN) extend to pc scales and produce radio emission? We explore the correlations between a pc-scale radio wind and the BLR wind in a sample of 19 RQ Palomar-Green (PG) quasars. The radio wind is defined based on the spectral slope and the compactness of the emission at 1.5-5 GHz, and the BLR wind is defined by the excess blue wing in the C IV emission line profile. The five objects with both radio and BLR wind indicators are found at high Eddington ratios L/L_Edd (&gt; 0.66), and eight of the nine objects with neither radio nor BLR winds reside at low L/L_Edd (&lt; 0.28). This suggests that the BLR wind and the radio wind in RQ AGN are related to a radiation pressure driven wind. Evidence for free-free absorption by AGN photoionized gas, which flattens the spectral slope, is found in two objects. Radio outflows in three low L/L_Edd (0.05-0.12) objects are likely from a low-power jet, as suggested by additional evidence. The presence of a mild equatorial BLR wind in four intermediate L/L_Edd (0.2-0.4) objects can be tested with future spectropolarimetry.</description>

      <title>Origin and full characterization of the secondary (assembly) halo bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Not only are halos of different masses differently clustered, the so-called primary bias, but halos with distinct internal properties also are, which is known as secondary bias. Contrarily to the former bias, the latter is not understood within the Press-Schechter (PS) and excursion set (ES) formalisms of structure formation, where protohalos are fully characterised by their height and scale. As halos in different backgrounds undergo mergers at different rates, the secondary bias was suggested not to be innate but to arise from the distinct assembly history of halos. However, it has recently been proven that mergers leave no imprint in halo properties. But, in the peak model of structure formation, the secondary bias could still be innate and arise from the different typical curvature of peaks lying in different backgrounds. Here we show that this is the case, indeed. Using the CUSP formalism, we find that peaks lying in different backgrounds with different typical curvatures evolve in halos with different density profiles which in turn lead to many other distinct properties. The dependence we find of halo bias with those properties reproduces the results of simulations.</description>

      <title>The Tidal Torque Theory Revisited. I. Protohalo Angular Momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: According to the Tidal Torque Theory (TTT), the angular momentum of haloes arises from the tidal torque produced on protohaloes by the mass fluctuations around them. That approach, initially developed assuming protohaloes as random overdense regions in the linear density field, was extended to the more realistic scenario that protohaloes are collapsing patches around peaks in the Gaussian-smoothed linear density field. But that extension faced two fundamental issues: 1) the unknown mass of collapsing patches marked by Gaussian peaks, and 2) the unknown ellipsoidal collapse time of those triaxial patches. Furthermore, the TTT strictly holds in linear regime only. This Paper is the first of a series of two devoted to revisiting the TTT and accurately calculating the halo angular momentum. In the present Paper we use the CUSP formalism fixing all those issues to deal with the TTT from a full peak model viewpoint, i.e. not only is the protohalo suffering the tidal torque identified to a peak, but the main mass fluctuation causing the tidal torque is also seen as a peak or a hole. This way we obtain a simple analytic expression for the Lagrangian protohalo AM, which can be readily implemented in galaxy formation models and be compared to the results of simulations.</description>

      <title>Preliminary Study on Dark Matter-Dominated Systems: Further Analysis for galactic dark matter halos with Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.05865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low surface brightness galaxies are an excellent laboratory where stars and baryonic matter act as tracers of the gravitational potential of the dark matter halo. If dark matter is modeled as a perfect fluid, then spherically symmetric and static dark matter halos in hydrostatic equilibrium demand that dark matter should have an intrinsic pressure that counteracts the gravitational attraction that the dark matter halo exerts on itself. This static fluid (dark matter-dominated system, where the presence of baryons is negligible) has a specific equation of state for each rotational velocity profile of the stars in galaxies. In this work, we study the dark matter equation of state needed for the self-gravitating object to produce a gravitational potential such that the tracers follow the Universal Rotational Velocity Profile for stars of spiral galaxies proposed by Persic et al. (1996) and analyze the properties of the self-gravitating structures that emerge from this equation of state.The resulting configurations explaining the observed rotational speeds are found to be unstable. We conclude that the halo is not in hydrostatic equilibrium, it is nonspherically symmetric, or it is not static if the universal velocity profile should be valid for fitting the rotational velocity curve of the galaxies.</description>

      <title>Rotation Curve Fitting Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04372v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One key piece of evidence for dark matter is the flat rotation curve problem: the disagreement between measured galactic rotation curves and their luminous mass. A novel solution to this problem is presented here. A model of relativistic frame effects on Doppler shifts due to the slightly curved frames of an emitting galaxy and the Milky Way is derived. This model predicts observed Doppler shifted spectra (in excess of the luminous mass) based only on the observed luminous matter profile and one free model parameter. Fits to the 175 galaxies reported in the SPARC database of galactic rotation profiles and accurate photometry measurements are compared between this novel model and dark matter and MOND (RAR) models. We find on the SPARC sample of 175 galaxies; that MOND-RAR has an average reduced chisquare of $\chi^2_r = 4.22$ for 175 galaxies fitted, the isothermal dark matter model has $\chi^2_r = 1.90$ for 165 galaxies fitted, and the new model we present has $\chi^2_r = 2.39$ for 172 galaxies fitted. Implications of this model are discussed.</description>

      <title>Natal Kicks from the Galactic Center and Implications on their Environment and the Roman Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most galaxies, including the Milky Way, harbor a central supermassive black hole (SMBH) weighing millions to billions of solar masses. Surrounding these SMBHs are dense regions of stars and stellar remnants, such as neutron stars and black holes. Neutron stars and possibly black holes receive large natal kicks at birth on the order of hundreds of km s$^{-1}$. The natal kicks that occur in the vicinity of an SMBH may redistribute the orbital configuration of the compact objects and alter their underlying density distribution. We model the effects of natal kicks on a Galactic Center (GC) population of massive stars and stellar binaries with different initial density distributions. Using observational constraints from stellar orbits near the GC, we place an upper limit on the steepness of the initial stellar profile and find it to be core-like. In addition, we predict that $30-70 \%$ of compact objects become unbound from the SMBH due to their kicks and will migrate throughout the galaxy. Different black hole kick prescriptions lead to distinct spatial and kinematic distributions. We suggest that the Roman Space Telescope may be able to distinguish between these distributions and thus be able to differentiate natal kick mechanisms.</description>

      <title>FORGE'd in FIRE III: The IMF in Quasar Accretion Disks from STARFORGE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, we demonstrated self-consistent formation of strongly-magnetized quasar accretion disks (QADs) from cosmological radiation-magnetohydrodynamic-thermochemical galaxy-star formation simulations, including the full STARFORGE physics shown previously to produce a reasonable IMF under typical ISM conditions. Here we study star formation and the stellar IMF in QADs, on scales from 100 au to 10 pc from the SMBH. We show it is critical to include physics often previously neglected, including magnetic fields, radiation, and (proto)stellar feedback. Closer to the SMBH, star formation is suppressed, but the (rare) stars that do form exhibit top-heavy IMFs. Stars can form only in special locations (e.g. magnetic field switches) in the outer QAD. Protostars accrete their natal cores rapidly but then dynamically decouple from the gas and wander, ceasing accretion on timescales ~100 yr. Their jets control initial core accretion, but the ejecta are swept up into the larger-scale QAD flow without much dynamical effect. The strong tidal environment strongly suppresses common-core multiplicity. The IMF shape depends sensitively on un-resolved dynamics of protostellar disks (PSDs), as the global dynamical times can become incredibly short ($\ll$ yr) and tidal fields are incredibly strong, so whether PSDs can efficiently transport angular momentum or fragment catastrophically at $\lesssim 10$ au scales requires novel PSD simulations to properly address. Most analytic IMF models and analogies with planet formation in PSDs fail qualitatively to explain the simulation IMFs, though we discuss a couple of viable models.</description>

      <title>(Re)mind the gap: a hiatus in star formation history unveiled by APOGEE DR17</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The analysis of several spectroscopic surveys indicates the presence of a bimodality between the disc stars in the abundance ratio space of [${\alpha}$/Fe] versus [Fe/H]. The two stellar groups are commonly referred to as the high-${\alpha}$ and low-${\alpha}$ sequences. Some models capable of reproducing such a bimodality, invoke the presence of a hiatus in the star formation history in our Galaxy, whereas other models explain the two sequences by means of stellar migration. Our aim is to show that the existence of the gap in the star formation rate between high-$\alpha$ and low-$\alpha$ is evident in the stars of APOGEE DR17, if one plots [Fe/$\alpha$] versus [$\alpha$/H], thus confirming previous suggestions by Gratton et al. (1996) and Fuhrmann (1998). Then we try to interpret the data by means of detailed chemical models. We compare the APOGEE DR17 red giant stars with the predictions of a detailed chemical evolution model based on the two-infall paradigm, taking also into account possible accretion of dwarf satellites. The APOGEE DR17 abundance ratios [Fe/$\alpha$] versus [$\alpha$/H] exhibit a sharp increase of [Fe/$\alpha$] at a nearly constant [$\alpha$/H] (where $\alpha$ elements considered are Mg, Si, O) during the transition between the two disc phases. This observation strongly supports the hypothesis that a hiatus in star formation occurred during this evolutionary phase. Notably, the most pronounced growth in the [Fe/$\alpha$] versus [$\alpha$/H] relation is observed for oxygen, as this element is exclusively synthesised in core-collapse supernovae. A chemical model predicting a stop in the star formation of a duration of roughly 3.5 Gyr, and where the high-$\alpha$ disc starts forming from pre-enriched gas by a previous encounter with a dwarf galaxy can well explain the observations.</description>

      <title>Velocity-Resolved Ionization Mapping of Broad Line Region. I. Insights into Diverse Geometry and Kinematics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Broad emission lines of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) originate from the broad-line region (BLR), consisting of dense gas clouds in orbit around an accreting supermassive black hole. Understanding the geometry and kinematics of the region is crucial for gaining insights into the physics and evolution of AGNs. Conventional velocity-resolved reverberation mapping may face challenges in disentangling the degeneracy between intricate motion and geometry of this region. To address this challenge, new key constraints are required. Here, we report the discovery of an asymmetric BLR using a novel technique: velocity-resolved ionization mapping, which can map the distance of emitting gas clouds by measuring Hydrogen line ratios at different velocities. By analyzing spectroscopic monitoring data, we find that the Balmer decrement is anticorrelated with the continuum and correlated with the lags across broad emission line velocities. Some line ratio profiles deviate from the expectations for a symmetrically virialized BLR, suggesting that the red-shifted and blue-shifted gas clouds may not be equidistant from the supermassive black hole (SMBH). This asymmetric geometry might represent a formation imprint, provide new perspectives on the evolution of AGNs, and influence SMBH mass measurements.</description>

Abstract: We present the design and observations of low resolution JWST/NIRSpec PRISM spectroscopy from the Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam ObserVations before the Epoch of Reionization (UNCOVER) Cycle 1 JWST Treasury program. Targets are selected using JWST/NIRCam photometry from UNCOVER and other programs, and cover a wide range of categories and redshifts to ensure the legacy value of the survey. These categories include the first galaxies at $z\gtrsim10$, faint galaxies during the Epoch of Reionization ($z\sim6-8$), high redshift AGN ($z\gtrsim6$), Population III star candidates, distant quiescent and dusty galaxies ($1\lesssim z \lesssim 6$), and filler galaxies sampling redshift--color--magnitude space from $z\sim 0.1-13$. Seven NIRSpec MSA masks across the extended Abell 2744 cluster were observed, along with NIRCam parallel imaging in 8 filters (F090W, F115W, F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W, F410M, F444W, F480M) over a total area of ~26 arcmin$^2$, overlapping existing HST coverage from programs including the Hubble Frontier Fields and BUFFALO. We successfully observed 553 objects down to $m_{\mathrm{F444W}}\sim30\mathrm{AB}$, and by leveraging mask overlaps, we reach total on-target exposure times ranging from 2.4-16.7h. We demonstrate the success rate and distribution of confirmed redshifts, and also highlight the rich information revealed by these ultradeep spectra for a subset of our targets. An updated lens model of Abell 2744 is also presented, including 14 additional spectroscopic redshifts and finding a total cluster mass of $M_{\mathrm{SL}}=(2.1\pm0.3)\times10^{15}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. We publicly release reduced 1D and 2D spectra for all objects observed in Summer 2023 along with a spectroscopic redshift catalog and the updated lens model of the cluster (https://jwst-uncover.github.io/DR4.html).</description>

Abstract: Cosmological inferences typically rely on explicit expressions for the likelihood and covariance of the data vector, which normally consists of a set of summary statistics. However, in the case of nonlinear large-scale structure, exact expressions for either likelihood or covariance are unknown, and even approximate expressions can become very cumbersome, depending on the scales and summary statistics considered. Simulation-based inference (SBI), in contrast, does not require an explicit form for the likelihood but only a prior and a simulator, thereby naturally circumventing these issues. In this paper, we explore how this technique can be used to infer $\sigma_8$ from a Lagrangian effective field theory (EFT) based forward model for biased tracers. The power spectrum and bispectrum are used as summary statistics to obtain the posterior of the cosmological, bias and noise parameters via neural density estimation. We compare full simulation-based inference with cases where the data vector is drawn from a Gaussian likelihood with sample and analytical covariances. We conclude that, for $k_{\text{max}}=0.1h\text{Mpc}^{-1}$ and $0.2h\text{Mpc}^{-1}$, the form of the covariance is more important than the non-Gaussianity of the likelihood, although this conclusion is expected to depend on the cosmological parameter inferred, the summary statistics considered and range of scales probed.</description>

      <title>The Blue Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (BlueMUSE) on the VLT: science drivers and overview of instrument design</title>

Abstract: BlueMUSE is a blue-optimised, medium spectral resolution, panoramic integral field spectrograph under development for the Very Large Telescope (VLT). With an optimised transmission down to 350 nm, spectral resolution of R$\sim$3500 on average across the wavelength range, and a large FoV (1 arcmin$^2$), BlueMUSE will open up a new range of galactic and extragalactic science cases facilitated by its specific capabilities. The BlueMUSE consortium includes 9 institutes located in 7 countries and is led by the Centre de Recherche Astrophysique de Lyon (CRAL). The BlueMUSE project development is currently in Phase A, with an expected first light at the VLT in 2031. We introduce here the Top Level Requirements (TLRs) derived from the main science cases, and then present an overview of the BlueMUSE system and its subsystems fulfilling these TLRs. We specifically emphasize the tradeoffs that are made and the key distinctions compared to the MUSE instrument, upon which the system architecture is built.</description>

      <title>The updated BOSZ synthetic stellar spectral library</title>

Abstract: Context. The modeling of stellar spectra of flux standards observed by the Hubble and James Webb space telescopes requires a large synthetic spectral library that covers a wide atmospheric parameter range.
  Aims. The aim of this paper is to present and describe the calculation methods behind the updated version of the BOSZ synthetic spectral database, which was originally designed to fit the CALSPEC flux standards. These new local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) models incorporate both MARCS and ATLAS9 model atmospheres, updated continuous opacities, and 23 new molecular line lists.
  Methods. The new grid was calculated with Synspec using the LTE approximation and covers metallicities [M/H] from -2.5 to 0.75 dex, [alpha/M] from -0.25 to 0.5 dex, and [C/M] from -0.75 to 0.5 dex, providing spectra for 336 unique compositions. Calculations for stars between 2800 and 8000 K use MARCS model atmospheres, and ATLAS9 is used between 7500 and 16,000 K.
  Results. The new BOSZ grid includes 628,620 synthetic spectra from 50 nm to 32 microns with models for 495 Teff - log g parameter pairs per composition and per microturbulent velocity. Each spectrum has eight different resolutions spanning a range from R = 500 to 50,000 as well as the original resolution of the synthesis. The microturbulent velocities are 0, 1, 2, and 4 km/s.
  Conclusions. The new BOSZ grid extends the temperature range to cooler temperatures compared to the original grid because the updated molecular line lists make modeling possible for cooler stars. A publicly available and consistently calculated database of model spectra is important for many astrophysical analyses, for example spectroscopic surveys and the determination of stellar elemental compositions.</description>

      <title>The JWST/NIRISS Deep Spectroscopic Survey for Young Brown Dwarfs and Free-Floating Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery and characterization of free-floating planetary-mass objects (FFPMOs) is fundamental to our understanding of star and planet formation. Here we report results from an extremely deep spectroscopic survey of the young star cluster NGC1333 using NIRISS WFSS on the James Webb Space Telescope. The survey is photometrically complete to K~21, and includes useful spectra for objects as faint as K~20.5. The observations cover 19 known brown dwarfs, for most of which we confirm spectral types using NIRISS spectra. We discover six new candidates with L-dwarf spectral types that are plausible planetary-mass members of NGC1333, with estimated masses between 5-15 MJup. One, at ~5 MJup, shows clear infrared excess emission and is a good candidate to be the lowest mass object known to have a disk. We do not find any objects later than mid-L spectral type (M &lt; ~4 MJup). The paucity of Jupiter-mass objects, despite the survey's unprecedented sensitivity, suggests that our observations reach the lowest mass objects formed like stars in NGC1333. Our findings put the fraction of FFPMOs in NGC1333 at ~10% of the number of cluster members, significantly more than expected from the typical log-normal stellar mass function. We also search for wide binaries in our images and report a young brown dwarf with a planetary-mass companion.</description>
