      <title>Pure Moving Electromagnetic Media Consisting of Magnetochiral Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical studies demonstrate that magneto-chiral (MCh) metasurfaces consisting of double Z-type gammadions with perpendicularly magnetized substrate exhibit bianisotropy for microwaves. Effective polarizability tensors of the metasurfaces, extracted from the reflection and transmission coefficients, have components corresponding to non-reciprocal moving-type bianisotropy as well as reciprocal chiral-type bianisotropy and non-reciprocal magneto-optical effects. The combination of the metasurfaces and contraposition MCh metasurfaces cancels the chiral-type bianisotropy and magneto-optical effect, leading to pure moving electromagnetic media. Achieved perfect transmission with phase difference of {\pi} realizes an ideal gyrator for arbitrary spatial and polarization modes.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Maxwell equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the analysis of biquaternion quadratic forms of field, it is shown that Maxwell equations arise as a consequence of the principle of conservation of the energy-momentum flow of field in space-time. It turns out that this principle presupposes the existence more general nonlinear field equations. Classical linear Maxwell equations are embedded in a special way into new nonlinear equations and are their special case. It is shown that in a number of important cases nonlinear equations, in contrast to linear ones, allow solutions that have a swirling energy flow. Solutions of the equations we obtained make it possible to give wave description of charged particles, common for quantum mechanics, within the framework of nonlinear classical electrodynamics. Special attention in the work is paid to the problem of dividing the field into "own" field of a charged particle and a field "external" to it. From the nonlinear field equations follow both the classical Maxwell equations themselves and the equations of charges moving under the Lorentz force. In this way, the problem of finding nonlinear field equations that include interaction is solved. In our approach, the particle charge is electromagnetic (complex-valued), passing through periodically changing linear combinations of electric and magnetic charges - from purely electric to purely magnetic. In real processes, it is not the particle charge itself that plays a role, but its phase relationship with other charges and fields.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating Invalidity of Solution Methods Involved in Solving Compatibility Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the theory of elasticity, the constraint of compatibility conditions on displacement field is not equivalent to the property of displacement field. The difference may broaden the possibility of solutions to elasticity problems, which means that the solution methods involved in solving the compatibility equations like stress-based solution method and stress function method may be invalid. The study argues the validity of the solution methods involved in solving the compatibility equations. It is concluded that the absence of constraints on local rigid body rotation causes the non-uniqueness of displacement fields for a rectangular beam purely bent and a cantilever loaded at the end.</description>

      <title>Unification of energy concepts in generalised phase space theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider how to describe Hamiltonian mechanics in generalised probabilistic theories with the states represented as quasi-probability distributions. We give general operational definitions of energy-related concepts. We define generalised energy eigenstates as the purest stationary states. Planck's constant plays two different roles in the framework: the phase space volume taken up by a pure state and a dynamical factor. The Hamiltonian is a linear combination of generalised energy eigenstates. This allows for a generalised Liouville time-evolution equation that applies to quantum and classical Hamiltonian mechanics and more. The approach enables a unification of quantum and classical energy concepts and a route to discussing energy in a wider set of theories.</description>

      <title>Compressible single-phase flows in heated and cooled ducts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analytical/quasi-analytical solutions are proposed for a steady, compressible, single-phase flow in a rectilinear duct subjected to heating followed by cooling. The flow is driven by the pressure ratio between an upstream tank and a variable outlet pressure. The article proposes a methodology to determine the full flow behavior, as a function of pressure ratio and heat-flux distribution. Following an analogy done with the study of compressible flows in nozzles, a behavioral classification of non-adiabatic compressible flows is proposed through the definition of critical pressure ratios. It is demonstrated that a critical pressure ratio distinguishes subsonic and supersonic outlet regimes and that there cannot be a steady shock-wave in such configuration. The behavior of this critical pressure ratio is studied for limit cases of heat-flux, delineating physical boundaries. An abacus is also proposed for a given couple of heating and cooling powers, as both values are needed to characterize the flow. Results are studied for parameters such as pressure ratio and outlet heat power. A short validation of a numerical simulation tool is provided, yielding excellent results and very small relative errors.</description>

      <title>Aspects of the Einstein-Maxwell-Weyl coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interesting phenomena and problems arising from the coupling of large-scale electromagnetic fields and spacetime curvature, are introduced and studied within this thesis. From electromagnetic wave propagation in curved spacetime to envisaging a gravito-electromagnetic equivalence on large scales; from magnetic fields' cosmic evolution, and magnetised gravitational collapse in astrophysical environments, to the interaction between electromagnetic and gravitational radiation; the present research work explores some unique characteristics and properties of the gravito-electromagnetic coexistence. Its theoretical framework is generally provided by classical (Maxwellian) electrodynamics in the (4-dimensional) Riemannian spacetime of General Relativity. Chapter 1, dealing with the perspective of a gravito-electromagnetic equivalence in a metric affine geometry (involving torsion and non-metricity), forms an exception to the aforementioned general framework. Regarding its structure, the manuscript consists of four chapters divided in two parts. The first two chapters (forming Part I) are concerned with the Maxwell field in curved, Riemannian (Chapter 2) and (generalised) metric affine (Chapter 2), spacetime framework. Aspects of the Weyl-Maxwell coupling (where the Weyl field refers to long-range curvature) are also included in Chapter 2. The last two chapters (forming Part II) treat magnetohydrodynamics in the general relativistic framework.</description>
