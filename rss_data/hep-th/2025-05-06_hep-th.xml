      <title>Time-Ordering in the Dyson-Unruh Problem: Accelerated Observers and Quantum Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the structure of time-ordered perturbative expansions in quantum field theory (QFT) in curved spacetime, focusing on the interaction between a scalar field and multiple Unruh-DeWitt detectors undergoing uniform acceleration. Assuming the existence of a timelike Killing vector field, which serves as a global time coordinate, we express each detector's proper time in terms of this global time and consistently implement time-ordering in the Dyson series. Using light-cone coordinates and detector worldlines, we construct all possible interaction terms for two detectors at first, second, and third orders in perturbation theory. Our formalism enables a systematic classification of contributions to the S-matrix, resolving ordering ambiguities that arise due to differing accelerations and causal structure.</description>

      <title>Universality of the microcanonical entropy at large spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider rigorous consequences of modular invariance for two-dimensional unitary non-rational CFTs with $c &gt; 1$. Simple estimates for the torus partition function can lead to remarkably strong results. We show in particular that the spectral density of spin-$J$ operators must grow like $\exp\left( \pi \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}(c-1) J} \right)/\sqrt{2J}$ in any twist interval at or above $(c-1)/12$, with a known twist-dependent prefactor. This proves that the large $J$ spectrum becomes dense even without averaging over spins. For twists below $(c-1)/12$ we establish that the growth must be strictly slower. Finally, we estimate how fast the maximal gap between two spin-$J$ operators must go to zero as $J$ becomes large.</description>

      <title>The Sky Remembers everything: Celestial amplitude, Shadow and OPE in quadratic EFT of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we compute the celestial amplitude arising from higher curvature corrections to Einstein gravity, incorporating phase dressing. The inclusion of such corrections leads to effective modifications of the theory's ultraviolet (UV) behaviour. In the eikonal limit, we find that, in contrast to Einstein's gravity, where the $u$ and $s$-channel contributions cancel, these contributions remain non-vanishing in the presence of higher curvature terms. We examine the analytic structure of the resulting amplitude and derive a dispersion relation for the phase-dressed eikonal amplitude in quadratic gravity. Furthermore, we investigate the celestial conformal block expansion of the Mellin-transformed conformal shadow amplitude within the framework of celestial conformal field theory (CCFT). As a consequence, we compute the corresponding operator product expansion (OPE) coefficients using the Burchnall-Chaundy expansion. In addition, we evaluate the OPE via the Euclidean OPE inversion formula across various kinematic channels and comment on its applicability and implications. Finally, we briefly explore the Carrollian amplitude associated with the corresponding quadratic EFT.</description>

      <title>A Chiral-Planar dualization algorithm for $3d$ $\mathcal{N}=2$ Chern-Simons-matter theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a broad class of three-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ chiral Chern-Simons gauge theories admit an abelian and planar dual description. These chiral-planar dualities emerge by performing real mass deformations on known $\mathcal{N}=4$ mirror pairs, using the $\mathcal{N}=2^*$ setup to flow to chiral theories on the electric side. While identifying the correct dual vacuum is subtle due to the rich structure of the Coulomb branch, we develop a mirror dualization algorithm that streamlines this process and systematically provides the abelian-planar duals of chiral quivers.</description>

      <title>RNS superstring measure for genus 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new formula for the RNS supersting measure for genus 3. Our derivation is based on invariant theory. We follow Witten's idea of using an algebraic parametrization of the moduli space (which he applied to re-derive D'Hoker and Phong's formula for the RNS superstring measure for genus 2); but the particular parametrization that we use has not been applied to superstring theory before. We prove that the superstring measure is a linear combinaition (with complex coefficients) of three known functions. Furthermore, we conjecture the values of the coefficients of this linear combination and provide evidence for this conjecture. Unlike the Ansatz of Cacciatori, Dalla Piazza and van Geemen from 2008, our formula has a polar singularity along the hyperelliptic locus; the existence of this singularity was established by Witten in 2015. Moreover, our formula is not an Ansatz but follows from first principles, except for the values of the three coefficients.</description>

      <title>M\"obius randomness in the Hartle-Hawking state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider quantum cosmology for toroidal universes in d+1 dimensions. The Hilbert space is the space of square-integrable automorphic forms for GL(d). The Hartle-Hawking state is defined as a Poincar\'e sum over the no-boundary geometries. We obtain its representation in the Langlands spectral decomposition. This leads to an expression as a sum over the Riemann zeta zeros and implies that its near singularity dynamics is governed by the Hilbert-P\'olya Hamiltonian. It also takes the form of a M\"obius average of CFT partition functions which suggests a similar interpretation for the de Sitter entropy. We briefly discuss the relationship between quantum cosmology and the Langlands program.</description>

      <title>Notes on su$(1,2)\oplus$u$(1)$ Chern-Simons theory and Torsional Newton-Cartan gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate three-dimensional torsional Newton-Cartan (TNC) gravity by gauging the su$(1,2)\oplus$u$(1)$ algebra and construct its action using the Chern-Simons theory. This TNC exhibits novels features, including the fact that the gauge fields associated with both dilatation and rotation symmetries transform non-trivially under Galilean boosts. This theory also reproduces the Schr\"odinger gravity acquired by gauging the extended $z=2$ Schr\"odinger algebra \cite{Hartong:2016yrf} via $1/c$ expansion. In particular, we explain that the $z=2$ Lifshitz geometry appearing in the Schr\"odinger gravity is related to the null reduction of 4d $\Omega$-background up to a conformal factor. Based on these results, we revisit the identification between the extended Schr\"odinger algebra and the bosonic analogue of super BMS algebra \cite{Chernyavsky:2019hyp}. We interpret that this relation originates from the $\mathcal{W}_3^{(2)}$ algebra which acts as the bosonic analogue of $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universal cosmologies are exact solutions of 10d type IIA supergravity containing a 4d Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker factor, that can also be repackaged as solutions of 4d models, i.e. as 4d consistent truncations. We extend the dynamical system analysis of universal cosmologies, beyond the case of a single exponential potential. For an open universe (negative 3d spatial curvature), these models generally possess many desirable features: parametric control of e-folds, late-time acceleration from potentials with steep exponentials (i.e. in accordance with swampland bounds), small string-loop and $\alpha'$-corrections, scale separation and/or absence of decompactification.</description>

      <title>Non-relativistic quantum strings from gauged WZW models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct non-relativistic quantum strings from gauged Wess--Zumino--Witten (WZW) models. We depart from the fact that Lie groups with a bi-invariant galilean structure can be seen as the quotient by a null central subgroup of a generalised Nappi--Witten group. We implement the quotient by a chiral null gauging. We use a particular free field realisation of the Nappi--Witten current algebra to compute the Virasoro BRST cohomology of the gauged WZW model, resulting in a closed string theory reminiscent of the bosonic Gomis--Ooguri string, but whose spectrum differs slightly between the holomorphic and antiholomorphic sectors.</description>

      <title>Soft Theorems from Higher Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the connection between spontaneously-broken higher symmetries and soft theorems for scattering amplitudes of their associated Nambu-Goldstone bosons. Our main result is a new sub-leading double soft pion theorem in theories with a spontaneously-broken continuous 2-group global symmetry, which intertwines amplitudes with different numbers of pions and photons. We also provide a novel derivation of the leading soft photon theorem from the Ward identity of an emergent 1-form global symmetry in effective field theories where antiparticles are integrated out. Our derivations of these soft theorems use the algebra of spacetime currents and do not rely on asymptotic symmetries or diagrammatic arguments.</description>

      <title>Three-Family Supersymmetric Pati-Salam models from Intersecting D6-Branes on Rigid Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intersecting D6-brane models without discrete torsion typically suffer from unstabilized open string moduli, arising from D-brane positions and Wilson lines. These moduli generate additional massless adjoint fields, obstructing the realization of negative beta functions necessary for asymptotic freedom unless they are decoupled around string scale. A viable solution involves utilizing rigid cycles, which eliminate these unwanted adjoint fields. In this work, we for the first time present a class of consistent three-family supersymmetric Pati-Salam models from rigid intersecting D6-branes on the factorizable $\mathbb{T}^6/(\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2^\prime)$ orientifold with discrete torsion. These models satisfy all the known consistency conditions, including $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetry, K-theory constraints, tadpole cancellation, and recent swampland bounds on the maximal gauge group rank. We provide detailed particle spectra, analyze their phenomenological implications, and discuss the decoupling of exotic states through strong dynamics in the hidden sector.</description>

      <title>Topological Manipulations On $\mathbb{R}$ Symmetries Of Abelian Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Performing topological manipulations is a fruitful way to understand global aspects of Quantum Field Theory (QFT). Such modifications are controlled by the notion of Topological QFT (TQFT) coupling across different codimensions. Motivated by the recent developments involving non-compact TQFTs as the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) for continuous symmetries, we explore topological manipulations on global $\mathbb{R}$ symmetries in the simple contexts of abelian gauge theories. We do so by turning on $\mathbb{R}$ background fields in these models, which are then inserted into a BF theory with a conjugate field valued either in $\mathbb{R}$ or $U(1)$, depending on the manipulation. When the conjugate field is $\mathbb{R}$-valued, it gives a flat gauging prescription of the $\mathbb{R}$ global symmetry. For certain cases, this gauging can be used to establish path-integral dualities, with which one can construct topological duality defects and condensation defects. The defects being defined by employing self-duality under $\mathbb{R}$ gauging, they are anticipated to obey a Tambara-Yamagami like fusion algebra. Due to the challenges arising from the non-compactness of $\mathbb{R}$, we do not rigorously establish this expectation. For the TQFT coupling with $U(1)$ valued conjugate field, we demonstrate a $2\pi \mathbb{Z} \subset \mathbb{R}$ subgroup gauging, which we connect to the results obtained from SymTFT recently. Executing this gauging in the 2d real scalar and the 4d $\mathbb{R}$ Maxwell, we respectively obtain the 2d compact scalar and the 4d $U(1)$ Maxwell theory. Finally, we give an exposition on the $\mathbb{R}$ gauging ideas applied to $(-1)-$form and $(d-1)-$form $\mathbb{R}$ symmetries. In particular, using the SymTFT picture, we identify the possible manipulations and realize them explicitly in the context of $p$-form gauge theory in $d=p+1$ dimensions.</description>

      <title>Symplectic Grassmannian description of the Coulomb branch three and four point amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a formulation of the three- and four-point amplitudes on the Coulomb branch of N=4 SYM as integrals over the symplectic Grassmannian. We demonstrate that their kinematic spaces are equivalent to symplectic Grassmannians SpGr(n,2n). For the three-point case, we express the amplitude as an integral over the symplectic Grassmannian in a specific little group frame. In the four-point case, we show that the integral yields the amplitude up to a known kinematic factor. Building on the four-dimensional analysis, we also express the six-dimensional N = (1,1) SYM amplitude in terms of four-dimensional variables in a form that makes its symplectic Grassmannian structure manifest.</description>

      <title>Gauge invariance and color charge fluctuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of confinement is connected with color charge. Unfortunately, the color charge densities in QCD, the Noether charge densities associated with the global color invariance, are not invariant under local color rotations. This implies that the expectation values of the net color charge in any region of any physical state in QCD, states that satisfy the color Gauss law, are automatically zero for all components of color. In this paper it is shown that the expectation value of the square of the net color charge in a region, a measure of the color charge fluctuations, is necessarily nonzero when evaluated in physical states and the result, while depending on the scheme and scale by which the theory is regulated, is gauge invariant. This holds despite the formal lack of gauge invariance of the operator. Moreover, there is a particular combination of the color charge fluctuations for the vacuum and for a system describable by a non-trivial density matrix that is independent that has a well-defined continuum limit</description>

      <title>Controlling Schwinger tunneling via engineering of virtual particle phases in vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An investigation into Schwinger pair production mechanisms is presented, demonstrating that vacuum tunneling processes can be effectively controlled through electromagnetic potential modulation while maintaining the strong ffelds in the interaction region. This challenges the conventional paradigm that attributes exclusive governance of Schwinger processes to localized ffeld intensities. Through comprehensive analysis of particle number, momentum spectra, and spatial distribution of created pairs, we establish that the observed modulation effects originate from electromagnetic potential - induced modiffcations to the quantum phase structure of virtual particles. This phenomenon reveals a profound connection between Schwinger tunneling dynamics and the geometric phase properties of the quantum vacuum state - a vacuum analogue to the Aharonov-Bohm effect in charged particle systems. This discovery not only advances our understanding of electromagnetic interactions in quantum vacuum but also opens up new experimental opportunities for realizing Schwinger tunneling processes with existing facilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study quantum phases of a fluid of mobile charged non-abelian anyons, which arise upon doping the lattice Moore-Read quantum Hall state at lattice filling $\nu = 1/2$ and its generalizations to the Read-Rezayi ($\mathrm{RR}_k$) sequence at $\nu = k/(k+2)$. In contrast to their abelian counterparts, non-abelian anyons present unique challenges due to their non-invertible fusion rules and non-abelian braiding structures. We address these challenges using a Chern-Simons-Ginzburg-Landau (CSGL) framework that incorporates the crucial effect of energy splitting between different anyon fusion channels at nonzero dopant density. For the Moore-Read state, we show that doping the charge $e/4$ non-abelion naturally leads to a fully gapped charge-$2$ superconductor without any coexisting topological order. The chiral central charge of the superconductor depends on details of the interactions determining the splitting of anyon fusion channels. For general $\mathrm{RR}_k$ states, our analysis of states obtained by doping the basic non-abelion $a_0$ with charge $e/(k+2)$ reveals a striking even/odd pattern in the Read-Rezayi index $k$. We develop a general physical picture for anyon-driven superconductivity based on charge-flux unbinding, and show how it relates to the CSGL description of doped abelian quantum Hall states. Finally, as a bonus, we use the CSGL formalism to describe transitions between the $\mathrm{RR}_k$ state and a trivial period-$(k+2)$ CDW insulator at fixed filling, driven by the gap closure of the fundamental non-abelian anyon $a_0$. Notably, for $k=2$, this predicts a period-4 CDW neighboring the Moore-Read state at half-filling, offering a potential explanation of recent numerical observations in models of twisted MoTe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Positivity in Perturbative Renormalization: an EFT $a$-theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the direction of renormalization in effective field theory is constrained by fundamental principles in the infrared$\unicode{x2014}$unitarity, analyticity, and Lorentz invariance. Our theorem, in the spirit of the $a$-theorem in conformal field theory, determines the sign of the one-loop running of couplings in the forward limit, when one inserts two operators whose mass dimensions are identical and even. The theorem holds for a broad class of effective field theories with arbitrary ultraviolet completions. The constraint directly applies to linear positivity bounds derived using tree-level amplitudes in the IR, providing a criterion for whether renormalization effects can preserve the positivity bounds, or lead to their apparent violation. We discuss the phenomenological implications of our theorem in chiral perturbation theory and the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, where our theorem is particularly constraining for the running at dimension eight. We provide several examples and show various extensions and applications even at dimension six.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field equations of pre-geometric theories of gravity are derived and analysed, both without and with matter. After the spontaneous symmetry breaking that reduces the gauge symmetry of these theories \`a la Yang-Mills, a metric structure for spacetime emerges and the field equations recover both the Einstein and the Cartan field equations for gravity. A first exact solution of the pre-geometric field equations is also presented. This solution can be considered as a pre-geometric de Sitter universe and provides a possible resolution for the problem of the Big Bang singularity.</description>

      <title>Direct Sum Structure of the Super Virasoro Algebra and a Fermion Algebra Arising from the Quantum Toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that the $q$-deformed Virasoro algebra can be constructed from a certain representation of the quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}_1$ algebra. In this paper, we apply the same construction to the quantum toroidal algebra of type $\mathfrak{gl}_2$ and study the properties of the resulting generators $W_i(z)$ ($i=1,2$). The algebra generated by $W_i(z)$ can be regarded as a $q$-deformation of the direct sum $\mathsf{F} \oplus \mathsf{SVir}$, where $\mathsf{F}$ denotes the free fermion algebra and $\mathsf{SVir}$ stands for the $N=1$ super Virasoro algebra, also referred to as the $N=1$ superconformal algebra or the Neveu-Schwarz-Ramond algebra. Moreover, we find that the generators $W_i(z)$ admit two screening currents, whose degeneration limits coincide with the screening currents of $\mathsf{SVir}$. We also establish the quadratic relations satisfied by the $W_i(z)$ and show that they generate a pair of commuting $q$-deformed Virasoro algebras, which degenerate into two nontrivial commuting Virasoro algebras included in $\mathsf{F} \oplus \mathsf{SVir}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has recently been proposed that the extra dimension in holographic models for charmoniun is related to its internal structure. Representing the interaction between the quark anti-quark pair by a string inside the background used in these models, the linear term of the Cornell potential was obtained. More than that, the dissociation in the thermal medium is also described in a consistent way. Here we extend this study to the case of a plasma with finite density. The combined effects of density and temperature are analyzed from the point of view of quark anti-quark interaction and the results obtained are consistent with the ones derived previously using spectral functions.</description>

      <title>Deep learning spinfoam vertex amplitudes: the Euclidean Barrett-Crane model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spinfoam theories propose a well-defined path-integral formulation for quantum gravity and are hoped to provide the dynamics of loop quantum gravity. However, it is computationally hard to calculate spinfoam amplitudes. The well-studied Euclidean Barrett-Crane model provides an excellent setting for testing analytical and numerical tools to probe spinfoam models. We explore a data-driven approach to accelerating spinfoam computations by showing that the vertex amplitude is an object that can be learned from data using deep learning. We divide the learning process into a classification and a regression task: Two networks are independently engineered to decide whether the amplitude is zero or not and to predict the precise numerical value, respectively. The trained networks are tested with several accuracy measures. The classifier in particular demonstrates robust generalisation far outside the training domain, while the regressor demonstrates high predictive accuracy in the domain it is trained on. We discuss limitations, possible improvements, and implications for future work.</description>

      <title>Generalization of Bohmian Mechanics and Quantum Gravity Effective Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the de Broglie-Bohm (dBB) formulation of quantum mechanics to the case of quantum gravity (QG) by using the effective action for a QG theory. This is done by replacing the dBB equations of motion with the effective action equations of motion, which is beneficial even in the non-gravitational case, since in this way one avoids the violations of the Heisenberg uncertainity relations and the absence of the classical trajectories for stationary bound states. Another advantage of the effective action formalism is that one can obtain the field configurations in the case of a quantum field theory (QFT). The proposed QG generalization is natural for Bohmiam mechanics because a dBB wavefunction is really a wavefunction of the Universe and in order to define the effective action for an arbitrary initial state one needs a QG path integral. The QG effective action can be constructed by using the piecewise flat quantum gravity (PFQG) theory and the PFQG effective action can be approximated by the QFT effective action for General Relativity coupled to matter, with a cutoff determined by the average edge length of the spacetime triangulation. One can then calculate the corresponding field configurations and from these field configurations one can obtain the trajectories for the corresponding elementary particles.</description>

      <title>Effective Field Theory of Superconductivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A field theory of a Schr\"{o}dinger type complex scalar field of Cooper pair, a U(1) gauge field of electromagnetism, and a neutral scalar field of gapless acoustic phonon is proposed for superconductivity of s-waves. Presence of the gapless neutral scalar field is justified as low energy residual acoustic phonon degrees in the context of effective field theory. The critical coupling of quartic self-interaction of complex scalar field is computed from a 1-loop level interaction balance between the repulsion mediated by massive degree of the U(1) gauge field and the attraction mediated by massive Higgs degree, in the static limit. The obtained net attraction or repulsion in perturbative regime matches the type I or II superconductivity, respectively. We find the new critical coupling of cubic Yukawa type interaction between the neutral and complex scalar fields from another tree level interaction balance between the Coulomb repulsion mediated by massless degree of the U(1) gauge field and the attraction mediated by the gapless neutral scalar field, in the static limit. Superconducting phase is realized at or in the vicinity of this critical coupling. A huge discrepancy between the propagation speeds of photon and phonon gives a plausible explanation on low critical temperatures in conventional superconductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Joyce structures are a class of geometric structures that first arose in relation to Donaldson-Thomas theory. There is a special class of examples, called class $S[A_1]$, whose underlying manifold parameterises Riemann surfaces of some fixed genus equipped with a meromorphic quadratic differential with poles of fixed orders. We study two Joyce structures of this type using the isomonodromic systems associated to the Painlev\'e II and III$_3$ equations. We give explicit formulae for the Pleba\'nski functions of these Joyce structures, and compute several associated objects, including their tau functions, which we explicitly relate to the corresponding Painlev\'e tau functions. We show that the behaviour of the Joyce structure near the zero-section can be studied analytically through poles of Painlev\'e equations. The systematic treatment gives a blueprint for the study of more general Joyce structures associated to meromorphic quadratic differentials on the Riemann sphere.</description>

Abstract: We present an analytical solution for the evolution of parton distributions incorporating mixed-order QCD $\otimes$ QED corrections, addressing both polarized and unpolarized cases. Using the Altarelli-Parisi kernels extended to mixed order, we solve the DGLAP equations exactly in Mellin $N$-space and derive the associated Wilson coefficients for the polarized structure function $g_1$. Our analytical approach not only improves computational efficiency but also enhances the precision of theoretical predictions relevant for current and future phenomenological applications.</description>

      <title>Cosmic strings and domain walls of the QCD quark condensate with and without a hidden axion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chiral quark condensate of QCD, which spontaneously breaks the anomalous axial symmetry, gives rise to axionic type global string-wall systems. If a Peccei-Quinn type axion exists in the theory, the axionic strings are in general accompanied by winding of the QCD quark condensate. Depending on the axion model the winding can proceed either in the $\eta'$ or in the pion direction. This determines the structure of fermionic zero modes and the anomaly inflow which has important astrophysical consequences. We point out that $\eta'$ and pion string-wall systems exist in pure QCD, independently of the hidden axion. Strikingly, even if a hidden axion exists, the early cosmology can be entirely dominated by string-wall systems formed by the QCD quark condensate. We also discuss their role in the QCD phase transition and in heavy-ion physics.</description>

Abstract: We revise the notion of the blobbed topological recursion by extending it to the setting of generalized topological recursion as well as allowing blobs which do not necessarily admit topological expansion. We show that the so-called non-perturbative differentials form a special case of this revisited version of blobbed topological recursion. Furthermore, we prove the KP integrability of the differentials of blobbed topological recursion for the input data that include KP-integrable blobs. This result generalizes, unifies, and gives a new proof of the KP integrability of nonperturbative differentials conjectured by Borot--Eynard and recently proved by the authors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a modification of the Starobinsky model in the form of an additional cubic Ricci scalar curvature term $\sim \alpha R^3$, scaled by a dimensionless parameter $\alpha$, with the resulting inflaton potential being the standard Starobinsky potential modified to first parametric order by an additive term. The resulting potential is identical to the potential obtained by a modification of the superpotential employed in the construction of the Starobinsky model in the framework of no-scale supergravity, thus, extending the correspondence between a class of no-scale supergravity models and modifications of the Starobinsky model. We analyze the inflationary predictions of the model and find that for $-4.2 \times 10^{-5} \lesssim \alpha \lesssim -1.9 \times 10^{-5}$, the modified Starobinsky model is in full agreement with the recent observational data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, for a range of $e$-folds, $N_\star = 50-60$.</description>

      <title>Consequences of non-minimal coupling for mass mixing in spontaneous baryogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of a non-minimal Yukawa-like coupling between curvature and inflaton field within the \emph{spontaneous baryogenesis} background. We demonstrate that this coupling leads to a significant enhancement in particle production, even for small values of the coupling constant $\xi$. Assuming a perfectly homogeneous and isotropic universe during the reheating phase, we study the inflaton decay into fermion-antifermion pairs by means of a semiclassical approach, treating fermions as quantized fields and considering the inflaton and the Ricci scalar as classical quantities. We adopt the simplest approach in which the inflaton is minimally coupled to baryons, and non-minimally with gravity. In particular, we solve the equations of motion for the inflaton to first order in perturbation theory, with $\xi$ serving as perturbative parameter. Afterwards, we compute the difference in the number densities of baryons and antibaryons produced through the inflaton decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. We show that the non-minimal coupling term \emph{de facto} increases inflaton mass, letting fermion-antifermion decays be more probable, and thus enhancing the overall baryogenesis process. As a further outcome, we find that the non-minimal Yukawa coupling also leads to a renormalization of the inflaton mass and weakly influences the bounds over the gravitational constant. Finally, since the fermionic fields appear not to be mass eigenstates, we specialize the mass-mixing between them only. To this end, we thus include the effects of mass-mixing and cosmic expansion into our calculations. Physical consequences of baryon production are therefore explored.</description>

      <title>Supermassive black hole in NGC 4649 (M60) with a dark matter halo: Impact on shadow measurements and thermodynamic properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate black hole (BH) solutions embedded in a dark matter (DM) halo, modeled as extensions of the Schwarzschild metric. The DM density profile is constrained by Hubble Space Telescope data, stellar dynamics, and globular cluster (GC) measurements of the elliptical galaxy NGC 4649 (M60). Using this profile, we construct two distinct spacetime solutions characterized by the black hole mass ($M$), critical velocity ($V_c$), and core radius ($a$), all reducing to the Schwarzschild case in the limit $V_c=0$ and $a=0$. Our results show that the DM halo modifies essential BH features, such as the event horizon radius and spacetime curvature, as reflected in the Kretschmann scalar. We also derive an approximate analytical expression for the BH shadow radius, which increases slightly due to the halo's influence. Comparisons with two observational datasets further validate the analysis. Thermodynamic properties are examined across the two models. In the first, a generalized Smarr formula is obtained via two additional variables, $\gamma$ and $a$. The second incorporates halo effects through $V_c=0$ and $a=0$. These results underscore the role of DM in shaping both geometric and thermodynamic aspects of BHs.</description>

Abstract: We propose a novel centrality definition-independent method for analyzing higher-order proton cumulants, specifically addressing the challenge of volume fluctuations that dominate in low-energy heavy-ion collisions. This method reconstructs particle number distributions using the Edgeworth expansion, with parameters optimized via a combination of differential evolution algorithm and Bayesian inference. Its effectiveness is validated using UrQMD model simulations and benchmarked against traditional approaches, including centrality definitions based on particle multiplicity. Our results show that the proposed framework yields cumulant patterns consistent with those obtained using number of participant nucleon ($N_{\text{part}}$) based centrality observables, while eliminating the conventional reliance on centrality determination. This consistency confirms the method's ability to extract genuine physical signals, thereby paving the way for probing the intrinsic thermodynamic properties of the produced medium through event-by-event fluctuations.</description>

      <title>The integrand form of infrared singularities of two-loop QCD scattering amplitudes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we express the singular part of a scattering amplitude in terms of Feynman integrals compatible with topologies appearing in the bare amplitude, and we choose a basis of locally finite Master Integrals. In two-loop massless QCD, we find such a representation of the amplitude singularities using a systematic ansatz reconstruction of the integrand from a predicted integrated form. As an example application, we write the finite part of an amplitude for the digluon production in quark annihilation for some helicity configurations as manifestly locally finite.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that in supersymmetric theories, knowing the soft theorem for a single particle in a supermultiplet allows one to immediately determine soft theorems for the remainder of the supermultiplet. While soft theorems in supersymmetric theories have a rich history, they have only been chronicled for specific examples due to the fact that they are usually derived with technical Feynman diagrammatics or amplitudes methods. By contrast, we show that one can compute soft theorems non-perturbatively for entire supermultiplets in one line of algebra. This formalism is directly applicable to the most general supersymmetric theory: one with an arbitrary matter content, number of supercharges, and spacetime dimension. We give many explicit examples illustrating the scope and dexterity of this framework.</description>

      <title>The spectrum of a quantum Lifshitz black hole in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15336v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the low-energy spectrum of a four-dimensional near-extremal black hole that arises as a solution to a low energy effective theory of heterotic string theory. The effective two-dimensional gravitational description exhibits features of Lifshitz symmetry, which break the usual $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ invariance down to $U(1)$. For this effective two-dimensional gravitational description, we derive a one-dimensional Schwarzian-like action that inherits the $U(1)$ symmetry. The Schwarzian-like description allows us to compute a logarithmic correction to the entropy through a saddle-point approximation of the two-dimensional partition function. This logarithmic correction modifies the density of states, lifting the delta-function divergence at extremality, and removes the exponential ground-state degeneracy seen in the semiclassical analysis. Furthermore, the prefactor of the logarithmic term is $\frac{1}{2}$, rather than $\frac{3}{2}$ found for the $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ invariant description, indeed reflecting having fewer symmetries.</description>

Abstract: Holomorphic modular bootstrap is an approach to classifying rational conformal field theories making use of the modular differential equations. In this paper we explore its flavored refinement. For a class of chiral algebras, we propose constraints on a special null state, which determine the structure of the algebra, and through flavored modular differential equations and quasi-modularity, completely fix the spectra in both the untwisted and twisted sector. Using the differential equations, we reveal hidden structures among null states of the chiral algebras under the modular group action and translation related to spectral flow.</description>

Abstract: We study $\frac{1}{4}$-BPS Wilson loops in four-dimensional SU$(N$) ${\mathcal{N}}=2$ super-Yang-Mills theories with conformal matter in an arbitrary representation $\mathcal{R}$. These operators are formed of two meridians on the two-sphere separated by an arbitrary opening angle. We conjecture that these observables are encoded in a modification of Pestun's matrix model. The matrix representation of these operators resembles that of the $\frac12$-BPS circular Wilson loop, differing only for a rescaling in the exponent. We compare the matrix model predictions with an explicit three-loop calculation in flat space based on standard Feynman-diagram techniques, finding perfect agreement. Finally, exploiting the matrix model representation of these Wilson loops, we study the large-$N$ limit at strong coupling of $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal QCD, finding a surprising transition in the vacuum expectation value for a critical opening angle.</description>

      <title>Mixed 't Hooft Anomalies and the Witten Effect for AdS Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a variety of BPS black holes in string theory, the supersymmetric index has provided a microscopic validation of the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. In the near-BPS limit, a gravitational path integral analysis previously revealed the semiclassical spectrum is modified, having a large extremal degeneracy (consistent with the index) and a mass gap up to a continuum of non-BPS black holes. Presently, we study examples in which these sharp features of the spectrum are altered due to the presence of anomalies in the form of $\vartheta$-angle terms in the action. These may appear generally, but we focus on near-BPS dyonic AdS$_4$ black holes in M-theory, dual to 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs of Class $R$ obtained by twisted compactification of $N$ wrapped M5 branes. Due to the Witten effect, the dyonic black holes receive quantum corrections to their charges, and when $\vartheta = \pi$ one may find a mixed `t Hooft anomaly between the $U(1)_R$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ time reversal symmetries. Using results from $\mathcal{N}=2$ JT supergravity, we find these effects result in a spectrum in which both the gap and index are reduced, and may even vanish. Surprisingly, for $\vartheta \rightarrow \pi$, neither the Bekenstein-Hawking formula nor the index correctly account for the extremal degeneracies.</description>

      <title>The spectrum of near-BPS Kerr-Newman black holes and the ABJM mass gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supersymmetric rotating 1/16-BPS black holes in $AdS_4 \times S^7$ are expected to capture the average degeneracy of BPS states in the dual ABJM superconformal theory for given fixed charges. This has been successfully demonstrated for the superconformal index using complexified black hole metrics, but a naive Gibbons-Hawking calculation of the actual degeneracies in the low temperature limit is invalid due to large quantum fluctuations of the near horizon $AdS_2$ metric. We argue that in a particular mixed grand/canonical ensemble, these fluctuations of the near-BPS Kerr-Newman black holes are described by a version of the $\mathcal{N}=2$ super-Schwarzian theory with $SU(1,1|1)$ symmetry. Using this description as well as properties of ABJM, we recover the large $N$ superconformal index and find a characteristic ``mass gap'' of order $N^{-3/2}$ between the 1/16-BPS states and the lightest near BPS state. We further make a prediction for the operator dimension spectrum above the gap in the large $N$, low $T$ limit. Our results are consistent with the Bekenstein-Hawking formula at large energies, random matrix theory at low energies, and the microscopic index.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the celestial CFT dual to theories with bulk supersymmetry. The boundary theory realizes supersymmetry in the spirit of the Green-Schwarz superstring: there is manifest 4d super-Poincar\'e symmetry, but no 2d superconformal symmetry. Nevertheless, we can extend the celestial sphere itself to a supermanifold -- the celestial supersphere. This provides a unified framework for describing key features of celestial holography, including conformally soft theorems, OPEs, and chiral soft algebras. Using these tools, we demonstrate that the $\frak{bms}_{4}$ algebra extends to a novel $\frak{sbms}_{4|\mathcal{N}}$ algebra. We also relate the supersymmetric $L(w_{1+\infty}^\wedge)$ algebra to Hamiltonian vector fields on $\mathbb{C}^{2|\mathcal{N}}$, consistent with the expectation from twistor theory, and deduce the deformation of this algebra by a cosmological constant, $\Lambda$. These results are all universal and independent of the specific details of the underlying theory.</description>

Abstract: We numerically investigate the Araki-Uhlmann relative entropy in Quantum Field Theory, focusing on a free massive scalar field in 1+1-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. Using Tomita-Takesaki modular theory, we analyze the relative entropy between a coherent state and the vacuum state, with several types of test functions localized in the right Rindler wedge. Our results confirm that relative entropy decreases with increasing mass and grows with the size of the spacetime region, aligning with theoretical expectations.</description>

Abstract: Two modern programs involving analogies between general relativity and electromagnetism, gravito-electromagnetism (GEM) and the classical double copy (CDC), induce electromagnetic potentials from specific classes of spacetime metrics. We demonstrate such electromagnetic potentials are typically gauge equivalent to Killing vectors present in the spacetime, long known themselves to be analogous to electromagnetic potentials. We utilize this perspective to relate the Type D Weyl double copy to the Kerr-Schild double copy without appealing to specific coordinates. We analyze the typical assumptions taken within Kerr-Schild double copies, emphasizing the role Killing vectors play in the construction. The basis of the GEM program utilizes comparisons of tidal tensors between GR and EM; we perform a more detailed analysis of conditions necessary for equivalent tidal tensors between the theories, and note they require the same source prescription as the classical double copy. We discuss how these Killing vector potentials relate to the Weyl double copy, in particular there must a relation between the field strength formed from the Killing vector and the Weyl tensor. We consider spacetimes admitting a Killing-Yano tensor which provide a particularly insightful example of this correspondence. This includes a broad class of spacetimes, and provides an explanation for observations regarding the splitting of the Weyl tensor noted when including sources.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of effective actions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the same quantum field theory distinct effective actions can be obtained by coupling sources to different choices of field variables. This is the same as considering effective actions for theories related by a change of variables and thus differ only by the values of so called inessential couplings. The effective actions will appear quite different since they generate correlation functions of different operators. Here we show that the effective actions are related by an implicit change of variables of the mean field, i.e. the argument of the effective action. Conversely, one can go the other way: by making a change of variables of the mean variable we obtain a new effective action which generates correlation functions of an implicitly defined composite field. The existence of the implicit transformations in both cases rests on the existence of solutions to initial value problems where the ``time'' parameter is an inessential coupling. Non-perturbatively the solutions may only exist for some non-zero amount of this time. However, at each order in perturbation theory one obtains linear equations which implies that unique solutions exist. We then show that scattering amplitudes are independent of inessential couplings without use of perturbation theory. For gauge theories we expect our correspondence to extend to effective actions which differ by a choice of gauge.</description>

      <title>Loop Hori Formulae for T-duality and Twisted Bismut-Chern Character</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main purpose of this paper is to establish the loop space formulation of T-duality in the presence of background flux. In particular, we construct a loop space analogue of the Hori formula, termed \textbf{the loop Hori map}, and demonstrate that it induces a quasi-isomorphism between the exotic twisted equivariant cohomologies on the free loop spaces of the T-dual sides. Spacetime, when viewed as the constant loops, is a submanifold of loop space. The duality that we prove on loop space restricts to the T-duality with $H$-flux on spacetime. This significantly refines the earlier work of the authors in 2015 where T-duality was established after localisation to the base space. The construction of the loop Hori map is an application of our generalization of the Bismut--Chern character in 2015, originally introduced in the loop space interpretation of the Atiyah--Singer index theorem by Atiyah--Witten and Bismut.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The helicity operator of massless particles has only two polarisations like it takes place for photons and gravitons. For them not all of the 2s+1 spin magnetic quantum states exist, with two exceptions, and the spin operator ceases to be defined properly and consistently. The problem was solved by Schwinger, who introduced non-commutative space coordinates that completely eliminate the spin operator and ensure that only helicity operator appears explicitly. We further investigate the violation of the associativity relation of the momentum translation operator that emerges due to the failure of the corresponding Jacobi identity. The associativity relation is broken by a phase factor which satisfies a 3-cocycle relation. The associativity is restored when a 3-cocycle is an integer number, and leads to the quantisation of massless particle's helicity. We discuss the correspondence (duality) between the helicity and the Dirac quantisation conditions. The relation for the minimal space cell volume, similar to the minimal phase-space cell of Heisenberg is suggested.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: These proceedings are based on the author's invited talk reviewing the original published work [1,2] of the author with collaborators. The subject matter is a new, covariant and efficient technology of constructing entire trajectories of physical string states deeper inside the string spectrum than the leading Regge. The key observation behind the technology is that the lowering operators of a symplectic algebra appear in the Virasoro constraints which impose physicality of states in the open bosonic string. This algebra commutes with the spacetime Lorentz algebra, (of the little group) of which all string states are irreducible representations. Employing then the so-called Howe duality of representation theory, one may relate the irreducible representations of the two algebras via a bijection. The spectrum thus splits into two parts: trajectories that are lowest weight states of the symplectic algebra and their infinitely many clones. The latter can then be reached by suitably dressing the former with the raising operators of the symplectic algebra. The technology is nontrivially extended to the open superstring, where the relevant Howe dual is an orthosymplectic algebra.</description>

Abstract: Under reasonable assumptions, black holes have been argued to form firewalls, burning up anything crossing their horizons. This argument finds that a firewall would appear very late in a black hole's lifetime, when Hawking radiation has caused the horizon to shrink to one-half its original area. For stellar-mass black holes, this process surpasses the universe's current age and so no such black hole would currently possess a firewall. However, black holes have recently been conjectured to scramble their interior degrees-of-freedom, with a scrambling time scale comparable to the time it takes light to travel a Schwartzschild radius' distance. We prove that local observers will already experience a firewall from the scrambling time onwards after the black hole's formation. Here `local' means that the observer couples to fewer than one-half the black hole's total interior `qubits.' Indeed, for observers to fail to be local in this manner, it would mean that they couple to more `qubits' within such black holes than exist in all the stars of the observable universe. Therefore we find that if black holes are indeed fast scramblers, then every astrophysical black hole in the universe will already have a fully developed firewall for any local physical process.</description>

      <title>Light rings on stationary axisymmetric spacetimes: blind to the topology and able to coexist</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05495v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been established that Black Hole (BH) spacetimes obeying some general set of assumptions always possess, at least, one light ring (per rotation sense) [arXiv:2003.06445]. This theorem was originally established for asymptotically flat, stationary, axial symmetric, 1+3 dimensional circular spacetimes harbouring a non-extremal and topologically spherical Killing horizon. Following the mantra that a theorem is only as strong as its assumptions in this work we extend this theorem to non topologically spherical (toroidal) BHs and to spacetimes harbouring more than one BH. As in [arXiv:2003.06445], we show that each BH still contributes with, at least, one LR (per rotation sense).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to study the geometry underlying mechanics and its application to describe autonomous and nonautonomous conservative dynamical systems of different types; as well as dissipative dynamical systems. We use different geometric descriptions to study the main properties and characteristics of these systems; such as their Lagrangian, Hamiltonian and unified formalisms, their symmetries, the variational principles, and others. The study is done mainly for the regular case, although some comments and explanations about singular systems are also included.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Planck Luminosity Bound in Quantum Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, we introduced a non-perturbative quantization of impulsive gravitational null initial data. In this note, we investigate an immediate physical implication of the model. One of the quantum numbers is the total luminosity carried to infinity. We show that a transition happens when the luminosity reaches the Planck power $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{P}}$. Below $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{P}}$, the spectrum of the radiated power is discrete. Above the Planck power, the spectrum is continuous and contains caustics that can spoil the semi-classical interpretation of the resulting quantum states of geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10742v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultralight bosons can condense to form the so-called bosonic clouds around spinning black holes by superradiance instability. When quantum effects are taken into account, the classical black holes were replaced by exotic compact objects including area quantized black holes. In this work, we consider the superradiant instabilities of massive scalar fields around area quantized Kerr black hole. We introduce the reflectivity of area quantized black hole possesses the distinct discrete feature, and the scalar fields have the superradiant modes solution only within the specific mass range. In addition, the area quantization may terminate the superradiance when the black hole spins down, or even suppress the formation of the bosionic cloud.</description>

      <title>Exact Spin Correlators of Integrable Quantum Circuits from Algebraic Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the correlation functions of strings of spin operators for integrable quantum circuits exactly. These observables can be used for calibration of quantum simulation platforms. We use algebraic Bethe Ansatz, in combination with computational algebraic geometry to obtain analytic results for medium-size (around 10-20 qubits) quantum circuits. The results are rational functions of the quantum circuit parameters. We obtain analytic results for such correlation functions both in the real space and Fourier space. In the real space, we analyze the short time and long time limit of the correlation functions. In Fourier space, we obtain analytic results in different parameter regimes, which exhibit qualitatively different behaviors. Using these analytic results, one can easily generate numerical data to arbitrary precision.</description>

      <title>Skyrmion-vortex hybrid and spin wave solutions in superconducting ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The coexistence of Ferromagnetism and superconductivity in so called ferromagnetic superconductors is an intriguing phenomenon which may lead to novel physical effects as well as applications. Here in this work we have explored the interplay of topological excitations, namely vortices and skyrmions, in ferromagnetic superconductors using a field theoretic description of such systems. In particular, numerical solutions for the continuous spin field compatible to a given vortex profile are determined in absence and presence of a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) term. The solutions show that the spin configuration is like a skyrmion but intertwined with the vortex structure -- the radius of the the skyrmion-like solution depends on the penetration depth and also the polarity of the skyrmion depends on the sign of the winding number. Thus our solution describes a novel topological structure -- namely a skyrmion-vortex composite. We have also determined the spin wave solutions in such systems in presence and absence of a vortex. In absence of vortex frequency and wave vector satisfy a cubic equation which leads to various interesting features. In particular, we have shown that in the low frequency regime the minimum in dispersion relation shifts from $k=0$ to a non zero $k$ value depending on the parameters. We also discuss the nature of spin wave dispersion in the $\omega \sim \Tilde{m}$ regime which shows a similar pattern in the dispersion curve. The group velocity of the spin wave would change it's sign across such a minimum which is unique to FMSC. Also, the spin wave modes around the local minimum looks like roton mode in superfluid and hence called a magnetic roton. In presence of a vortex, the spin wave amplitude is shown to vary spatially such that the profile looks like that of a N\'eel Skyrmion. Possible experimental signature of both solutions are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Signatures of linearized gravity in atom interferometers: A simplified computational framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a general framework for calculating the leading-order, general relativistic contributions to the gravitational phase shift in single-photon atom interferometers within the context of linearized gravity. We show that the atom gradiometer observable, which only depends on the atom interferometer propagation phase, can be written in terms of three distinct contributions: the Doppler phase shift, which accounts for the tidal displacement of atoms along the baseline, the Shapiro phase shift, which accounts for the delay in the arrival time of photons at atom-light interaction points, and the Einstein phase shift, which accounts for the gravitational redshift measured by the atoms. For specific atom gradiometer configurations, we derive the signal and response functions for two physically motivated scenarios: (i) transient gravitational waves in the transverse-traceless gauge and, for the first time, in the proper detector frame, and (ii) transient massive objects sourcing weak and slow-varying Newtonian potentials. We find that the Doppler contribution of realistic Newtonian noise sources (e.g., a freight truck or a piece of space debris) at proposed atom gradiometer experiments, such as AION, MAGIS and AEDGE, can exceed the shot noise level and thus affect physics searches if not properly subtracted.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05693v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we explore the $f(Q,T_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu \nu})$ gravity theory, building upon the foundations laid by the $f(Q)$ and $f(Q,T)$ gravity theories. Here, $Q$ represents non-metricity and $T_{\mu\nu}$ stands for the energy-momentum tensor. The proposed action encompasses an arbitrary function of both non-metricity $Q$ and the square of the energy-momentum tensor, specifically $T^2=T_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu \nu}$. We find the analytical solution for the barotropic fluid case $p=\omega \rho$ for the model $f(Q, T_{\mu \nu}T^{\mu \nu}) = Q + \eta(T_{\mu \nu}T^{\mu \nu}) $. We constrain parameters of the solution $H(z)$ utilizing CC, BAO, and latest Pantheon+SH0ES samples with the help of Monte Carlo Markov Chain sampling technique along with Bayesian statistical analysis. Further, from the Om diagnostic test, we find that the assumed cosmological model favors the quintessence regime.</description>

      <title>An Explicit Categorical Construction of Instanton Density in Lattice Yang-Mills Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07195v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the inception of lattice QCD, a natural definition for the Yang-Mills instanton on lattice has been long sought for. In a recent work, one of authors showed the natural solution has to be organized in terms of bundle gerbes in higher homotopy theory / higher category theory, and introduced the principles for such a categorical construction. To pave the way towards actual numerical implementation in the near future, nonetheless, an explicit construction is necessary. In this paper we provide such an explicit construction for $SU(2)$ gauge theory, with technical aspects inspired by L\"{u}scher's 1982 geometrical construction. We will see how the latter is in a suitable sense a saddle point approximation to the full categorical construction. The generalization to $SU(N)$ will be discussed. The construction also allows for a natural definition of lattice Chern-Simons-Yang-Mills theory in three spacetime dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following the recently proposed stable and causal first-order relativistic hydrodynamics by Bemfica, Disconzi, and Noronha, we find the heat flow equation in the presence of gravity for a non-viscous fluid, which suffers heat dissipation. The derivation is confined to static and stationary backgrounds. We find that in the presence of gravity, the heat flux times a redshift factor is conserved. Then for radial heat flow, the temperature profiles are obtained from the heat equation when the gravity is sourced by Schwarzschild, Schwarzschild-dS, Kerr and Kerr-dS black holes, respectively. Consequently, the chemical potential profile is also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Core-collapse supernovae (SNe) provide a unique environment to study Feebly Interacting Particles (FIPs) such as Axion-Like Particles (ALPs), sterile neutrinos, and Dark Photons (DPs). This paper focuses on heavy FIPs produced in SNe, whose decay produces electrons and positrons, generating observable secondary signals during their propagation and annihilation. We focus on the In-flight Annihilation (IA) of positrons, which emerge as the most significant contribution to the resulting gamma-ray spectrum. Using data from COMPTEL and EGRET we derive the most stringent bounds on the FIP-electron couplings for heavy ALPs, sterile neutrinos, and DPs. These results strenghten existing bounds of one or two orders of magnitude, depending on the FIP model.</description>

      <title>Damped photonic modes in helical graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the behavior of spin-1 vector bosons in helical spacetime, focusing on photonic modes in helical graphene structures. We model the helical graphene surface as a smooth, continuous, and distortion-free manifold, effectively adopting the continuum approximation. By solving the fully covariant vector boson equation, we derive exact solutions that describe the quantum states of photons in a curved helical background, revealing their energy spectra, mode profiles, and decay dynamics. We find that the decay times of damped photonic modes range from \(10^{-16}\) to \(10^{-13}\) seconds as the helical pitch (\(a\)) varies from \(10^3\) nanometers to \(1\) nanometer, indicating that the structure efficiently absorbs all photonic modes. Additionally, the probability density functions exhibit time dependence, complementing their spatial variation. These findings provide a foundation for the design of ultrafast graphene photodetectors, graphene photodevices for high-speed optical communications, advanced photonic devices, and quantum materials based on helical graphene for various nanophotonic applications.</description>

      <title>Critical Behaviour in the Single Flavor Thirring Model in 2+1$d$ with Wilson Kernel Domain Wall Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present results of a lattice field theory simulation of the 2+1$d$ Thirring model with $N=1$ fermion flavors, using domain wall fermions. The model exhibits a U(2) symmetry-breaking phase transition with the potential to define a UV-stable renormalisation group fixed point. The novelty is the replacement of the Shamir kernel used in all previous work with the Wilson kernel, improving the action particularly with respect to the $L_s\to\infty$ limit needed to recover U(2), now under much better control. Auxiliary field ensembles generated on $16^3\times24$ with varying self-interaction strength $g^2$ and bare mass $m$ are used to measure the bilinear condensate order parameter $\langle\bar\psi i\gamma_3\psi\rangle$ with domain wall separations as large as $L_s=120$. The resulting $L_s\to\infty$ extrapolation is used to fit an empirical equation of state modelling spontaneous symmetry breaking as $m\to0$. The fit is remarkably stable and compelling, with the fitted critical exponents $\beta_m\simeq2.4$, $\delta\simeq1.3$ differing markedly from previous estimates. The associated susceptibility exhibits a mass hierarchy in line with physical expectations, again unlike previous estimates. Schwinger-Dyson equation (SDE) solutions of the Thirring model exploiting a hidden local symmetry in the action are reviewed, and analytic predictions presented for the exponents. In contrast to all previous lattice studies, the universal characteristics of the critical point revealed qualitatively resemble the SDE predictions.</description>

      <title>Twist-Induced Effects on Weyl Pairs in Magnetized Graphene Nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an analytical investigation into the dynamics of Weyl pairs within magnetized helicoidal graphene nanoribbons. By embedding a curved surface into flat Minkowski space-time, we derive a fully covariant two-body Dirac equation specific to this system. We begin by formulating a non-perturbative wave equation that governs the relative motion of the Weyl pairs and obtain exact solutions. Our results demonstrate the influence of the uniform magnetic field and the number of twists on the dynamics of Weyl pairs in graphene nanoribbons, providing precise energy values that lay a robust foundation for future research. Furthermore, we examine the material's response to perturbation fields by calculating the polarization function and investigating how twisting and magnetic fields affect this response. Our findings indicate that, in principle, the material's properties, which are crucial for practical applications, can be effectively controlled by precisely tuning the magnetic field and the number of twists in graphene nanoribbons.</description>

      <title>Three-local Conserved Charge Implies Quantum Integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17773v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown that the conservation of a local charge supported by three neighboring sites, or its local version, Reshetikhin's condition, suffices to guarantee the existence of all higher conserved charges and hence the integrability of a quantum spin chain. This establishes Grabowski and Mathieu's long-standing conjecture as a theorem, ending the folklore that the existence of higher conserved charges imposes additional constraints not implied by the conservation of the three-local charge.</description>

      <title>On a lower-dimensional Killing vector origin of irreducible Killing tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Considering a spacetime foliated by co-dimension-2 hypersurfaces, we find the conditions under which lower-dimensional symmetries of a base space can be lifted up to irreducible Killing tensors of the full spacetime. In this construction, the key ingredient for irreducibility is the non-commutativity of the underlying Killing vectors. It gives rise to a tower of growing rank Killing tensors determined by the structure constants of the corresponding Lie algebra. A canonical example of a metric with such emergent non-trivial hidden symmetries in all dimensions is provided by rotating (off-shell) generalized Lense-Thirring spacetimes, where the irreducible Killing tensors arise from the underlying spherical symmetry of the base space. A physical on-shell realization of this construction in four dimensions is embodied by a rotating black hole in the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion theory. Further examples of equal spinning Myers-Perry spacetimes and spacetimes built on planar and Taub-NUT base metrics are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Lattice points in polytope boundaries and formal geometric quantization of singular Calabi Yau hypersurfaces in toric varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the number of lattice points in the boundary of a positive integer dilate of a Delzant integral polytope is a polynomial in the dilation parameter, analogous to the Ehrhart polynomial giving the number of lattice points in a lattice polytope. We give an explicit formula for this polynomial, analogous to the formula of Khovanskii-Pukhlikov for the Ehrhart polynomial. These counting polynomials satisfy a lacunarity principle, the vanishing of alternate coefficients, quite unlike the Ehrhart polynomial. We show that formal geometric quantization of singular Calabi Yau hypersurfaces in smooth toric varieties gives this polynomial, in analogy with the relation of the Khovanskii-Pukhlikov formula to the geometric quantization of toric varieties. The Atiyah-Singer theorem for the index of the Dirac operator gives a moral argument for the lacunarity of the counting polynomial. We conjecture that similar formulas should hold for arbitrary simple integral polytope boundaries.</description>
