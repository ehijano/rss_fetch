      <title>Doped moir\'e magnets: renormalized flat bands and excitonic phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the phase diagram of a twisted bilayer of strongly interacting electrons on a honeycomb lattice close to half-filling using the slave boson mean-field theory. Our analysis indicates that a variety of new phases can be realized as a function of chemical doping and twist angle. In particular, we find a non-magnetic excitonic insulating phase that breaks the translational symmetry of the underlying moir\'e pattern. This phase results from the interplay of strong Coulomb interactions and the twist angle. In addition, we show that the features of the renormalized dispersion such as the magic angles depend significantly on the interactions. Our results highlight the rich physics arising in doped moir\'e superlattices of Mott insulators.</description>

      <title>Magnetization Plateaus in the Two-dimensional S = 1/2 Heisenberg Model with a 3$\times$3 Checkerboard Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the S=1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model with a 3$\times$3 checkerboard lattice structure in a longitudinal magnetic field. By using the stochastic series expansion quantum Monte Carlo (SSE-QMC) method, we obtain the properties of the non-plateau XY phase, 1/9, 3/9, 5/9, 7/9 magnetization plateau phases, and fully polarized phase. Then, we determine the precise phase transition critical points belonging to the 3D XY universality class through finite-size scaling. Moreover, we study the longitudinal and transverse dynamic spin structure factors of this model in different phases. For the non-plateau XY phase, the energy spectra present a gap between the low-energy gapless branch and the high-energy part under the competition of magnetic field and interaction. The gapless branch can be described by the spin wave theory in the canted antiferromagnetic phase of the effective "block spin" model. In the magnetization plateau phase, we identify that the excitation arises from localized disturbances within the sublattice, which are capable of spreading in momentum space. This study offers theoretical insights and interpretations for the characteristics of the ground state and the inelastic neutron scattering spectrum in two-dimensional quantum magnetic materials. Specifically, it focuses on materials with a checkerboard unit cell structure and odd-spin configurations under the influence of a longitudinal magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Correlation Effects in a Simplified Bilayer Two-Orbital Hubbard Model at Half Filling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent findings indicating high-temperature superconductivity in bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressures, we employ projective formalism of determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations to explore the ground-state phase diagram and correlation effects using a simplified bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model at half filling. Our numerical results reveal the instability of the metallic phase under weak on-site Hubbard $U$, leading to the emergence of a nonmagnetic weakly insulating phase without breaking any symmetry. As the $U$ increases, an antiferromagnetic Mott insulating phase emerges when the ratio $U/t_1^x$ exceeds approximately 4.15. This magnetic phase transition belongs to the 3D O(3) Heisenberg universality class. Furthermore, using analytical continuation, we explore the dynamical properties, such as the single-particle spectral function and dynamical spin structure factor, pertinent to experimental investigations. Our numerical results can help to understand the strong correlation effects within La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</description>

      <title>Competing quantum effects in spin crossover chains: spin-orbit coupling, magnetic exchange, and elastic interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive and study a model of square planar, d8 spin crossover materials that treats elastic, magnetic and spin-orbit interactions on an equal footing. For 1D chains density matrix renormalization group calculations show that the competition between these interactions leads to six different phases. For weak spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and large antiferromagnetic interactions we find a symmetry protected topological (SPT) Haldane phase. This is equivalent to the Haldane-large-D phase transition driven by single ion anisotropy(D) in the spin-one Heisenberg model. For strong SOC the Sz=+-1 HS states are high-energy excitations. Thus, the system can be understood as a transverse field Ising model with the SOC playing the role of the transverse field. Consistent with this, we find a quantum phase transition between the THS phase and a quantum disordered (QD) phase. However, if the magnetic coupling is non-zero or the HS and LS states of a single molecule are non-degenerate the Z2 (Ising) symmetry is broken and the phase transition becomes a crossover. Thus, the QD phase and the THS phases are adiabatically connected, as, equivalently, are the large-D phase of the spin-one Heisenberg model and the quantum disordered phase of the transverse field Ising model. We also find a ferroelastic LS phase, and antierroelastic phase, with alternating HS and LS complexes, and a dimer phase, which results from the competition between antiferromagnetic and antiferroelastic interactions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A tight-binding model for $e_g$ orbitals on a simple cubic lattice with finite thickness is investigated. The hopping integrals for nearest-neighboring sites are considered. We examine the electronic band structures for systems with (001), (110), and (111) surfaces. Electronic states well localized around the surfaces are found for the (110) and (111) surfaces. In particular, the surface state is flat and extends in the entire Brillouin zone for the (111) surface, provided the bulk band projected onto the surface Brillouin zone is gapped. We also find that these surface states possess octupole moments in both the (110) and (111) surface cases.</description>

      <title>Unusual strong ferromagnetism in site-ordered cubic Laves phase compound LuInCo$_4$ with Co-pyrochlore lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have successfully synthesized single crystals of the site-ordered cubic (C15b) Laves phase compound LuInCo$_4$ with the Co-pyrochlore sublattice for the first time. LuInCo$_4$ undergoes a ferromagnetic transition at 306 K and has a saturation moment of 3.43 $\mu_{\rm{B}}$/f.u. at 5 K. The strongly ferromagnetic nature was verified by DFT calculations, suggesting that Co-3$d$ flat bands near the Fermi level induce the spin polarization. The magnetization is isotropic above $\sim$100 K, saturates most easily in the [100] direction at low temperatures. In this anisotropic ferromagnetic state, the magnetization undergoes a metamagnetic transition in the [111] direction. Our results suggest that LuInCo$_4$ is a new strong but unusual itinerant electron ferromagnet, which deserves further study as a pyrochlore metal.</description>

      <title>Kondo spectral functions at low-temperatures: A dynamical-exchange-correlation-field perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the low-temperature spectral function of the symmetric single impurity Anderson model using a recently proposed dynamical exchange-correlation (xc) field formalism. The xc field, coupled to the one-particle Green's function, is obtained through analytic analysis and numerical extrapolation based on finite clusters. In the Kondo regime, the xc field consists of a complex constant term and a main quasiparticle-like oscillation term. The constant term represents the Hubbard side-band contribution, containing a bath-induced broadening effect, while the quasiparticle-like term is related to the Kondo resonance peak at low-temperature. We illustrate these features in terms of analytical and numerical calculations for small and medium-size finite clusters, and in the thermodynamic limit. The results indicate that the xc field formalism provides a good trade-off between accuracy and complexity in solving impurity problems. Consequently, it can significantly reduce the complexity of the many-body problem faced by first-principles approaches to strongly correlated materials.</description>

      <title>Quantum Phase Transitions in 2D--dimensional paramagnetic half--filled Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum phase transitions in strongly correlated electronic systems at $T=0^0K$ by the example of the 2D Hubbard model. The model for numerical calculations were formalized in terms of the integral equations previously obtained for the half--filled paramagnetic Hubbard model by means of the variational derivatives technique and subsequent Legendre transformation. For principal results we submit in series the momentum distribution functions $n(k)$ which display distinct attributes for the incipient regimes: the pure doublon phase, the metal phase, Weyl semimetal phase, and Weyl excitonic insulator phase at the sequential increasing the onsite Coulomb interaction $U$.</description>

      <title>Enormous enhancement of resistivity in nanostructured electron-phonon systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments on nanoclusters of silver (Ag) embedded in a gold (Au) matrix reveal a huge increase in both the zero temperature resistivity and the coefficient of the ``$T$ linear'' thermal resistivity with increasing volume fraction of Ag. A fraction $f \sim 50\%$ of Ag leads to a factor of $20$ increase in the residual resistivity, and a $40$ fold enhancement in the coefficient of linear $T$ resistivity, with respect to Au. Since Au and Ag both have weak electron-phonon coupling we surmise that the huge enhancements arise from a moderately large electron-phonon coupling that may emerge at the Ag-Au interface. We construct nanocluster configurations for varying $f$ in two dimensions, define a Holstein model on it with weak coupling on the `interior' sites and a strong coupling on the interfacial sites, and solve the model through exact diagonalisation based Langevin dynamics. Computing the resistivity, we observe a large $T=0$ increase with $f$ and also a linear $T$ enhancement factor of $\sim 30$. While the enhancement factors are parameter choice dependent, our key qualitative result is that the interface physics is inhomogeneous, with widely varying distortions, and different segments of the interface dictate the residual resistivity and the thermal scattering.</description>

      <title>Information Scrambling in Bosonic Gaussian Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that randomness in quadratic Hamiltonians for multimode bosonic systems results in certain information scrambling diagnostics, mirroring those seen in chaotic systems. Specifically, considering initial Gaussian states, we observe the disappearance of the memory effect in entanglement dynamics and the negative value of tripartite mutual information. However, in contrast to chaotic systems, we find that the spectral form factor exhibits a non-linear ramp and the out-of-time-ordered correlators display a power law growth. These results show that information scrambling, associated with randomness, is a distinct feature from quantum chaos. Moreover, our results provide insight into the dynamics of Gaussian states of continuous-variable systems that are useful and available resources for quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Sr4Os3O12- A Layered Osmate (V,VI) that is Magnetic close to Room Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black crystals of the mixed-valence osmate(V,VI) Sr4Os3O12 were grown via a gas phase reaction in an evacuated silica tube. The material is attracted to a permanent magnet at room temperature (295 K) but loses this property when heated or cooled. In this temperature interval, soft magnetic behavior with vanishing coercivity is observed, but the saturation magnetization is only 0.05 MuB per formula unit. Resistivity measurements show that Sr4Os3O12 is a semiconductor with a small band gap of about 0.26 eV at room temperature. X-ray diffraction on a single-crystal revealed a rhombohedral structure with the space group R-3m and lattice parameters ar = 554.64(2) pm and cr = 2700.1(1) pm at 300(1) K. The compound crystallizes in the La4Ti3O12 structure type and is isostructural to Sr4CoRe2O12. The structure is a rhombohedral stack of layered blocks, each of which can be considered as a section of three layers of the cubic perovskite structure cut perpendicular to one of its threefold axes. The Os-O-Os bond angle of about 175{/deg} favors superexchange that leads to antiferromagnetic coupling between the osmium atoms with 5d3 and 5d2 configurations. Sr4Os3O12 exhibits strong lattice dynamics. One aspect is the antiferro-rotative lattice modes of the corner-sharing [OsO6] octahedra, which freeze upon cooling. At 100 K, an ordered, yet twinned triclinic superstructure is formed. Strong spin-orbit coupling and other effects cause deformations of the [OsO6] octahedra that differ significantly at 300 K and 100 K, suggesting a change in the electronic configuration. Competing ground states could also explain the temperature dependent band gap and the magnetic fluctuations manifested in the magnetization peak at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetry breaking in SYK and the black hole spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spectrum and dynamics of near-extremal black holes are strongly modified by quantum effects at low temperatures. When the extremal limit does not preserve any supersymmetry, the density of states goes to zero at extremality and no extremal black holes remain. However, when the extremal limit is supersymmetric, a large microscopic degeneracy survives and there is a gap to the first excited black hole visible from gravity. In this article we study large $N$ quantum mechanical models where supersymmetry is explicitly broken, allowing us to interpolate between these two qualitatively different pictures. We propose and analyze deformations of $\mathcal{N}=2$ SYK models with such a pattern of (super)symmetry breaking which violates the $U(1)$ $R$-symmetry. These models feature a lifting of the BPS degeneracy and a closing of the spectral gap, and we further show that the large $N$ soft effective action is given by a modification of the $\mathcal{N}=2$ Schwarzian theory in which the $U(1)_R$ mode becomes massive.</description>

      <title>Dissipation and Interaction-Controlled Non-Hermitian Skin Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian skin effects (NHSEs) have recently been investigated extensively at the single-particle level. When many-body interactions become dominant, novel non-Hermitian physical phenomena can emerge. In this work, we theoretically study NHSEs controlled by dissipation and interaction. We consider a 1D zigzag Bose-Hubbard lattice, subject to magnetic flux, staggered onsite single-particle loss, and uniform onsite two-particle loss. When the two-particle loss is small, two-body bound eigenstates (i.e., doublons) are all localized at the same boundary due to the interplay of the magnetic flux and staggered single-particle loss. While, for strong two-particle loss, the localization direction of doublons is unexpectedly reversed. This is attributed to the effective strong nonreciprocal hopping of doublons induced by the virtual second-order and third-order hopping processes of particle pairs with the combination of the magnetic flux, staggered single-particle loss, and strong two-particle loss. Moreover, a two-particle gain can induce the same skin-localization and reversal features of doublons, which can be utilized to dynamically observe the NHSE and its reversal of doublons controlled by interactions. Our results open up a new avenue for exploring novel non-Hermitian phenomena in many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Commensurate and Incommensurate Chern Insulators in Magic-angle Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between strong electron-electron interaction and symmetry breaking can have profound influence on the topological properties of materials. In magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG), the flat band with a single SU(4) flavor associated with the spin and valley degrees of freedom gains non-zero Chern number when C2z symmetry or C2zT symmetry is broken. Electron-electron interaction can further lift the SU(4) degeneracy, leading to the Chern insulator states. Here we report a complete sequence of zero-field Chern insulators at all odd integer fillings (v = +-1, +-3) with different chirality (C = 1 or -1) in hBN aligned MATBG which structurally breaks C2z symmetry. The Chern states at hole fillings (v = -1, -3), which are firstly observed in this work, host an opposite chirality compared with the electron filling scenario. By slightly doping the v = +-3 states, we have observed new correlated insulating states at incommensurate moir\'e fillings which is highly suggested to be intrinsic Wigner crystals according to our theoretical calculations. Remarkably, we have observed prominent Streda-formula violation around v = -3 state. By doping the Chern gap at v = -3 with notable number of electrons at finite magnetic field, the Hall resistance Ryx robustly quantizes to ~ h/e2 whereas longitudinal resistance Rxx vanishes, indicating that the chemical potential is pinned within a Chern gap, forming an incommensurate Chern insulator. By providing the first experimental observation of zero-field Chern insulators in the flat valence band, our work fills up the overall topological framework of MATBG with broken C2z symmetry. Our findings also demonstrate that doped topological flat band is an ideal platform to investigate exotic incommensurate correlated topological states.</description>

      <title>Tripartite entanglement dynamics following a quantum quench</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of multipartite entanglement after quenches from initial states which generate multiplets of quasiparticle excitations beyond the usual pair structure. We focus on the dynamics of tripartite entanglement through the lens of the Markov gap -- a computable quantity that signals irreducible tripartite entanglement when positive. In the XX spin chain, we show that the Markov gap is positive at intermediate times, implying the presence of tripartite entanglement. After a time delay, the Markov gap increases and then decays at longer times, thus exhibiting an entanglement barrier. We argue that those qualitative features are consistent with an interpretation of the spreading of tripartite entanglement by triplets of tripartite-entangled quasiparticles.</description>

      <title>Electric field control of superconductivity and quantized anomalous Hall effects in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inducing superconducting correlations in chiral edge states is predicted to generate topologically protected zero energy modes with exotic quantum statistics. Experimental efforts to date have focused on engineering interfaces between superconducting materials, typically amorphous metals, and semiconducting quantum Hall or quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) systems. However, the strong interfacial disorder inherent can prevent the formation of isolated topological modes. An appealing alternative is to use low-density flat band materials where the ground state can be tuned between intrinsic superconducting and quantum anomalous Hall states using only the electric field effect. However, quantized transport and superconductivity have not been simultaneously achieved. Here, we show that rhombohedral tetralayer graphene aligned to a hexagonal boron nitride substrate hosts a quantized anomalous Hall state at superlattice filling $\nu = -1$ as well as a superconducting state at $\nu \approx -3.1$ at zero magnetic field. Remarkably, gate voltage can also be used to actuate nonvolatile switching of the chirality in the quantum anomalous Hall state, allowing arbitrarily reconfigurable networks of topological edge modes in locally gated devices. Thermodynamic compressibility measurements further reveal a topologically ordered fractional Chern insulator at $\nu = 2/3$, also stable at zero magnetic field, enabling proximity coupling between superconductivity and fractionally charged edge modes. Finally, we show that integrating an additional transition metal dichalcogenide layer to the heterostructure enhances the maximum superconducting critical temperature and nucleates new superconducting pockets, while leaving the topology of $\nu = -1$ the quantum anomalous Hall state intact. Our results pave the way for hybrid interfaces between superconductors and topological edge states in the low-disorder limit.</description>

      <title>Natural orbital impurity solver for real-frequency properties at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.06517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the natural orbital impurity solver [PRB 90, 085102 (2014)] to finite temperatures and apply it to calculate spectral and transport properties of correlated electrons within the dynamical mean-field theory. First, we benchmark our method against the exact diagonalization result for small clusters, finding that the natural orbital scheme works well not only for zero temperature but for low finite temperatures. The method yields smooth and sufficiently accurate spectra, which agree well with the results of the numerical renormalization group. Using the smooth spectra, we calculate the electric conductivity and Seebeck coefficient for the two-dimensional Hubbard model at low temperatures which are in the scope of many experiments and practical applications. These results demonstrate the usefulness of the natural orbital framework for obtaining the real frequency information of correlated electron systems.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Non-Fermi Liquid and Dynamical Planckian Scaling of the Quasi-Kagome Kondo Lattice CeRhSn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The anisotropic electronic structure and Drude response of the quasi-kagome Kondo lattice CeRhSn have been investigated by combining polarized optical conductivity measurements and first-principles band calculations. Along the hexagonal $a$- and $c$-axes, the peaks in the middle-infrared region originating from the hybridization between conduction bands and Ce $4f$ states appear even at room temperature, indicating strong valence fluctuation. Renormalized Drude responses observed at the photon energy below 100 meV, on the other hand, are characterized by non-Fermi-liquid-like scattering rate $1/\tau$ proportional to $\omega^1$ for $E \parallel a$ and $\omega^{1.5}$ for $E \parallel c$. Additionally, the heavy carrier response only for $E \parallel a$ obeyed the dynamical Planckian scaling below 80 K, suggesting that the quantum criticality only appears in the Ce quasi-kagone plane for $E \parallel a$. These results indicate that the quantum criticality with the strong valence fluctuation is realized in the Ce quasi-kagome lattice.</description>

      <title>Integrable models on Rydberg atom chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of integrable models for spin chains with constrained Hilbert spaces; we focus on spin-1/2 chains with the Rydberg constraint. We extend earlier results for medium-range spin chains to the constrained Hilbert space, and formulate an integrability condition. This enables us to construct new integrable models with fixed interaction ranges. We classify all time- and space-reflection symmetric integrable Rydberg-constrained Hamiltonians of range 3 and 4. At range 3, we find a single family of integrable Hamiltonians: the so-called RSOS quantum chains, which are related to the well-known RSOS models of Andrews, Baxter, and Forrester. At range 4 we find two families of models, the first of which is the constrained XXZ model. We also find a new family of models depending on a single coupling $z$. We provide evidence of two critical points related to the golden ratio $\phi$, at $z=\phi^{-1/2}$ and $z=\phi^{3/2}$. We also perform a partial classification of integrable Hamiltonians for range 5.</description>

      <title>Topological Phases of Many-Body Localized Systems: Beyond Eigenstate Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many-body localization (MBL) lends remarkable robustness to nonequilibrium phases of matter. Such phases can show topological and symmetry breaking order in their ground and excited states, but they may also belong to an anomalous localized topological phase (ALT phase). All eigenstates in an ALT phase are trivial, in that they can be deformed to product states, but the entire Hamiltonian cannot be deformed to a trivial localized model without going through a delocalization transition. Using a correspondence between MBL phases with short-ranged entanglement and locality preserving unitaries - called quantum cellular automata (QCA) - we reduce the classification of ALT phases to that of QCA. This method extends to periodically (Floquet) and quasiperiodically driven ALT phases, and captures anomalous Floquet phases within the same framework as static phases. The QCA framework further generalizes to include symmetry-enriched ALT phases (SALT phases), and provides a large class of soluble models suitable for realization in quantum simulators. In systematizing the study of ALT phases, we both greatly extend the classification of interacting nonequilibrium systems and clarify a confusion in the literature which implicitly equates nontrivial Hamiltonians with nontrivial ground states.</description>

      <title>Dipole representation of composite fermions in graphene's quantum Hall systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The even denominator fractional quantum Hall effect has been experimentally observed in the fourth Landau level ($n = 3$). This paper is motivated by recent studies regarding the possibility of pairing and the nature of the ground state in this system. By extending the dipole representation of composite fermions, we adapt this framework to the context of graphene's quantum Hall systems, with a focus on half-filled Landau levels. We derive an effective Hamiltonian that incorporates the key symmetry of half-filled Landau levels, particularly particle-hole symmetry. At the Fermi level, the energetic instability of the dipole state is influenced by the interplay between topology and symmetry, driving the system towards a critical state. We explore the possibility that this critical state stabilizes into one of the paired states with well-defined pairing solutions. However, our results demonstrate that the regularized state which satisfies boost invariance at Fermi level and lacks well-defined pairing instabilities emerges as energetically more favorable. Therefore, we find no well-defined pairing instabilities of composite fermions in the dipole representation in the half-filled fourth Landau level ($ n = 3 $) of electrons in graphene. Although the theory of composite fermions has its limitations, further research is required to investigate other possible configurations. We discuss the consistency of our results with experimental and numerical studies, and their relevance for future research efforts.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity with Tc 116K discovered in antimony polyhydrides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04033v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity (SC) was experimentally observed for the first time in antimony polyhydride. The diamond anvil cell combined with laser heating system was used to synthesize the antimony polyhydride sample at high pressure and high temperature conditions. In-situ high pressure transport measurements as function of temperature with applied magnet are performed to study the SC properties. It was found that the antimony polyhydride samples show superconducting transition with critical temperature Tc 116 K at 184 GPa. The investigation of SC at magnetic field revealed that the superconducting coherent length ~40 angstroms based on Ginzburg Landau (GL) equation. Antimony polyhydride superconductor has the second highest Tc in addition to sulfur hydride among the polyhydrides of elements from main group IIIA to VIIA in periodic table.</description>

      <title>Digital quantum simulation of lattice fermion theories with local encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15091v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically analyze the feasibility of a platform-neutral, general strategy to perform quantum simulations of fermionic lattice field theories under open boundary conditions. The digital quantum simulator requires solely one- and two-qubit gates and is scalable since integrating each Hamiltonian term requires a finite (non-scaling) cost. The exact local fermion encoding we adopt relies on auxiliary $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge fields by adding a pure gauge Hamiltonian term akin to the Toric Code. By numerically emulating the quantum simulator real-time dynamics, we observe a timescale separation for spin- and charge-excitations in a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Hubbard ladder in the $t-J$ model limit.</description>

      <title>Two-component superconductivity and strange metallicity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$: A Schwinger boson study of the $t$-$V$-$J$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in La$_{3}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has stimulated intensive investigations concerning its paring mechanism and effective low-energy theory. Here we apply the Schwinger boson approach to the bilayer $t$-$V$-$J$ model and obtain a global phase diagram with both metallic and superconducting ground states separated by a quantum phase transition. We predict a minimal interlayer superexchange $J$ and a minimal $d_{z^2}$-hole concentration necessary for the superconductivity, a right-triangle-like shape for the $T_c$ curve, and a maximum $T_c$ comparable with experiments. The normal state is featured with a pseudogap in the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ spectra associated with preformed Cooper pairs and non-Fermi liquid strange metal behavior due to hybridization-induced spinon-holon-electron scattering. Our work clarifies the key difference of the two-component scenario from other pairing mechanisms, and provides a consistent understanding of the high-temperature superconductivity and strange metallic properties of La$_{3}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure.</description>
