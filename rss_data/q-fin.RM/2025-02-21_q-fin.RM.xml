      <title>Utilizing Effective Dynamic Graph Learning to Shield Financial Stability from Risk Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial risks can propagate across both tightly coupled temporal and spatial dimensions, posing significant threats to financial stability. Moreover, risks embedded in unlabeled data are often difficult to detect. To address these challenges, we introduce GraphShield, a novel approach with three key innovations: Enhanced Cross-Domain Infor mation Learning: We propose a dynamic graph learning module to improve information learning across temporal and spatial domains. Advanced Risk Recognition: By leveraging the clustering characteristics of risks, we construct a risk recognizing module to enhance the identification of hidden threats. Risk Propagation Visualization: We provide a visualization tool for quantifying and validating nodes that trigger widespread cascading risks. Extensive experiments on two real-world and two open-source datasets demonstrate the robust performance of our framework. Our approach represents a significant advancement in leveraging artificial intelligence to enhance financial stability, offering a powerful solution to mitigate the spread of risks within financial networks.</description>

      <title>Modelling the term-structure of default risk under IFRS 9 within a multistate regression framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lifetime behaviour of loans is notoriously difficult to model, which can compromise a bank's financial reserves against future losses, if modelled poorly. Therefore, we present a data-driven comparative study amongst three techniques in modelling a series of default risk estimates over the lifetime of each loan, i.e., its term-structure. The behaviour of loans can be described using a nonstationary and time-dependent semi-Markov model, though we model its elements using a multistate regression-based approach. As such, the transition probabilities are explicitly modelled as a function of a rich set of input variables, including macroeconomic and loan-level inputs. Our modelling techniques are deliberately chosen in ascending order of complexity: 1) a Markov chain; 2) beta regression; and 3) multinomial logistic regression. Using residential mortgage data, our results show that each successive model outperforms the previous, likely as a result of greater sophistication. This finding required devising a novel suite of simple model diagnostics, which can itself be reused in assessing sampling representativeness and the performance of other modelling techniques. These contributions surely advance the current practice within banking when conducting multistate modelling. Consequently, we believe that the estimation of loss reserves will be more timeous and accurate under IFRS 9.</description>
