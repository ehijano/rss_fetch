      <title>Construction of cubic nonlinear lattice free from umklapp processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel type of umklapp-free lattice (UFL), where umklapp processes are completely absent. The proposed UFL incorporates cubic long-range nonlinearity, a feature not addressed in previous studies. In this paper, we derive an analytical expression for the cubic nonlinear coupling constants by imposing mathematical conditions such that the nonlinear coupling strength between particle pairs decays inversely with their separation distance. The absence of umklapp processes in the proposed lattice is confirmed through numerical comparisons with the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) lattice. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations are performed to investigate the thermal conductivity of the proposed lattice in the non-equilibrium steady state. Compared to the original FPUT lattice, the proposed UFL is closer to ballistic transport. Our results demonstrate that the umklapp processes induced by cubic nonlinearity are suppressed in the proposed UFL. Moreover, compared to the UFL with only quartic nonlinearity, truncation of long-range interactions plays a significant role in the proposed lattice.</description>

      <title>Implementation of a generalized intermittency scenario in the Rossler dynamical system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The realization of novel scenario involving transitions between different types of chaotic attractors is investigated for the Rossler system. Characteristic features indicative of the presence of generalized intermittency scenario in this system are identified. The properties of "chaos-chaos" transitions following the generalized intermittency scenario are analyzed in detail based on phase-parametric characteristics, Lyapunov characteristic exponents, phase portraits, and Poincare sections.</description>

      <title>Final state sensitivity and fractal basin boundaries from coupled Chialvo neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate and quantify the basin geometry and extreme final state uncertainty of two identical electrically asymmetrically coupled Chialvo neurons. The system's diverse behaviors are presented, along with the mathematical reasoning behind its chaotic and nonchaotic dynamics as determined by the structure of the coupled equations. The system is found to be multistable with two qualitatively different attractors. Although each neuron is individually nonchaotic, the chaotic basin takes up the vast majority of the coupled system's state space, but the nonchaotic basin stretches to infinity due to chance synchronization. The boundary between the basins is found to be fractal, leading to extreme final state sensitivity. This uncertainty and its potential effect on the synchronization of biological neurons may have significant implications for understanding human behavior and neurological disease.</description>

      <title>Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals Embedded in Dark Matter Halo I:Existence of Homoclinic Orbit and Near-Horizon Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the existence of homoclinic orbit and the onset of chaotic motion for a massive particle moving around a Schwarzschild-like black hole embedded in a Dehnen-(1,4,5/2) type dark matter halo, within the extreme-mass-ratio limit q = m/M &lt;&lt; 1, where m and M are the masses of the particle and the central black hole, respectively. The presence of the halo modifies the spacetime curvature and consequently deforms the effective potential governing the particle's motion. Using the Hamiltonian formulation, we derive the conditions under which unstable circular orbit and the associated homoclinic trajectory arise, marking the separatrix between bound and plunging motion. By analyzing the effective potential and the corresponding phase-space structure, we identify the transition from regular to chaotic dynamics in the near-horizon region. Numerical analyses through Poincare sections and Lyapunov exponents calculations demonstrate that increasing the halo density, scale radius along with energy amplifies nonlinear effects which leads to chaos eventually. We demonstrate that within a dark matter halo environment, the dynamical stability of particle motion can be significantly altered without violating the universal surface gravity bound on chaos. This work provides a deeper understanding of horizon-induced chaos in astrophysically realistic environments and serves as a theoretical basis for exploring its possible imprints on gravitational wave signals in extreme-mass-ratio inspirals system.</description>

      <title>SVD-based Causal Emergence for Gaussian Iterative Systems</title>

Abstract: Causal emergence (CE) based on effective information (EI) demonstrates that macro-states can exhibit stronger causal effects than micro-states in dynamics. However, the identification of CE and the maximization of EI both rely on coarse-graining strategies, which is a key challenge. A recently proposed CE framework based on approximate dynamical reversibility, utilizing singular value decomposition (SVD), is independent of coarse-graining. Still, it is limited to transition probability matrices (TPM) in discrete states. To address this, this article proposes a novel CE quantification framework for Gaussian iterative systems (GIS), based on approximate dynamical reversibility derived from the SVD of inverse covariance matrices in forward and backward dynamics. The positive correlation between SVD-based and EI-based CE, along with the equivalence condition, is given analytically. After that, we provide precise coarse-graining strategies directly from singular value spectra and orthogonal matrices. This new framework can be applied to any dynamical system with continuous states and Gaussian noise, such as auto-regressive growth models, Markov-Gaussian systems, and even SIR modeling using neural networks (NN). Numerical simulations on typical cases validate our theory and offer a new approach to studying the CE phenomenon, emphasizing noise and covariance over dynamical functions in both known models and machine learning.</description>

      <title>Quantization of nonlinear non-Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06939v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several important dynamical systems are in $\mathbb{R}^2$, defined by the pair of differential equations $(x',y')=(f(x,y),g(x,y))$. A question of fundamental importance is how such systems might behave quantum mechanically. In developing quantum theory, Dirac and others realized that classical Hamiltonian systems can be mapped to their quantum counterparts via canonical quantization. The resulting quantum dynamics is always physical, characterized by completely-positive and trace-preserving evolutions in the Schr\"{o}dinger picture. However, whether non-Hamiltonian systems can be quantized systematically while respecting the same physical requirements has remained a long-standing problem. Here we resolve this question when $f(x,y)$ and $g(x,y)$ are arbitrary polynomials. By leveraging open-systems theory, we prove constructively that every polynomial system admits a physical generator of time evolution in the form of a Lindbladian. We call our method cascade quantization, and demonstrate its power by analyzing several paradigmatic examples of nonlinear dynamics such as bifurcations, noise-activated spiking, and Li\'{e}nard systems. In effect, our method can quantize any classical system whose $f(x,y)$ and $g(x,y)$ are analytic with arbitrary precision. More importantly, cascade quantization is exact. This means restrictive system properties usually assumed in the literature to facilitate quantization, such as weak nonlinearity, rotational symmetry, or semiclassical dynamics, can all be dispensed with by cascade quantization. We also highlight the advantages of cascade quantization over existing proposals, by weighing it against examples from the variational paradigm using Lagrangians, as well as non-variational approaches.</description>

      <title>Retrodicting Chaotic Systems: An Algorithmic Information Theory Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Making accurate inferences about data is a key task in science and mathematics. Here we study the problem of \emph{retrodiction}, inferring past values of a series, in the context of chaotic dynamical systems. Specifically, we are interested in inferring the starting value $x_0$ in the series $x_0,x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n$ given the value of $x_n$, and the associated function $f$ which determines the series as $f(x_i)=x_{i+1}$. Even in the deterministic case this is a challenging problem, due to mixing and the typically exponentially many candidate past values in the pre-image of any given value $x_n$ (e.g., a current observation). We study this task from the perspective of algorithmic information theory, which motivates two approaches: One to search for the `simplest' value in the set of candidates, and one to look for the value in the lowest density region of the candidates. We test these methods numerically on the logistic map, Tent map, Bernoulli map, and Julia/Mandelbrot map, which are well-studied maps in chaos theory. The methods aid in retrodiction by assigning low ranks to candidates which are more likely to be the true starting value. Our approach works well in some parameter and map cases, and outperforms several other retrodiction techniques (each of which fails to outperform random guessing). Nonetheless, the approach is not effective in all cases, and several open problems remain including computational cost and sensitivity to noise. All of these methods are unified through a Gaussian Process (GP) perspective, motivating complexity-based priors for GPs.</description>

      <title>Response function as a quantitative measure of consciousness in brain dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the neural correlates of consciousness remains a central challenge in neuroscience. In this study, we investigate the relationship between consciousness and neural responsiveness by analyzing intracranial ECoG recordings from non-human primates across three distinct states: wakefulness, anesthesia, and recovery. Using a nonequilibrium recurrent neural network (RNN) model, we fit state-dependent cortical dynamics to extract the neural response function as a dynamics complexity indicator. Our findings demonstrate that the amplitude of the neural response function serves as a robust dynamical indicator of conscious state, consistent with the role of a linear response function in statistical physics. Notably, this aligns with our previous theoretical results showing that the response function in RNNs peaks near the transition between ordered and chaotic regimes -- highlighting criticality as a potential principle for sustaining flexible and responsive cortical dynamics. Empirically, we find that during wakefulness, neural responsiveness is strong, widely distributed, and consistent with rich nonequilibrium fluctuations. Under anesthesia, response amplitudes are significantly suppressed, and the network dynamics become more chaotic, indicating a loss of dynamical sensitivity. During recovery, the neural response function is elevated, supporting the gradual re-establishment of flexible and responsive activity that parallels the restoration of conscious processing. Our work suggests that a robust, brain-state-dependent neural response function may be a necessary dynamical condition for consciousness, providing a principled framework for quantifying levels of consciousness in terms of nonequilibrium responsiveness in the brain.</description>
