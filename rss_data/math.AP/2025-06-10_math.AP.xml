      <title>A Directional-ODE Framework for Discretization of Advection-Diffusion Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach that redefines the traditional interpretation of explicit and implicit discretization methods for solving a general class of advection-diffusion equations (ADEs) featuring nonlinear advection, diffusion operators, and potential source terms. By reformulating the discrete ADEs as directional ordinary differential equations (ODEs) along temporal or spatial dimensions, we derive analytical solutions that lead to novel update formulas. In essence, the information of discrete ADEs is compressed into these directional ODEs, which we refer to as representative ODEs. The analytical update formulas derived from the representative ODEs significantly enhance stability, computational efficiency, and spatiotemporal resolution. Furthermore, we extend the framework to systems with uncertain parameters and coefficients, showcasing its versatility in addressing complex ADEs encountered in modeling and simulation across diverse scientific and engineering disciplines.</description>

      <title>Wellposedness of inviscid SQG in the half-plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the SQG equation without dissipation on the half-plane with Dirichlet boundary condition, and prove local wellposedness in the spaces $W^{3,p}$ and $C^{2,\beta}$ for any $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$ and $0&lt;\beta&lt;1$. We complement this wellposedness by showing that for generic $C^{\infty}_{0}$ initial data, the unique corresponding solution does not belong to $W^{3,\infty}$.</description>

      <title>Weak and mild solutions to the MHD equations and the viscoelastic Navier-Stokes equations with damping in Wiener amalgam spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the three-dimensional incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations and the incompressible viscoelastic Navier-Stokes equations with damping. Building on techniques developed by Bradshaw, Lai, and Tsai (Math. Ann. 2024), we prove the existence of mild solutions in Wiener amalgam spaces that satisfy the corresponding spacetime integral bounds. In addition, we construct global-in-time local energy weak solutions in these amalgam spaces using the framework introduced by Bradshaw and Tsai (SIAM J. Math. Anal. 2021). As part of this construction, we also establish several properties of local energy solutions with $L^2_{\rm uloc}$ initial data, including initial and eventual regularity as well as small-large uniqueness, extending analogous results obtained for the Navier-Stokes equations by Bradshaw and Tsai (Comm. Partial Differential Equations 2020).</description>

      <title>Existence of traveling waves for vector valued gradient flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Allen-Cahn equation is a fundamental continuum model that describes phase transitions in multi-component mixtures. We prove the existence of traveling waves for vector valued Allen-Cahn equations in the context of Ginzburg-Landau theories; in addition, we find the largest wave speed and provide its bounds from upper and below. Our method is based on a variation technique and can be applied to system of equations with a gradient flow structure.</description>

      <title>Mixing for generic passive scalars by incompressible flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixing by incompressible flows is a ubiquitous yet incompletely understood phenomenon in fluid dynamics. While previous studies have focused on optimal mixing rates, the question of its genericity, i.e., whether mixing occurs for typical incompressible flows and typical initial data, remains mathematically unclear. In this paper, it is shown that classical mixing criteria, e.g. topological mixing or non-precompactness in $L^2$ for all nontrivial densities, fail to persist under arbitrarily small perturbations of velocity fields. A Young-measure theory adapted to $L^\infty$ data is then developed to characterize exactly which passive scalars mix. As a consequence, the existence of a single mixed density is equivalent to mixing for generic bounded data, and this equivalence is further tied to the non-precompactness of the associated measure-preserving flow maps in $L^p$. These results provide a foundation for a general theory of generic mixing in non-autonomous incompressible flows.</description>

      <title>Global regularity results for the fractional heat equation and application to a class of non-linear KPZ problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the first part of this paper, we prove the global regularity, in an adequate parabolic Bessel-Potential space and then in the corresponding parabolic fractional Sobolev space, of the unique solution to following fractional heat equation $ w_t+(-\Delta)^sw= h\;;\; w(x,t)=0 \text{ in } \; (\mathbb{R}^N\setminus\Omega)\times(0,T)\;;\; w(x,0)=w_0(x) \; \text{in}\; \Omega$, where $\Omega$ is an open bounded subset of $\mathbb{R}^N$. The proof is based on a new pointwise estimate on the fractional gradient of the corresponding kernel. Moreover, we establish the compactness of $(w_0,h)\mapsto w$. As a majeur application, in the second part , we establish existence and regularity of solutions to a class of Kardar--Parisi--Zhang equations with fractional diffusion and a nonlocal gradient term. Additionally, several auxiliary results of independent interest are obtained.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of nonlinear Robin energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the asymptotic behavior of a class of nonlinear variational problems with Robin-type boundary conditions on a bounded Lipschitz domain. The energy functional contains a bulk term (the $p$-norm of the gradient), a boundary term (the $q$-norm of the trace) scaled by a parameter $\alpha&gt;0$, and a linear source term. By variational methods, we derive first-order expansions of the minimum as $\alpha\to 0^+$ (Neumann limit) and as $\alpha\to+\infty$ (Dirichlet limit). In the Dirichlet limit, the energy converges to the one of Dirichlet problem with a power-type quantified rate (depending only on $q$), while the Neumann limit exhibits a dichotomy: under a compatibility condition, the energy linearly approaches the one of Neumann problem, otherwise, it diverges as a power of $\alpha$ depending only on $q$.</description>

      <title>CDF-Generated Damage Laws: Admissibility, Gamma-Convergence to Griffith Fracture, and Well-Posedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a family of scalar softening laws by setting the stored-energy density $\psi(\eta)=\int_{0}^{\eta}[1-F(s)]d s$, where $F$ ranges over exponential, Cauchy, logistic, half-normal, Gudermannian, hypergeometric, radical, rational, piece-wise, and rapid-decay cumulative-distribution functions (CDFs). We prove that every such law yields a degradation map that is monotone, bounded, and dissipative, rendering the associated hyperelastic material thermodynamically admissible. Working directly in spatial dimensions $d=2,3$, we establish compactness and $\Gamma$-convergence of the CDF-based energies to a sharp-interface Griffith functional. We further show the existence of rate-independent quasi-static evolutions by constructing global energetic solutions that satisfy both stability and energy balance. These analytical results provide a rigorous bridge between the probabilistic damage formulation and Griffith-type fracture mechanics. One illustrative example is presented to show the effectiveness of the current damage laws.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness and orbital stability of solitary waves for Zakharov-Ito equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Zakharov-Ito equation \begin{equation*}
  \begin{cases}
  u_t+u_{xxx}+3uu_x+\rho\rho_x=0,
  \rho_t+{(u\rho)}_x=0.
  \end{cases}
  \end{equation*}
  We prove the local well-posedness in $H^s\times H^s$ for $s&gt;3/2$ and global well-posedness in $H^s\times H^s$ for $s\geq2$. When $\rho=0$, the Zakharov-Ito equation reduces to the KdV equation, hence has solitary waves with speeds $c\in(0,+\infty)$. We prove the orbital stability of these solitary waves in $H^1\times L^2$ by combining a variational approach and the framework of Grillakis, Shatah and Strauss \cite{GSS1987}.</description>

      <title>Exponential local energy decay of solutions to the wave equation with $L^\infty$ electric and magnetic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove sharp resolvent estimates for the magnetic Schr\"odinger operator in $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d\ge 3$, with $L^\infty$ short-range electric and magnetic potentials. We also show that these resolvent estimates still hold for the Dirichlet self-adjoint realization of the Schr\"odinger operator in the exterior of a non-trapping obstacle in $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d\ge 2$, provided the magnetic potential is supposed identically zero. As an application of the resolvent estimates, we obtain an exponential decay of the local energy of solutions to the wave equation with $L^\infty$ electric and magnetic potentials which decay exponentially at infinity, in all odd and even dimensions, provided the low frequencies are cut off in a suitable way. We also show that in odd dimensions there is no need to cut off the low frequencies in order to get an exponential local energy decay, provided we assume that zero is neither an eigenvalue nor a resonance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present an image restoration method based on solving an elliptic partial differential equation (PDE) of the form \begin{equation*} -\Delta u+\lambda \,G(u)=f, \end{equation*} where $\Delta $ denotes the Laplacian, $G(u)$ is a nonlocal operator (with the Gaussian convolution being a particular example), and $f$ is the degraded image. We detail the derivation of the model, prove the existence and uniqueness of its weak solution via the Lax--Milgram theorem (assuming $% f\in L^{2}(\Omega )$), and describe the discretization scheme using finite differences and a fixed-point iterative method. The complete Python implementation is integrated into the article.</description>

Abstract: We consider on Riemannian manifolds solutions of the Leibenson equation \begin{equation*} \partial _{t}u=\Delta _{p}u^{q}. \end{equation*} This equation is also known as doubly nonlinear evolution equation. We prove gradient estimates for positive solutions $u$ under the condition that the Ricci curvature on $M$ is bounded from below by a non-positive constant. We distinguish between the case $q(p-1)&gt;1$ (slow diffusion case) and the case $q(p-1)&lt;1$ (fast diffusion case).</description>

      <title>Solvability of the Zakharov-Shabat systems with meromorphic potentials by quadrature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the solvability of the general two-dimensional Zakharov-Shabat (ZS) systems with meromorphic potentials by quadrature. These systems appear in application of the inverse scattering transform (IST) to an important class of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) called integrable systems. Their solvability by quadrature is a key to obtain analytical expressions for solutions to the initial value problems of the integrable PDEs by using the IST. We prove that the ZS systems are always integrable in the sense of differential Galois theory, i.e., solvable by quadrature, if and only if the meromporphic potentials are reflectionless, under the condition that the potentials are absolutely integrable on $\mathbb{R}\setminus(-R_0,R_0)$ for some $R_0&gt;0$. Similar statements were previously proved to be true by the author for a limited class of potentials and the linear Schr\"odinger equations.</description>

      <title>Uniform a priori bounds for Slightly Subcritical Elliptic Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain a uniform $L^{\infty}(\Omega)$ a priori bound, for any positive weak solutions to elliptic problem with a nonlinearity $f$ slightly subcritical, slightly superlinear, and regularly varying.
  To achieve our result, we first obtain a uniform estimate of an specific $L^1(\Omega)$ weighted norm. This, combined with moving planes method and elliptic regularity theory, provides a uniform $L^\infty$ bound in a neighborhood of the boundary of $\Omega$. Next, by using Pohozaev's identity, we obtain a uniform estimate of one weighted norm of the solutions. Joining now elliptic regularity theory, and Morrey's Theorem, we estimate from below the radius of a ball where a solution exceeds the half of its $L^\infty(\Omega)$-norm. Finally, going back to the previous uniform weighted norm estimate, we conclude our result.</description>

Abstract: The steady motion of a viscous incompressible fluid in distorted pipes, of finite length, is modeled through the Navier-Stokes equations with mixed boundary conditions: the inflow is given by an arbitrary member of the Lions-Magenes class with positive influx, and the fluid motion is subject to a directional do-nothing boundary condition on the outlet, together with the standard no-slip assumption on the remaining walls of the domain. Existence of a weak solution to such Navier-Stokes system is proved without any restriction on the data (that is, inlet velocity and external force) by means of the Leray-Schauder Principle, in which the required a priori estimate is obtained by a contradiction argument that employs Bernoulli's law for solutions of the stationary Euler equations, as well as some properties of harmonic divergence-free vector fields. Under a suitable smallness assumption on the data, we also prove the unique solvability of the boundary-value problem.</description>

      <title>Another look at quasilinear Schr\"odinger equations with prescribed mass via dual method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to study the existence of ground state normalized solutions for the following quasilinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation $-\Delta u-\Delta(u^2)u=h(u)+\lambda u,\,\, x\in\R^N$, under the mass constraint $\int_{\R^N}|u|^2\text{d}x=a,$ where $N\geq2$, $a&gt;0$ is a given mass, $\lambda$ is a Lagrange multiplier and $h$ is a nonlinear reaction term with some suitable conditions. By employing a suitable transformation $u=f(v)$, we reformulate the original problem into the equivalent form $-\Delta v =h(f(v))f'(v)+\lambda f(v)f'(v),\,\, x\in\R^N,$ with prescribed mass $
\int_{\R^N}|f(v)|^2\text{d}x=a. $
To address the challenge posed by the $L^2$-norm $\|f(v)\|^2_2$ not necessarily equaling
  $a$, we introduce a novel stretching mapping: $
v_t(x):=f^{-1}(t^{N/2}f(v(tx))). $
This construction, combined with a dual method and detailed analytical techniques, enables us to establish the following existence results:
  (1)Existence of solutions via constrained minimization using dual methods;
  (2) Existence of ground state normalized solutions under general
  $L^2$-supercritical growth conditions, along with nonexistence results, analyzed via dual methods;
  (3)Existence of normalized solutions under critical growth conditions, treated via dual methods.
  Additionally, we analyze the asymptotic behavior of the ground state energy obtained in {\bf(P2)}. Our results extend and refine those of Colin-Jeanjean-Squassina [Nonlinearity 20: 1353-1385, 2010], of Jeanjean-Luo-Wang [J. Differ. Equ. 259: 3894-3928, 2015], of Li-Zou [Pacific J. Math. 322: 99-138, 2023], of Zhang-Li-Wang [Topol. Math. Nonl. Anal. 61: 465-489, 2023] and so on. We believe that the methodology developed here can be adapted to study related problems concerning the existence of normalized solutions for quasilinear Schr\"{o}dinger equations via the dual method.</description>

      <title>Singular Dirichlet boundary problems for a class of fully nonlinear parabolic equations in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we deal with the initial value problem for a class of fully nonlinear parabolic equations with a singular Dirichlet boundary condition in one space dimension. The interior equation includes, for example, a fully nonlinear $p$-Laplace type heat equation and a $\beta$-power type curvature flow. The singular Dirichlet boundary condition depicts, for example, the asymptoticness of the ends of complete curve to parallel two lines in geometric flow of graphs. We study the dependence of the existence and non-existence of solution to the problem on the interior equation and the boundedness of the initial function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a power-type mild singular perturbation of a Dirichlet semilinear critical problem settled in an open and bounded set in a Carnot group. Here, the term critical has to be understood in the sense of the Sobolev embedding. We aim to prove the existence of two positive weak solutions: the first one is obtained by means of the variational Perron's method, while for the second one we adapt a classical argument relying on proper estimates of a family of functions which mimic the role of the classical Aubin-Talenti functions in the Euclidean setting. Our results fall in the framework of semilinear PDEs in Carnot group but, as far as we know, are the first ones dealing with singular perturbations of power-type.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a certain type of tug-of-war game, including a constant payoff discount rate at every turn. The model PDEs of these games are $p$-Laplace type equations with measurable ingredients. We provide existence, uniqueness and regularity results for game value functions. Furthermore, we consider relevant properties of solutions to the model problems based on the discussion about the games.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove the lower semicontinuity of a Neohookean-type energy for a model of Nonlinear Elasticity that allows, for the first time, for $p&lt;n-1$. Our class of admissible deformations consists of weak limits of Sobolev $W^{1,p}$ homeomorphisms. We also introduce a model that allows for cavitations by studying weak limits of homeomorphisms that can open cavities at some points. In this model we add the measure of the created surface to the energy functional and for this functional we again prove lower semicontinuity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove existence, symmetry and uniqueness of solutions to the fractional Gelfand equation
  $$
  (-\Delta)^s u = e^u \quad \mbox{in $\mathbb{R}$} \quad \mbox{with} \quad \int_{\mathbb{R}} e^u dx &lt; +\infty
  $$ for all exponents $s \in (\frac{1}{2},1)$. Furthermore, we show $u$ has finite Morse index and that its linearized operator is nondegenerate. Our arguments are based on a fixed point scheme in terms of the function $v= \sqrt{e^u}$ and we devise a nonlocal shooting method involving (locally) compact nonlinear maps. We also study existence, symmetry and uniqueness of solutions to $(-\Delta)^s u = K e^u$ in $\mathbb{R}$ with $K e^u \in L^1(\mathbb{R})$ for a general class of positive, even and monotone-decreasing functions $K &gt; 0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a quantitative version of the isoperimetric inequality for the torsion of multiply connected domains, among sets with given area and with given joint area of the holes.
  Since the optimal shape is the annulus, we investigate how a given domain approaches an annular configuration when its torsion is close to the optimal value. Our result shows that when the torsional rigidity is nearly optimal, the domain $\Omega$ must be close to an annulus.</description>

      <title>Sharp quantitative stability estimates for the Brezis-Nirenberg problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quantitative stability for the classical Brezis-Nirenberg problem associated with the critical Sobolev embedding $H^1_0(\Omega) \hookrightarrow L^{\frac{2n}{n-2}}(\Omega)$ in a smooth bounded domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ ($n \geq 3$). To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first quantitative stability result for the Sobolev inequality on bounded domains. A key discovery is the emergence of unexpected stability exponents in our estimates, which arise from the intricate interaction among the nonnegative solution $u_0$ and the linear term $\lambda u$ of the Brezis--Nirenberg equation, bubble formation, and the boundary effect of the domain $\Omega$. One of the main challenges is to capture the boundary effect quantitatively, a feature that fundamentally distinguishes our setting from the Euclidean case treated in \cite{CFM, FG, DSW} and the smooth closed manifold case studied in \cite{CK}. In addressing a variety of difficulties, our proof refines and streamlines several arguments from the existing literature while also resolving new analytical challenges specific to our setting.</description>

      <title>Fractional Sobolev spaces and fractional $p$-Laplace equations on locally finite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph-based analysis holds both theoretical and applied significance, attracting considerable attention from researchers and yielding abundant results in recent years. However, research on fractional problems remains limited, with most of established results restricted to lattice graphs. In this paper, fractional Sobolev spaces are constructed on general graphs that are connected, locally finite and stochastically complete. Under certain assumptions, these spaces exhibit completeness, reflexivity, and other properties. Moreover, we propose a fractional $p$-Laplace operator, and study the existence of solutions to some nonlinear Schr\"odinger type equations involving this nonlocal operator. The main contribution of this paper is to establish a relatively comprehensive set of analytical tools for studying fractional problems on graphs.</description>

By employing conserved quantities in terms of the momentum variable $m$, we show that the 2-soliton, when regarded as a solution to the initial-value problem for the modified Camassa-Holm equation, is nonlinearly stable to perturbations with respect to the momentum variable in the Sobolev space $H^2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the large-time asymptotic behavior of solutions to the one-dimensional damped pressureless Euler-Poisson system with variable background states, subject to a neutrality condition. In the case where the background density converges asymptotically to a positive constant, we establish the convergence of global classical solutions toward the corresponding equilibrium state. The proof combines phase plane analysis with hypocoercivity-type estimates. As an application, we analyze the damped pressureless Euler--Poisson system arising in cold plasma ion dynamics, where the electron density is modeled by a Maxwell-Boltzmann relation. We show that solutions converge exponentially to the steady state under suitable a priori bounds on the density and velocity fields. Our results provide a rigorous characterization of asymptotic stability for damped Euler-Poisson systems with nontrivial background structures.</description>

      <title>Global weak solutions to a compressible Navier--Stokes/Cahn--Hilliard system with singular entropy of mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a Navier-Stokes/Cahn-Hilliard system modeling the evolution of a compressible binary mixture of viscous fluids undergoing phase separation. The novelty of this work is a free energy potential including the physically relevant Flory-Huggins (logarithmic) entropy, as opposed to previous studies in the literature, which only consider regular potentials with polynomial growth. Our main result establishes the existence of global-in-time weak solutions in three-dimensional bounded domains for arbitrarily large initial data. The core contribution is the derivation of new estimates for the chemical potential and the Flory-Huggins entropy arising from a density-dependent Cahn-Hilliard equation under minimal assumptions: non-negative $\gamma$-integrable density with $\gamma&gt;\frac32$. In addition, we prove that the phase variable, which represents the difference of the mass concentrations, takes value within the physical interval $[-1,1]$ almost everywhere on the set where the density is positive.</description>

      <title>Control strategies and trends to equilibrium for kinetic models of opinion dynamics driven by social activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce new kinetic equations modeling opinion dynamics inside a population of individuals, whose propensity to interact with each other is described by their level of social activity. We show that opinion polarization can arise among agents with a low activity level, while active ones develop a consensus, highlighting the importance of social interactions to prevent the formation of extreme opinions. Moreover, we present a realistic control strategy aimed at reducing the number of inactive agents and increasing the number of socially active ones. At last, we prove several (weak and strong) convergence to equilibrium results for such controlled model. In particular, by considering additional interactions between individuals and opinion leaders capable of steering the average opinion of the population, we use entropy method-like techniques to estimate the relaxation toward equilibrium of solutions to a Fokker-Planck equation with adjoint given by a Wright-Fisher-type model with time-dependent coefficients.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent equations and quantum diffusion for the Anderson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Anderson tight-binding model on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d\geq 2$, with Gaussian noise and at low disorder $\lambda&gt;0$. We derive a diffusive scaling limit for the entries of the resolvent $R(z)$ at imaginary part $\operatorname*{Im} z\sim\lambda^{2+\kappa_d}$, $\kappa_d&gt;0$, with high probability. As consequences, we establish quantum diffusion (in a time-averaged sense) for the Schr\"{o}dinger propagator at the longest timescale known to date and improve the best available lower bounds on the localization length of eigenfunctions. Our results for $d=2$ are the first quantum diffusion results for the Anderson model on $\mathbb{Z}^2$. The proof avoids the use of diagrammatic expansions and instead proceeds by analyzing certain self-consistent equations for $R(z)$. This is facilitated by new estimates for $\|R(z)\|_{\ell^p\rightarrow \ell^q}$ that control the recollisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a continuous-time portfolio selection framework that reflects goal-based investment principles and mental accounting behavior. In this framework, an investor with multiple investment goals constructs separate portfolios, each corresponding to a specific goal, with penalties imposed on fund transfers between these goals, referred to as mental costs. By applying the stochastic Perron's method, we demonstrate that the value function is the unique constrained viscosity solution of a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation system. Numerical analysis reveals several key features: the free boundaries exhibit complex shapes with bulges and notches; the optimal strategy for one portfolio depends on the wealth level of another; investors must diversify both among stocks and across portfolios; and they may postpone reallocating surplus from an important goal to a less important one until the former's deadline approaches.</description>

      <title>Active Contour Models Driven by Hyperbolic Mean Curvature Flow for Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parabolic mean curvature flow-driven active contour models (PMCF-ACMs) are widely used in image segmentation, which however depend heavily on the selection of initial curve configurations. In this paper, we firstly propose several hyperbolic mean curvature flow-driven ACMs (HMCF-ACMs), which introduce tunable initial velocity fields, enabling adaptive optimization for diverse segmentation scenarios. We shall prove that HMCF-ACMs are indeed normal flows and establish the numerical equivalence between dissipative HMCF formulations and certain wave equations using the level set method with signed distance function. Building on this framework, we furthermore develop hyperbolic dual-mode regularized flow-driven ACMs (HDRF-ACMs), which utilize smooth Heaviside functions for edge-aware force modulation to suppress over-diffusion near weak boundaries. Then, we optimize a weighted fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm with nine-point stencil spatial discretization when solving the above-mentioned wave equations. Experiments show that both HMCF-ACMs and HDRF-ACMs could achieve more precise segmentations with superior noise resistance and numerical stability due to task-adaptive configurations of initial velocities and initial contours.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of Fractional Stochastic p-Laplace Equations Driven by Superlinear Transport Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions of the fractional p-Laplace equation with a polynomial drift of arbitrary order driven by superlinear transport noise. By the monotone argument, we first prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions of an abstract stochastic differential equation satisfying a fully local monotonicity condition. We then apply the abstract result to the fractional stochastic p-Laplace equation defined in a bounded domain. The main difficulty is to establish the tightness as well as the uniform integrability of a sequence of approximate solutions defined by the Galerkin method. To obtain the necessary uniform estimates, we employ the Skorokhod-Jakubowski representation theorem on a topological space instead of a metric space. Since the strong Skorokhod representation theorem is incorrect even in a complete separable metric space, we pass to the limit of stochastic integrals with respect to a sequence of Wiener processes by a weak convergence argument.</description>

      <title>Zero-noise selection and Large Deviations in $L^\infty_t L^p_x$ for the stochastic transport equation beyond DiPerna-Lions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider $L^\infty_t L^p_x$ solutions of the stochastic transport equation with drift in $L^\infty_t W^{1,q}_x$. We show strong existence and pathwise uniqueness of solutions in a regime of parameters $p,q$ for which non-unique weak solutions of the deterministic transport equation exist. When the intensity of the noise goes to zero, we prove that the solutions of the stochastic transport equation converge to the unique renormalized solution of the transport equation in the sense of DiPerna-Lions. Furthermore, we show that the convergence is governed by a Large Deviations Principle in the space $L^\infty_t L^p_x$. Since the space $L^\infty_t L^p_x$ is not separable, and solutions of the stochastic transport equation lack compactness therein, the weak convergence approach to Large Deviations by Budhiraja, Dupuis, and Maroulas is not directly applicable.</description>

      <title>The diffusivity of supercritical Bernoulli percolation is infinitely differentiable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that, the diffusivity and conductivity on $\mathbb{Z}^d$-Bernoulli percolation ($d \geq 2$) are infinitely differentiable in supercritical regime. This extends a result by Kozlov [Uspekhi Mat. Nauk 44 (1989), no. 2(266), pp 79 - 120]. The key to the proof is a uniform estimate for the finite-volume approximation of derivatives, which relies on the perturbed corrector equations in homogenization theory. The renormalization of geometry is then implemented in a sequence of scales to gain sufficient degrees of regularity. To handle the higher-order perturbation on percolation, new techniques, including cluster-growth decomposition and hole separation, are developed.</description>

      <title>Homogenization of non-symmetric convolution type operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper studies homogenization problem for a bounded in $L_2(\mathbb R^d)$ convolution type operator ${\mathbb A}_\eps$, $\eps &gt;0$, of the form $$ ({\mathbb A}_\eps u) (\x) = \eps^{-d-2} \int_{\R^d} a((\x-\y)/\eps) \mu(\x/\eps, \y/\eps) \left( u(\x) - u(\y) \right)\,d\y. $$ It is assumed that $a(\x)$ is a non-negative function from $L_1(\R^d)$, and $\mu(\x,\y)$ is a periodic in $\x$ and $\y$ function such that $0&lt; \mu_- \leqslant \mu(\x,\y) \leqslant \mu_+&lt; \infty$. No symmetry assumption on $a(\cdot)$ and $\mu(\cdot)$ is imposed, so the operator ${\mathbb A}_\eps$ need not be self-adjoint. Under the assumption that the moments $M_k = \int_{\R^d} |\x|^k a(\x)\,d\x$, $k=1,2,3$, are finite we obtain, for small $\eps&gt;0$, sharp in order approximation of the resolvent $({\mathbb A}_\eps + I)^{-1}$ in the operator norm in $L_2(\mathbb R^d)$, the discrepancy being of order $O(\eps)$. The approximation is given by an operator of the form $({\mathbb A}^0 + \eps^{-1} \langle \boldsymbol{\alpha},\nabla \rangle + I)^{-1}$ multiplied on the right by a periodic function $q_0(\x/\eps)$; here ${\mathbb A}^0 = - \operatorname{div}g^0 \nabla$ is the effective operator, and $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ is a constant vector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies Hausdorff-Young-type inequalities within the framework of Lorentz spaces $L_{p,q}$. Focusing on the dependence of the associated constants on the integrability parameter $p$, we derive optimal bounds in the limiting case $p\rightarrow 2$, addressing the Herz-Bochkarev problem. The results obtained refine the pioneering estimates in [3] and are comparable to recent advances in [16]. The main ingredients of our approach are new grand Lorentz space techniques.</description>

      <title>GBDT with nontrivial seeds: explicit solutions of the focusing NLS equations and the corresponding Weyl functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our GBDT (generalised B\"acklund-Darboux transformation) approach is used to construct explicit solutions of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) equation in the case of the exponential seed $a \exp\{2 i (cx +dt)\}$. The corresponding Baker-Akhiezer functions and evolution of the Weyl functions are obtained as well. In particular, the solutions, which appear in the study of rogue waves, step-like solutions and $N$-modulation solutions of the NLS equation are considered. This work is an essential development of our joint work with Rien Kaashoek and Israel Gohberg, where the seed was trivial, as well as several other of our previous works.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the analyticity of a class of exponential Dirichlet series. We then explicitly determine the coefficients of their power series decomposition and provide an estimate for the remainder. As an application, we study the approximate controllability property of linear parabolic equations with locally distributed or lumped controls by employing the moment method, which relies on the exponential Dirichlet series associated with the spectrum of the system's operator.</description>

      <title>Neural Tangent Kernel Analysis to Probe Convergence in Physics-informed Neural Solvers: PIKANs vs. PINNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (PIKANs), and in particular their Chebyshev-based variants (cPIKANs), have recently emerged as promising models for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, their training dynamics and convergence behavior remain largely unexplored both theoretically and numerically. In this work, we aim to advance the theoretical understanding of cPIKANs by analyzing them using Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory. Our objective is to discern the evolution of kernel structure throughout gradient-based training and its subsequent impact on learning efficiency. We first derive the NTK of standard cKANs in a supervised setting, and then extend the analysis to the physics-informed context. We analyze the spectral properties of NTK matrices, specifically their eigenvalue distributions and spectral bias, for four representative PDEs: the steady-state Helmholtz equation, transient diffusion and Allen-Cahn equations, and forced vibrations governed by the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation. We also conduct an investigation into the impact of various optimization strategies, e.g., first-order, second-order, and hybrid approaches, on the evolution of the NTK and the resulting learning dynamics. Results indicate a tractable behavior for NTK in the context of cPIKANs, which exposes learning dynamics that standard physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) cannot capture. Spectral trends also reveal when domain decomposition improves training, directly linking kernel behavior to convergence rates under different setups. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic NTK study of cPIKANs, providing theoretical insight that clarifies and predicts their empirical performance.</description>

Abstract: We derive homogenized bending shell theories starting from three dimensional nonlinear elasticity. The original three dimensional model contains three small parameters: the two homogenization scales $\varepsilon$ and $\varepsilon^2$ of the material properties and the thickness $h$ of the shell. Depending on the asymptotic ratio of these three parameters, we obtain different asymptotic theories.</description>

      <title>The Cauchy Problem for Non-Isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes/Allen-Cahn system with Degenerate Heat-Conductivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2005.11205v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Cauchy problem for non-isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes/Allen-Cahn system with degenerate heat-conductivity $\kappa(\theta)=\tilde{\kappa}\theta^\beta$ in 1-d is discussed in this paper. This system is widely used to describe the motion of immiscible two-phase flow in numerical simulation. The wellposedness for strong solution of this problem is established with the $H^1$ initial data for density, temperature, velocity, and the $H^2$ initial data for phase field. The result shows that no discontinuity of the phase field, vacuum, shock wave, mass or heat concentration will be developed at any finite time in the whole space. From the hydrodynamic point of view, this means that no matter how complex the interaction between the hydrodynamic and phase-field effects, phase separation will not occur, but the phase transition is possible.</description>

      <title>Large time behavior for the 3D Navier-Stokes with Navier boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03489v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in a smooth bounded domain $\Omega$ with initial velocity $u_0$ square-integrable, divergence-free and tangent to $\partial \Omega$. We supplement the equations with the Navier friction boundary conditions $u \cdot n = 0$ and $[(2Su)n + \alpha u]_{tang} = 0$, where $n$ is the unit exterior normal to $\partial \Omega$, $Su = (Du + (Du)^t)/2$, $\alpha \in C^0(\partial\Omega)$ is the boundary friction coefficient and $[\cdot]_{tang}$ is the projection of its argument onto the tangent space of $\partial \Omega$. We prove global existence of a weak Leray-type solution to the resulting initial-boundary value problem and exponential decay in energy norm of these solutions when friction is positive. We also prove exponential decay if friction is non-negative and the domain is not a solid of revolution. These two results are well known in the case of Dirichlet boundary condition, but, even if they have been implicitly used for the Navier boundary conditions, the comprehensive analysis is not available in the literature. After carefully studying the Stokes semigroup for such a boundary condition, we use the Galerkin method for existence, Poincar\'{e}-type inequalities, with suitable adaptations to account for the differential geometry of the boundary, and a novel integral Gronwall-type inequality. In addition, in the frictionless case $\alpha = 0$, we prove convergence of the solution to a steady rigid rotation, if the domain is a solid of revolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the conductivity problem for a homogeneous body with an inclusion of a different, but known, conductivity. Our interest concerns the associated shape derivative, i.e., the derivative of the corresponding electrostatic potential with respect to the shape of the inclusion. For a smooth inclusion it is known that the shape derivative is the solution of a specific inhomogeneous transmission problem. We show that this characterization of the shape derivative is also valid when the inclusion is a polygonal domain, but due to singularities at the vertices of the polygon, the shape derivative fails to belong to $H^1$ in this case.</description>

Abstract: We consider here a fully discrete variant of the implicit variational scheme for mean curvature flow [AlmTayWan,LucStu], in a setting where the flow is governed by a crystalline surface tension defined by the limit of pairwise interactions energy on the discrete grid. The algorithm is based on a new discrete distance from the evolving sets, which prevents the occurrence of the spatial drift and pinning phenomena identified in [MisiatsYip16,BraGelNov] in a similar discrete framework. We provide the first rigorous convergence result holding in any dimension, for any initial set and for a large class of purely crystalline anisotropies, in which the spatial discretization mesh can be of the same order or coarser than the time step.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we first define a discrete version of the fractional Laplace operator $(-\Delta)^{s}$ through the heat semigroup on a stochastically complete, connected, locally finite graph $G = (V, E, \mu, w)$. Secondly, we define the fractional divergence and give another form of $(-\Delta)^s$. The third point, and the foremost, is the introduction of the fractional Sobolev space $W^{s,2}(V)$, which is necessary when we study problems involving $(-\Delta)^{s}$. Finally, using the mountain-pass theorem and the Nehari manifold, we obtain multiplicity solutions to a discrete fractional Schr\"{o}dinger equation on $G$. We caution the readers that though these existence results are well known in the continuous case, the discrete case is quite different.</description>

Abstract: We prove a weighted Carleman estimate for a class of one-dimensional, self-adjoint Schr\"odinger operators $P(h)$ with low regularity electric and magnetic potentials, where $h &gt; 0$ is a semiclassical parameter. The long range part of either potential has bounded variation. The short range part of the magnetic potential belongs to $L^1(\mathbb{R}) \cap L^2(\mathbb{R})$, while the short range part of the electric potential is a finite signed measure. The proof is a one dimensional instance of the energy method, which is used to prove Carleman estimates in higher dimensions and in more complicated geometries. The novelty of our result lies in the weak regularity assumptions on the coefficients. As a consequence of the Carleman estimate, we establish an optimal limiting absorption resolvent estimates for $P(h)$. We also present standard applications to the distribution of resonances for $P(1)$ and to associated evolution equations.</description>

      <title>The emergence of nonlinear Jeans-type instabilities for quasilinear wave equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article contributes a key ingredient to the longstanding open problem of understanding the fully nonlinear version of Jeans instability, as highlighted by A. Rendall [Living Rev. Relativ. 8, 6 (2005)]. We establish a family of self-increasing blowup solutions for the following class of quasilinear wave equations (a model of the Peebles' and Noh-Hwang's equations) that have not previously been studied: \[
  \partial^2_t \varrho- \biggl(\frac{ \mathsf{m}^2 (\partial_{t}\varrho )^2}{(1+\varrho )^2} + 4(\mathsf{k}-\mathsf{m}^2)(1+\varrho )\biggr) \Delta \varrho = F(t,\varrho,\partial_{\mu} \varrho) \] where $F$ is given by \[
  F(t,\varrho,\partial_{\mu} \varrho):=
  \underbrace{\frac{2}{3 } \varrho (1+\varrho) }_{ \text{(i) self-increasing}} \underbrace{-\frac{1}{3} \partial_{t}\varrho }_{ \text{(ii) damping}}
  + \underbrace{\frac{4}{3} \frac{(\partial_{t}\varrho )^2}{1+\varrho } }_{\text{(iii) Riccati}} + \underbrace{ \biggl(\mathsf{m}^2 \frac{ (\partial_{t}\varrho )^2}{(1+\varrho )^2} + 4(\mathsf{k}-\mathsf{m}^2) (1+\varrho ) \biggr) q^i \partial_{i}\varrho }_{\text{(iv) convection}} - \mathtt{K}^{ij} \partial_{i}\varrho\partial_{j}\varrho. \] The result implies the solutions can attain arbitrarily large values over time, leading to self-increasing singularities at some future endpoints of null geodesics provided the inhomogeneous perturbations of data are sufficiently small. Moreover, the solution exhibits almost blowup behavior in the long-wavelength domain. This phenomenon is referred to as the nonlinear Jeans-type instability because this wave equation is closely related to the nonlinear version of the Jeans instability problem in the Euler-Poisson and Einstein-Euler systems, which characterizes the formation of nonlinear structures in the universe. The growth rate of $\varrho$ is significantly faster than that of the solutions to the classical linearized Jeans instability.</description>

      <title>Global existence for wave equations with scale-invariant time-dependent damping and time derivative nonlinearity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the Cauchy problem for wave equations with scale-invariant time-dependent damping and nonlinear time-derivative terms, modeled as $$\partial_{t}^2u- \Delta u +\frac{\mu}{1+t}\partial_tu= f(\partial_tu), \quad x\in \mathbb{R}^n, t&gt;0,$$ where $f(\partial_tu)=|\partial_tu|^p $ or $|\partial_tu|^{p-1}\partial_tu$ with $p&gt;1$ and $\mu&gt;0$. We prove global existence of small data solutions in low dimensions $1\leq n\leq 3$ by using energy estimates in appropriate Sobolev spaces. Our primary contribution is an existence result for $p&gt;1+\frac2{\mu}$, in the one-dimensional case, when $\mu \le 2$, which in conjunction with prior blow-up results from \cite{Our2}, establish that the critical exponent for small data solutions in one dimension is $p_G(1,\mu)=1+\frac2{\mu}$, when $\mu \le 2$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first identification of the critical exponent range for the time-dependent damped wave equations with scale-invariant and time-derivative nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>An Eulerian-Lagrangian formulation for compressible Euler Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13414v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel Eulerian-Lagrangian formulation for the compressible isentropic Euler equations with a general pressure law. Using the developed Lagrangian formulation, we show a short-time solution which is unique in the framework of Bessel space $H_{p}^{\beta}(\mathbb{T}^{d})$ for $\beta&gt;\frac{d}{p}+1$. The proof is precise and relatively simple, relying on the application of the Implicit Function Theorem in Banach spaces combined with a carefully designed regularization procedure. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the Lagrangian formulation has been employed to show local wellposedness for compressible Euler equations. Moreover, it can be adaptableto $C^{k,\alpha}$ spaces, and notably Besov type spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Boltzmann equation is a fundamental equation in kinetic theory that describes the motion of rarefied gases. In this study, we examine the Boltzmann equation within a $C^1$ bounded domain, subject to a large external potential $\Phi(x)$ and diffuse reflection boundary conditions. Initially, we prove the asymptotic stability of small perturbations near the local Maxwellian $\mu_E (x,v)$. Subsequently, we demonstrate the asymptotic stability of large amplitude solutions with initial data that is arbitrarily large in (weighted) $L^\infty$, but sufficiently small in the sense of relative entropy. Specifically, we extend the results for large amplitude solutions of the Boltzmann equation (with or without external potential) [10, 11, 12, 23] to scenarios involving significant external potentials [19, 28] under diffuse reflection boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>On the uniqueness of tangent cones to area minimizing currents at boundaries with arbitrary multiplicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an area minimizing current $T$ in a $C^2$ submanifold $\Sigma$ of $\mathbb{R}^{m+n}$, with arbitrary integer boundary multiplicity $\partial T = Q [\![ \Gamma ]\!]$ where $\Gamma$ is a $C^2$ submanifold of $\Sigma$. We show that at every density $Q/2$ boundary point the tangent cone to $T$ is unique and there is a power rate of convergence to the unique tangent cone.
  In particular, if $\Gamma$ is a closed manifold which lies at the boundary of a uniformly convex set $\Omega$ and $\Sigma=\mathbb{R}^{m+n}$ then $T$ has a unique tangent cone at every boundary point.
  As a structural consequence of the uniqueness of the tangent cone, we obtain a decomposition theorem which is the starting point of the boundary regularity theory we develop in another paper in collaboration with Reinaldo Resende. The regularity theory we obtain generalizes Allard's boundary regularity theorem to a higher multiplicity setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fixed angle inverse scattering problem for a velocity consists in determining a sound speed, or a Riemannian metric up to diffeomorphism, from measurements obtained by probing the medium with a single plane wave. This is a formally determined inverse problem that is open in general. In this article we consider the rigidity question of distinguishing a sound speed or a Riemannian metric from the Euclidean metric. We prove that a general smooth metric that is Euclidean outside a ball can be distinguished from the Euclidean metric. The methods involve distorted plane waves and a combination of geometric, topological and unique continuation arguments.</description>

      <title>Critical exponent for the one-dimensional wave equation with a space-dependent scale invariant damping and time derivative nonlinearity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate in this paper the Cauchy problem of the one-dimensional wave equation with space-dependent damping of the form $\mu_0(1+x^2)^{-1/2}$, where $\mu_0&gt;0$,
  and time derivative nonlinearity.
  We establish global existence of mild solutions for small data compactly supported by employing energy estimates within suitable Sobolev spaces of the associated homogeneous problem.
  Furthermore, we derive a blow-up result under some positive initial data by employing the test function method. This shows that the critical exponent is given by $p_G(1+\mu_0)=1+2/\mu_0$, when $\mu_0\in (0,1]$, where $p_G$ is the Glassey exponent. To the best of our knowledge, this constitutes the first identification of the critical exponent range for this class of equations. As by product, we extend the global existence result to a more general class of space/time nonlinearities of the form $f(\partial_tu,\partial_x u)=|\partial_x u|^{q}$ or $f(\partial_tu,\partial_x u)=|\partial_tu|^{p}|\partial_x u|^{q}$, with $p,q&gt;1$.</description>

      <title>Well-Posedness of Contact Discontinuity Solutions and Vanishing Pressure Limit for the Aw-Rascle Traffic Flow Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the well-posedness of contact discontinuity solutions and the vanishing pressure limit for the Aw-Rascle traffic flow model with general pressure functions. The well-posedness problem is formulated as a free boundary problem, where initial discontinuities propagate along linearly degenerate characteristics. To address vacuum degeneracy, a condition at density jump points is introduced, ensuring a uniform lower bound for density. The Lagrangian coordinate transformation is applied to fix the contact discontinuity.The well-posedness of contact discontinuity solutions is established, showing that compressive initial data leads to finite-time blow-up of the velocity gradient, while rarefactive initial data ensures global existence. For the vanishing pressure limit, uniform estimates of velocity gradients and density are derived via level set argument. The contact discontinuity solutions of the Aw-Rascle system are shown to converge to those of the pressureless Euler equations, with matched convergence rates for characteristic triangles and discontinuity lines. Furthermore, under the conditions of pressure, enhanced regularity in non-discontinuous regions yields convergence of blow-up times.</description>

Under suitable assumptions on the $\beta_{ij}$'s, given a non-degenerate critical point $\xi_0$ of a suitable linear combination of the potentials $V_i$, we build solutions whose components concentrate at $\xi_0$ as the prescribed global mass $\mu$ is either large (when $N=1$) or small (when $N=3$) or it approaches some critical threshold (when $N=2$).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with an interaction problem between a full compressible, electrically conducting fluid and a thermoelastic shell in a two-dimensional setting. The shell is modelled by linear thermoelasticity equations, and encompasses a time-dependent domain which is filled with a fluid described by full compressible (non-resistive) magnetohydrodynamic equations. The magnetohydrodynamic flow and the shell are fully coupled, resulting in a fluid-structure interaction problem that involves heat exchange. We establish the existence of weak solutions through domain extension, operator splitting, decoupling, penalization of the interface condition, and appropriate limit passages.</description>

Abstract: We study the obstacle problem associated with the American chooser option. The obstacle is given by the maximum of an American call option and an American put option, which, in turn, can be expressed as the maximum of the solutions to the corresponding obstacle problems. This structure makes the obstacle problem particularly challenging and non-trivial. Using theoretical analysis, we overcome these difficulties and establish the existence and uniqueness of a strong solution. Furthermore, we rigorously prove the monotonicity and smoothness of the free boundary arising from the obstacle problem.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by a recent result of Funano's, we provide a sharp quantitative comparison result between the first nontrivial eigenvalues of the Neumann Laplacian on bounded convex domains $\Omega_{1} \subset \Omega_{2}$ in any dimension $d$ greater than or equal to two, recovering domain monotonicity up to an explicit multiplicative factor. We provide upper and lower bounds for such multiplicative factors for higher-order eigenvalues, and study their behaviour with respect to the dimension and order. We further consider different scenarios where convexity is no longer imposed. In a final section we formulate some related open problems.</description>

      <title>Defending Against Diverse Attacks in Federated Learning Through Consensus-Based Bi-Level Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02535v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose significant challenges in many machine learning applications, particularly in the setting of distributed training and federated learning, where malicious agents seek to corrupt the training process with the goal of jeopardizing and compromising the performance and reliability of the final models. In this paper, we address the problem of robust federated learning in the presence of such attacks by formulating the training task as a bi-level optimization problem. We conduct a theoretical analysis of the resilience of consensus-based bi-level optimization (CB$^2$O), an interacting multi-particle metaheuristic optimization method, in adversarial settings. Specifically, we provide a global convergence analysis of CB$^2$O in mean-field law in the presence of malicious agents, demonstrating the robustness of CB$^2$O against a diverse range of attacks. Thereby, we offer insights into how specific hyperparameter choices enable to mitigate adversarial effects. On the practical side, we extend CB$^2$O to the clustered federated learning setting by proposing FedCB$^2$O, a novel interacting multi-particle system, and design a practical algorithm that addresses the demands of real-world applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate the robustness of the FedCB$^2$O algorithm against label-flipping attacks in decentralized clustered federated learning scenarios, showcasing its effectiveness in practical contexts.</description>

      <title>Finite-PINN: A Physics-Informed Neural Network with Finite Geometric Encoding for Solid Mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09453v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: PINN models have demonstrated capabilities in addressing fluid PDE problems, and their potential in solid mechanics is beginning to emerge. This study identifies two key challenges when using PINN to solve general solid mechanics problems. These challenges become evident when comparing the limitations of PINN with the well-established numerical methods commonly used in solid mechanics, such as the finite element method (FEM). Specifically: a) PINN models generate solutions over an infinite domain, which conflicts with the finite boundaries typical of most solid structures; and b) the solution space utilised by PINN is Euclidean, which is inadequate for addressing the complex geometries often present in solid structures.
  This work presents a PINN architecture for general solid mechanics problems, referred to as the Finite-PINN model. The model is designed to effectively tackle two key challenges, while retaining as much of the original PINN framework as possible. To this end, the Finite-PINN incorporates finite geometric encoding into the neural network inputs, thereby transforming the solution space from a conventional Euclidean space into a hybrid Euclidean-topological space. The model is comprehensively trained using both strong-form and weak-form loss formulations, enabling its application to a wide range of forward and inverse problems in solid mechanics. For forward problems, the Finite-PINN model efficiently approximates solutions to solid mechanics problems when the geometric information of a given structure has been preprocessed. For inverse problems, it effectively reconstructs full-field solutions from very sparse observations by embedding both physical laws and geometric information within its architecture.</description>

Abstract: Numerical and experimental studies have demonstrated the drag-reducing potential of carefully designed streamwise-elongated riblets in lowering skin-friction drag. To support the systematic design of such surface corrugations, recent efforts have integrated simplified versions of the governing equations with innovative methods for representing the effects of rough boundaries on flow dynamics. Notably, the statistical response of the eddy-viscosity-enhanced linearized Navier-Stokes equations has been shown to effectively capture the ability of riblets in suppressing turbulence, quantify the influence of background turbulence on the mean velocity, and reproduce established drag-reduction trends. In this paper, we enhance the flexibility and computational efficiency of this simulation-free approach by implementing a domain transformation for surface representation, along with a perturbation analysis on a small geometric parameter of the riblets. While domain transformation complicates the differential equations, it provides accurate boundary representations and facilitates the analysis of complex riblet shapes at high Reynolds numbers by enabling perturbation analysis to simplify the dimensional complexity of the governing equations. Our method successfully predicts drag reduction trends for triangular and scalloped riblets, consistent with existing literature. We further utilize our framework to investigate flow mechanisms influenced by riblets and extend our study to channel flows with friction Reynolds numbers up to 2003. Our findings reveal the emergence of K-H rollers over large and sharp scalloped riblets, contributing to the degradation of drag reduction in these geometries. Additionally, we examine the impact of riblets on near-wall flow structures, focusing on their suppression of streamwise-elongated structures in flows over large riblets.</description>

      <title>BridgeNet: A Hybrid, Physics-Informed Machine Learning Framework for Solving High-Dimensional Fokker-Planck Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04354</link>

Abstract: BridgeNet is a novel hybrid framework that integrates convolutional neural networks with physics-informed neural networks to efficiently solve non-linear, high-dimensional Fokker-Planck equations (FPEs). Traditional PINNs, which typically rely on fully connected architectures, often struggle to capture complex spatial hierarchies and enforce intricate boundary conditions. In contrast, BridgeNet leverages adaptive CNN layers for effective local feature extraction and incorporates a dynamically weighted loss function that rigorously enforces physical constraints. Extensive numerical experiments across various test cases demonstrate that BridgeNet not only achieves significantly lower error metrics and faster convergence compared to conventional PINN approaches but also maintains robust stability in high-dimensional settings. This work represents a substantial advancement in computational physics, offering a scalable and accurate solution methodology with promising applications in fields ranging from financial mathematics to complex system dynamics.</description>
