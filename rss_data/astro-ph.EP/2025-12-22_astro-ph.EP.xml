      <title>Towards an Agnostic Algorithm for Sampling Empirical Structure Models: The case of Uranus and Neptune</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an algorithm to efficiently sample the full space of planetary interior density profiles. Our approach uses as few assumptions as possible to pursue an agnostic algorithm. The algorithm avoid the common Markov Chain Monte Carlo method for an optimisation-based gradient descent approach designed for computational efficiency. In this work, we use Uranus and Neptune as test cases and obtain empirical models that provide density and pressure profiles consistent with the observed physical properties (total mass, radius, and gravitational moments). We compare our findings to other work and find that while other studies are generally in line with our findings, they do not cover the entire space of solutions faithfully. Furthermore, we present guidance for modellers that construct Uranus or Neptune interior models with a fixed number of layers. We provide a statistical relation between the steepness classifying a density discontinuity and the resulting number of discontinuities to be expected. For example, if one classifies a discontinuity as a density gradient larger than 0.02 kg m$^{-4}$, then most solutions should have at most one such discontinuity. Finally, we find that discontinuities, if present, are concentrated around a planetary normalised radius of 0.65 for Uranus and 0.7 for Neptune. Our algorithm to efficiently and faithfully investigate the full space of possible interior density profiles can be used to study all planetary objects with gravitational field data.</description>

      <title>On the Divergent Evolution of Io and Europa as Primordial Ocean Worlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Galilean moons exhibit a decrease in bulk density with distance from Jupiter, which may reflect differences in evolutionary paths and water loss. Early in its history, Jupiter was more luminous and may have driven substantial atmospheric escape on Io and Europa. We investigate whether Io could have lost its water inventory while Europa retained its volatiles, assuming both moons initially accreted hydrous silicates. The formation and early thermal evolution of the protosatellites are modeled using an interior evolution model coupled with an atmospheric escape framework. Dehydration timescales and volatile losses for Io and Europa are computed during their early evolution, accounting for accretional heating from both satellitesimal and pebble accretion, as well as irradiation from Jupiter's primordial luminosity. Europa likely retained most of its volatiles under nearly all plausible formation and evolution scenarios, as large-scale dehydration would have taken place only after the first 10 Myr of its evolution. In contrast, Io was unlikely to lose a substantial amount of water through atmospheric escape and therefore probably accreted predominantly anhydrous silicates. If Europa initially accreted hydrous minerals, the present-day volatile contrast between Io and Europa could be explained by their relative locations with respect to the phyllosilicate dehydration line in the Jovian subnebula. Distinct evolutionary pathways or atmospheric escape processes alone appear insufficient to reproduce the observed differences.</description>

      <title>Hidden Companions of the Early Milky Way I. New alpha-Enhanced Exoplanet Hosts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planet formation in the chemically ancient, dynamically heated Galactic thick disc remains poorly constrained, owing to the expectation that its low solid reservoirs, short disc lifetimes, and harsh irradiation environments inhibit efficient assembly of planetary bodies. However, an increasing number of confirmed thick disc planet hosts now challenge this view, indicating that planetary formation and survival in the early Milky Way may have been more resilient -- and more diverse -- than standard disc-evolution models suggest. Here we present a homogeneous characterisation of 38 exoplanetary systems orbiting bona fide thick disc stars, combining new detections with a systematic reassessment of archival systems. High-precision radial velocities and space-based transit photometry, combined with uniform high-resolution spectroscopy, yield self-consistent stellar and planetary parameters, and thick disc membership is secured via joint chemical and kinematic criteria. Among these systems, we identify two remarkably low-density, inflated planets -- TOI-1927 b and TOI-2643 b -- representing the first puffy planets known to orbit thick disc stars, and an outcome that is highly unexpected in metal-poor environments, thereby challenging current models of atmospheric retention and thermal inflation at low metallicity. This consolidated sample establishes a new empirical baseline for understanding how planetary architectures emerge under the depleted, short-lived discs characteristic of the early Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Surveying Ultra-hot Jupiters using Phase Curves with $\textit{Twinkle}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to their high equilibrium temperatures ($T_{eq}$ $&gt;$ 2000 K), ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJs) are the best characterized exoplanets to date. However, many questions about their formation, evolution, and atmospheres remain unanswered. Phase curve observations can reveal answers to these questions by constraining multiple atmospheric properties including circulation, albedo, and chemistry. To this end, we simulate and forecast a survey of UHJ atmospheres via phase curve observations with the upcoming $\textit{Twinkle}$ mission. $\textit{Twinkle}$ is a spectroscopic satellite covering 0.5--4.5 micron with a spectral resolving power of R $\sim$ 50--70. Using a physically motivated model, we simulate white-light photometric phase curve observations for 14 UHJs in $\textit{Twinkle's}$ field of regard. We project that $\textit{Twinkle}$ will be able to detect all phase curve signals in our survey. Additionally, we simulate spectroscopic phase curves for the UHJ, WASP-189b. From our simulated spectroscopic phase curves, we generate mock phase-resolved emission spectra. Previously detected UHJ molecules (e.g. H$_2$O, CO and CO$_2$) produce notable features in the resulting spectra, allowing for detailed atmospheric characterization to study the 3D structure of UHJ atmospheric chemistry and dynamics. For planets with hotspot phase offsets, $\textit{Twinkle}$ will be capable of detecting them both in the optical and infrared wavelength ranges. This future survey would represent the first UHJ phase curve survey with simultaneous coverage in optical and infrared wavelengths and will provide new constraints and reveal intriguing trends in these extreme environments.</description>

      <title>A Near-Earth Object Model Calibrated to Earth Impactors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The population of Earth-impacting meteoroids and its size-dependent orbital elements are key to understanding the origin of meteorites and informing on planetary defence efforts. Outstanding questions include the role of collisions in depleting meteoroids on highly evolved orbits and the relative importance of delivery resonances. Those depend on size, with current dynamical models considering only asteroids larger than 10m in diameter. Based on 1,202 sporadic meteoroids observed by the Global Fireball Observatory, we created a debiased model of the near-Earth meteoroid population in the 10g - 150kg in size (approximately 1cm - 0.5m) as they dynamically evolved from the main asteroid belt onto Earth-crossing orbits. The observed impact population is best matched with a collisional half-life decreasing from 3Myr for meteoroids of 0.6kg (7cm) or higher, to 1Myr below this size, extending to the model lower bound of 10g. Placing our results in context with near-Earth object models for larger sizes, we find that the inner main belt continues to dominate feeding the small 1m to 10m diameter population primarily via the $\nu_6$ secular resonance and the 3:1J mean motion resonance. We also evaluated the potential significance of physical processes other than collisions on Earth-impacting meteoroids, such as low-perihelion disruptions from thermal stresses.</description>

      <title>Surrogate-Accelerated Bayesian Inversion for Exoplanet Interior Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing the interior structure of exoplanets is an inverse problem often solved using Bayesian inference, but this approach is hampered by the high computational cost of planetary structure models. To overcome this barrier, we present a robust framework that accelerates inference by replacing the computationally expensive physics-based forward model with a fast polynomial chaos-Kriging (PCK) surrogate directly within a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling loop. We rigorously validate our approach using a suite of tests, including a direct comparison against a benchmark MCMC inference using the full forward model, and a large-scale coverage study with 1000 synthetic test cases to demonstrate the statistical reliability of our inferred credible intervals. Our surrogate-assisted framework achieves a computational speedup of over 2 orders of magnitude (factor of $\sim$320), reducing single-CPU inference times from days to minutes. This efficiency is achieved with a surrogate that requires only a few hundred forward model evaluations for training \rev{for a single planet}. This data efficiency provides significant flexibility for model developments and a clear advantage over common machine learning approaches, which typically demand vast training sets ($&gt;10^6$ model runs) and intensive pre-computation. The PCK surrogate maintains high fidelity with $R^2 &gt; 0.99$ for most scenarios, and root-mean-square errors typically an order of magnitude smaller than observational uncertainties. This efficiency enables large scale population studies while preserving statistical robustness, which is computationally impractical with traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Exoplanets in reflected starlight with dual-field interferometry and a fifth Unit Telescope at VLTI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this white paper, we propose an upgrade to the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) consisting of the addition of a new 8m Unit Telescope (UT5). The primary goal of this upgrade is to optimise the VLTI for exoplanet detection by creating four additional baselines of approximately 200m oriented toward the north-west. The inclusion of this telescope would reduce the inner working angle and improve the achievable contrast of the VLTI, thereby enabling the detection of mature exoplanets in reflected light.</description>

      <title>The mass distribution of clumpy accretion onto the nearby young star TW Hya</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of high time-resolution and decades-long monitoring of classical T Tauri stars provides a vast opportunity to test the variability of the star-disk connections. However, most monitoring surveys use single broad-band filters, which makes the conversion of photometric variability into accretion rate difficult. In this study, we analyze accretion bursts onto the nearby young star TW Hya over short (hours, days) and long (months, years) timescales by calibrating TESS and ASAS-SN $g$-band photometry to accretion rates with simultaneous spectroscopy. The high cadence TESS light curve shows bursts of accretion in clumps with masses from a sensitivity limit of $\sim10^{-13}$~M$_\odot$ up to $3\times 10^{-11}$\,M$_\odot$. The average burst duration of 1.8 days is longer than a simple estimate of the thermal response timescale, supporting the interpretation that the photometric variability probes the instantaneous accretion rate. The reset timescale of 1.2--2 days derived from the structure function and previously reported quasi-periods of 3.5--4 days are consistent with bursts that may be related to the different rotation between the stellar magnetosphere and inner disk or with azimuthal asymmetries in the inner disk. The near-daily ASAS-SN light curve across 8 years reveals some seasonal changes in brightness with a standard deviation of $\sim 0.13$ mag, about half of the scatter seen on short timescales. This study demonstrates the importance of coordinating contemporaneous multi-epoch spectroscopy with time domain surveys to interpret light curves of young stars.</description>

      <title>Exoplanets synchronization: Learning from Venus' retrograde rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context: Planets in the HZ can have dense atmospheres affecting their rotations. Over time, the rotation tends to stationary solutions that can be synchronous or asynchronous. Aims: Our understanding of Venus's rotational dynamics is revisited to look at what might happen to exoplanets in the habitable zone of a solar-type star. Methods. The creep tide theory is used to calculate the gravitational tidal torque. Mathematical analysis is used to study the differential equation resulting from the joint contributions of tidal and atmospheric torques. Results. The formation of a dense atmosphere can alter the primordial rotation of the planet. One possibility is that it gradually becomes retrograde. The rotation of Venus is an example.</description>

      <title>SPHEREx Pre-Perihelion Mapping of $\mathrm{H_2O}$, $\mathrm{CO_2}$, and $\mathrm{CO}$ in Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: From 01- to 15-Aug-2025 UT, the SPHEREx spacecraft observed interstellar object 3I/ATLAS. Using $R = 40$-$130$ spectrophotometry at $\lambda = 0.7$-$5\mu$m, light curves, spectra, and imaging of 3I were obtained. From these, robust detections of water gas emission at $2.7$-$2.8\,\mu$m and CO$_2$ gas at $4.23$-$4.27\,\mu$m plus tentative detections of $^{13}$CO$_2$ and CO gas were found. A slightly extended H$_2$O coma was detected, and a huge CO$_2$ atmosphere extending out to at least $4.2\times10^{5}\,$km was discovered. Gas production rates for H$_2$O, $^{12}$CO$_2$, $^{13}$CO$_2$, and CO were $Q_{\mathrm{gas}} = 3.2\times10^{26} \pm 20\%$, $1.6\times10^{27} \pm 10\%$, $1.3\times10^{25} \pm 25\%$, and $1.0\times10^{26} \pm 25\%$, respectively. Co-addition of all $\lambda = 1.0$-$1.5\,\mu$m scattered light continuum images produced a high SNR image consistent with an unresolved source. The scattered light lightcurve showed $\lesssim 15\%$ variability over the observation period. The absolute brightness of 3I at $1.0$-$1.5\,\mu$m is consistent with a $&lt; 2.5\,$km radius nucleus surrounded by a 100 times brighter coma. The $1.5$-$4.0\,\mu$m continuum structure shows a strong feature commensurate with water ice absorption seen in KBOs and distant comets. The observed cometary behavior of 3I, including its preponderance of CO$_2$ emission, lack of CO output, small size, and predominance of large icy chunks of material in a flux-dominant coma is reminiscent of the behavior of short period comet 103P/Hartley 2, target of the NASA Deep Impact extended mission in 2010 and a ``hyperactive comet'' near the end of its outgassing lifetime. This correspondence places 3I closer to barely- or non-active 1I/Oumuamua than primitive, ice rich 2I/Borisov, suggesting that ISOs are often highly thermally processed before ejection into the ISM.</description>
