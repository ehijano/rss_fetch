      <title>Coboundary expansion inside Chevalley coset complex HDXs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent major results in property testing~\cite{BLM24,DDL24} and PCPs~\cite{BMV24} were unlocked by moving to high-dimensional expanders (HDXs) constructed from $\widetilde{C}_d$-type buildings, rather than the long-known $\widetilde{A}_d$-type ones. At the same time, these building quotient HDXs are not as easy to understand as the more elementary (and more symmetric/explicit) \emph{coset complex} HDXs constructed by Kaufman--Oppenheim~\cite{KO18} (of $A_d$-type) and O'Donnell--Pratt~\cite{OP22} (of $B_d$-, $C_d$-, $D_d$-type). Motivated by these considerations, we study the $B_3$-type generalization of a recent work of Kaufman--Oppenheim~\cite{KO21}, which showed that the $A_3$-type coset complex HDXs have good $1$-coboundary expansion in their links, and thus yield $2$-dimensional topological expanders.
  The crux of Kaufman--Oppenheim's proof of $1$-coboundary expansion was: (1)~identifying a group-theoretic result by Biss and Dasgupta~\cite{BD01} on small presentations for the $A_3$-unipotent group over~$\mathbb{F}_q$; (2)~``lifting'' it to an analogous result for an $A_3$-unipotent group over polynomial extensions~$\mathbb{F}_q[x]$.
  For our $B_3$-type generalization, the analogue of~(1) appears to not hold. We manage to circumvent this with a significantly more involved strategy: (1)~getting a computer-assisted proof of vanishing $1$-cohomology of $B_3$-type unipotent groups over~$\mathbb{F}_5$; (2)~developing significant new ``lifting'' technology to deduce the required quantitative $1$-cohomology results in $B_3$-type unipotent groups over $\mathbb{F}_{5^k}[x]$.</description>

      <title>Efficient Classical Computation of Single-Qubit Marginal Measurement Probabilities to Simulate Certain Classes of Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical simulations of quantum circuits are essential for verifying and benchmarking quantum algorithms, particularly for large circuits, where computational demands increase exponentially with the number of qubits. Among available methods, the classical simulation of quantum circuits inspired by density functional theory -- the so-called QC-DFT method, shows promise for large circuit simulations as it approximates the quantum circuits using single-qubit reduced density matrices to model multi-qubit systems. However, the QC-DFT method performs very poorly when dealing with multi-qubit gates. In this work, we introduce a novel CNOT "functional" that leverages neural networks to generate unitary transformations, effectively mitigating the simulation errors observed in the original QC-DFT method. For random circuit simulations, our modified QC-DFT enables efficient computation of single-qubit marginal measurement probabilities, or single-qubit probability (SQPs), and achieves lower SQP errors and higher fidelities than the original QC-DFT method. Despite limitations in capturing full entanglement and joint probability distributions, we find potential applications of SQPs in simulating Shor's and Grover's algorithms for specific solution classes. These findings advance the capabilities of classical simulations for some quantum problems and provide insights into managing entanglement and gate errors in practical quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions via Complex Extensions of Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study algebraic properties of partition functions, particularly the location of zeros, through the lens of rapidly mixing Markov chains. The classical Lee-Yang program initiated the study of phase transitions via locating complex zeros of partition functions. Markov chains, besides serving as algorithms, have also been used to model physical processes tending to equilibrium. In many scenarios, rapid mixing of Markov chains coincides with the absence of phase transitions (complex zeros). Prior works have shown that the absence of phase transitions implies rapid mixing of Markov chains. We reveal a converse connection by lifting probabilistic tools for the analysis of Markov chains to study complex zeros of partition functions.
  Our motivating example is the independence polynomial on $k$-uniform hypergraphs, where the best-known zero-free regime has been significantly lagging behind the regime where we have rapidly mixing Markov chains for the underlying hypergraph independent sets. Specifically, the Glauber dynamics is known to mix rapidly on independent sets in a $k$-uniform hypergraph of maximum degree $\Delta$ provided that $\Delta \lesssim 2^{k/2}$. On the other hand, the best-known zero-freeness around the point $1$ of the independence polynomial on $k$-uniform hypergraphs requires $\Delta \le 5$, the same bound as on a graph.
  By introducing a complex extension of Markov chains, we lift an existing percolation argument to the complex plane, and show that if $\Delta \lesssim 2^{k/2}$, the Markov chain converges in a complex neighborhood, and the independence polynomial itself does not vanish in the same neighborhood. In the same regime, our result also implies central limit theorems for the size of a uniformly random independent set, and deterministic approximation algorithms for the number of hypergraph independent sets of size $k \le \alpha n$ for some constant $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>Optical orthogonal codes from a combinatorial perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical orthogonal codes (OOCs) are sets of $(0,1)$-sequences with good auto- and cross- correlation properties. They were originally introduced for use in multi-access communication, particularly in the setting of optical CDMA communications systems. They can also be formulated in terms of families of subsets of $\Z_v$, where the correlation properties can be expressed in terms of conditions on the internal and external differences within and between the subsets. With this link there have been many studies on their combinatorial properties. However, in most of these studies it is assumed that the auto- and cross-correlation values are equal; in particular, many constructions focus on the case where both correlation values are $1$. This is not a requirement of the original communications application. In this paper, we "decouple" the two correlation values and consider the situation with correlation values greater than $1$. We consider the bounds on each of the correlation values, and the structural implications of meeting these separately, as well as associated links with other combinatorial objects. We survey definitions, properties and constructions, establish some new connections and concepts, and discuss open questions.</description>

      <title>Hyperplanes Avoiding Problem and Integer Points Counting in Polyhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our work, we consider the problem of computing a vector $x \in Z^n$ of minimum $\|\cdot\|_p$-norm such that $a^\top x \not= a_0$, for any vector $(a,a_0)$ from a given subset of $Z^n$ of size $m$. In other words, we search for a vector of minimum norm that avoids a given finite set of hyperplanes, which is natural to call as the $\textit{Hyperplanes Avoiding Problem}$. This problem naturally appears as a subproblem in Barvinok-type algorithms for counting integer points in polyhedra. More precisely, it appears when one needs to evaluate certain rational generating functions in an avoidable critical point. We show that:
  1) With respect to $\|\cdot\|_1$, the problem admits a feasible solution $x$ with $\|x\|_1 \leq (m+n)/2$, and show that such solution can be constructed by a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm with $O(n \cdot m)$ operations. Moreover, this inequality is the best possible. This is a significant improvement over the previous randomized algorithm, which computes $x$ with a guaranty $\|x\|_{1} \leq n \cdot m$. The original approach of A.~Barvinok can guarantee only $\|x\|_1 = O\bigl((n \cdot m)^n\bigr)$;
  2) The problem is NP-hard with respect to any norm $\|\cdot\|_p$, for $p \in \bigl(R_{\geq 1} \cup \{\infty\}\bigr)$.
  3) As an application, we show that the problem to count integer points in a polytope $P = \{x \in R^n \colon A x \leq b\}$, for given $A \in Z^{m \times n}$ and $b \in Q^m$, can be solved by an algorithm with $O\bigl(\nu^2 \cdot n^3 \cdot \Delta^3 \bigr)$ operations, where $\nu$ is the maximum size of a normal fan triangulation of $P$, and $\Delta$ is the maximum value of rank-order subdeterminants of $A$. It refines the previous state-of-the-art $O\bigl(\nu^2 \cdot n^4 \cdot \Delta^3\bigr)$-time algorithm.</description>

      <title>Soft happy colourings and community structure of networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $0&lt;\rho\leq 1$, a $\rho$-happy vertex $v$ in a coloured graph $G$ has at least $\rho\cdot \mathrm{deg}(v)$ same-colour neighbours, and a $\rho$-happy colouring (aka soft happy colouring) of $G$ is a vertex colouring that makes all the vertices $\rho$-happy. A community is a subgraph whose vertices are more adjacent to themselves than the rest of the vertices. Graphs with community structures can be modelled by random graph models such as the stochastic block model (SBM). In this paper, we present several theorems showing that both of these notions are related, with numerous real-world applications. We show that, with high probability, communities of graphs in the stochastic block model induce $\rho$-happy colouring on all vertices if certain conditions on the model parameters are satisfied. Moreover, a probabilistic threshold on $\rho$ is derived so that communities of a graph in the SBM induce a $\rho$-happy colouring. Furthermore, the asymptotic behaviour of $\rho$-happy colouring induced by the graph's communities is discussed when $\rho$ is less than a threshold. We develop heuristic polynomial-time algorithms for soft happy colouring that often correlate with the graphs' community structure. Finally, we present an experimental evaluation to compare the performance of the proposed algorithms thereby demonstrating the validity of the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Optimal Padded Decomposition For Bounded Treewidth Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A $(\beta,\delta,\Delta)$-padded decomposition of an edge-weighted graph $G = (V,E,w)$ is a stochastic decomposition into clusters of diameter at most $\Delta$ such that for every vertex $v\in V$, the probability that $\rm{ball}_G(v,\gamma\Delta)$ is entirely contained in the cluster containing $v$ is at least $e^{-\beta\gamma}$ for every $\gamma \in [0,\delta]$. Padded decompositions have been studied for decades and have found numerous applications, including metric embedding, multicommodity flow-cut gap, multicut, and zero extension problems, to name a few. In these applications, parameter $\beta$, called the padding parameter, is the most important parameter since it decides either the distortion or the approximation ratios. For general graphs with $n$ vertices, $\beta = \Theta(\log n)$. Klein, Plotkin, and Rao showed that $K_r$-minor-free graphs have padding parameter $\beta = O(r^3)$, which is a significant improvement over general graphs when $r$ is a constant. A long-standing conjecture is to construct a padded decomposition for $K_r$-minor-free graphs with padding parameter $\beta = O(\log r)$. Despite decades of research, the best-known result is $\beta = O(r)$, even for graphs with treewidth at most $r$. In this work, we make significant progress toward the aforementioned conjecture by showing that graphs with treewidth $\rm{tw}$ admit a padded decomposition with padding parameter $O(\log \rm{tw})$, which is tight. As corollaries, we obtain an exponential improvement in dependency on treewidth in a host of algorithmic applications: $O(\sqrt{ \log n \cdot \log(\rm{tw})})$ flow-cut gap, max flow-min multicut ratio of $O(\log(\rm{tw}))$, an $O(\log(\rm{tw}))$ approximation for the 0-extension problem, an $\ell^{O(\log n)}_\infty$ embedding with distortion $O(\log \rm{tw})$, and an $O(\log \rm{tw})$ bound for integrality gap for the uniform sparsest cut.</description>
