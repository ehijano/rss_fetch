      <title>Pseudo-perplexity in One Fell Swoop for Protein Fitness Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protein language models trained on the masked language modeling objective learn to predict the identity of hidden amino acid residues within a sequence using the remaining observable sequence as context. They do so by embedding the residues into a high dimensional space that encapsulates the relevant contextual cues. These embedding vectors serve as an informative context-sensitive representation that not only aids with the defined training objective, but can also be used for other tasks by downstream models. We propose a scheme to use the embeddings of an unmasked sequence to estimate the corresponding masked probability vectors for all the positions in a single forward pass through the language model. This One Fell Swoop (OFS) approach allows us to efficiently estimate the pseudo-perplexity of the sequence, a measure of the model's uncertainty in its predictions, that can also serve as a fitness estimate. We find that ESM2 OFS pseudo-perplexity performs nearly as well as the true pseudo-perplexity at fitness estimation, and more notably it defines a new state of the art on the ProteinGym Indels benchmark. The strong performance of the fitness measure prompted us to investigate if it could be used to detect the elevated stability reported in reconstructed ancestral sequences. We find that this measure ranks ancestral reconstructions as more fit than extant sequences. Finally, we show that the computational efficiency of the technique allows for the use of Monte Carlo methods that can rapidly explore functional sequence space.</description>

      <title>High-Performance Sorting-Based k-mer Counting in Distributed Memory with Flexible Hybrid Parallelism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In generating large quantities of DNA data, high-throughput sequencing technologies require advanced bioinformatics infrastructures for efficient data analysis. k-mer counting, the process of quantifying the frequency of fixed-length k DNA subsequences, is a fundamental step in various bioinformatics pipelines, including genome assembly and protein prediction. Due to the growing volume of data, the scaling of the counting process is critical. In the literature, distributed memory software uses hash tables, which exhibit poor cache friendliness and consume excessive memory. They often also lack support for flexible parallelism, which makes integration into existing bioinformatics pipelines difficult. In this work, we propose HySortK, a highly efficient sorting-based distributed memory k-mer counter. HySortK reduces the communication volume through a carefully designed communication scheme and domain-specific optimization strategies. Furthermore, we introduce an abstract task layer for flexible hybrid parallelism to address load imbalances in different scenarios. HySortK achieves a 2-10x speedup compared to the GPU baseline on 4 and 8 nodes. Compared to state-of-the-art CPU software, HySortK achieves up to 2x speedup while reducing peak memory usage by 30% on 16 nodes. Finally, we integrated HySortK into an existing genome assembly pipeline and achieved up to 1.8x speedup, proving its flexibility and practicality in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>DeepGene Transformer: Transformer for the gene expression-based classification of cancer subtypes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.11833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.11833v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cancer and its subtypes constitute approximately 30% of all causes of death globally and display a wide range of heterogeneity in terms of clinical and molecular responses to therapy. Molecular subtyping has enabled the use of precision medicine to overcome these challenges and provide significant biological insights to predict prognosis and improve clinical decision-making. Over the past decade, conventional machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms have been widely espoused for the classification of cancer subtypes from gene expression datasets. However, these methods are potentially biased toward the identification of cancer biomarkers. Hence, an end-to-end deep learning approach, DeepGene Transformer, is proposed which addresses the complexity of high-dimensional gene expression with a multi-head self-attention module by identifying relevant biomarkers across multiple cancer subtypes without requiring feature selection as a pre-requisite for the current classification algorithms. Comparative analysis reveals that the proposed DeepGene Transformer outperformed the commonly used traditional and state-of-the-art classification algorithms and can be considered an efficient approach for classifying cancer and its subtypes, indicating that any improvement in deep learning models in computational biologists can be reflected well in this domain as well.</description>

      <title>Genome-on-Diet: Taming Large-Scale Genomic Analyses via Sparsified Genomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.08157v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Searching for similar genomic sequences is an essential and fundamental step in biomedical research and an overwhelming majority of genomic analyses. State-of-the-art computational methods performing such comparisons fail to cope with the exponential growth of genomic sequencing data. We introduce the concept of sparsified genomics where we systematically exclude a large number of bases from genomic sequences and enable much faster and more memory-efficient processing of the sparsified, shorter genomic sequences, while providing similar or even higher accuracy compared to processing non-sparsified sequences. Sparsified genomics provides significant benefits to many genomic analyses and has broad applicability. We show that sparsifying genomic sequences greatly accelerates the state-of-the-art read mapper (minimap2) by 2.57-5.38x, 1.13-2.78x, and 3.52-6.28x using real Illumina, HiFi, and ONT reads, respectively, while providing up to 2.1x smaller memory footprint, 2x smaller index size, and more truly detected small and structural variations compared to minimap2. Sparsifying genomic sequences makes containment search through very large genomes and large databases 72.7-75.88x faster and 723.3x more storage-efficient than searching through non-sparsified genomic sequences (with CMash and KMC3). Sparsifying genomic sequences enables robust microbiome discovery by providing 54.15-61.88x faster and 720x more storage-efficient taxonomic profiling of metagenomic samples over the state-of-the-art tool (Metalign). We design and open-source a framework called Genome-on-Diet as an example tool for sparsified genomics, which can be freely downloaded from https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/Genome-on-Diet.</description>
