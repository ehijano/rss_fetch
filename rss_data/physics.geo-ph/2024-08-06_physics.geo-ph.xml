      <title>Transformer for seismic image super-resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seismic images obtained by stacking or migration are usually characterized as low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), low dominant frequency and sparse sampling both in depth (or time) and offset dimensions. For improving the resolution of seismic images, we proposed a deep learning-based method to achieve super-resolution (SR) in only one step, which means performing the denoising, interpolation and frequency extrapolation at the same time. We design a seismic image super-resolution Transformer (SIST) to extract and fuse local and global features, which focuses more on the energy and extension shapes of effective events (horizons, folds and faults, etc.) from noisy seismic images. We extract the edge images of input images by Canny algorithm as masks to generate the input data with double channels, which improves the amplitude preservation and reduces the interference of noises. The residual groups containing Swin-Transformer blocks and residual connections consist of the backbone of SIST, which extract the global features in a window with preset size and decrease computational cost meanwhile. The pixel shuffle layers are used to up-sample the output feature maps from the backbone to improve the edges, meanwhile up-sampling the input data through a skip connection to enhance the amplitude preservation of the final images especially for clarifying weak events. 3-dimensional synthetic seismic volumes with complex geological structures are created, and the amplitudes of half of the volumes are mixtures of strong and weak, then select 2-dimensional slices randomly to generate training datasets which fits field data well to perform supervised learning. Both numerical tests on synthetic and field data in different exploration regions demonstrate the feasibility of our method.</description>

      <title>PRIME-DP: Pre-trained Integrated Model for Earthquake Data Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new seismic wave representation model called PRIME-DP, which stands for Pre-trained Integrated Model for Earthquake Data Processing. Unlike most of the models, which are designed to specifically a singular problem, PRIME-DP is used for multi-task single station seismic waveform processing. PRIME-DP can be used to Pg/Sg/Pn/Sn phase picking, P polarization classification. And can be fine-tunned to wide range of tasks, such as event classification, without architecture modifications. PRIME-DP can achieve over 85% recall on Pg and Sg phases, when picking continuous waveform and achieves over 80% accuracy in P polarization classification. By fine-tunning classification decoder with NeiMeng dataset, PRIME-DP can achieve 95.1% accuracy on event.</description>

      <title>Do earthquakes "know" how big they will be? a neural-net aided study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earthquake occurrence is notoriously difficult to predict. While some aspects of their spatiotemporal statistics can be relatively well captured by point-process models, very little is known regarding the magnitude of future events, and it is deeply debated whether it is possible to predict the magnitude of an earthquake before it starts. This is due both to the lack of information about fault conditions and to the inherent complexity of rupture dynamics. Consequently, even state of the art forecasting models typically assume no knowledge about the magnitude of future events besides the time-independent Gutenberg Richter (GR) distribution, which describes the marginal distribution over large regions and long times. This approach implicitly assumes that earthquake magnitudes are independent of previous seismicity and are identically distributed. In this work we challenge this view by showing that information about the magnitude of an upcoming earthquake can be directly extracted from the seismic history. We present MAGNET - MAGnitude Neural EsTimation model, an open-source, geophysically-inspired neural-network model for probabilistic forecasting of future magnitudes from cataloged properties: hypocenter locations, occurrence times and magnitudes of past earthquakes. Our history-dependent model outperforms stationary and quasi-stationary state of the art GR-based benchmarks, in real catalogs in Southern California, Japan and New-Zealand. This demonstrates that earthquake catalogs contain information about the magnitude of future earthquakes, prior to their occurrence. We conclude by proposing methods to apply the model in characterization of the preparatory phase of earthquakes, and in operational hazard alert and earthquake forecasting systems.</description>

      <title>Noise Suppression for CRP Gathers Based on Self2Self with Dropout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noise suppression in seismic data processing is a crucial research focus for enhancing subsequent imaging and reservoir prediction. Deep learning has shown promise in computer vision and holds significant potential for seismic data processing. However, supervised learning, which relies on clean labels to train network prediction models, faces challenges due to the unavailability of clean labels for seismic exploration data. In contrast, self-supervised learning substitutes traditional supervised learning with surrogate tasks by different auxiliary means, exploiting internal input data information. Inspired by Self2Self with Dropout, this paper presents a self-supervised learning-based noise suppression method called Self-Supervised Deep Convolutional Networks (SSDCN), specifically designed for Common Reflection Point (CRP) gathers. We utilize pairs of Bernoulli-sampled instances of the input noisy image as surrogate tasks to leverage its inherent structure. Furthermore, SSDCN incorporates geological knowledge through the normal moveout correction technique, which capitalizes on the approximately horizontal behavior and strong self-similarity observed in useful signal events within CRP gathers. By exploiting the discrepancy in self-similarity between the useful signals and noise in CRP gathers, SSDCN effectively extracts self-similarity features during training iterations, prioritizing the extraction of useful signals to achieve noise suppression. Experimental results on synthetic and actual CRP gathers demonstrate that SSDCN achieves high-fidelity noise suppression.</description>

      <title>Joint Inversion of DC Resistivity and MT Data using Multi-Objective Grey Wolf Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Joint inversion of geophysical datasets is instrumental in subsurface characterization and has garnered significant popularity, leveraging information from multiple geophysical methods. In this study, we implemented the joint inversion of DC resistivity with MT data using the Multi-Objective Grey Wolf Optimization (MOGWO) algorithm. As an extension of the widely-used Grey Wolf Optimization algorithm, MOGWO offers a suite of pareto optimal non-dominated solutions, eliminating the need for weighting parameters in the objective functions. This set of non-dominated predictions also facilitates the understanding of uncertainty in the predicted model parameters. Through a field case study in the region around Broken Hill in South Central Australia, the paper showcases MOGWO's capabilities in joint inversion, providing confident estimates of the model parameters (resistivity profiles), as indicated by a narrow spread in the suite of solutions. The obtained results are comparable to well established methodologies and highlight the efficacy of MOGWO as a reliable tool in geophysical exploration.</description>

      <title>Inversion of DC Resistivity Data using Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inversion of DC resistivity data is a widely employed method for near-surface characterization. Recently, deep learning-based inversion techniques have garnered significant attention due to their capability to elucidate intricate non-linear relationships between geophysical data and model parameters. Nevertheless, these methods face challenges such as limited training data availability and the generation of geologically inconsistent solutions. These concerns can be mitigated through the integration of a physics-informed approach. Moreover, the quantification of prediction uncertainty is crucial yet often overlooked in deep learning-based inversion methodologies. In this study, we utilized Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) based Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to invert both synthetic and field Schlumberger sounding data while also estimating prediction uncertainty via Monte Carlo dropout. For both synthetic and field case studies, the median profile estimated by PINNs is comparable to the results from existing literature, while also providing uncertainty estimates. Therefore, PINNs demonstrate significant potential for broader applications in near-surface characterization.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Impedance Prediction Using an Attention-Based Dual-Branch Double-Inversion Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seismic impedance inversion is a widely used technique for reservoir characterization. Accurate, high-resolution seismic impedance data form the foundation for subsequent reservoir interpretation. Deep learning methods have demonstrated significant potential in seismic impedance inversion. Traditional single semi-supervised networks, which directly input original seismic logging data, struggle to capture high-frequency weak signals. This limitation leads to low-resolution inversion results with inadequate accuracy and stability. Moreover, seismic wavelet uncertainty further constrains the application of these methods to real seismic data. To address these challenges, we propose ADDIN-I: an Attention-based Dual-branch Double-Inversion Network for Impedance prediction. ADDIN-I's dual-branch architecture overcomes the limitations of single-branch semi-supervised networks and improves the extraction of high-frequency weak signal features in sequence modeling. The network incorporates an attention mechanism to further enhance its feature extraction capabilities. To adapt the method for real seismic data applications, a deep learning forward operator is employed to fit the wavelet adaptively. ADDIN-I demonstrates excellent performance in both synthetic and real data applications.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Framework for History Matching CO2 Storage with 4D Seismic and Monitoring Well Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geological carbon storage entails the injection of megatonnes of supercritical CO2 into subsurface formations. The properties of these formations are usually highly uncertain, which makes design and optimization of large-scale storage operations challenging. In this paper we introduce a history matching strategy that enables the calibration of formation properties based on early-time observations. Early-time assessments are essential to assure the operation is performing as planned. Our framework involves two fit-for-purpose deep learning surrogate models that provide predictions for in-situ monitoring well data and interpreted time-lapse (4D) seismic saturation data. These two types of data are at very different scales of resolution, so it is appropriate to construct separate, specialized deep learning networks for their prediction. This approach results in a workflow that is more straightforward to design and more efficient to train than a single surrogate that provides global high-fidelity predictions. The deep learning models are integrated into a hierarchical Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) history matching procedure. History matching is performed on a synthetic case with and without 4D seismic data, which allows us to quantify the impact of 4D seismic on uncertainty reduction. The use of both data types is shown to provide substantial uncertainty reduction in key geomodel parameters and to enable accurate predictions of CO2 plume dynamics. The overall history matching framework developed in this study represents an efficient way to integrate multiple data types and to assess the impact of each on uncertainty reduction and performance predictions.</description>

      <title>A Deep CNN Model for Ringing Effect Attenuation of Vibroseis Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of exploration geophysics, seismic vibrator is one of the widely used seismic sources to acquire seismic data, which is usually named vibroseis. "Ringing effect" is a common problem in vibroseis data processing due to the limited frequency bandwidth of the vibrator, which degrades the performance of first-break picking. In this paper, we proposed a novel deringing model for vibroseis data using deep convolutional neural network (CNN). In this model we use end-to-end training strategy to obtain the deringed data directly, and skip connections to improve model training process and preserve the details of vibroseis data. For real vibroseis deringing task we synthesize training data and corresponding labels from real vibroseis data and utilize them to train the deep CNN model. Experiments are conducted both on synthetic data and real vibroseis data. The experiment results show that deep CNN model can attenuate the ringing effect effectively and expand the bandwidth of vibroseis data. The STA/LTA ratio method for first-break picking also shows improvement on deringed vibroseis data using deep CNN model.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-based subsurface multiphysics monitoring and forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Carbon capture and storage (CCS) plays a crucial role in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, particularly from industrial outputs. Using seismic monitoring can aid in an accurate and robust monitoring system to ensure the effectiveness of CCS and mitigate associated risks. However, conventional seismic wave equation-based approaches are computationally demanding, which hinders real-time applications. In addition to efficiency, forecasting and uncertainty analysis are not easy to handle using such numerical-simulation-based approaches. To this end, we propose a novel subsurface multiphysics monitoring and forecasting framework utilizing video diffusion models. This approach can generate high-quality representations of CO$2$ evolution and associated changes in subsurface elastic properties. With reconstruction guidance, forecasting and inversion can be achieved conditioned on historical frames and/or observational data. Meanwhile, due to the generative nature of the approach, we can quantify uncertainty in the prediction. Tests based on the Compass model show that the proposed method successfully captured the inherently complex physical phenomena associated with CO$_2$ monitoring, and it can predict and invert the subsurface elastic properties and CO$_2$ saturation with consistency in their evolution.</description>
