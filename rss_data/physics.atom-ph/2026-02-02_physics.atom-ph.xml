      <title>Low energy elastic scattering of H, D and T on $^{3}$He and $^{4}$He</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the needs of atomic tritium sources for neutrino mass experiments, we present calculations of energy-dependent elastic scattering cross sections of hydrogen isotopes (H, D and T) on helium isotopes ($^3$He and $^4$He) in the temperature range 1~mK to 300~K. The tritium-on-helium cross sections are found to be enhanced over their hydrogen-on-helium counterparts by a near-threshold resonant s-wave bound state at low energy, similar to that predicted in the triplet T-T system. While the energy-dependent cross sections span a wide range at low energy due to this s-wave enhancement, they tend toward a common value at high energy where the scattering becomes effectively geometric in nature.</description>

      <title>Wichmann-Kroll Correction in Muonic Atoms and Hydrogen-Like Electronic Ions: a Comparative Study of Two Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wichmann-Kroll corrections are calculated in both hydrogen-like electronic ions and muonic systems ($Z = \{36$--$92\}$) using two independent methods. The Gaussian finite basis set approach, enhanced with dual basis construction, analytical large-distance corrections, and $B$-spline representations, provides computational efficiency. The Green function method, based on semi-analytical construction from Dirac solutions with Fermi nuclear charge distributions, offers higher systematic accuracy and freedom from basis-dependent artifacts. Results are consistent with the literature values, providing reliable reference data for precision spectroscopy of exotic atoms.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of the optical Magnus effect with a trapped ion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We directly observe and spatially map an optical analog of the Magnus effect, where intrinsic spin-orbit-like coupling of light generates a spin-dependent transverse displacement of the atom-light interaction profile for a $^{40}$Ca$^+$ ion. Probed on a quadrupole transition using a tightly focused beam, we observe displacements of the maximum in the profile of the effective interaction by several 100 nm originating from intrinsic longitudinal electric field components beyond the paraxial approximation. The tight focus of the beam induces additional transverse polarization gradients, which we characterize through a phase-sensitive measurement and spatial maps for different beam configurations. The results establish the physical basis of polarization-gradient interactions relevant to optical tweezer-based quantum control.</description>

      <title>Unambiguous Vector Magnetometry with Structured Light in Atomic Vapor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Absorption profiles of vector light upon interaction with atomic vapor carries distinct signatures of external magnetic field vector. However, this signature becomes ambiguous for anti parallel magnetic field vectors of equal magnitude, which makes their absorption profiles visually indistinguishable. To resolve this ambiguity, we present theoretical analysis of the interaction of vector light with optically polarized atoms immersed in reference and test magnetic fields. Furthermore, we demonstrate the complete characterization of the arbitrarily oriented (transverse) test magnetic field via Fourier analysis of the absorption profile. This analysis reveals a one to one correspondence between the magnetic field properties and the profiles contrast and rotational angle. Our findings open an avenue to design an optical vector atomic magnetometer based on structured light fields.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Yield Rate of \textsuperscript{229m}Th via Cascade Decay in Storage Rings and Electron Beam Ion Traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The low-energy nuclear isomeric state of \textsuperscript{229m}Th provides a unique bridge between nuclear and atomic physics, enabling applications such as nuclear clocks and precision metrology. However, efficient and controllable production of \textsuperscript{229m}Th remains a major experimental challenge. We propose an efficient scheme to produce the $^{229\mathrm{m}}$Th in storage rings (SRs) and electron beam ion traps (EBITs), using a cascade decay pathway. Highly charged ions are excited to higher nuclear states via nuclear excitation by inelastic electron scattering (NEIES) and nuclear excitation by electron capture (NEEC), followed by radiative or internal conversion cascades that populate the isomer. Our calculations demonstrate that, under typical SRs and EBITs conditions, optimized indirect excitation pathways significantly enhance \textsuperscript{229m}Th production rate. In particular, NEIES can provide an enhancement of up to four orders of magnitude through cascade de-excitation at high energies, while NEEC can contribute an additional enhancement of up to several tens of times. Such a significant increase in the \textsuperscript{229m}Th yield rate would facilitate its application in various nuclear photonics fields, especially in the development of atomic nuclear clocks.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Distance Scaling of Casimir-Polder Force between Atomic Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventionally, dispersion forces mediated by quantum vacuum fluctuations are known to exhibit universal distance scalings, with retardation typically leading to a faster decay of the interaction. Here, we show that this expectation fails for intrinsically discrete systems. Using the microscopic scattering approach, we study the Casimir-Polder interaction between two atomic arrays, and uncover an unconventional distance scaling in which the force crosses over from a faster decay at short separations to a slower decay in the retarded regime. This behavior originates from the discrete lattice structure and can be consistently understood within the scattering picture. Extending our analysis to Rydberg atomic arrays, we predict an even stronger deviation from conventional scaling and propose an experimentally feasible scheme for direct measurement. Our results provide a new platform for exploring dispersion forces beyond the continuum limit.</description>

      <title>Laser-induced Coulomb explosion of the LiI molecule and of its dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A gas-phase sample consisting of lithium iodide, $\mathrm{LiI}$, molecules and their dimer $\mathrm{(LiI)}_2$, are Coulomb exploded by an intense 25 femtosecond laser pulse. In the case of $\mathrm{LiI}$, we focus on the double ionization that creates a pair of $\mathrm{Li}^+$ and $\mathrm{I}^+$ recoil ions. From the kinetic energy distribution of the $\mathrm{Li}^+$ ions, extracted using coincidence filtering, we determine the distribution of internuclear distances $P(R)$ via the ground state potential curve of $\mathrm{LiI}^{2+}$ obtained from an ab initio calculation that accounts for non-Coulombic effects. We find that the center of $P(R)$ is close to the expected internuclear separation based on the three vibrational states of $\mathrm{LiI}$ populated, whereas the width of $P(R)$ exceeds the theoretical value by $\sim$ 52 %. We discuss if fragmentation via excited $\mathrm{LiI}^{2+}$ potential curves affects the determination of $P(R)$. In the case of the dimer, $\mathrm{(LiI)}_2$, we observe kinetic energies and relative emission directions of $\mathrm{Li}^+$, $\mathrm{I}^+$, and $\mathrm{I}^{2+}$ recoil ions consistent with Coulomb explosion of the parallelogram-shaped dimer after removing up to six electrons by the laser pulse.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy of $^4$He at 0.25 ppt Uncertainty and Improved Alpha-Helion Charge-Radius Difference Determination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-precision spectroscopy of simple atomic systems can be used to advance the theory of atomic energy levels but can also serve as a sensitive probe of nuclear charge radii. For this last purpose, we report an improved measurement of the $2\,^3{S}_1 \to 2\,^1{S}_0$ transition frequency in $^4$He with 48 Hz uncertainty (0.25 ppt), using a Bose-Einstein condensed sample confined in a magic-wavelength optical dipole trap. A systematic Doppler shift from condensate motion is suppressed by time-resolved ion detection, and the transition frequency is calibrated via a White Rabbit link to a remote active hydrogen maser clock. Combined with previous $^3$He measurements and improved theory, we obtain the most precise determination to date of the charge-radius difference between the helion and alpha particle ($r_{h}^2 -r_{\alpha}^2$) of $1.0676(10)\text{fm}^2$. This is consistent with other recent determinations and confirms that the current discrepancy between QED theory and experimentally observed ionization energies of excited states in helium is not apparent in the isotope shift.</description>

      <title>The Three-Body Limit Cycle: Universal Form for General Regulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Efimov effect, a remarkable realization of discrete scale invariance, emerges in the three-body problem with short-range interactions and is understood as a renormalization group (RG) limit cycle within Short-Range Effective Field Theory (SREFT). While the analytic form of the three-body renormalization relation has been established for a sharp cutoff regulator, its universality for other regulators remains underexplored. In this work, we derive the universal functional form of the three-body renormalization relation for general separable regulators through a detailed analysis of the Skorniakov-Ter-Martirosian and Faddeev equations. We find that the relation follows from a real M\"{o}bius transformation characterized by three parameters. This universality is verified numerically for various regulators. Although the functional form remains the same, the parameters characterizing the limit cycle exhibit regulator dependence. These findings broaden the class of RG limit cycles in SREFT and offer a more complete understanding of three-body renormalization.</description>
