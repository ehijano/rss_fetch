      <title>Computing all minimal Markov bases in Macaulay2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the package allMarkovBases for Macaulay2, which is used to compute all minimal Markov bases of a given toric ideal. The package builds on functionality of 4ti2 by producing the fiber graph of the toric ideal. The package uses this graph to compute other properties of the toric ideal such as its indispensable set of binomials as well as its universal Markov basis.</description>

      <title>$B$-orderings for all ideals $B$ of Dedekind domains and generalized factorials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends Bhargava's theory of $\mathfrak{p}$-orderings of subsets $S$ of a Dedekind ring $R$ valid for prime ideals $\mathfrak{p}$ in $R$. Bhargava's theory defines for integers $k\ge1$ invariants of $S$, the generalized factorials $[k]!_S$, which are ideals of $R$. This paper defines $\mathfrak{b}$-orderings of subsets $S$ of a Dedekind domain $D$ for all nontrivial proper ideals $\mathfrak{b}$ of $D$. It defines generalized integers $[k]_{S,T}$, as ideals of $D$, which depend on $S$ and on a subset $T$ of the proper ideals $\mathscr{I}_D$ of $D$. It defines generalized factorials $[k]!_{S,T}$ and generalized binomial coefficients, as ideals of $D$. The extension to all ideals applies to Bhargava's enhanced notions of $r$-removed $\mathfrak{p}$-orderings, and $\mathfrak{p}$-orderings of order $h$.</description>

      <title>Some topological aspects of a general spectra construction of Matsui and Takahashi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matsui and Takahashi introduce a general spectra construction for triangulated categories in [J. Math. Soc. Japan, 4:2121-2150,2020], which is later used to establish Matsui's theory of triangular geometry. In this paper, we study several topological aspects of this general construction and give criteria for soberness and spectralness of the spectra. Furthermore, we discuss and generalize the immersion phenomenon for Noetherian schemes as appeared in [Pacific. J. Math., 313(2):433-457, 2021]. The last section illustrates that similar immersions also appear if the underlying category has a well-defined finite group action. We work in the extriangulated context to incorporate similar ideas from the triangulated and abelian contexts.</description>

      <title>Algebra and geometry of ASM weak order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Much of modern Schubert calculus is centered on Schubert varieties in the complete flag variety and on their classes in its integral cohomology ring. Under the Borel isomorphism, these classes are represented by distinguished polynomials called Schubert polynomials, introduced by Lascoux and Sch\"utzenberger.
  Knutson and Miller showed that Schubert polynomials are multidegrees of matrix Schubert varieties, affine varieties introduced by Fulton, which are closely related to Schubert varieties. Many roads to studying Schubert polynomials pass through unions and intersections of matrix Schubert varieties. The third author showed that the natural indexing objects of arbitrary intersections of matrix Schubert varieties are alternating sign matrices (ASMs). Every ASM variety is expressible as a union of matrix Schubert varieties.
  Many fundamental algebro-geometric invariants (e.g., codimension, degree, and Castelnuovo--Mumford regularity) are well understood combinatorially for matrix Schubert varieties, substantially via the combinatorics of strong Bruhat order on $S_n$. The extension of strong order to ASM(n), the set of $n \times n$ ASMs, has so far not borne as much algebro-geometric fruit for ASM varieties.
  Hamaker and Reiner proposed an extension of weak Bruhat order from $S_n$ to ASM(n), which they studied from a combinatorial perspective. In the present paper, we place this work on algebro-geometric footing. We use weak order on ASMs to give a characterization of codimension of ASM varieties. We also show that weak order operators commute with K-theoretic divided difference operators and that they satisfy the same derivative formula that facilitated the first general combinatorial computation of Castelnuovo--Mumford regularity of matrix Schubert varieties. Finally, we build from these results to generalizations that apply to arbitrary unions of matrix Schubert varieties.</description>

      <title>Koszul homomorphisms and universal resolutions in local algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a local homomorphism $(Q,k)\to (R,\ell)$ to be Koszul if its derived fiber $R \otimes^{\mathsf{L}}_Q k$ is formal, and if $\operatorname{Tor}^Q(R,k)$ is Koszul in the classical sense. This recovers the classical definition when $Q$ is a field, and more generally includes all flat deformations of Koszul algebras. The non-flat case is significantly more interesting, and there is no need for examples to be quadratic: all complete intersection and all Golod quotients are Koszul homomorphisms. We show that the class of Koszul homomorphisms enjoys excellent homological properties, and we give many more examples, especially various monomial and Gorenstein examples. We then study Koszul homomorphisms from the perspective of $\mathrm{A}_\infty$-structures on resolutions. We use this machinery to construct universal free resolutions of $R$-modules by generalizing a classical construction of Priddy. The resulting (infinite) free resolution of an $R$-module $M$ is often minimal, and can be described by a finite amount of data whenever $M$ and $R$ have finite projective dimension over $Q$. Our construction simultaneously recovers the resolutions of Shamash and Eisenbud over a complete intersection ring, and the bar resolutions of Iyengar and Burke over a Golod ring, and produces analogous resolutions for various other classes of local rings.</description>

      <title>On the $(S_2)$-condition of edge rings for cactus graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17413v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A cactus graph is a connected graph in which every block is either an edge or a cycle. In this paper, we will examine cactus graphs where all the blocks are $3$-cycles, i.e., triangular cactus graphs, of diameter $4$. Our main focus is to prove that the corresponding edge ring of this family of graphs is not normal and satisfies Serre's condition $(S_2)$. We use a criterion due to Katth\"an for non-normal affine semigroup rings.</description>
