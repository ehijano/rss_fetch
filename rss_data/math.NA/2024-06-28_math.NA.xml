      <title>Supercloseness of the HDG method on Shishkin mesh for a singularly perturbed convection diffusion problem in 2D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the first analysis of parameter-uniform convergence for a hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method applied to a singularly perturbed convection-diffusion problem in 2D using a Shishkin mesh. The primary difficulty lies in accurately estimating the convection term in the layer, where existing methods often fall short. To address this, a novel error control technique is employed, along with reasonable assumptions regarding the stabilization function. The results show that, with polynomial degrees not exceeding $k$, the method achieves supercloseness of almost $k+\frac{1}{2}$ order in an energy norm. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Generation of Random (Generalized) Orthogonal Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an algorithmic method for generating random orthogonal matrices \(A\) that satisfy the property \(A^t S A = S\), where \(S\) is a fixed real invertible symmetric or skew-symmetric matrix. This method is significant as it generalizes the procedures for generating orthogonal matrices that fix a general fixed symmetric or skew-symmetric bilinear form. These include orthogonal matrices that fall to groups such as the symplectic group, Lorentz group, Poincar\'e group, and more generally the indefinite orthogonal group, to name a few. These classes of matrices play crucial roles in diverse fields such as theoretical physics, where they are used to describe symmetries and conservation laws, as well as in computational geometry, numerical analysis, and number theory, where they are integral to the study of quadratic forms and modular forms. The implementation of our algorithms can be accomplished using standard linear algebra libraries.</description>

      <title>Simpson's quadrature for a nonlinear variational symplectic scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a variational symplectic numerical method for the time integration of dynamical systems issued from the least action principle. We assume a quadratic internal interpolation of the state between two time steps and we approximate the action in one time step by the Simpson's quadrature formula. The resulting scheme is nonlinear and symplectic. First numerical experiments concern a nonlinear pendulum and we have observed experimentally very good convergence properties.</description>

      <title>Rational Empirical Interpolation Methods with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a rational empirical interpolation method for interpolating a family of parametrized functions to rational polynomials with invariant poles, leading to efficient numerical algorithms for space-fractional differential equations, parameter-robust preconditioning, and evaluation of matrix functions. Compared to classical rational approximation algorithms, the proposed method is more efficient for approximating a large number of target functions. In addition, we derive a convergence estimate of our rational approximation algorithm using the metric entropy numbers. Numerical experiments are included to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Inducing Riesz and orthonormal bases in $L^2$ via composition operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate perturbations of orthonormal bases of $L^2$ via a composition operator $C_h$ induced by a mapping $h$. We provide a comprehensive characterization of the mapping $h$ required for the perturbed sequence to form an orthonormal or Riesz basis. Restricting our analysis to differentiable mappings, we reveal that all Riesz bases of the given form are induced by bi-Lipschitz mappings. In addition, we discuss implications of these results for approximation theory, highlighting the potential of using bijective neural networks to construct complete sequences with favorable approximation properties.</description>

      <title>Data-driven identification of port-Hamiltonian DAE systems by Gaussian processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Port-Hamiltonian systems (pHS) allow for a structure-preserving modeling of dynamical systems. Coupling pHS via linear relations between input and output defines an overall pHS, which is structure preserving. However, in multiphysics applications, some subsystems do not allow for a physical pHS description, as (a) this is not available or (b) too expensive. Here, data-driven approaches can be used to deliver a pHS for such subsystems, which can then be coupled to the other subsystems in a structure-preserving way. In this work, we derive a data-driven identification approach for port-Hamiltonian differential algebraic equation (DAE) systems. The approach uses input and state space data to estimate nonlinear effort functions of pH-DAEs. As underlying technique, we us (multi-task) Gaussian processes. This work thereby extends over the current state of the art, in which only port-Hamiltonian ordinary differential equation systems could be identified via Gaussian processes. We apply this approach successfully to two applications from network design and constrained multibody system dynamics, based on pH-DAE system of index one and three, respectively.</description>

      <title>Operator Learning of Lipschitz Operators: An Information-Theoretic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Operator learning based on neural operators has emerged as a promising paradigm for the data-driven approximation of operators, mapping between infinite-dimensional Banach spaces. Despite significant empirical progress, our theoretical understanding regarding the efficiency of these approximations remains incomplete. This work addresses the parametric complexity of neural operator approximations for the general class of Lipschitz continuous operators. Motivated by recent findings on the limitations of specific architectures, termed curse of parametric complexity, we here adopt an information-theoretic perspective. Our main contribution establishes lower bounds on the metric entropy of Lipschitz operators in two approximation settings; uniform approximation over a compact set of input functions, and approximation in expectation, with input functions drawn from a probability measure. It is shown that these entropy bounds imply that, regardless of the activation function used, neural operator architectures attaining an approximation accuracy $\epsilon$ must have a size that is exponentially large in $\epsilon^{-1}$. The size of architectures is here measured by counting the number of encoded bits necessary to store the given model in computational memory. The results of this work elucidate fundamental trade-offs and limitations in</description>

      <title>Quantum annealing-based structural optimization with a multiplicative design update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new structural design framework, developed based on iterative optimization via quantum annealing (QA). The novelty lies in its successful design update using an unknown design multiplier obtained by iteratively solving the optimization problems with QA. In addition, to align with density-based approaches in structural optimization, multipliers are multiplicative to represent design material and serve as design variables. In particular, structural analysis is performed on a classical computer using the finite element method, and QA is utilized for topology updating. The primary objective of the framework is to minimize compliance under an inequality volume constraint, while an encoding process for the design variable is adopted, enabling smooth iterative updates to the optimized design. The proposed framework incorporates both penalty methods and slack variables to transform the inequality constraint into an equality constraint and is implemented in a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) model through QA. To demonstrate its performance, design optimization is performed for both truss and continuum structures. Promising results from these applications indicate that the proposed framework is capable of creating an optimal shape and topology similar to those benchmarked by the optimality criteria (OC) method on a classical computer.</description>

      <title>A Thermo-Electro-Mechanical Model for Long-Term Reliability of Aging Transmission Lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrity and reliability of a national power grid system are essential to society's development and security. Among the power grid components, transmission lines are critical due to exposure and vulnerability to severe external conditions, including high winds, ice, and extreme temperatures. The combined effects of external agents with high electrical load and presence of damage precursors greatly affects the conducting material's properties due to a thermal runaway cycle that accelerates the aging process. In this paper, we develop a thermo-electro-mechanical model for long-term failure analysis of overhead transmission lines. A phase-field model of damage and fatigue, coupled with electrical and thermal modules, provides a detailed description of the conductor's temperature evolution. We define a limit state function based on maximum operating temperature to avoid excessive overheating and sagging. We study four representative scenarios deterministically, and propose the Probabilistic Collocation Method (PCM) as a tool to understand the stochastic behavior of the system. We use PCM in forward parametric uncertainty quantification, global sensitivity analysis, and computation of failure probability curves in a straightforward and computationally efficient fashion, and we quantify the most influential parameters that affect the failure predictability from a physics-based perspective.</description>

      <title>Grassmannian optimization is NP-hard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that unconstrained quadratic optimization over a Grassmannian $\operatorname{Gr}(k,n)$ is NP-hard. Our results cover all scenarios: (i) when $k$ and $n$ are both allowed to grow; (ii) when $k$ is arbitrary but fixed; (iii) when $k$ is fixed at its lowest possible value $1$. We then deduce the NP-hardness of unconstrained cubic optimization over the Stiefel manifold $\operatorname{V}(k,n)$ and the orthogonal group $\operatorname{O}(n)$. As an addendum we demonstrate the NP-hardness of unconstrained quadratic optimization over the Cartan manifold, i.e., the positive definite cone $\mathbb{S}^n_{\scriptscriptstyle++}$ regarded as a Riemannian manifold, another popular example in manifold optimization. We will also establish the nonexistence of $\mathrm{FPTAS}$ in all cases.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary-order pressure-robust DDR and VEM methods for the Stokes problem on polyhedral meshes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.09750v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper contains two major contributions. First we derive, following the discrete de Rham (DDR) and Virtual Element (VEM) paradigms, pressure-robust methods for the Stokes equations that support arbitrary orders and polyhedral meshes. Unlike other methods presented in the literature, pressure-robustness is achieved here without resorting to an $\boldsymbol{H}({\rm div})$-conforming construction on a submesh, but rather projecting the volumetric force onto the discrete $\boldsymbol{H}({\bf curl})$ space. The cancellation of the pressure error contribution stems from key commutation properties of the underlying DDR and VEM complexes. The pressure-robust error estimates in $h^{k+1}$ (with $h$ denoting the meshsize and $k\ge 0$ the polynomial degree of the DDR or VEM complex) are proven theoretically and supported by a panel of three-dimensional numerical tests. The second major contribution of the paper is an in-depth study of the relations between the DDR and VEM approaches. We show, in particular, that a complex developed following one paradigm admits a reformulation in the other, and that couples of related DDR and VEM complexes satisfy commuting diagram properties with the degrees of freedom maps.</description>

Abstract: We present block variants of the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM); as a particular application, we will consider a CUR factorization. The block DEIM algorithms are based on the concept of the maximum volume of submatrices and a rank-revealing QR factorization. We also present a version of the block DEIM procedures, which allows for adaptive choice of block size. The results of the experiments indicate that the block DEIM algorithms exhibit comparable accuracy for low-rank matrix approximation compared to the standard DEIM procedure. However, the block DEIM algorithms also demonstrate potential computational advantages, showcasing increased efficiency in terms of computational time.</description>

      <title>Efficient Bounds and Estimates for Canonical Angles in Randomized Subspace Approximations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.04676v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Randomized subspace approximation with "matrix sketching" is an effective approach for constructing approximate partial singular value decompositions (SVDs) of large matrices. The performance of such techniques has been extensively analyzed, and very precise estimates on the distribution of the residual errors have been derived. However, our understanding of the accuracy of the computed singular vectors (measured in terms of the canonical angles between the spaces spanned by the exact and the computed singular vectors, respectively) remains relatively limited. In this work, we present practical bounds and estimates for canonical angles of randomized subspace approximation that can be computed efficiently either a priori or a posteriori, without assuming prior knowledge of the true singular subspaces. Under moderate oversampling in the randomized SVD, our prior probabilistic bounds are asymptotically tight and can be computed efficiently, while bringing a clear insight into the balance between oversampling and power iterations given a fixed budget on the number of matrix-vector multiplications. The numerical experiments demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of these canonical angle bounds and estimates on different matrices under various algorithmic choices for the randomized SVD.</description>

Abstract: This paper is devoted to the numerical solution of constrained energy minimization problems arising in computational physics and chemistry such as the Gross-Pitaevskii and Kohn-Sham models. In particular, we introduce the Riemannian Newton methods on the infinite-dimensional Stiefel and Grassmann manifolds. We study the geometry of these two manifolds, its impact on the Newton algorithms, and present expressions of the Riemannian Hessians in the infinite-dimensional setting, which are suitable for variational spatial discretizations. A series of numerical experiments illustrates the performance of the methods and demonstrates its supremacy compared to other well-established schemes such as the self-consistent field iteration and gradient descent schemes.</description>

      <title>Solving parametric elliptic interface problems via interfaced operator network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning operators mapping between infinite-dimensional Banach spaces via neural networks has attracted a considerable amount of attention in recent years. In this paper, we propose an interfaced operator network (IONet) to solve parametric elliptic interface PDEs, where different coefficients, source terms, and boundary conditions are considered as input features. To capture the discontinuities in both the input functions and the output solutions across the interface, IONet divides the entire domain into several separate subdomains according to the interface and uses multiple branch nets and trunk nets. Each branch net extracts latent representations of input functions at a fixed number of sensors on a specific subdomain, and each trunk net is responsible for output solutions on one subdomain. Additionally, tailored physics-informed loss of IONet is proposed to ensure physical consistency, which greatly reduces the training dataset requirement and makes IONet effective without any paired input-output observations inside the computational domain. Extensive numerical studies demonstrate that IONet outperforms existing state-of-the-art deep operator networks in terms of accuracy and versatility.</description>

      <title>Preconditioned iterative solvers for constrained high-order implicit shock tracking methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-order implicit shock tracking (fitting) is a class of high-order numerical methods that use numerical optimization to simultaneously compute a high-order approximation to a conservation law solution and align elements of the computational mesh with non-smooth features. This alignment ensures that non-smooth features are perfectly represented by inter-element jumps and high-order basis functions approximate smooth regions of the solution without nonlinear stabilization, which leads to accurate approximations on traditionally coarse meshes. In this work, we devise a family of preconditioners for the saddle point linear system that defines the step toward optimality at each iteration of the optimization solver so Krylov solvers can be effectively used. Our preconditioners integrate standard preconditioners from constrained optimization with popular preconditioners for discontinuous Galerkin discretizations such as block Jacobi, block incomplete LU factorizations with minimum discarded fill reordering, and p-multigrid. Thorough studies are performed using two inviscid compressible flow problems to evaluate the effectivity of each preconditioner in this family and their sensitivity to critical shock tracking parameters such as the mesh and Hessian regularization, linearization state, and resolution of the solution space.</description>

The P-ERK schemes enable multirate time-integration with no changes in the spatial discretization methodology, making them readily implementable in existing codes that employ a method-of-lines approach.
  We show that speedup compared to a range of state of the art Runge-Kutta methods can be realized, despite additional overhead due to the dynamic re-assignment of flagging variables and restricting nonlinear stability properties. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated for a range of simulation setups for viscous and inviscid convection-dominated compressible flows for which we provide a reproducibility repository.
  In addition, we perform a thorough investigation of the nonlinear stability properties of the Paired-Explicit Runge-Kutta schemes regarding limitations due to the violation of monotonicity properties of the underlying spatial discretization. Furthermore, we present a novel approach for estimating the relevant eigenvalues of large Jacobians required for the optimization of stability polynomials.</description>

      <title>A projected Euler Method for Random Periodic Solutions of Semi-linear SDEs with non-globally Lipschitz coefficients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present work introduces and investigates an explicit time discretization scheme, called the projected Euler method, to numerically approximate random periodic solutions of semi-linear SDEs under non-globally Lipschitz conditions. The existence of the random periodic solution is demonstrated as the limit of the pull-back of the discretized SDE. Without relying on a priori high-order moment bounds of the numerical approximations, the mean square convergence rate is proved to be order 0.5 for SDEs with multiplicative noise and order 1 for SDEs with additive noise. Numerical examples are also provided to validate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Annealing-based approach to solving partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving partial differential equations using an annealing-based approach is based on solving generalized eigenvalue problems. When a partial differential equation is discretized, it leads to a system of linear equations (SLE). Solving an SLE can be expressed as a general eigenvalue problem, which can be converted into an optimization problem with the objective function being a generalized Rayleigh quotient. The proposed algorithm allows the computation of eigenvectors at arbitrary precision without increasing the number of variables using an Ising machine. Simple examples solved using this method and theoretical analysis provide a guideline for appropriate parameter settings.</description>

      <title>Computation of viscoelastic shear shock waves using finite volume schemes with artificial compressibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formation of shear shock waves in the brain has been proposed as one of the plausible explanations for deep intracranial injuries. In fact, such singular solutions emerge naturally in soft viscoelastic tissues under dynamic loading conditions. To improve our understanding of the mechanical processes at hand, the development of dedicated computational models is needed. The present study concerns three-dimensional numerical models of incompressible viscoelastic solids whose motion is analysed by means of shock-capturing finite volume methods. More specifically, we focus on the use of the artificial compressibility method, a technique that has been frequently employed in computational fluid dynamics. The material behaviour is deduced from the Fung--Simo quasi-linear viscoelasiticity theory (QLV) where the elastic response is of Yeoh type. We analyse the accuracy of the method and demonstrate its applicability for the study of nonlinear wave propagation in soft solids. The numerical results cover accuracy tests, shock formation and wave focusing.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Flame Structure and Interactions Between Chemical Reactions, Species Transport and Heat Release in Laminar Flames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16762v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel method for analyzing counterflow diffusion flames, inspired by Zurada's sensitivity approach for neural networks, is proposed to identify critical species influencing the heat release rate. By further analyzing concentration changes, this method reveals complex interactions among critical radicals across different temperature zones. To illustrate this approach, the study investigates the auto-ignition temperature of n-heptane and ethanol mixtures within a counterflow flame configuration under low strain rates. In n-heptane dominant mixtures, the inhibition of low-temperature chemistry (LTC) by additional ethanol impacts the heat release rate in the high-temperature zone through the diffusion of specific radicals such as CH2O, C2H4, C3H6, and H2O2. In ethanol-dominant mixtures, higher ethanol fractions increase the heat release rate, primarily due to ethanol decomposition and its subsequent reactions. This method effectively quantifies and compares the influence of both chemical kinetics and species diffusion effects, providing detailed insights into the interactions among species across the reactive field when analyzing the counterflow configuration of complex fuel mixtures.</description>

      <title>Efficient Hardware Accelerator Based on Medium Granularity Dataflow for SpTRSV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sparse triangular solve (SpTRSV) is widely used in various domains. Numerous studies have been conducted using CPUs, GPUs, and specific hardware accelerators, where dataflow can be categorized into coarse and fine granularity. Coarse dataflow offers good spatial locality but suffers from low parallelism, while fine dataflow provides high parallelism but disrupts the spatial structure, leading to increased nodes and poor data reuse. This paper proposes a novel hardware accelerator for SpTRSV or SpTRSV-like DAGs. The accelerator implements a medium granularity dataflow through hardware-software codesign and achieves both excellent spatial locality and high parallelism. Additionally, a partial sum caching mechanism is introduced to reduce the blocking frequency of processing elements (PEs), and a reordering algorithm of intra-node edges computation is developed to enhance data reuse. Experimental results on 264 benchmarks with node counts reaching up to 85,392 demonstrate that this work achieves average performance improvements of 12.2$\times$ (up to 874.5$\times$) over CPUs and 10.1$\times$ (up to 740.4$\times$) over GPUs. Compared to the state-of-the-art technique (DPU-v2), this work shows a 2.5$\times$ (up to 5.9$\times$) average performance improvement and 1.8$\times$ (up to 4.1$\times$) average energy efficiency enhancement.</description>
