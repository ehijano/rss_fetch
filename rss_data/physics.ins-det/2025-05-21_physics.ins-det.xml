      <title>Universal Convergence Metric for Time-Resolved Neutron Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a model-independent, dimensionless metric for predicting optimal measurement duration in time-resolved Small-Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS) using early-time data. Built on a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) framework, the method reconstructs scattering profiles with quantified uncertainty, even from sparse or noisy measurements. Demonstrated on the EQSANS instrument at the Spallation Neutron Source, the approach generalizes to general SANS instruments with a two-dimensional detector. A key result is the discovery of a dimensionless convergence metric revealing a universal power-law scaling in profile evolution across soft matter systems. When time is normalized by a system-specific characteristic time $t^{\star}$, the variation in inferred profiles collapses onto a single curve with an exponent between $-2$ and $-1$. This trend emerges within the first ten time steps, enabling early prediction of measurement sufficiency. The method supports real-time experimental optimization and is especially valuable for maximizing efficiency in low-flux environments such as compact accelerator-based neutron sources.</description>

      <title>A new tellurium-loaded liquid scintillator based on p-dioxane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tellurium-loaded liquid scintillators are essential for neutrinoless double-beta decay experiments, but conventional organic scintillator systems face inherent limitations on tellurium loading due to solubility constraints. In this work, we developed and characterized a novel surfactant-free, water-compatible liquid scintillator based on p-dioxane, incorporating telluric acid, water, and naphthalene. Fluorescence measurements confirmed efficient stepwise energy transfer from p-dioxane through naphthalene to PPO, and UV-Vis absorption studies showed no intrinsic absorption features above 400 nm. At a tellurium mass fraction of 0.5%, the scintillator achieved approximately 60% of the light yield of a reference organic scintillator. These results demonstrate the feasibility of surfactant-free, water-compatible tellurium-loaded scintillators, providing a proof of concept for future development of high-loading liquid scintillator systems.</description>

      <title>Revealing Information from Weak Signal in Electron Energy-Loss Spectroscopy with a Deep Denoiser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) coupled with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) is a powerful technique to determine materials composition and bonding with high spatial resolution. Noise is often a limitation especially with the increasing sophistication of EELS experiments. The signal characteristics from direct electron detectors provide a new opportunity to design superior denoisers. We have developed a CNN based denoiser, the unsupervised deep video denoiser (UDVD), which can be applied to EELS datasets acquired with direct electron detectors. We described UDVD and explained how to adapt the denoiser to energy-loss spectral series. To benchmark the performance of the denoiser on EELS datasets, we generated and denoised a set of simulated spectra. We demonstrate the charge spreading effect associated with pixel interfaces on direct electron detectors, which leads to artifacts after denoising. To suppress such artifacts, we propose some adjustments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the denoiser using two challenging real data examples: mapping Gd dopants in $CeO_2$ nanoparticles and characterizing vibrational modes in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) with atomic resolution.</description>

      <title>Updates on MURAVES Project at Mt. Vesuvius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The MUon RAdiography of VESuvius (MURAVES) project aims to use muography imaging techniques to study the internal structure of the summit of the Mt. Vesuvius, an active volcano near Naples, Italy. This paper presents recent advancements in both data analysis and simulation tools that enhance the quality and reliability of the experiments results. A new track selection method, termed the Golden Selection, has been introduced to select high quality muon tracks by applying a refined Chi2 based criterion. This selection improves the signal to background ratio and enhances the resolution of muographic images. Additionally, the simulation framework has been upgraded with the integration of the MULDER (MUon simuLation for DEnsity Reconstruction) library, which unifies the functionalities of pervious used libraries within a single platform. MULDER enables efficient and accurate modeling of muon flux variations due to topographical features. An agreement is shown between simulated and experimental flux map.</description>

      <title>Simulation of charge transport at the surface of planar silicon sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiation-hard silicon sensors used in high-energy physics require a high electric field and are susceptible to surface breakdown. This study aims to improve the understanding of the underlying mechanisms by developing new methods to probe the electric field at surface near the sensor's edge. For planar sensors, avalanche breakdown primarily occurs at the Si-SiO2 interface, where localized electric field peaks can form between the guard ring and the edge. Accurate simulations are challenging and it is essential to validate simulation parameters by comparing the simulation results to measurements. In this work, the electrical behavior of the edge region of planar silicon diodes was simulated using Synopsis TCAD. Transient Current Technique (TCT) simulations were performed in both TCAD and Allpix Squared, and compared to measurements. Additionally, laser scans over the edge region were performed in Allpix Squared to evaluate the simulated surface electric field and charge collection efficiency.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised anomaly detection in MeV ultrafast electron diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study focus in the construction of an unsupervised anomaly detection methodology to detect faulty images in MUED. We believe that unsupervised techniques are the best choice for our purposes because the data used to train the detector does not need to be manually labeled, and instead, the machine is intended to detect by itself the anomalies in the dataset, which liberates the user of tedious, time-consuming initial image examination. The structure must, additionally, provide the user with some measure of uncertainty in the detection, so the user can take decisions based on this measure.</description>

      <title>Performance of short and long bent crystals for the TWOCRYST experiment at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the performance of bent silicon crystals intended to channel hadrons in a fixed-target experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The phenomenon of planar channelling in bent crystals enables extremely high effective bending fields for positively charged hadrons within compact volumes. Particles trapped in the potential well of high-purity, ordered atomic lattices follow the mechanical curvature of the crystal, resulting in macroscopic deflections. Although the bend angle remains constant across different momenta (i.e., the phenomenon is non-dispersive), the channelling acceptance and efficiency still depend on the particle momentum.
  Crystals with lengths from 5 cm to 10 cm, bent to angles between 5 mrad and 15 mrad, are under consideration for measurements of the electric and magnetic dipole moments of short-lived charmed baryons, such as the Lambda_c^+. Such large deflection angles over short distances cannot be achieved using conventional magnets.
  The principle of inducing spin precession through bent crystals for magnetic dipole moment measurements was first demonstrated in the 1990s. Building on this concept, experimental layouts are now being explored at the LHC. The feasibility of such measurements depends, among other factors, on the availability of crystals with the mechanical properties required to achieve the necessary channelling performance. To address this, a dedicated machine experiment, TWOCRYST, has been installed in the LHC to carry out beam tests in the TeV energy range. The bent crystals for TWOCRYST were fabricated and tested using X-ray diffraction and high-momentum hadron beams at 180 GeV/c at the CERN SPS. This paper presents an analysis of the performance of these newly developed crystals, as characterised by these measurements.</description>

      <title>Micromegas with GEM preamplification for enhanced energy threshold in low-background gaseous time projection chambers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: we develop the concept of a Micromegas (MICRO-MEsh GAseous Structure) readout plane with an additional GEM (Gas Electron Multiplier) preamplification stage placed a few mm above it, to increase the maximum effective gain of the combined readout. We implement it and test it in realistic conditions for its application to low-background dark matter searches like the TREX-DM experiment. Methods: for this, we use a Micromegas of microbulk type, built with radiopure materials. A small test chamber allowing for systematic scanning of voltages and pressures is used. In addition, a TREX-DM full-scale set-up has also been built and tested, featuring a replica of the fully-patterned TREX-DM microbulk readout. Results: we report on GEM effective extra gain factors of about 90, 50 and 20 in 1, 4 and 10 bar of Ar-1%iC$_{4}$H$_{10}$. Conclusions: the results here obtained show promise to lower the threshold of the experiment down to 50 eV$_{ee}$, corresponding to substantially enhanced sensitivity to low-mass WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles).</description>

      <title>ALICE ITS2: overview and performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The new Inner Tracking System (ITS2) is instrumental for tracking and vertex reconstruction in the ALICE experiment. The new tracker consists of seven cylindrical layers equipped with silicon Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS) with a pixel size of 27 by 29 $\rm{\mu}$m. The sensors are thinned down to a thickness of 50 $\mu$m and 100 $\mu$m for the three innermost layers and for the four outer layers, respectively. The material budget of the innermost layers is as low as 0.36% $X_{0}$/ layer compared to 1.14% $X_{0}$/ layer of the previous ITS1. In combination with a radius of 23 mm for the innermost layer and a position resolution of about 5 $\mu$m, the low material budget greatly enhances the reconstruction capabilities of heavy-flavour and low-$p_{\rm T}$ particles compared to Run 2. ITS2 has been in operation since the beginning of Run 3 and has already recorded more than 42 pb$^{-1}$ proton-proton events at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13.6 TeV and more than 2 nb$^{-1}$ Pb--Pb events at $ \sqrt{s_{ \rm{NN} }} $ = 5.36 TeV, operating stably during these operations at interaction rate up to 4 MHz in pp and about 50 kHz in Pb--Pb collisions. This contribution will review the detector performance during LHC Run 3 and give an overview on the calibration methods and running experience</description>
