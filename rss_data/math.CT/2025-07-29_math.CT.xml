      <title>A Completeness Theorem for Topological Doctrines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend logical categories with fiberwise interior and closure operators so as to obtain an embedding theorem into powers of the category of topological spaces. The required axioms, besides the Kuratowski closure axioms, are a `product independence' and a `loop contraction' principle.</description>

      <title>Sheaves on a bicategory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a detailed account of the theory of enrichment over a bicategory and show that it establishes a two-fold generalization of enrichment over both quantaloids and monoidal categories. We define complete B-categories, a generalization of Cauchy-complete enriched categories serving as a basis for the development of sheaf theory in the enriched setting. We prove an adjunction between complete B-categories and 2-presheaves on the category Map(B) of left adjoints in B. We express conditions under which this adjunction becomes a left-exact reflection, yielding back the usual results linking sheaves on sites and enriched categories. We prove that our adjunction recovers the already existing results about quantaloids, and discuss the fixed points of the adjunction in the monoidal case.</description>

      <title>Morphisms and comorphisms of sites II -- Distributors of sites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of distributor of sites, involving suited analogs of flatness and cover-preservation, and show that this notion jointly generalizes those of morphism and comorphism of sites. Given two sites, we exhibit an adjunction between the category of distributors of sites between them and the category of geometric morphisms between the associated sheaf topoi; this adjunction restricts to an equivalence between geometric morphisms and continuous distributors of sites. We finally discuss some equipment-like properties of the bicategory of sites and distributors of sites.</description>

      <title>On the Irreducible Morphisms for Skew group algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For an algebraically closed field K, let G be a finite abelian group of K-linear automorphisms of a finite-dimensional path algebra KQ of a quiver Q. Under certain assumptions on the action of G, we show the existence of a certain kind of covering that we call a Galois semi-covering functor, which becomes a Galois covering when the group action is free. We study the module category of its skew group algebra under this functor. As an application, we obtain a complete description of the irreducible morphisms and almost split sequences of skew group algebras and show that the (stable) rank is preserved under skewness. In particular, we determine the stable rank of skew-gentle algebras.</description>

      <title>Partially Dualized Quasi-Hopf Algebras Reconstructed from Dual Tensor Categories to Finite-Dimensional Hopf Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04886v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathsf{Rep}(H)$ be the category of finite-dimensional representations of a finite-dimensional Hopf algebra $H$. Andruskiewitsch and Mombelli proved in 2007 that each indecomposable exact $\mathsf{Rep}(H)$-module category has form $\mathsf{Rep}(B)$ for some indecomposable exact left $H$-comodule algebra $B$. This paper reconstructs and determines a quasi-Hopf algebra structure from the dual tensor category of $\mathsf{Rep}(H)$ with respect to $\mathsf{Rep}(B)$, when $B$ is a left coideal subalgebra of $H$. Consequently, it is categorically Morita equivalent to $H$, and some other elementary properties are also studied. As applications, our construction could be applied to imply some classical results on bismash products of matched pair of groups and bosonizations of dually paired Hopf algebras.</description>

      <title>A Categorical Treatment of Open Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03934v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An open stochastic system \`a la Jan Willems is a system affected by two qualitatively different kinds of uncertainty: one is probabilistic fluctuation, and the other one is nondeterminism caused by a fundamental lack of information. We present a formalization of open stochastic systems in the language of category theory. Central to this is the notion of copartiality which models how the lack of information propagates through a system (corresponding to the coarseness of sigma-algebras in Willems' work). As a concrete example, we study extended Gaussian distributions, which combine Gaussian probability with nondeterminism and correspond precisely to Willems' notion of Gaussian linear systems. We describe them both as measure-theoretic and abstract categorical entities, which enables us to rigorously describe a variety of phenomena like noisy physical laws and uninformative priors in Bayesian statistics. The category of extended Gaussian maps can be seen as a mutual generalization of Gaussian probability and linear relations, which connects the literature on categorical probability with ideas from control theory like signal-flow diagrams.</description>

      <title>Term Assignment and Categorical Models for Intuitionistic Linear Logic with Subexponentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12360v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a typed lambda calculus ${\bf SILL}(\lambda)_{\Sigma}$, a type-theoretic version of intuitionistic linear logic with subexponentials, that is, we have many resource comonadic modalities with some interconnections between them given by a subexponential signature. We also give proof normalisation rules and prove the strong normalisation and Church-Rosser properties for $\beta$-reduction by adapting the Tait-Girard method to subexponential modalities. Further, we analyse subexponentials from the point of view of categorical logic. We introduce the concepts of a Cocteau category and a $\Sigma$-assemblage to characterise models of linear type theories with a single exponential and affine and relevant subexponentials and a more general case respectively. We also generalise several known results from linear logic and show that every Cocteau category and a $\Sigma$-assemblage can be viewed as a symmetric monoidal closed category equipped with a family of monoidal adjunctions of a particular kind. In the final section, we give a stronger 2-categorical characterisation of Cocteau categories.</description>
