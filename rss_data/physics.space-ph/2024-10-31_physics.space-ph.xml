      <title>An anisotropic plasma model of the heliospheric interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a pioneering model of the interaction between the solar wind and the surrounding interstellar medium that includes the possibility of different pressures in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field. The outer heliosheath region is characterized by a low rate of turbulent scattering that would permit a development of pressure anisotropy. The effect is best seen on the interstellar side of the heliopause, where a narrow region is developed with an excessive perpendicular pressure resembling a plasma depletion layer typical of planetary magnetspheres. The magnitude of this effect is relatively small owing to the fact that proton-proton collisions don't permit the anisotropy to approach a stability threshold. We also show that if turbulence in the interstellar medium is weak, a much broader anisotropic boundary layer can exist, with a dominant perpendicular pressure in the southern hemisphere and a dominant parallel pressure in the north.</description>

      <title>Sigmoid eruption associated with X9.3 flare from AR 12673 drives gradual SEP event on 2017 September 6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large gradual solar energetic particle (SEP) events can pose a radiation risk to crewed spaceflight and a significant threat to near-Earth satellites however, the origin of the SEP seed particle population, how these particles are released, accelerated and transported into the heliosphere are not well understood. We analyse NOAA active region (AR) 12673, that was the source responsible for multiple large gradual SEP events during September 2017, and found that almost immediately after each significant eruptive event associated with SEPs an enhanced Si/S abundance ratio was measured by Wind, consistent with the previous work by Brooks et al. Hinode/EIS took data roughly 8~hours before the second SEP event on 2017 September 6 that allowed the regions of enhanced Si/S abundance ratio in the AR to be determined. We have shown that the AR contains plasma with elemental abundance values detected in situ by Wind. In particular, the plasma originates from the core of the AR, similar to Brooks et al., but in the moss (footpoints) associated with hot sigmoidal AR loops. The sigmoid, that contains highly fractionated plasma, erupts and propagates towards an Earth-connected magnetic null point, providing a direct channel for the highly fractionated plasma to escape and be detected in the near-Earth environment.</description>

      <title>Global Simulation of the Solar Wind: A Comparison With Parker Solar Probe Observations During 2018-2022</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models play an important role in the infrastructure of space weather forecasting. Validating such models commonly utilizes in situ solar wind measurements made near the orbit of the Earth. The purpose of this study is to test the performance of G3DMHD (a data driven, time-dependent, 3-D MHD model of the solar wind) with Parker Solar Probe (PSP) measurements. Since its launch in August 2018, PSP has traversed the inner heliosphere at different radial distances sunward of the Earth (the closest approach ~13.3 solar radii), thus providing a good opportunity to study evolution of the solar wind and to validate heliospheric models of the solar wind. The G3DMHD model simulation is driven by a sequence of maps of photospheric field extrapolated to the assumed source surface (2.5 Rs) using the potential field model from 2018 to 2022, which covers the first 15 PSP orbits. The Pearson correlation coefficient (cc) and the mean absolute squared error (MASE) are used as the metrics to evaluate the model performance. It is found that the model performs better for both magnetic intensity (cc = 0.75; MASE = 0.60) and the solar wind density (cc = 0.73; MASE = 0.50) than for the solar wind speed (cc = 0.15; MASE = 1.29) and temperature (cc = 0.28; MASE = 1.14). This is due primarily to lack of accurate boundary conditions. The well-known underestimate of the magnetic field in solar minimum years is also present. Assuming that the radial magnetic field becomes uniformly distributed with latitude at or below 18 Rs (the inner boundary of the computation do-main), the agreement in the magnetic intensity significantly improves (cc = 0.83; MASE = 0.49).</description>

      <title>A "Galactic Disk"-Model for Three-Dimensional Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal Modes in a Finite Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.11632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new model, inspired by the structure of galactic disks, for three-dimensional Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal (BGK) modes in a plasma with a uniform finite background magnetic field is presented. These modes are exact nonlinear solutions of the steady-state Vlasov equation, with an electric potential and a magnetic potential perturbation localized in all three spatial dimensions that satisfies the Poisson equation, and the Ampere Law, self-consistently. The existence of solutions is shown analytically in the limit of small electric and magnetic field perturbations associated with the disk species, and numerically using an iterative method that converges up to moderately strong field perturbations.</description>

      <title>Post-Keplerian perturbations of the hyperbolic motion in the field of a rotating massive object. Analysis in terms of osculating and nonosculating (contact) elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12063v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The perturbations of the hyperbolic motion of a test particle due to the general relativistic gravitoelectromagnetic Schwarzschild and Lense-Thirring components of the gravitational field of a rotating massive body are analytically worked out to the first post-Newtonian level in terms of the osculating Keplerian orbital elements. To the Newtonian order, the impact of the quadrupole mass moment of the source is calculated as well. The resulting analytical expressions are valid for a generic orientation in space of both the orbital plane of the probe and the spin axis of the primary, and for arbitrary values of the eccentricity. They are applied to 'Oumuamua, an interstellar asteroid which recently visited our solar system along an unbound heliocentric orbit, and to the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) spacecraft during its flyby of the Earth. The calculational approach developed can be straightforwardly extended to any alternative models of gravity as well.</description>
