      <title>Toward Fully-End-to-End Listened Speech Decoding from EEG Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech decoding from EEG signals is a challenging task, where brain activity is modeled to estimate salient characteristics of acoustic stimuli. We propose FESDE, a novel framework for Fully-End-to-end Speech Decoding from EEG signals. Our approach aims to directly reconstruct listened speech waveforms given EEG signals, where no intermediate acoustic feature processing step is required. The proposed method consists of an EEG module and a speech module along with a connector. The EEG module learns to better represent EEG signals, while the speech module generates speech waveforms from model representations. The connector learns to bridge the distributions of the latent spaces of EEG and speech. The proposed framework is both simple and efficient, by allowing single-step inference, and outperforms prior works on objective metrics. A fine-grained phoneme analysis is conducted to unveil model characteristics of speech decoding. The source code is available here: github.com/lee-jhwn/fesde.</description>

      <title>Real-time Digital RF Emulation -- I: The Direct Path Computational Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of developing a computational model for emulating an RF channel. The motivation for this is that an accurate and scalable emulator has the potential to minimize the need for field testing, which is expensive, slow, and difficult to replicate. Traditionally, emulators are built using a tapped delay line model where long filters modeling the physical interactions of objects are implemented directly. For an emulation scenario consisting of $M$ objects all interacting with one another, the tapped delay line model's computational requirements scale as $O(M^3)$ per sample: there are $O(M^2)$ channels, each with $O(M)$ complexity. In this paper, we develop a new ``direct path" model that, while remaining physically faithful, allows us to carefully factor the emulator operations, resulting in an $O(M^2)$ per sample scaling of the computational requirements. The impact of this is drastic, a $200$ object scenario sees about a $100\times$ reduction in the number of per sample computations. Furthermore, the direct path model gives us a natural way to distribute the computations for an emulation: each object is mapped to a computational node, and these nodes are networked in a fully connected communication graph.
  Alongside a discussion of the model and the physical phenomena it emulates, we show how to efficiently parameterize antenna responses and scattering profiles within this direct path framework. To verify the model and demonstrate its viability in hardware, we provide several numerical experiments produced using a cycle level C++ simulator of a hardware implementation of the model.</description>

      <title>Real-time Digital RF Emulation -- II: A Near Memory Custom Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A near memory hardware accelerator, based on a novel direct path computational model, for real-time emulation of radio frequency systems is demonstrated. Our evaluation of hardware performance uses both application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) and field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) methodologies: 1). The ASIC testchip implementation, using TSMC 28nm CMOS, leverages distributed autonomous control to extract concurrency in compute as well as low latency. It achieves a $518$ MHz per channel bandwidth in a prototype $4$-node system. The maximum emulation range supported in this paradigm is $9.5$ km with $0.24$ $\mu$s of per-sample emulation latency. 2). The FPGA-based implementation, evaluated on a Xilinx ZCU104 board, demonstrates a $9$-node test case (two Transmitters, one Receiver, and $6$ passive reflectors) with an emulation range of $1.13$ km to $27.3$ km at $215$ MHz bandwidth.</description>

      <title>Joint Hybrid Transceiver and Reflection Matrix Design for RIS-Aided mmWave MIMO Cognitive Radio Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) cognitive radio (CR) downlink operating in the underlay mode is investigated. The cognitive base station (CBS) communicates with multiple secondary users (SUs), each having multiple RF chains in the presence of a primary user (PU). We conceive a joint hybrid transmit precoder (TPC), receiver combiner (RC), and RIS reflection matrix (RM) design, which maximizes the sum spectral efficiency (SE) of the secondary system while maintaining the interference induced at the PU below a specified threshold. To this end, we formulate the sum-SE maximization problem considering the total transmit power (TP), the interference power (IP), and the non-convex unity modulus constraints of the RF TPC, RF RC, and RM. To solve this highly non-convex problem, we propose a two-stage hybrid transceiver design in conjunction with a novel block coordinate descent (BCD)-successive Riemannian conjugate gradient (SRCG) algorithm. We initially decompose the RF TPC, RC, and RM optimization problem into a series of sub-problems and subsequently design pairs of RF TPC and RC vectors, followed by successively optimizing the elements of the RM using the iterative BCD-SRCG algorithm. Furthermore, based on the effective baseband (BB) channel, the BB TPC and BB RC are designed using the proposed direct singular value decomposition (D-SVD) and projection based SVD (P-SVD) methods. Subsequently, the proportional water-filling solution is proposed for optimizing the power, which maximizes the weighted sum-SE of the system. Finally, simulation results are provided to compare our proposed schemes to several benchmarks and quantify the impact of other parameters on the sum-SE of the system.</description>

      <title>Low-Overhead Channel Estimation via 3D Extrapolation for TDD mmWave Massive MIMO Systems Under High-Mobility Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In TDD mmWave massive MIMO systems, the downlink CSI can be attained through uplink channel estimation thanks to the uplink-downlink channel reciprocity. However, the channel aging issue is significant under high-mobility scenarios and thus necessitates frequent uplink channel estimation. In addition, large amounts of antennas and subcarriers lead to high-dimensional CSI matrices, aggravating the pilot training overhead. To systematically reduce the pilot overhead, a spatial, frequency, and temporal domain (3D) channel extrapolation framework is proposed in this paper. Considering the marginal effects of pilots in the spatial and frequency domains and the effectiveness of traditional knowledge-driven channel estimation methods, we first propose a knowledge-and-data driven spatial-frequency channel extrapolation network (KDD-SFCEN) for uplink channel estimation by exploiting the least square estimator for coarse channel estimation and joint spatial-frequency channel extrapolation to reduce the spatial-frequency domain pilot overhead. Then, resorting to the uplink-downlink channel reciprocity and temporal domain dependencies of downlink channels, a temporal uplink-downlink channel extrapolation network (TUDCEN) is proposed for slot-level channel extrapolation, aiming to enlarge the pilot signal period and thus reduce the temporal domain pilot overhead under high-mobility scenarios. Specifically, we propose the spatial-frequency sampling embedding module to reduce the representation dimension and consequent computational complexity, and we propose to exploit the autoregressive generative Transformer for generating downlink channels autoregressively. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework in significantly reducing the pilot training overhead by more than 16 times and improving the system's spectral efficiency under high-mobility scenarios.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Sparse Acoustic Array Geometries for the Application in Indoor Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Angle-of-Arrival estimation technology, with its potential advantages, emerges as an intriguing choice for indoor localization. Notably, it holds the promise of reducing installation costs. In contrast to ToF/TDoA based systems, AoA-based approaches require a reduced number of nodes for effective localization. This characteristic establishes a trade-off between installation costs and the complexity of hardware and software. Moreover, the appeal of acoustic localization is further heightened by its capacity to provide cost-effective hardware solutions while maintaining a high degree of accuracy. Consequently, acoustic AoA estimation technology stands out as a feasible and compelling option in the field of indoor localization. Sparse arrays additionally have the ability to estimate the DoA of more sources than available sensors by placing sensors in a specific geometry. In this contribution, we introduce a measurement platform designed to evaluate various sparse array geometries experimentally. The acoustic microphone array comprises 64 microphones arranged in an 8x8 grid, following an Uniform Rectangular Array (URA) configuration, with a grid spacing of 8.255 mm. This configuration achieves a spatial Nyquist frequency of approximately 20.8 kHz in the acoustic domain at room temperature. Notably, the array exhibits a mean spherical error of 1.26{\deg} when excluding higher elevation angles. The platform allows for masking sensors to simulate sparse array configurations. We assess four array geometries through simulations and experimental data, identifying the Open-Box and Nested array geometries as robust candidates. Additionally, we demonstrate the array's capability to concurrently estimate the directions of three emitting sources using experimental data, employing waveforms consisting of orthogonal codes.</description>

      <title>Towards Unified AI Models for MU-MIMO Communications: A Tensor Equivariance Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a unified framework based on equivariance for the design of artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted technologies in multi-user multiple-input-multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems. We first provide definitions of multidimensional equivariance, high-order equivariance, and multidimensional invariance (referred to collectively as tensor equivariance). On this basis, by investigating the design of precoding and user scheduling, which are key techniques in MU-MIMO systems, we delve deeper into revealing tensor equivariance of the mappings from channel information to optimal precoding tensors, precoding auxiliary tensors, and scheduling indicators, respectively. To model mappings with tensor equivariance, we propose a series of plug-and-play tensor equivariant neural network (TENN) modules, where the computation involving intricate parameter sharing patterns is transformed into concise tensor operations. Building upon TENN modules, we propose the unified tensor equivariance framework that can be applicable to various communication tasks, based on which we easily accomplish the design of corresponding AI-assisted precoding and user scheduling schemes. Simulation results demonstrate that the constructed precoding and user scheduling methods achieve near-optimal performance while exhibiting significantly lower computational complexity and generalization to inputs with varying sizes across multiple dimensions. This validates the superiority of TENN modules and the unified framework.</description>

      <title>Site-Specific Radio Channel Representation -- Current State and Future Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A site-specific radio channel representation considers the surroundings of the communication system through the environment geometry, such as buildings, vegetation, and mobile objects including their material and surface properties. In this article, we focus on communication technologies for 5G and beyond that are increasingly able to exploit the specific environment geometry for both communication and sensing. We present methods for a site-specific radio channel representation that is spatially consistent, such that mobile transmitters and receivers cause a correlated time-varying channel impulse response. When modelled as random, this channel impulse response has non-stationary statistical properties, i.e., a time-variant Doppler spectrum, power delay profile, K-factor and spatial correlation. A site-specific radio channel representation will enable research into emerging 5G and beyond technologies such as distributed multiple-input multiple-output systems, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, multi-band communication, and joint communication and sensing. These 5G and beyond technologies will be deployed for a wide range of environments, from dense urban areas to railways, road transportation, industrial automation, and unmanned aerial vehicles.</description>

      <title>Joint Channel Estimation and Prediction for Massive MIMO with Frequency Hopping Sounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, the downlink transmission performance heavily relies on accurate channel state information (CSI). Constrained by the transmitted power, user equipment always transmits sounding reference signals (SRSs) to the base station through frequency hopping, which will be leveraged to estimate uplink CSI and subsequently predict downlink CSI. This paper aims to investigate joint channel estimation and prediction (JCEP) for massive MIMO with frequency hopping sounding (FHS). Specifically, we present a multiple-subband (MS) delay-angle-Doppler (DAD) domain channel model with off-grid basis to tackle the energy leakage problem. Furthermore, we formulate the JCEP problem with FHS as a multiple measurement vector (MMV) problem, facilitating the sharing of common CSI across different subbands. To solve this problem, we propose an efficient Off-Grid-MS hybrid message passing (HMP) algorithm under the constrained Bethe free energy (BFE) framework. Aiming to address the lack of prior CSI in practical scenarios, the proposed algorithm can adaptively learn the hyper-parameters of the channel by minimizing the corresponding terms in the BFE expression. To alleviate the complexity of channel hyper-parameter learning, we leverage the approximations of the off-grid matrices to simplify the off-grid hyper-parameter estimation. Numerical results illustrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively mitigate the energy leakage issue and exploit the common CSI across different subbands, acquiring more accurate CSI compared to state-of-the-art counterparts.</description>

      <title>Federated Contrastive Learning for Personalized Semantic Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we design a federated contrastive learning (FedCL) framework aimed at supporting personalized semantic communication. Our FedCL enables collaborative training of local semantic encoders across multiple clients and a global semantic decoder owned by the base station. This framework supports heterogeneous semantic encoders since it does not require client-side model aggregation. Furthermore, to tackle the semantic imbalance issue arising from heterogeneous datasets across distributed clients, we employ contrastive learning to train a semantic centroid generator (SCG). This generator obtains representative global semantic centroids that exhibit intra-semantic compactness and inter-semantic separability. Consequently, it provides superior supervision for learning discriminative local semantic features. Additionally, we conduct theoretical analysis to quantify the convergence performance of FedCL. Simulation results verify the superiority of the proposed FedCL framework compared to other distributed learning benchmarks in terms of task performance and robustness under different numbers of clients and channel conditions, especially in low signal-to-noise ratio and highly heterogeneous data scenarios.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Waveform for 6G: Harnessing Delay-Doppler Alignment Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Waveform design has served as a cornerstone for each generation of mobile communication systems. The future sixth-generation (6G) mobile communication networks are expected to employ larger-scale antenna arrays and exploit higher-frequency bands for further boosting data transmission rate and providing ubiquitous wireless sensing. This brings new opportunities and challenges for 6G waveform design. In this article, by leveraging the super spatial resolution of large antenna arrays and the multi-path spatial sparsity of highfrequency wireless channels, we introduce a new approach for waveform design based on the recently proposed delay-Doppler alignment modulation (DDAM). In particular, DDAM makes a paradigm shift of waveform design from the conventional manner of tolerating channel delay and Doppler spreads to actively manipulating them. First, we review the fundamental constraints and performance limitations of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and introduce new opportunities for 6G waveform design. Next, the motivations and basic principles of DDAM are presented, followed by its various extensions to different wireless system setups. Finally, the main design considerations for DDAM are discussed and the new opportunities for future research are highlighted.</description>

      <title>Joint Power Allocation and Beamforming Design for Active IRS-Aided Directional Modulation Secure Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the secrecy rate (SR) performance improvement obtained by secure directional modulation (DM) network is limited, an active intelligent reflective surface (IRS)-assisted DM network is considered to attain a high SR. To address the SR maximization problem, a novel method based on Lagrangian dual transform and closed-form fractional programming algorithm (LDT-CFFP) is proposed, where the solutions to base station (BS) beamforming vectors and IRS reflection coefficient matrix are achieved. However, the computational complexity of LDT-CFFP method is high . To reduce its complexity, a blocked IRS-assisted DM network is designed. To meet the requirements of the network performance, a power allocation (PA) strategy is proposed and adopted in the system. Specifically, the system power between BS and IRS, as well as the transmission power for confidential messages (CM) and artificial noise (AN) from the BS, are allocated separately. Then we put forward null-space projection (NSP) method, maximum-ratio-reflecting (MRR) algorithm and PA strategy (NSP-MRR-PA) to solve the SR maximization problem. The CF solutions to BS beamforming vectors and IRS reflection coefficient matrix are respectively attained via NSP and MRR algorithms. For the PA factors, we take advantage of exhaustive search (ES) algorithm, particle swarm optimization (PSO) and simulated annealing (SA) algorithm to search for the solutions. From simulation results, it is verified that the LDT-CFFP method derives a higher SR gain over NSP-MRR-PA method. For NSP-MRR-PA method, the number of IRS units in each block possesses a significant SR performance. In addition, the application PA strategies, namely ES, PSO, SA methods outperforms the other PA strategies with fixed PA factors.</description>

      <title>Variational Mode Decomposition as Trusted Data Augmentation in ML-based Power System Stability Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Balanced data is required for deep neural networks (DNNs) when learning to perform power system stability assessment. However, power system measurement data contains relatively few events from where power system dynamics can be learnt. To mitigate this imbalance, we propose a novel data augmentation strategy preserving the dynamic characteristics to be learnt. The augmentation is performed using Variational Mode Decomposition. The detrended and the augmented data are tested for distributions similarity using Kernel Maximum Mean Discrepancy test. In addition, the effectiveness of the augmentation methodology is validated via training an Encoder DNN utilizing original data, testing using the augmented data, and evaluating the Encoder's performance employing several metrics.</description>

      <title>On Improving Error Resilience of Neural End-to-End Speech Coders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Error resilient tools like Packet Loss Concealment (PLC) and Forward Error Correction (FEC) are essential to maintain a reliable speech communication for applications like Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), where packets are frequently delayed and lost. In recent times, end-to-end neural speech codecs have seen a significant rise, due to their ability to transmit speech signal at low bitrates but few considerations were made about their error resilience in a real system. Recently introduced Neural End-to-End Speech Codec (NESC) can reproduce high quality natural speech at low bitrates. We extend its robustness to packet losses by adding a low complexity network to predict the codebook indices in latent space. Furthermore, we propose a method to add an in-band FEC at an additional bitrate of 0.8 kbps. Both subjective and objective assessment indicate the effectiveness of proposed methods, and demonstrate that coupling PLC and FEC provide significant robustness against packet losses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for predicting tool wear in CNC turning operations, combining ultrasonic microphone arrays and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). High-frequency acoustic emissions between 0 kHz and 60 kHz are enhanced using beamforming techniques to improve the signal- to-noise ratio. The processed acoustic data is then analyzed by a CNN, which predicts the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of cutting tools. Trained on data from 350 workpieces machined with a single carbide insert, the model can accurately predict the RUL of the carbide insert. Our results demonstrate the potential gained by integrating advanced ultrasonic sensors with deep learning for accurate predictive maintenance tasks in CNC machining.</description>

      <title>Environment-Aware Codebook Design for RIS-Assisted MU-MISO Communications: Implementation and Performance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) provides a new electromagnetic response control solution, which can proactively reshape the characteristics of wireless channel environments. In RIS-assisted communication systems, the acquisition of channel state information (CSI) and the optimization of reflecting coefficients constitute major design challenges. To address these issues, codebook-based solutions have been developed recently, which, however, are mostly environment-agnostic. In this paper, a novel environment-aware codebook protocol is proposed, which can significantly reduce both pilot overhead and computational complexity, while maintaining expected communication performance. Specifically, first of all, a channel training framework is introduced to divide the training phase into several blocks. In each block, we directly estimate the composite end-to-end channel and focus only on the transmit beamforming. Second, we propose an environment-aware codebook generation scheme, which first generates a group of channels based on statistical CSI, and then obtains their corresponding RIS configuration by utilizing the alternating optimization (AO) method offline. In each online training block, the RIS is configured based on the corresponding codeword in the environment-aware codebook, and the optimal codeword resulting in the highest sum rate is adopted for assisting in the downlink data transmission. Third, we analyze the theoretical performance of the environment-aware codebook-based protocol taking into account the channel estimation errors. Finally, numerical simulations are provided to verify our theoretical analysis and the performance of the proposed scheme. In particular, the simulation results demonstrate that our protocol is more competitive than conventional environment-agnostic codebooks.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Multiuser Communications based on Sparse Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers near-field multiuser communications based on sparse arrays (SAs). First, for the uniform SAs (USAs), we analyze the beam gains of channel steering vectors, which shows that increasing the antenna spacings can effectively improve the spatial resolution of the antenna arrays to enhance the sum rate of multiuser communications. Then, we investigate nonuniform SAs (NSAs) to mitigate the high multiuser interference from the grating lobes of the USAs. To maximize the sum rate of near-field multiuser communications, we optimize the antenna positions of the NSAs, where a successive convex approximation-based antenna position optimization algorithm is proposed. Moreover, we find that the channels of both the USAs and the NSAs show uniform sparsity in the defined surrogate distance-angle (SD-A) domain. Based on the channel sparsity, an on-grid SD-A-domain orthogonal matching pursuit (SDA-OMP) algorithm is developed to estimate multiuser channels. To further improve the resolution of the SDA-OMP, we also design an off-grid SD-A-domain iterative super-resolution channel estimation algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Self-reconfigurable Multifunctional Memristive Nociceptor for Intelligent Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial nociceptors, mimicking human-like stimuli perception, are of significance for intelligent robotics to work in hazardous and dynamic scenarios. One of the most essential characteristics of the human nociceptor is its self-adjustable attribute, which indicates that the threshold of determination of a potentially hazardous stimulus relies on environmental knowledge. This critical attribute has been currently omitted, but it is highly desired for artificial nociceptors. Inspired by these shortcomings, this article presents, for the first time, a Self-Directed Channel (SDC) memristor-based self-reconfigurable nociceptor, capable of perceiving hazardous pressure stimuli under different temperatures and demonstrates key features of tactile nociceptors, including 'threshold,' 'no-adaptation,' and 'sensitization.' The maximum amplification of hazardous external stimuli is 1000%, and its response characteristics dynamically adapt to current temperature conditions by automatically altering the generated modulation schemes for the memristor. The maximum difference ratio of the response of memristors at different temperatures is 500%, and this adaptability closely mimics the functions of biological tactile nociceptors, resulting in accurate danger perception in various conditions. Beyond temperature adaptation, this memristor-based nociceptor has the potential to integrate different sensory modalities by applying various sensors, thereby achieving human-like perception capabilities in real-world environments.</description>

      <title>Learning the Influence Graph of a High-Dimensional Markov Process with Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by multiple applications in social networks, nervous systems, and financial risk analysis, we consider the problem of learning the underlying (directed) influence graph or causal graph of a high-dimensional multivariate discrete-time Markov process with memory. At any discrete time instant, each observed variable of the multivariate process is a binary string of random length, which is parameterized by an unobservable or hidden [0,1]-valued scalar. The hidden scalars corresponding to the variables evolve according to discrete-time linear stochastic dynamics dictated by the underlying influence graph whose nodes are the variables. We extend an existing algorithm for learning i.i.d. graphical models to this Markovian setting with memory and prove that it can learn the influence graph based on the binary observations using logarithmic (in number of variables or nodes) samples when the degree of the influence graph is bounded. The crucial analytical contribution of this work is the derivation of the sample complexity result by upper and lower bounding the rate of convergence of the observed Markov process with memory to its stationary distribution in terms of the parameters of the influence graph.</description>

      <title>A Novel Analytical Model for LEO and MEO Satellite Networks based on Cox Point Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.03549v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work develops an analytical framework for downlink low Earth orbit (LEO) or medium Earth orbit (MEO) satellite communications, leveraging tools from stochastic geometry. We propose a tractable approach to the analysis of such satellite communication systems, accounting for the fact that satellites are located on circular orbits. We accurately incorporate this geometric property of LEO or MEO satellite constellations by developing a Cox point process model that jointly produces orbits and satellites on these orbits. Our work contrasts with previous modeling studies that presumed satellite locations to be entirely random, thereby overlooking the fundamental fact that satellites are jointly positioned on orbits. Employing this Cox model, we analyze the network performance experienced by users located on Earth. Specifically, we evaluate the no-satellite probability of the proposed network and the Laplace transform of the interference created by such a network. Using it, we compute its SIR (signal-to-interference) distribution, namely its coverage probability. By presenting fundamental network performance as functions of key parameters, this model allows one to assess the statistical properties of downlink LEO or MEO satellite communications and can thus be used as a system-level design tool to operate and optimize forthcoming complex LEO or MEO satellite networks.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Multipath Information for Integrated Localization and Sensing via PHD Filtering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15538v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate localization and perception are pivotal for enhancing the safety and reliability of vehicles. However, current localization methods suffer from reduced accuracy when the line-of-sight (LOS) path is obstructed, or a combination of reflections and scatterings is present. In this paper, we present an integrated localization and sensing method that delivers superior performance in complex environments while being computationally efficient. Our method uniformly leverages various types of multipath components (MPCs) through the lens of random finite sets (RFSs), encompassing reflections, scatterings, and their combinations. This advancement eliminates the need for the multipath identification step and streamlines the filtering process by removing the necessity for distinct filters for different multipath types, a requirement that was critical in previous research. The simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of our method in both robustness and effectiveness, particularly in complex environments where the LOS MPC is obscured and in situations involving clutter and missed detection of MPC measurements.</description>

      <title>A Non-Intrusive Neural Quality Assessment Model for Surface Electromyography Signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05482v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In practical scenarios involving the measurement of surface electromyography (sEMG) in muscles, particularly those areas near the heart, one of the primary sources of contamination is the presence of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. To assess the quality of real-world sEMG data more effectively, this study proposes QASE-net, a new non-intrusive model that predicts the SNR of sEMG signals. QASE-net combines CNN-BLSTM with attention mechanisms and follows an end-to-end training strategy. Our experimental framework utilizes real-world sEMG and ECG data from two open-access databases, the Non-Invasive Adaptive Prosthetics Database and the MIT-BIH Normal Sinus Rhythm Database, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of QASE-net over the previous assessment model, exhibiting significantly reduced prediction errors and notably higher linear correlations with the ground truth. These findings show the potential of QASE-net to substantially enhance the reliability and precision of sEMG quality assessment in practical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a reciprocity calibration method for dual-antenna repeaters in wireless networks. The method uses bi-directional measurements between two network nodes, A and B, where for each bi-directional measurement, the repeaters are configured in different states. The nodes A and B could be two access points in a distributed MIMO system, or they could be a base station and a mobile user terminal, for example. From the calibration measurements, the differences between the repeaters' forward and reverse gains are estimated. The repeaters are then (re-)configured to compensate for these differences such that the repeaters appear, transparently to the network, as reciprocal components of the propagation environment, enabling reciprocity-based beamforming in the network.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation for Holographic MIMO: Wavenumber-Domain Sparsity Inspired Approaches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the sparse channel estimation for holographic multiple-input multiple-output (HMIMO) systems. Given that the wavenumber-domain representation is based on a series of Fourier harmonics that are in essence a series of orthogonal basis functions, a novel wavenumber-domain sparsifying basis is designed to expose the sparsity inherent in HMIMO channels. Furthermore, by harnessing the beneficial sparsity in the wavenumber domain, the sparse estimation of HMIMO channels is structured as a compressed sensing problem, which can be efficiently solved by our proposed wavenumber-domain orthogonal matching pursuit (WD-OMP) algorithm. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed wavenumber-domain sparsifying basis maintains its detection accuracy regardless of the number of antenna elements and antenna spacing. Additionally, in the case of antenna spacing being much less than half a wavelength, the wavenumber-domain approach remains highly accurate in identifying the significant angular power of HMIMO channels.</description>

      <title>GAPses: Versatile smart glasses for comfortable and fully-dry acquisition and parallel ultra-low-power processing of EEG and EOG</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements in head-mounted wearable technology are revolutionizing the field of biopotential measurement, but the integration of these technologies into practical, user-friendly devices remains challenging due to issues with design intrusiveness, comfort, and data privacy. To address these challenges, this paper presents GAPSES, a novel smart glasses platform designed for unobtrusive, comfortable, and secure acquisition and processing of electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG) signals. We introduce a direct electrode-electronics interface with custom fully dry soft electrodes to enhance comfort for long wear. An integrated parallel ultra-low-power RISC-V processor (GAP9, Greenwaves Technologies) processes data at the edge, thereby eliminating the need for continuous data streaming through a wireless link, enhancing privacy, and increasing system reliability in adverse channel conditions. We demonstrate the broad applicability of the designed prototype through validation in a number of EEG-based interaction tasks, including alpha waves, steady-state visual evoked potential analysis, and motor movement classification. Furthermore, we demonstrate an EEG-based biometric subject recognition task, where we reach a sensitivity and specificity of 98.87% and 99.86% respectively, with only 8 EEG channels and an energy consumption per inference on the edge as low as 121 uJ. Moreover, in an EOG-based eye movement classification task, we reach an accuracy of 96.68% on 11 classes, resulting in an information transfer rate of 94.78 bit/min, which can be further increased to 161.43 bit/min by reducing the accuracy to 81.43%. The deployed implementation has an energy consumption of 24 uJ per inference and a total system power of only 16.28 mW, allowing for continuous operation of more than 12 h with a small 75 mAh battery.</description>

      <title>Learning graph geometry and topology using dynamical systems based message-passing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09924v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce DYMAG: a message passing paradigm for GNNs built on the expressive power of continuous, multiscale graph-dynamics. Standard discrete-time message passing algorithms implicitly make use of simplistic graph dynamics and aggregation schemes which limit their ability to capture fundamental graph topological properties. By contrast, DYMAG makes use of complex graph dynamics based on the heat and wave equation as well as a more complex equation which admits chaotic solutions. The continuous nature of the dynamics are leveraged to generate multiscale (dynamic-time snapshot) representations which we prove are linked to various graph topological and spectral properties. We demonstrate experimentally that DYMAG achieves superior performance in recovering the generating parameters of Erd\"os-Renyi and stochastic block model random graphs and the persistent homology of synthetic graphs and citation network. Since the behavior of proteins and biomolecules is sensitive to graph topology and exhibits important structure at multiple scales, we find that DYMAG outperforms other methods at predicting salient features of various biomolecules.</description>
