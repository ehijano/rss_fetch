      <title>Geometry of Hypersurfaces with Isolated Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the Fano variety of lines in hypersurfaces, particularly focusing on those with mild singularities. Our first result explores the irreducibility of the variety $\Sigma$ of lines passing through a singular point $y$ on a hypersurface $Y \subset \mathbb{P}^n$. Our second result studies the Fano variety of lines of cubic hypersurfaces with more than one singular point, motivated by Voisin's construction of a dominant rational self map.</description>

      <title>Gr\"obner Fans and Minimal Embedded Toric Resolutions of Rational Double Point Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [19], the authors give minimal embedded toric resolutions of ADE-singularities in C^3 by constructing regular refinements of their dual Newton polyhedrons with the elements of their embedded valuation sets derived from the jet schemes constructed in [18]. On the other hand in [1] and [2], the authors represent the Gr\"obner fan of a Newton non-degenerate variety and prove that a regular refinement of the Gr\"obner fan of such a singularity yields an embedded toric resolution. In this paper, we reconstruct embedded toric resolutions of ADE-singularities: We give the explicit constructions of their Gr\"obner fans and refine them using the concept of profile.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that any equivalence of bounded derived categories of coherent sheaves on a smooth projective complex variety supported in a closed algebraic subset preserves the dimension of the support in two cases: (i) the restriction of the (anti)canonical bundle to the support is ample; (ii) the supports are irreducible and the equivalence sends a skyscraper sheaf of a closed point to a skyscraper sheaf of a closed point. Moreover, in the first case the equivalence recovers the set of closed points of the support up to homeomorphism.</description>

      <title>Quantum K--theory of Grassmannians from a Yang-Baxter algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an earlier paper, two of the authors defined a $5$-vertex Yang-Baxter algebra (a Hopf algebra) which acts on the sum of the equivariant quantum K-rings of Grassmannians $\mathrm{Gr}(k;n)$, where $k$ varies from $0$ to $n$. We construct geometrically defined operators on quantum K-rings describing this action. In particular, the $R$-matrix defining the Yang-Baxter algebra corresponds to the left Weyl group action. Most importantly, we use the `quantum=classical' statement for the quantum K-theory of Grassmannians to prove an explicit geometric interpretation of the action of generators of the Yang-Baxter algebra. The diagonal entries of the monodromy matrix are given by quantum K-multiplications by explicitly defined classes, and the off-diagonal entries by certain push-pull convolutions. We use this to find a quantization of the classes of fixed points in the quantum K-rings, corresponding to the Bethe vectors of the Yang-Baxter algebra. On each of the quantum K-rings, we prove that the two Frobenius structures (one from geometry, and the other from the integrable system construction) coincide. We discuss several applications, including an action of the extended affine Weyl group on the quantum K-theory ring (extending the Seidel action), a quantum version of the localization map (which is a ring homomorphism with respect to the quantum K-product), and a graphical calculus to multiply by Hirzebruch $\lambda_y$ classes of the dual of the tautological quotient bundle. In an Appendix we illustrate our results in the case when $n=2$.</description>

      <title>$(G,F)$-points on $\mathbb{Q}$-algebraic varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G\in \mathbb{Q}[x,y,z]$ be a polynomial, and let $V(G)$ be the $\mathbb{Q}$-algebraic variety corresponding to $G$, i.e., $V(G)=\{P\in\mathbb{Q}^3~|~G(P)=0\}$. Let \[\begin{split} F:\quad &amp;\mathbb{Q}^3\rightarrow \mathbb{Q}^3,\\ &amp;(x,y,z)\mapsto (f(x),f(y),f(z)) \end{split}\] be a vector function, where $f\in \mathbb{Q}[x]$. It is easy to know that the function obtained by the composition of $G$ and $F$, denoted as $G\circ F$, is still in $\mathbb{Q}[x,y,z]$. Moreover, let $V(G\circ F)$ be the $\mathbb{Q}$-algebraic variety corresponding to $G\circ F$, i.e., $V(G\circ F)=\{P\in\mathbb{Q}^3~|~G\circ F(P)=0\}$. A rational point $P$ is called a $(G,F)$-point on $V(G)$ if $P$ belongs to the intersection of $V(G)$ and $V(G\circ F)$, that is $P\in V(G)\cap V(G\circ F)$. Denote $\langle G,F\rangle$ as the set consisting of all $(G,F)$-points on $V(G)$. Obviously, $\langle G,F\rangle$ is a $\mathbb{Q}$-algebraic variety. In this paper, we consider the algebraic variety $\langle G,F\rangle$ for some specific functions $G$ and $F$. For these specific functions $G$ and $F$, we prove that $\langle G,F\rangle$ will be isomorphic to a certain elliptic curve. We also analyze some properties of these elliptic curves.</description>

      <title>On complete distinguished chains and defectless unibranched extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let (K,v) be a valued field. Take an extension of v to a fixed algebraic closure L of K. In this paper we show that an element a in L admits a complete distinguished chain over K if and only if the extension (K(a)|K,v) is defectless and unibranched. This characterization generalizes the known result in the henselian case. In particular, our result shows that if a admits a complete distinguished chain over K, then it also admits one over the henselization; however, the converse may not be true. The main tool employed in our analysis is the stability of the j-invariant associated to a valuation transcendental extension under passage to the henselization.</description>

      <title>Number fields generated by points in linear systems on curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a nonconstant morphism from a smooth projective geometrically integral curve $C$ to $\mathbb{P}^1$ over a number field $k$, Hilbert's irreducibility theorem implies that there are infinitely many points $t\in \mathbb{P}^1(k)$ such that the fiber $C_t$ is irreducible. Results in the case of Galois covers control the possible inertia and ramification degrees of places where a (not necessarily Galois) morphism $C\to \mathbb{P}^1$ has good reduction, which determines the isomorphism classes of all unramified subfields of $\mathbf{k}(C_t)$. In this paper, we develop techniques for studying the possible isomorphism classes of ramified maximal subfields of $\mathbf{k}(C_t)$, without passing to a Galois closure. In particular, we describe the realized isomorphism classes of ramified maximal subfields of $\mathbf{k}(C_t)$ as $t$ varies in a single residue disk in terms of an orbit of a single realizable ramified subfield.</description>

      <title>Positivity of automorphic vector bundles on unitary Shimura varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be the special fiber of a unitary Shimura variety of hyperspecial level. We establish a sharp criterion for the ampleness of automorphic line bundles $\mathcal{L}_Y(\lambda)$ over the flag space $Y$, which effectively detects the coherent cohomology of automorphic vector bundles on $X$. Our proof is based on a careful analyse of the stratification of $X$ and $Y$, along with the morphisms between these strata. Additionally, we construct certain strata Hasse invariants, and establish correspondences between specific strata of different unitary Shimura varieties and their respective flag spaces.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Reducing the Complexity of Geometric Vision Problems and its Application to Two-View Triangulation with Approximation Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new framework for reducing the computational complexity of geometric vision problems through targeted reweighting of the cost functions used to minimize reprojection errors. Triangulation - the task of estimating a 3D point from noisy 2D projections across multiple images - is a fundamental problem in multiview geometry and Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipelines. We apply our framework to the two-view case and demonstrate that optimal triangulation, which requires solving a univariate polynomial of degree six, can be simplified through cost function reweighting reducing the polynomial degree to two. This reweighting yields a closed-form solution while preserving strong geometric accuracy. We derive optimal weighting strategies, establish theoretical bounds on the approximation error, and provide experimental results on real data demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to standard methods. Although this work focuses on two-view triangulation, the framework generalizes to other geometric vision problems.</description>

      <title>Skeletal Torus Actions and GKM Structures on Quiver Grassmannians of String Representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quiver Grassmannians of equioriented type $\texttt{A}$ and nilpotent equioriented type $\tilde{\texttt{A}}$ quiver representations are GKM-varieties. In particular, they have a cellular decomposition and admit a torus action with finitely many fixed points and one-dimensional orbits (i.e. skeletal action). We examine the case of string representations and provide a classification of all corresponding quiver Grassmannians with a GKM-variety structure.</description>

Abstract: We study algebraic cycles on complex Gushel-Mukai (GM) varieties. We prove the generalised Hodge conjecture, the (motivated) Mumford-Tate conjecture, and the generalised Tate conjecture for all GM varieties. We compute all integral Chow groups of GM varieties, except for the only two infinite-dimensional cases (1-cycles on GM fourfolds and 2-cycles on GM sixfolds). We prove that if two GM varieties are generalised partners or generalised duals, their rational Chow motives in middle degree are isomorphic.</description>

      <title>Linear orbits of smooth quadric surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.09496v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The linear orbit of a degree d hypersurface in $\mathbb{P}^n$ is its orbit under the natural action of PGL(n+1), in the projective space of dimension $N =\binom{n+d}{d} - 1$ parameterizing such hypersurfaces. This action restricted to a specific hypersurface $X$ extends to a rational map from the projectivization of the space of matrices to $\mathbb{P}^N$. The class of the graph of this map is the predegree polynomial of its corresponding hypersurface. The objective of this paper is threefold. First, we formally define the predegree polynomial of a hypersurface in $\mathbb{P}^n$, introduced in the case of plane curves by Aluffi and Faber, and prove some results in the general case. A key result in the general setting is that a partial resolution of said rational map can contain enough information to compute the predegree polynomial of a hypersurface. Second, we compute the leading term of the predegree polynomial of a smooth quadric in $\mathbb{P}^n$ over an algebraically closed field with characteristic 0, and compute the other coefficients in the specific case n = 3. In analogy to Aluffi and Faber's work, the tool for computing this invariant is producing a (partial) resolution of the previously mentioned rational map which contains enough information to obtain the invariant. Third, we provide a complete resolution of the rational map in the case $n = 3$, which in principle could be used to compute more refined invariants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this short paper, we aim at giving a more conceptual and simpler proof of Rumely's moduli theoretic characterization of type II minimal locus of the resultant function $\operatorname{ordRes}_\phi$ on the Berkovich hyperbolic space for a rational function $\phi$ on $\mathbb{P}^1$ defined over an algebraically closed and complete non-archimedean and non-trivially valued field, and also at making it sharper and simplifying the proof of the degenerating limit theorem of DeMarco--Faber for the family of the unique maximal entropy measures on $\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{C})$ associated to a meromorphic family of complex rational functions. For those aims, we introduce the intrinsic reduction of $\phi$ at each point in the Berkovich projective line and its directionwise intrinsic depths, which are defined in terms of the tree and analytic structures of the Berkovich projective line and are suitable languages, and then establish two theorems in non-archimedean dynamics.</description>

      <title>Torsion points of small order on cyclic covers of $\mathbb P^1$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $d\geq 2$ be a positive integer, $K$ an algebraically closed field of characteristic not dividing $d$, $n\geq d+1$ a positive integer that is prime to $d$, $f(x)\in K[x]$ a degree $n$ monic polynomial without multiple roots, $C_{f,d}: y^d=f(x)$ the corresponding smooth plane affine curve over $K$, $\mathcal{C}_{f,d}$ a smooth projective model of $C_{f,d}$ and $J(\mathcal{C}_{f,d})$ the Jacobian of $\mathcal{C}_{f,d} $. We identify $\mathcal{C}_{f,d}$ with the image of its canonical embedding into $J(\mathcal{C}_{f,d})$ (such that the infinite point of $\mathcal{C}_{f,d}$ goes to the zero of the group law on $J(\mathcal{C}_{f,d})$).
  Earlier the second named author proved that if $d=2$ and $n=2g+1 \ge 5$ then the genus $g$ hyperelliptic curve $\mathcal{C}_{f,2}$ contains no points of orders lying between $3$ and $n-1=2g$.
  In the present paper we generalize this result to the case of arbitrary $d$. Namely, we prove that if $P$ is a point of order $m&gt;1$ on $\mathcal{C}_{f,d}$, then either $m=d$ or $m\geq n$. We also describe all curves $\mathcal{C}_{f,d}$ having a point of order $n$.</description>

      <title>On the module of derivations of a line arrangement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01624v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To each multiple point $p$ in a line arrangement $\mathcal A$ in the complex projective plane we associate a derivation $\tilde D_p \in D_0( \mathcal A)$. We show first that these derivations span a large subspace of $D_0(\mathcal A)$. To each such derivation $\tilde D_p \in D_0(\mathcal A)$ we associate a polynomial $g_p$ which seems to play a key role in the characterization of the freeness of $\mathcal A$, as well as in the study of the position of the multiple points of $\mathcal A$ with respect to unions of lines.</description>

      <title>Categorical Enumerative Invariants, II: Givental formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.06659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To a pair $(A,s)$ consisting of a smooth, cyclic $A_\infty$-algebra $A$ and a splitting $s$ of the Hodge filtration on its Hochschild homology Costello (2005) associates an invariant which conjecturally generalizes the total descendant Gromov-Witten potential of a symplectic manifold.
  In this paper we give explicit, computable formulas for Costello's invariants, as Feynman sums over partially directed stable graphs. The formulas use in a crucial way the combinatorial string vertices defined earlier by Costello and the authors. Explicit computations elsewhere confirm in many cases the equality of categorical invariants with known Gromov-Witten, Fan-Jarvis-Ruan-Witten, and Bershadsky-Cecotti-Ooguri-Vafa invariants.</description>

      <title>On real and observable rational realizations of input-output equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16799v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a single (differential-algebraic) input-output equation, we present a method for finding different representations of the associated system in the form of rational realizations; these are dynamical systems with rational right-hand sides. It has been shown that in the case where the input-output equation is of order one, rational realizations can be computed, if they exist. In this work, we focus first on the existence and actual computation of the so-called observable rational realizations, and secondly on rational realizations with real coefficients. The study of observable realizations allows to find every rational realization of a given first order input-output equation, and the necessary field extensions in this process. We show that for first order input-output equations the existence of a rational realization is equivalent to the existence of an observable rational realization. Moreover, we give a criterion to decide the existence of real rational realizations. The computation of observable and real realizations of first order input-output equations is fully algorithmic. We also present partial results for the case of higher order input-output equations.</description>

      <title>Learning Gaussian Multi-Index Models with Gradient Flow: Time Complexity and Directional Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on the gradient flow dynamics of a neural network model that uses correlation loss to approximate a multi-index function on high-dimensional standard Gaussian data. Specifically, the multi-index function we consider is a sum of neurons $f^*(x) \!=\! \sum_{j=1}^k \! \sigma^*(v_j^T x)$ where $v_1, \dots, v_k$ are unit vectors, and $\sigma^*$ lacks the first and second Hermite polynomials in its Hermite expansion. It is known that, for the single-index case ($k\!=\!1$), overcoming the search phase requires polynomial time complexity. We first generalize this result to multi-index functions characterized by vectors in arbitrary directions. After the search phase, it is not clear whether the network neurons converge to the index vectors, or get stuck at a sub-optimal solution. When the index vectors are orthogonal, we give a complete characterization of the fixed points and prove that neurons converge to the nearest index vectors. Therefore, using $n \! \asymp \! k \log k$ neurons ensures finding the full set of index vectors with gradient flow with high probability over random initialization. When $ v_i^T v_j \!=\! \beta \! \geq \! 0$ for all $i \neq j$, we prove the existence of a sharp threshold $\beta_c \!=\! c/(c+k)$ at which the fixed point that computes the average of the index vectors transitions from a saddle point to a minimum. Numerical simulations show that using a correlation loss and a mild overparameterization suffices to learn all of the index vectors when they are nearly orthogonal, however, the correlation loss fails when the dot product between the index vectors exceeds a certain threshold.</description>
