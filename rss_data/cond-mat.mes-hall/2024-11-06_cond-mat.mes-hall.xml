      <title>Tuning the lasing threshold of quantum well exciton-polaritons under a perpendicular magnetic field: a theoretical study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polariton lasing is a promising phenomenon with potential applications in next-generation lasers that operate without the need for population inversion. Applying a perpendicular magnetic field to a quantum well (QW) significantly alters the properties of exciton-polaritons. In this theoretical study, we investigate how the lasing threshold of QW exciton-polaritons depends on the magnetic field. By modifying the exciton's effective mass and Rabi splitting, the magnetic field induces notable changes in the relaxation kinetics, which directly affect the lasing threshold. For low-energy pumping, an increase in the magnetic field delays the lasing threshold, while for high-energy pumping, the threshold is reached at much lower pump intensities. Furthermore, increasing both the pump energy and the magnetic field enhances relaxation efficiency, leading to a substantially larger number of condensed polaritons. Our result gives insights into the modulation of exciton-polariton condensation through magnetic fields, with potential implications for the design of low-threshold polariton lasers.</description>

      <title>Bulk and shear viscosities in multicomponent 2D electron system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated magnetotransport in mesoscopic samples containing electrons from three different subbands in GaAs triple wells. At high temperatures, we observed positive magnetoresistance, which we attribute to the imbalance between different types of particles that are sensitive to bulk viscosities. At low temperatures, we found negative magnetoresistance, attributed to shear viscosity. By analyzing the magnetoresistance data, we were able to determine both viscosities. Remarkably, the electronic bulk viscosity was significantly larger than the shear viscosity. Studying multicomponent electron systems in the hydrodynamic regime presents an intriguing opportunity to further explore the physics in systems with high bulk viscosity.</description>

      <title>Straintronic magnetic tunnel junctions for analog computation: A perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The straintronic magnetic tunnel junction (s-MTJ) is an MTJ whose resistance state can be changed continuously or gradually from high to low with a gate voltage that generates strain the magnetostrictive soft layer. This unusual feature, not usually available in MTJs that are switched abruptly with spin transfer torque, spin-orbit torque or voltage-controlled-magnetic-anisotropy, enables many analog applications where the typically low tunneling magneto-resistance ratio of MTJs (on/off ratio of the switch) and the relatively large switching error rate are not serious impediments unlike in digital logic or memory. More importantly, the transfer characteristic of a s-MTJ (conductance versus gate voltage) always sports a linear region that can be exploited to implement analog arithmetic, vector matrix multiplication and linear synapses in deep learning networks very effectively. In these applications, the s-MTJ is actually superior to the better known memristors and domain wall synapses which do not exhibit the linearity and/or the analog behavior.</description>

      <title>Universal Spin Screening Clouds in Local Moment Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02723v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a local impurity spin interacts with conduction electrons whose density of states (DOS) has a (pseudo)gap or diverges at the Fermi energy, a local moment (LM) phase can be favored over a Kondo phase. Theoretically studying quantum entanglement between the impurity and conduction electrons, we demonstrate that conduction electrons form an ''LM spin cloud'' in general LM phases, which corresponds to, but has fundamental difference from, the Kondo cloud screening the impurity spin in the Kondo phase. The LM cloud algebraically decays over the distance from the impurity when the DOS has a pseudogap or divergence, and exponentially when it has a hard gap. We find an ''LM cloud length'', a single length scale characterizing a universal form of the LM cloud. The findings are supported by both of analytic theories and numerical computations.</description>

      <title>Strong coupling of a superconducting flux qubit to single bismuth donors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The realization of a quantum computer represents a tremendous scientific and technological challenge due to the extreme fragility of quantum information. The physical support of information, namely the quantum bit or qubit, must at the same time be strongly coupled to other qubits by gates to compute information, and well decoupled from its environment to keep its quantum behavior. An interesting physical system for realizing such qubits are magnetic impurities in semiconductors, such as bismuth donors in silicon. Indeed, spins associated to bismuth donors can reach an extremely long coherence time -- of the order of seconds. Yet it is extremely difficult to establish and control efficient gates between these spins. Here we demonstrate a protocol where single bismuth donors can coherently transfer their quantum information to a superconducting flux qubit, which acts as a mediator or quantum bus. This superconducting device allows to connect distant spins on-demand with little impact on their coherent behavior.</description>

      <title>Wave-packet dynamics in a graphene with periodic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the Dirac continuum model to study the propagation of electronic wave packets in graphene with periodically arranged circular potential steps. The time propagation of the wave packets are calculated using the split-operator method for different size, height and separation of the barriers. The time propagation of the wave packets is calculated using the split-operator method for various barrier sizes, heights, and separations. We found that, despite the pronounced Klein tunneling effect in graphene, the presence of a lattice of defects significantly impacts the propagation properties of the wave packets. For example, depending on the height and size of the incident wave packet, the transmission probability can decrease by more than 20\%. The alteration of the polarity of the potential barriers also contributes to the transmission probabilities of the wave packet in graphene. The obtained results could provide valuable insights into the fundamental understanding of charge carrier dynamics in graphene-based nanodevices.</description>

      <title>Dynamic switching of ferrocene and plasmonic interactions in Au/self-assembled monolayer/single Ag nanocube molecular junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the redox switching of ferrocene moieties embedded in a double tunnel barrier plasmonic cavity fabricated from a click-chemistry self-assembled monolayers of ferrocenyl-alkylthiol on ultra flat gold surfaces, connected to a single poly(vinylpyrrolidone) capped silver nanocube, AgNC, which is contacted by the tip of a conductive-AFM to study the electron transport properties in the dark and under light irradiation at the plasmonic resonance wavelengths. We observe a dual behavior in the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics in the dark: a large hysteresis loop at positive voltages and an hysteretic negative differential conductance (NDC) at negative voltages, due to the redox switching of ferrocene between its oxidized (Fc+) and neutral (Fc0) states. The I-V curves are analyzed by a generalized combined Marcus-Landauer model. We determine the highest occupied molecular orbital of the Fc+ and Fc0 states at 0.54 and 0.42 eV below the Fermi energy, respectively, with a weak reorganization energy &lt; 0.1 eV upon switching. Under plasmonic excitation, the hysteresis and NDC behaviors are no longer observed and the I-V characteristics of the Au-ferrocenyl-alkylthiol/AgNC junctions become similar to Au-ferrocenyl-alkylthiol SAMs. A virtual molecular orbital due to the plasmon-induced coupling (fast electron transfer) between the two redox states of the Fc is determined at 0.46 eV. This dynamic behavior opens perspectives in artificial synaptic devices for neuromorphic computing with the additional function to turn on/off this synaptic behavior on-demand by light.</description>

      <title>Chemifriction and Superlubricity: Friends or Foes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanisms underlying chemifriction, i.e. the contribution of interfacial bonding to friction in defected twisted graphene interfaces are revealed using fully atomistic machine-learning molecular dynamics simulations. This involves stochastic events of consecutive bond formation and rupture, that are spatially separated but not necessarily independent. A unique shear-induced interlayer atomic transfer healing mechanism is discovered that can be harnessed to design a run-in procedure to restore superlubric sliding. This mechanism should be manifested as negative differential friction coefficients that are expected to emerge under moderate normal loads. A physically motivated phenomenological model is developed to predict the effects of chemifriction in experimentally relevant sliding velocity regimes. This allows us to identify a distinct transition between logarithmic increase and logarithmic decrease of frictional stress with increasing sliding velocity. While demonstrated for homogeneous graphene interfaces, a similar mechanism is expected to occur in other homogeneous or heterogeneous defected two-dimensional material interfaces.</description>

      <title>Adatom engineering magnetic order in superconductors: Applications to altermagnetic superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study theoretically how superlattices based on adatoms on surfaces of unconventional superconductors can be used to engineer novel pairing states that break time-reversal symmetry and exhibit non-trivial magnetic point symmetries. We illustrate this using a square-lattice Hubbard model with $d$-wave superconductivity and a subleading $s$-wave state as an example. An adatom superlattice with square-lattice symmetries is shown to stabilize an "orbital-altermagnetic superconductor'', a state that exhibits loop current patterns and associated orbital magnetic moments, which preserve superlattice translations but are odd under four-fold rotations. This state is further characterized by a non-zero Berry curvature quadrupole moment and, upon including spin-orbit coupling, by an altermagnetic spin splitting of the bands and non-trivial spin textures in the superlattice unit cell, with zero net spin moment.</description>

      <title>Gapless Floquet topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in insulators and superconductors are known for their robust edge modes, linked to bulk invariants through the bulk-boundary correspondence. While this principle traditionally applies to gapped phases, recent advances have extended it to gapless systems, where topological edge states persist even in the absence of a bulk gap. We extend this framework to periodically driven chains with chiral symmetry, revealing the existence of topological edge zero- and pi-modes despite the lack of bulk gaps in the quasienergy spectrum. By examining the half-period decomposition of chiral evolutions, we construct topological invariants that circumvent the need to define the Floquet Hamiltonian, making them more suitable for generalization to the gapless regime. We provide explicit examples, including generalizations of the Kitaev chain and related spin models, where localized pi-modes emerge even when the bulk is gapless at the same quasi-energy as the edge modes. We numerically study the effect of interactions, which give a finite lifetime to the edge modes in the thermodynamic limit with the decay rate consistent with Fermi's Golden Rule.</description>

      <title>Extraction and Simulation of the Impact of Flux Trapping in Moats of AC-Biased Shift Registers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moats in superconducting ground planes are used to trap magnetic flux away from sensitive parts of superconductor integrated circuits. We simulate the effect of magnetic flux trapped in moats on the operating margins of ac-biased SFQ shift registers (ShReg) with two ground planes for various congruent moat geometries, moat sizes, locations in the ShReg cells, number and polarity of the trapped of fluxons. Using inductance extractor InductEx, we extract mutual couplings between the moats and the ShReg inductors and include them in the refined netlist. Then, we use JoSim to simulate the circuit operation and find the threshold ac clock amplitude above which the register starts to operate correctly. The relative change in this threshold is used to characterize the influence of flux trapping on the circuit operation. Monte-Carlo simulations are used to investigate the effect of the circuit parameter variations on the statistics of the threshold, using the standard deviation of the Josephson junction critical current and of the circuit inductance extracted from the fabrication process control monitors. The obtained distributions are compared with the independently measured distributions of the threshold amplitude for the individual cells of ac-biased shift registers with 108,500 Josephson junctions. The results show that flux trapping in properly designs moats have a very small effect on the operation margins of the large-scale shift registers whereas the main contribution to the cell-to-cell variation of the threshold comes from the variation of the junctions' critical currents.</description>

      <title>Quantum surface effects on quantum emitters coupled to surface plasmon polariton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As an ideal platform to explore strong quantized light-matter interactions, surface plasmon polariton (SPP) has inspired many applications in quantum technologies. It was recently found that quantum surface effects (QSEs) of the metal, including nonlocal optical response, electron spill-out, and Landau damping, contribute additional loss sources to the SPP. Such a deteriorated loss of the SPP severely hinders its realization of long-distance quantum interconnect. Here, we investigate the non-Markovian dynamics of quantum emitters (QEs) coupled to a common SPP in the presence of the QSEs in a planar metal-dielectric nanostructure. A mechanism to overcome the dissipation of the QEs caused by the lossy SPP is discovered. We find that, as long as the QE-SPP bound states favored by the QSEs are formed, a dissipationless entanglement among the QEs is created. It leads to that the separated QEs are coherently correlated in a manner of the Rabi-like oscillation mediated by the SPP even experiencing the metal absorption. Our study on the QSEs refreshes our understanding of the light-matter interactions in the absorptive medium and paves the way for applying the SPP in quantum interconnect.</description>

      <title>Hubbard interaction at finite $T$ on a hexagonal lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03196v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The temporal finite volume induces significant effects in Monte Carlo simulations of systems in low dimensions, such as graphene, a 2-D hexagonal system known for its unique electronic properties and numerous potential applications. In this work, we explore the behavior of fermions on a hexagonal sheet with a Hubbard-type interaction characterized by coupling $U$. This system exhibits zero or near zero-energy excitations that are highly sensitive to finite temperature effects. We compute corrections to the self-energy and the effective mass of low-energy excitations, arriving at a quantization condition that includes the temporal finite volume. These analyses are then conducted for both zero and finite temperatures. Our findings reveal that the first-order $\mathcal{O}(U)$ contributions are absent, leading to non-trivial corrections starting at $\mathcal{O}(U^2)$. We validate our calculations against exact and numerical results obtained from Hybrid Monte Carlo simulations on small lattices.</description>

      <title>Electron-irradiation effects on monolayer MoS2 at elevated temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effect of electron irradiation on 2D materials is an important topic, both for the correct interpretation of electron microscopy experiments and for possible applications in electron lithography. After the importance of including inelastic scattering damage in theoretical models describing beam damage, and the lack of oxygen-sensitivity under electron irradiation in 2D MoS2 was recently shown, the role of temperature has remained unexplored on a quantitative level. Here we show the effect of temperature on both the creation of individual defects as well as the effect of temperature on defect dynamics. Based on the measured displacement cross section of sulphur atoms in MoS2 by atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy, we find an increased probability for defect creation for temperatures up to 150{\deg}C, in accordance with theoretical predictions. However, higher temperatures lead to a decrease of the observed cross sections. Despite this apparent decrease, we find that the elevated temperature does not mitigate the creation of defects as this observation would suggest, but rather hides the created damage due to rapid thermal diffusion of the created vacancies before their detection, leading to the formation of vacancy lines and pores outside the measurements field of view. Using the experimental data in combination with previously reported theoretical models for the displacement cross section, we estimate the migration energy barrier of sulphur vacancies in MoS2 to be 0.47 +- 0.24 eV. These results mark another step towards the complete understanding of electron beam damage in MoS2 .</description>

Abstract: Topology is the study of geometrical properties and spatial relations unaffected by continuous changes, and has become an important tool for understanding complex physical systems. Although recent optical experiments have inferred the existence of vector fields with the topologies of merons, the inability to extract the full three dimensional vectors misses a richer set of topologies that have not yet been fully explored. In our work, we extend the study of the topology of electromagnetic fields on surfaces to a spin quasi-particle with the topology of a meron pair, formed by interfering surface plasmon polaritons, and show that the in-plane vectors are constrained by the embedding topology of the space as dictated by the Poincare-Hopf theorem. In addition we explore the time evolution of the three dimensional topology of the spin field formed by femtosecond laser pulses. These experiments are possible using our here developed method called polarimetric photoemission electron microscopy (polarimetric PEEM) that combines an optical pump-probe technique and polarimetry with photo-emission electron microscopy. This method allows for the accurate generation of surface plasmon polariton fields and their subsequent measurement, revealing both the spatial distribution of the full three-dimensional electromagnetic fields at deep sub-wavelength resolution and their time evolution.</description>

Abstract: We study parametric instability in a magnomechanical system, specifically examining magnon tunneling between moving ferromagnetic insulators. Our analysis reveals that quantum fluctuations generate spin currents above a critical velocity threshold, while no spin currents occur below this threshold at low temperatures. The critical velocity depends on magnon stiffness and Zeeman energy. Approaching the threshold, the spin current becomes divergent, linked to the PT-symmetry-breaking transition. This enhanced behavior could offer high-sensitivity measurements and efficient spin current generation in magnon-based quantum technology.</description>

Abstract: We report measurements of the current-phase relation of two voltage-controlled semiconductor-superconductor hybrid Josephson junctions (JJs) in series. The two hybrid junctions behave similar to a single-mode JJ with effective transparency determined by the ratio of Josephson coupling strengths of the two junctions. Gate-voltage control of Josephson coupling (measured from switching currents) allows tuning of the harmonic content from sinusoidal, for asymmetric tuning, to highly nonsinusoidal, for symmetric tuning. The experimentally observed tunable harmonic content agrees with a model based on two conventional (sinusoidal) JJs in series.</description>

      <title>Germanium-based hybrid semiconductor-superconductor topological quantum computing platforms: Disorder effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It was recently suggested that proximitized gate-defined Ge hole nanowires could serve as an alternative materials platform for the realization of topological Majorana zero modes (MZMs). Here, we theoretically study the expected experimental signatures of Ge-based MZMs in tunneling conductance measurements, taking into account that unintentional random disorder is unavoidably present in realistic devices. Explicitly, we present numerically calculated local and nonlocal tunneling conductance spectra (as functions of bias voltage and magnetic field) for two different wire lengths, two different disorder models, two different parent superconductors (Al and NbTiN), and various disorder strengths, which we relate to an estimated lower bound for the disorder strength in Ge-based hybrid devices that we extract from the experimentally reported hole mobilities in current state-of-the-art two-dimensional Ge hole gases. We find that even if the actual disorder strength in the Ge-based hybrid device exceeds this theoretical lower bound by an order of magnitude, the system is still in the weak disorder regime, where the topological superconductivity is intact and the local conductance spectra manifest clear end-to-end correlated zero-bias peaks if and only if the system hosts topological end MZMs. This shows that, despite the relatively small pristine topological gaps ($\sim\,$a few tens of $\mu$eV), Ge-based hybrid devices are a promising alternative platform for Majorana experiments due to the extremely high materials quality, which leads to an increased gap-to-disorder ratio and, therefore, to less ambiguity in the experimental tunneling conductance data compared to InAs-based devices.</description>

      <title>Electric, thermal, and thermoelectric magnetoconductivity for Weyl/multi-Weyl semimetals in planar Hall set-ups induced by the combined effects of topology and strain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14844v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We continue our investigation of the response tensors in planar Hall (or planar thermal Hall) configurations where a three-dimensional Weyl/multi-Weyl semimetal is subjected to the combined influence of an electric field $\mathbf E $ (and/or temperature gradient $\nabla_{\mathbf r } T$) and an effective magnetic field $\mathbf B_\chi $, generalizing the considerations of Phys. Rev. B 108 (2023) 155132 and Physica E 159 (2024) 115914. The electromagnetic fields are oriented at a generic angle with respect to each other, thus leading to the possibility of having collinear components, which do not arise in a Hall set-up. The net effective magnetic field $\mathbf B_\chi $ consists of two parts -- (a) an actual/physical magnetic field $\mathbf B $ applied externally; and (b) an emergent magnetic field $\mathbf B_5 $ which quantifies the elastic deformations of the sample. $\mathbf B_5 $ is an axial pseudomagnetic field because it couples to conjugate nodal points with opposite chiralities with opposite signs. Using a semiclassical Boltzmann formalism, we derive the generic expressions for the response tensors, including the effects of the Berry curvature (BC) and the orbital magnetic moment (OMM), which arise due to a nontrivial topology of the bandstructures. We elucidate the interplay of the BC-only and the OMM-dependent parts in the longitudinal and transverse (or Hall) components of the electric, thermal, and thermoelectric response tensors. Especially, for the co-planar transverse components of the response tensors, the OMM part acts exclusively in opposition (sync) with the BC-only part for the Weyl (multi-Weyl) semimetals.</description>

      <title>Persistent currents in mesoscopic spin-orbit coupled rings due to an applied Zeeman field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Persistent currents (PCs) in mesoscopic rings have been a subject of intense investigation since their proposal by B\"uttiker, Landauer, and Imry in 1983. In this paper, we explore the behavior of PC in spin-orbit coupled rings under the influence of a Zeeman field (without a need for a flux threading the ring), contrasting it with traditional PC observed in rings threaded by magnetic flux. Our study reveals that the emergence of PC in our setup crucially depends on nonzero values of spin-orbit coupling and the Zeeman field. Through theoretical analysis and numerical calculations, we uncover several intriguing phenomena. Specifically, in ballistic rings, we observe an inverse proportionality between PC and system size, with PC being zero at half filling for even numbers of sites. Additionally, the introduction of on-site disorder leads to the suppression of PC, with exponential decay observed for large disorder strengths and quadratic decay for smaller disorder strengths. Notably, disorder can enhance PC in individual samples, albeit with a configuration-averaged PC of zero. Furthermore, we find that the standard deviation of PC increases with disorder strength, reaching a maximum before decreasing to zero at high disorder strengths. We study the case of PC when the Zeeman field and the spin-orbit field are noncollinear. We also study persistent spin current which shows behavior similar to that of PC except that at half filling, it is not zero. Our findings shed light on the intricate interplay between spin-orbit coupling, Zeeman fields, and disorder in mesoscopic quantum systems, offering new avenues for theoretical exploration and experimental verification.</description>

      <title>Interplay between Majorana and Shiba states in a minimal Kitaev chain coupled to a superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two semiconducting quantum dots (QDs) coupled through a superconductor constitute a minimal realisation of a Kitaev chain with Majorana zero modes (MZMs). Such MZMs can be detected by e.g., tunneling conductance between each QD and normal leads [Dvir et al, Nature 614, 445 (2023)]. We here discuss how the seemingly trivial substitution of one of the normal leads by a superconducting (SC) one gives rise to a plethora of new effects. In particular, the coupling to the SC lead induces non-local Majorana effects upon variations of the QDs' energies. Furthermore, the lowest excitation of the chain is no longer determined by the bulk gap but rather by the energy of an emergent subgap Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) state coexisting with the MZMs. The YSR state hybridizes with the MZMs when the coupling between the SC and the QD is larger than the spin splitting, spoiling the Majorana properties, including the quantized conductance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Three-dimensional doped Dirac insulators foster simply connected (in both topological and trivial regimes) and annular (deep inside the topological regime) Fermi surfaces (FSs) in the normal state, and allow on-site repulsions among fermions with opposite spin ($U_1$) and parity ($U_2$) eigenvalues. From an unbiased leading-order (one-loop) renormalization group analysis, controlled by a suitable $\epsilon$ expansion, we show that this system develops a strong propensity toward the nucleation of scalar $s$-wave and odd-parity pseudoscalar $p$-wave pairings, favored by repulsive $U_1$ and $U_2$ interactions, respectively, irrespective of the underlying FS topology. Our results can be pertinent for the observed superconductivity in various doped narrow gap semiconductors, and the theoretical foundation can readily be applied to investigate similar phenomenon in various doped topological materials.</description>

      <title>Microscopic origin of twist-dependent electron transfer rate in bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00783v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using molecular simulation and continuum dielectric theory, we consider how electrochemical kinetics are modulated by twist angle in bilayer graphene electrodes. By establishing a connection between twist angle and the screening length of charge carriers within the electrode, we investigate how tunable metallicity modifies the statistics of the electron transfer energy gap. Constant potential molecular simulations show that the activation free energy for electron transfer increases with screening length, leading to a non-monotonic dependence on the twist angle. The twist angle alters the density of states, tuning the number of thermally-accessible channels for electron transfer and the reorganization energy by affecting the stability of the vertically excited state through attenuated image charge interactions. Understanding these effects allows us to express the Marcus rate of interfacial electron transfer as a function of twist angle, consistent with a growing body of experimental observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interactions between particles normally induce the decay of the particles Bloch oscillations (BOs) in a periodic lattice. In the limit of strong on-site interactions, spin-$1/2$ fermions may form doublon bound states and undergo BOs in the presence of a tilted potential. Here we investigate the impact of nearest-neighbor interaction $V$ on the multi-doublon BOs in a mass-imbalanced extended Fermi-Hubbard model. We derive an effective Hamiltonian for doublons, and show that a slight change in $V$ can qualitatively alter their dynamic behaviors. Notably, at a resonance point, the doublons behave like free hard-core bosons. Under a tilted potential, the system may exhibit different types of multi-doublon BOs at or deviation from the resonance point. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate our conclusions in both one- and two-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Robustness of near-thermal dynamics on digital quantum computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the impact of gate errors on quantum circuits is crucial to determining the potential applications of quantum computers, especially in the absence of large-scale error-corrected hardware. We put forward analytical arguments, corroborated by extensive numerical and experimental evidence, that Trotterized quantum circuits simulating the time-evolution of systems near thermal equilibrium are substantially more robust to both quantum gate errors and Trotter (discretization) errors than is widely assumed. In Quantinuum's trapped-ion computers, the weakly entangling gates that appear in Trotterized circuits can be implemented natively, and their error rate is smaller when they generate less entanglement; from benchmarking, we know that the error for a gate $\exp[-i (Z\otimes Z) \tau]$ decreases roughly linearly with $\tau$, up to a small offset at $\tau = 0$. We provide extensive evidence that this scaling, together with the robustness of near-thermal dynamics to both gate and discretization errors, facilitates substantial improvements in the achievable accuracy of Trotterized dynamics on near-term quantum computers. We make heavy use of a new theoretical tool -- a statistical ensemble of random product states that approximates a thermal state, which can be efficiently prepared with low noise on quantum computers. We outline how the random product state ensemble can be used to predict, optimize, and design Hamiltonian simulation experiments on near-thermal quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Rashba semiconductors and inversion-asymmetric topological insulators in monolayer Janus MAA'ZxZ'(4-x) family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Rashba effect in Janus structures, accompanied by nontrivial topology, plays an important role in spintronics and even photovoltaic applications, which are receiving increasing attention. However, less effort has been devoted to searching for the Rashba effect in conjunction with nontrivial topology, from the perspective of material design and in establishing universal rules. Herein, through first-principles calculations, we systematically investigate the geometric stability and electronic structures of the Janus MAA'ZxZ'(4-x) family derived from two-dimensional MA2Z4 (M=Mg, Ga, Sr; A=Al, Ga; Z=S, Se, Te) monolayers, designed numerous Rashba semiconductors and inversion-asymmetric topological insulators with Rashba splitting. As the total atomic number rises, the bandgaps of Janus MAA'ZxZ'(4-x) decrease continuously from 2.14 eV for MgAl2S3Se. The decrease persists until the bandgap, combined with strong spin-orbit coupling, becomes small enough to lead to the band inversion with nontrivial topology. In specific Janus systems, pz orbitals near the Fermi level, in conjunction with band inversion, could create a hybrid spin texture with double Rashba splitting. Importantly, the Rashba effect, nontrivial topological states and unique spin textures in the MAA'ZxZ'(4-x) systems can be significantly tuned through small biaxial strain. Our work not only develops the abundant Janus MAA'ZxZ'(4-x) family with multifunctional application prospects, but also reveals the designing rules of Rashba semiconductors and inversion-asymmetric nontrivial topological insulators.</description>
