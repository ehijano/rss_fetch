      <title>Geometric properties and flux of locally conformally symplectic diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the geometric and topological properties of the group of locally conformally symplectic (LCS) diffeomorphisms, utilizing the LCS flux homomorphism defined by S. Haller. By analyzing the flux map from the universal cover of the identity component $(\ker \Phi)_0$ to the first Lichnerowicz cohomology group $H_\omega^1(M)$, we establish a short exact sequence characterizing the Hamiltonian subgroup $\Ham_\Omega(M)$ and provide conditions for its topological splitting as a semidirect product. We develop LCS analogues of fundamental symplectic results, including a Weinstein neighborhood theorem, a flux rigidity theorem for homotopies, and a characterization of LCS structures on mapping tori. A central theme of this work is the influence of the Hodge decomposition of the Lee form $\omega = dh + l$. In the exact case ($l=0$), we utilize the global conformal equivalence to symplectic structures to establish energy-capacity inequalities, an LCS Hofer metric, and non-displaceability results. We explicitly analyze the relationship between the LCS Calabi invariant and its symplectic counterpart, showing they are controlled by a multiplicative factor depending on the conformal weight. For the general non-exact case ($l \neq 0$), we introduce a Twisted Calabi invariant that captures the interaction between Hamiltonian dynamics and the harmonic component of the Lee form.</description>

      <title>Gauged Courant sigma models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new class of sigma models based on Courant sigma models. We refer to these models as gauged Courant sigma models (GCSMs). By introducing additional gauge symmetries, such as those associated with a Lie group, a Lie groupoid (or Lie algebroid), and a Courant algebroid on the target space, Courant sigma models are extended to gauged sigma models of AKSZ type. The consistency of the theory is ensured by identities among geometric quantities on Lie algebroids and Courant algebroids, such as curvatures and torsions, which can be interpreted as flatness conditions on the target space. We also analyze geometric structures of GCSMs in the presence of fluxes and boundaries.</description>

      <title>Some incarnations of Hamiltonian reduction in symplectic geometry and geometric representation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this expository note, we give a self-contained introduction to some modern incarnations of Hamiltonian reduction. Particular emphasis is placed on applications to symplectic geometry and geometric representation theory. We thereby discuss abelianization in Hamiltonian geometry, reduction by symplectic groupoids, and the Moore--Tachikawa conjecture.</description>

      <title>Lecture notes on the symplectic geometry of graded manifolds and higher Lie groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study symplectic structures on graded manifolds and their global counterparts, higher Lie groupoids. We begin by introducing the concept of graded manifold, starting with the degree 1 case, and translating key geometric structures into classical differential geometry terms. We then extend our discussion to the degree 2 case, presenting several illustrative examples with a particular emphasis on equivariant cohomology and Lie bialgebroids. Next, we define symplectic Q-manifolds and their Lagrangian Q-submanifolds, introducing a graded analogue of Weinstein's tubular neighborhood theorem and applying it to the study of deformations of these submanifolds.
  Shifting focus, we turn to higher Lie groupoids and the shifted symplectic structures introduced by Getzler. We examine their Morita invariance and provide several examples drawn from the literature. Finally, we introduce shifted Lagrangian structures and explore their connections to moment maps and symplectic reduction procedures.
  Throughout these notes, we illustrate the key constructions and results with concrete examples, highlighting their applications in mathematics and physics. These lecture notes are based on two mini-courses delivered by the first author at Geometry in Algebra and Algebra in Geometry VII (2023) in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, and at the INdAM Intensive Period: Poisson Geometry and Mathematical Physics (2024) in Napoli, Italy.</description>

      <title>A Morse-Bott unification of the Grassmannians of a symplectic vector space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a quadratic Morse-Bott function on the real Grassmannian of a symplectic vector space from a compatible linear complex structure. We show that its critical loci consist of linear subspaces that split into isotropic and complex parts and that its stable manifolds coincide with the orbits of the linear symplectomorphism group. These orbits generalize the Lagrangian, symplectic, isotropic, and coisotropic Grassmannians to include the Grassmannians of linear subspaces that are neither isotropic, coisotropic, nor symplectic. The negative gradient flow deformation retracts these spaces onto compact homogeneous spaces for the unitary group.</description>

      <title>Quantum cohomology of projective bundles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03696v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct an I-function of the projective bundle P(V) associated with a not necessarily split vector bundle V\to B as a Fourier transform of the S^1-equivariant J-function of the total space of V and show that it lies on the Givental Lagrangian cone of P(V). Using this result, we show that the quantum cohomology D-module of P(V) splits into the direct sum of the quantum cohomology D-modules of the base space B. This has applications to the semisimplicity of big quantum cohomology.</description>

      <title>Minimal Factorization of Chern-Simons Theory -- Gravitational Anyonic Edge Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00501v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One approach to analyzing entanglement in a gauge theory is embedding it into a factorized theory with edge modes on the entangling boundary. For topological quantum field theories (TQFT), this naturally leads to factorizing a TQFT by adding local edge modes associated with the corresponding CFT. In this work, we instead construct a minimal set of edge modes compatible with the topological invariance of Chern-Simons theory. This leads us to propose a minimal factorization map. These minimal edge modes can be interpreted as the degrees of freedom of a particle on a quantum group. Of particular interest is three-dimensional gravity as a Chern-Simons theory with gauge group SL$(2,\mathbb{R}) \times$ SL$(2,\mathbb{R})$. Our minimal factorization proposal uniquely gives rise to quantum group edge modes factorizing the bulk state space of 3d gravity. This agrees with earlier proposals that relate the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy in 3d gravity to topological entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>$\text{F-manifolds}$, F$_\text{man}$-algebras and $\text{Poisson-algebra}$ Distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the geometric and algebraic interplay between F-manifolds and a newly defined class of structures termed F$_\text{man}$-algebras. We specialize our study to the category of F-Lie groups, characterized by a Lie group whose associated commutative and associative product of vector fields is left-invariant. We construct a canonical connection on Lie groups uniquely determined by the F$_\text{man}$-algebraic data, and subsequently characterize its curvature tensor and holonomy Lie algebra. A central feature of our investigation is the introduction of the Poisson-algebra distribution, arising from a canonical Poisson subalgebra within the F$_\text{man}$-algebra. We establish the integrability of this distribution, which induces a foliation of the F-Lie group and facilitates a local splitting theorem. The theoretical framework is illustrated through an in-depth analysis of the Heisenberg Lie algebra.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations of highly inclined near halo orbits using Moser regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the bifurcation structure of highly inclined near halo orbits with close approaches to the light primary, in the circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP). Using a Hamiltonian formulation together with Moser regularization, we develop a numerical framework for the continuation of periodic orbits and the computation of their Floquet multipliers which remains effective near collision. We describe vertical collision orbits and families emerging from its pitchfork, period-doubling, and period-tripling bifurcations in the limiting Hill's problem, including the halo and butterfly families. We continue these into the CR3BP using a perturbative framework via a symplectic scaling, and construct bifurcation graphs for representative systems (Saturn-Enceladus, Earth-Moon, Copenhagen) to identify common dynamical features. Conley-Zehnder indices are computed to classify the resulting families. Together, these results provide a coherent global picture of polar orbit architecture near the light primary, offering groundwork for future mission design, such as Enceladus plume sampling missions.</description>

      <title>Cone structures from a dynamical and probabilistic viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of this note is to explore, from a geometric and probabilistic point of view, the dynamics of cone structures adapted to open book decompositions. This is inspired by the picture which arises in the study of the circular restricted three body problem (CR3BP). This yields geometric obstructions to reaching a point from another point in the phase space of the CR3BP.</description>
