      <title>Atmospheric Centers of Action: current features and expected changes from simulations with CMIP5 and CMIP6 models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The results of an analysis of changes in the characteristics of atmospheric centers of action (ACAs) in the Northern (NH) and Southern (SH) hemispheres using results of simulations with the CMIP5 and CMIP6 ensembles of climate models are presented. The ability of models to simulate ACA features is estimated for the historical scenario in comparison with ERA5 reanalysis data. The projected changes are evaluated under RCP8.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios for CMIP5 and CMIP6 models, respectively. The ACA intensity is evaluated that defined as the difference in sea level pressure averaged over the ACA region and the entire hemisphere. In NH, reanalysis and models show greater intensity of subtropical oceanic anticyclonic ACAs in summer than in winter. The opposite is found for the intensity of NH subpolar oceanic cyclonic ACAs. The interannual variability of the ACA intensity in winter is generally greater than in summer. In SH, the season with greater intensity of oceanic anticyclonic and cyclonic ACAs and its interannual variability varies from ocean to ocean. CMIP5 and CMIP6 models show substantial changes of ACAs characteristics in the XXI century. More significant trends in the strengthening of ACAs in the 21st century appear in the SH, especially in the winter seasons. The most consistent weakening trends are found over continents for winter North American maximum and the summer Asian minimum. For the winter Siberian maximum, the weakening trend is found more pronounced in CMIP6 models than in CMIP5.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the Tropical Pacific Upper Ocean using Online Data Assimilation with a Deep Learning model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A deep learning (DL) model, based on a transformer architecture, is trained on a climate-model dataset and compared with a standard linear inverse model (LIM) in the tropical Pacific. We show that the DL model produces more accurate forecasts compared to the LIM when tested on a reanalysis dataset. We then assess the ability of an ensemble Kalman filter to reconstruct the monthly-averaged upper ocean from a noisy set of 24 sea-surface temperature observations designed to mimic existing coral proxy measurements, and compare results for the DL model and LIM. Due to signal damping in the DL model, we implement a novel inflation technique by adding noise from hindcast experiments. Results show that assimilating observations with the DL model yields better reconstructions than the LIM for observation averaging times ranging from one month to one year. The improved reconstruction is due to the enhanced predictive capabilities of the DL model, which map the memory of past observations to future assimilation times.</description>

      <title>Characterizing GPROF Regional Bias Using Radar-Derived Hydrometeor Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current satellite precipitation retrievals like GPROF assume that brightness temperature is sufficient to constrain rainfall. This information, however, often represents multiple rain states, resulting in rainfall estimate uncertainties. These uncertainties, while dominated by random variability, can also exhibit substantial regional biases, complicating the use of traditional ground validation techniques which seek to understand these uncertainties. This study aims to characterize the physical contributors to these biases for use in uncertainty quantification. To do this, coincident GPROF Version 7, GMI, and GPM Combined observations were examined over three tropical land regions, the Amazon, Congo, and Southeast Asia, which are known to exhibit distinct biases relative to one another when comparing GPROF with GPM Combined. Rain intensity and ice-rain ratio were identified as the primary sources of GPROF regional biases. By incorporating the information from these sources, the self-similarity between these three regions was brought from within 13 percent to within 7 percent, reducing the interregional bias by half. Including a third constraint based on the polarization-corrected 37-GHz brightness temperature further improved this self-similarity to within 4 percent by accounting for second-order hydrometeor profile differences which were underutilized by GPROF. Comparing the effects of these three constraints between GPROF Version 7 with the 1D version of GPROF-NN showed similar improvements, indicating the utility of this uncertainty quantification and adjustment method across precipitation products. With these constraints, regional GPROF biases can be made more consistent, improving the fidelity of the precipitation climate data records and operational precipitation products which utilize this information.</description>

      <title>Net Zero Averted Temperature Increase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using feedback-free estimates of the warming by increased atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and observed rates of increase, we estimate that if the United States (U.S.) eliminated net CO2 emissions by the year 2050, this would avert a warming of 0.0084 C (0.015 F), which is below our ability to accurately measure. If the entire world forced net zero CO2 emissions by the year 2050, a warming of only 0.070 C (0.13 F) would be averted. If one assumes that the warming is a factor of 4 larger because of positive feedbacks, as asserted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the warming averted by a net zero U.S. policy would still be very small, 0.034 C (0.061 F). For worldwide net zero emissions by 2050 and the 4-times larger IPCC climate sensitivity, the averted warming would be 0.28 C (0.50 F).</description>

      <title>How to derive skill from the Fractions Skill Score</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Fractions Skill Score (FSS) is a widely used metric for assessing forecast skill, with applications ranging from precipitation to volcanic ash forecasts. By evaluating the fraction of grid squares exceeding a threshold in a neighbourhood, the intuition is that it can avoid the pitfalls of pixel-wise comparisons and identify length scales at which a forecast has skill. The FSS is typically interpreted relative to a `useful' criterion, which provides a measure of whether a forecast is considered skilful enough. However, this useful criterion is problematic, as there can be considerable skill for forecasts that do not meet it, and it is not derived in a way that provides obvious meaning. We therefore provide a new derivation of a useful criterion, as the score that a random forecast achieves, which provides a more robust and meaningful way to assess the FSS. Through illustrative examples we show that this new criterion considerably changes the length scales at which a forecast would be regarded as skilful, and reveals subtleties in how the FSS should be interpreted.</description>
