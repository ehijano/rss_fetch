      <title>A theorem in relation to quantum Ising models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physics of the paradigmatic one-dimensional transverse field quantum Ising model $H= J \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} \sigma^x_i \sigma^x_j + h \sum_i \sigma^z_i$ is well-known. Instead, let us imagine "applying" the transverse field via a transverse Ising coupling of the spins to partner auxiliary spins, i.e. $H= J_x \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} \sigma^x_i \sigma^x_j + J_z \sum_i \sigma^z_i \sigma^z_{\text{partner of }i}$. If each spin of the chain has a unique auxiliary partner, then the theorem states that the resultant eigenspectrum is still the same as that of the quantum Ising model with $h = J_z$ and the degeneracy of the entire spectrum is $2^{\text{number of auxiliary spins}}$. This follows from the existence of extensively large and mutually anticommuting sets of conserved quantities for $H$. We can interpret this as the auxiliary spins remaining paramagnetic down to zero temperature with an extensive ground state degeneracy. This is lost upon the loss of the unique partner condition for the full spin chain. Other cases where such extensive degeneracy survives are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Full Statistics of Regularized Local Energy Density in a Freely Expanding Kipnis-Marchioro-Presutti Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine the Macroscopic Fluctuation Theory and the Inverse Scattering Method to determine the full long-time statistics of the energy density $u(x,t)$ averaged over a given spatial interval, $$ U =\frac{1}{2L}\int_{-L}^{L}dx\, u(x,t)\,, $$ in a freely expanding Kipnis-Marchioro-Presutti (KMP) lattice gas on the line, following the release at $t=0$ of a finite amount of energy at the origin. In particular, we show that, as time $t$ goes to infinity at fixed $L$, the large deviation function of $U$ approaches a universal form when expressed in terms of the energy content of the interval $|x|&lt;L$ at time $t$. A key part of the solution is the determination of the most likely configuration of the energy density at time $t$, conditional on $U$.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Brownian motion with dependent components: turning angle analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06374v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brownian motion in one or more dimensions is extensively used as a stochastic process to model natural and engineering signals, as well as financial data. Most works dealing with multidimensional Brownian motion assume that each component is independent. In this article, we investigate a model of correlated Brownian motion in $\mathbb{R}^2$, where the individual components are not necessarily independent. We explore various statistical properties of the process under consideration, going beyond the conventional analysis of the second moment. Our particular focus lies on investigating the distribution of turning angles. This distribution reveals particularly interesting characteristics for processes with dependent components that are relevant to applications in diverse physical systems. Theoretical considerations are supported by numerical simulations and analysis of two real-world datasets: the financial data of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Standard and Poor's 500, and trajectories of polystyrene beads in water. Finally, we show that the model can be readily extended to trajectories with correlations that change over time.</description>

      <title>Entanglement asymmetry in the critical XXZ spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the explicit breaking of a $SU(2)$ symmetry to a $U(1)$ subgroup employing the entanglement asymmetry, a recently introduced observable that measures how much symmetries are broken in a part of extended quantum systems. We consider as specific model the critical XXZ spin chain, which breaks the $SU(2)$ symmetry of spin rotations except at the isotropic point, and is described by the massless compact boson in the continuum limit. We examine the $U(1)$ subgroup of $SU(2)$ that is broken outside the isotropic point by applying conformal perturbation theory, which we complement with numerical simulations on the lattice. We also analyse the entanglement asymmetry of the full $SU(2)$ group. By relying on very generic scaling arguments, we derive an asymptotic expression for it.</description>

      <title>Inertial effects in discrete sampling information engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe an experiment on an underdamped mechanical oscillator used as an information engine. The system is equivalent to an inertial Brownian particle confined in a harmonic potential whose center is controlled by a feedback protocol which measures the particle position at a specific sampling frequency $1/{\tau}$. Several feedback protocols are applied and the power generated by the engine is measured as a function of the oscillator parameters and the sampling frequency. The optimal parameters are then determined. The results are compared to the theoretical predictions and numerical simulations on overdamped systems. We highlight the specific effects of inertia, which can be used to increase the amount of power extracted by the engine. In the regime of large $\tau$, we show that the produced work has a tight bound determined by information theories.</description>

      <title>Simulations of Mpemba Effect in WATER, Lennard-Jones and Ising Models: Metastability vs Critical Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Via molecular dynamics simulations we study ICE formation in the TIP4P/Ice model that is known to describe structure and dynamics in various phases of WATER accurately. For this purpose well equilibrated configurations from different initial temperatures, Ts, belonging to the fluid phase, are quenched to a fixed subzero temperature. Our results on kinetics, for a wide range of Ts, following such quenches, show quicker crystallization of samples that are hotter at the beginning. This implies the presence of the puzzling Mpemba effect (ME). Via a similar study, we also identify ME in fluid to solid transitions in a Lennard-Jones (LJ) model. In the latter case, the ME appears purely as an outcome of the influence of critical fluctuations on the nonequilibrium growth process, for which we present interesting scaling results. For the TIP4P/Ice case, on the other hand, we show that delay in nucleation, due to metastability, can alone be a driving factor for the exhibition of ME. To substantiate the difference between the two cases, we also present LJ-like scaling results for ME in a magnetic transition. Our simulations indicate that in each of the systems the effect can be observed independent of the cooling rate that may vary when samples from different Ts are brought in contact with a heat reservoir working at a fixed lower temperature.</description>

      <title>Approach to stationarity for the KPZ fixed point with boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current fluctuations for the one-dimensional totally asymmetric exclusion process (TASEP) connected to reservoirs of particles, and their large scale limit to the KPZ fixed point in finite volume, are studied using exact methods. Focusing on the maximal current phase for TASEP, corresponding to infinite boundary slopes for the KPZ height field, we obtain for general initial condition an exact expression for the late time correction to stationarity, involving extreme value statistics of Brownian paths. In the special cases of stationary and narrow wedge initial conditions, a combination of Bethe ansatz and numerical conjectures alternatively provide fully explicit exact expressions.</description>

      <title>Acoustic waves in a halfspace material filled with random particulate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particulate materials include powders, emulsions, composites, and many others. This is why measuring these has become important for both industry and scientific applications. For industrial applications, the greatest need is to measure dense particulates, in-situ, and non-destructively. In theory, this could be achieved with acoustics: the standard method is to send an acoustic wave through the particulate and then attempt to measure the effective wave speed and attenuation. A major obstacle here is that it is not clear how to relate the effective wave speed and attenuation to the reflection and transmission coefficients, which are far easier to measure. This is because it has been very difficult to mathematically account for different background mediums. In this paper we resolve this obstacle. We present how to account for different background mediums for a simple case, to help comprehension: a halfspace filled with a random particulate, where the background of the halfspace is different to the exterior medium. The key to solving this problem was to derive a systematic extension of a widely used closure approximation: the quasi-crystalline approximation (QCA). We present some numerical results to demonstrate that the reflection coefficient can be easily calculated for a broad range of frequencies and particle properties.</description>

      <title>Quantum dynamics of frustrated Josephson junction arrays embedded in a transmission line: an effective XX spin chain with long-range interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study theoretically a variety of collective quantum phases occurring in frustrated saw-tooth chains of Josephson junctions embedded in a dissipationless transmission line. The basic element of a system, i.e., the triangular superconducting cell, contains two $0$- and one $\pi$- Josephson junctions characterized by $E_J$ and $\alpha E_J$ Josephson energies, accordingly. In the frustrated regime the low energy quantum dynamics of a single cell is determined by anticlockwise or clockwise flowing persistent currents (vortex/antivortex). The direct embedding of $\pi$-Josephson junctions in a transmission line allows to establish a short/long-range interaction between (anti)vortices of well separated cells. By making use of the variational approach, we map the superconducting circuit Hamiltonian to an effective $XX$ spin model with an exchange spin-spin interaction decaying with the distance $x$ as $x^{-\beta}$, and the local $\hat \sigma_{x,n}$-terms corresponding to the coherent quantum beats between vortex and antivortex in a single cell. We obtain that in long arrays as $N \gg \ell_0 \simeq \sqrt{C/C_0}$, where $C$ and $C_0$ are capacitances of $0$-Josephson junction and transmission line, accordingly, the amplitude of quantum beats is strongly suppressed. By means of exact numerical diagonalization, we study the interplay between the coherent quantum beats and the exchange spin-spin interaction leading to the appearance of various collective quantum phases such as the paramagnetic ($P$), compressible superfluid ($CS$) and weakly compressible superfluid ($w$-$CS$) states.</description>

      <title>Superluminal Propagation of Composite Collective Modes in Superconductor-Ferromagnet Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductor/ferromagnet/superconductor Josephson junctions are paradigmatic systems for studying the delicate interplay of superconductivity and magnetism via proximity effects as well as their composite excitations. Here, we analyse the collective modes (CM) in such a heterostructure by taking into account the interplay between the de-magnetisation field $H_{dem}$ and the field caused by the anisotropy of the ferromagnet $H_{an}$, which was previously neglected. It turns out that the spectrum of composite collective modes, $\omega(k)$, has a qualitatively different form in the case of $H_{dem}&lt;H_{an}$ and of $H_{dem}&gt;H_{an}$. In the first case, the dependence $\omega(k)$ has the same form as in previous studies, whereas in the second case, the spectrum looks completely different. In particular, for moderate or weak anisotropy in ferromagnet the group velocity of collective modes demonstrates inflection point where the group velocity become infinite and is superluminal. Furthermore, this point separates purely real and complex-conjugate solutions for the collective modes and is also {\it exception point}. We show that the difference of the CMs spectra can be revealed by Fiske experiment, i.\,e.\,by measuring the $I-V$ characteristics in the presence of magnetic field and voltage.</description>

      <title>Thermal False Vacuum Decay Is Not What It Seems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the decay of a thermally excited metastable vacuum in classical field theory using real-time numerical simulations. We find a lower decay rate than predicted by standard thermal theory. The discrepancy is due to the violation of thermal equilibrium during the critical bubble nucleation. It is reduced by introducing dissipation and noise. We propose a criterion for the system to remain in equilibrium during the nucleation process and show that it is violated in the Hamiltonian evolution of a single field. In the case of many fields, the fulfillment of the criterion is model-dependent.</description>

      <title>Discrete JT gravity as an Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the program of discrete holography, we show that Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity on a hyperbolic tiling of Euclidean AdS$_2$ gives rise to an Ising model on the dual lattice, subject to a topological constraint. The Ising model involves an asymptotic boundary condition with spins pointing opposite to the magnetic field. The topological constraint enforces a single domain wall between the spins of opposite direction, with the topology of a circle. The resolvent of JT gravity is related to the free energy of this Ising model, and the classical limit of JT gravity corresponds to the Ising low-temperature limit. We study this Ising model through a Monte Carlo approach and a mean-field approximation. For finite truncations of the infinite hyperbolic lattice, the map between both theories is only valid in a regime in which the domain wall has a finite size. For the extremal cases of large positive or negative coupling, the domain wall either shrinks to zero or touches the boundary of the lattice. This behavior is confirmed by the mean-field analysis. We expect that our results may be used as a starting point for establishing a holographic matrix model duality for discretized gravity.</description>

      <title>The Mechanics of Nucleation and Growth and the Surface Tensions of Active Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Homogeneous nucleation, a textbook transition path for phase transitions, is typically understood on thermodynamic grounds through the prism of classical nucleation theory. However, recent studies have suggested the applicability of classical nucleation theory to systems far from equilibrium. In this Article, we formulate a purely mechanical perspective of homogeneous nucleation and growth, elucidating the criteria for the properties of a critical nucleus without appealing to equilibrium notions. Applying this theory to active fluids undergoing motility-induced phase separation, we find that nucleation proceeds in a qualitatively similar fashion to equilibrium systems, with concepts such as the Gibbs-Thomson effect and nucleation barriers remaining valid. We further demonstrate that the recovery of such concepts allows us to extend classical theories of nucleation rates and coarsening dynamics to active systems upon using the mechanically-derived definitions of the nucleation barrier and surface tensions.Three distinct surface tensions -- the mechanical, capillary, and Ostwald tensions -- play a central role in our theory. While these three surface tensions are identical in equilibrium, our work highlights the distinctive role of each tension in the stability of active interfaces and the nucleation and growth of motility-induced phases.</description>

      <title>Disordered Lattice Glass $\phi^{4}$ Quantum Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study numerically the three-dimensional $\phi^{4}$ spin glass, a prototypical disordered and discretized Euclidean field theory that manifests inhomogeneities in space and time but considers a homogeneous squared mass and lambda terms. The $\phi^{4}$ lattice glass field theory is a conceptual generalization of spin glasses to continuous degrees of freedom and we discuss the existence of a limit under which it formally reduces to the Edwards-Anderson model. By defining four variants of an order parameter which are suitable for continuous spin glasses, we verify numerically the emergence of an overlap in absence of the magnetization thus confirming the presence of a spin glass phase transition for a value of a critical squared mass. We conclude by discussing how the $\phi^{4}$ spin glass can be utilized to address assumptions of complete homogeneity in space or time and how, in parallel to statistical physics, provides a suitable framework to investigate the nonperturbative dynamics of machine learning algorithms from the perspective of disordered lattice and constructive field theory.</description>

      <title>Bubble phase induced by odd interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a repulsive thermal system governed by odd interactions. The interplay between oddness and inertia induces a non-equilibrium phase transition from a homogeneous to a non-homogeneous phase, characterized by bubbles induced by odd interactions. This phenomenon occurs in the absence of attractions and is generated by the competition between the standard pressure contribution due to particle repulsion and an effective surface tension generated by odd-induced centrifugal forces. As a signature of the phase transition, the system exhibits vortex structures and oscillating spatial velocity correlations, which emerge close to the analytically predicted transition point. Our findings can be verified in granular experiments governed by odd interactions, such as spinners and colloidal magnets, and could be key to characterizing the emerging properties of metamaterials.</description>

Abstract: We investigate key quantum characteristics of the mixed spin-(1/2,1,1/2) Heisenberg trimer under the influence of an external magnetic field. Specifically, we analyze the distributions of bipartite and tripartite entanglement quantified through the respective negativities, the $l_1$-norm of coherence, and spin squeezing with the help of rigorous analytical and numerical methods. Our findings suggest that the heterotrinuclear molecular nanomagnet $[\{\text{Cu}^\text{II}\text{L}\}_2\text{Ni}^\text{II}(\text{H}_2\text{O})_2](\text{ClO}_4)_23\text{H}_2\text{O}$, which represents an experimental realization of the mixed spin-(1/2,1,1/2) Heisenberg trimer, exhibits a significant bipartite entanglement between $\text{Cu}^\text{II}$ and $\text{Ni}^\text{II}$ magnetic ions along with robust tripartite entanglement among all three constituent magnetic ions. The significant bipartite and tripartite entanglement persists even at relatively high temperatures up to $37\,\text{K}$ and magnetic fields up to $50\,\text{T}$, whereby the coherence is maintained even at elevated temperatures. In addition, we investigate the spin squeezing parameter within thermal states of the spin-(1/2,1,1/2) Heisenberg trimer. Our exact results reveal optimal conditions for achieving the highest degree of the spin squeezing, which are achieved at zero magnetic field around $T \approx 30\,\text{K}$.</description>

      <title>Robustness of travelling states in generic non-reciprocal mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.05618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emergent non-reciprocal interactions violating Newton's third law are widespread in out-of-equilibrium systems. Phase separating mixtures with such interactions exhibit travelling states with no equilibrium counterpart. Using extensive Brownian dynamics simulations, we investigate the existence and stability of such travelling states in a generic non-reciprocal particle system. By varying a broad range of parameters including aggregate state of mixture components, diffusivity, degree of non-reciprocity, effective spatial dimension and density, we determine that travelling states do exist below the predator-prey regime, but nonetheless are only found in a narrow region of the parameter space. Our work also sheds light on the physical mechanisms for the disappearance of travelling states when relevant parameters are being varied, and has implications for a range of non-equilibrium systems including non-reciprocal phase separating mixtures, non-equilibrium pattern formation and predator-prey models.</description>

      <title>Independent-oscillator model and the quantum Langevin equation for an oscillator: A review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This review provides a brief and quick introduction to the quantum Langevin equation for an oscillator, while focusing on the steady-state thermodynamic aspects. A derivation of the quantum Langevin equation is carefully outlined based on the microscopic model of the heat bath as a collection of a large number of independent quantum oscillators, the so-called independent-oscillator model. This is followed by a discussion on the relevant `weak-coupling' limit. In the steady state, we analyze the quantum counterpart of energy equipartition theorem which has generated a considerable amount of interest in recent literature. The free energy, entropy, specific heat, and third law of thermodynamics are discussed for one-dimensional quantum Brownian motion in a harmonic well. Following this, we explore some aspects of dissipative diamagnetism in the context of quantum Brownian oscillators, emphasizing upon the role of confining potentials and also upon the environment-induced classical-quantum crossover. We discuss situations where the system-bath coupling is via the momentum variables by focusing on a gauge-invariant model of momentum-momentum coupling in the presence of a vector potential; for this problem, we derive the quantum Langevin equation and discuss quantum thermodynamic functions. Finally, the topic of fluctuation theorems is discussed (albeit, briefly) in the context of classical and quantum cyclotron motion of a particle coupled to a heat bath.</description>

      <title>Harmonic chain far from equilibrium: single-file diffusion, long-range order, and hyperuniformity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03155v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In one dimension, particles can not bypass each other. As a consequence, the mean-squared displacement (MSD) in equilibrium shows sub-diffusion ${\rm MSD}(t)\sim t^{1/2}$, instead of normal diffusion ${\rm MSD}(t)\sim t$. This phenomenon is the so-called single-file diffusion. Here, we investigate how the above equilibrium behaviors are modified far from equilibrium. In particular, we want to uncover what kind of non-equilibrium driving force can suppress diffusion and achieve the long-range crystalline order in one dimension, which is prohibited by the Mermin-Wagner theorem in equilibrium. For that purpose, we investigate the harmonic chain driven by the following four types of driving forces that do not satisfy the detailed balance: (i) temporally correlated noise with the noise spectrum $D(\omega)\sim \omega^{-2\theta}$, (ii) conserving noise, (iii) periodic driving force, and (iv) periodic deformations of particles. For the driving force (i) with $\theta&gt;-1/4$, we observe ${\rm MSD}(t)\sim t^{1/2+2\theta}$ for large $t$. On the other hand, for the driving forces (i) with $\theta&lt;-1/4$ and (ii)-(iv), MSD remains finite. As a consequence, the harmonic chain exhibits the crystalline order even in one dimension. Furthermore, the density fluctuations of the model are highly suppressed in a large scale in the crystal phase. This phenomenon is known as hyperuniformity. We discuss that hyperuniformity of the noise fluctuations themselves is the relevant mechanism to stabilize the long-range crystalline order in one dimension and yield hyperuniformity of the density fluctuations.</description>

      <title>A Minimal Model for Carnot Efficiency at Maximum Power</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Carnot efficiency sets a fundamental upper bound on the heat engine efficiency, attainable in the quasi-static limit, albeit at the cost of completely sacrificing power output. In this Letter, we present a minimal heat engine model that can attain Carnot efficiency while achieving maximum power output. We unveil the potential of intrinsic divergent physical quantities within the working substance, such as degeneracy, as promising thermodynamic resources to break through the universal power-efficiency trade-off imposed by nonequilibrium thermodynamics for conventional heat engines. Our findings provide novel insights into the collective advantage in harnessing energy of many-body interacting systems.</description>

      <title>Q-factor: A measure of competition between the topper and the average in percolation and in SOC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01553v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define the $Q$-factor in the percolation problem as the quotient of the size of the
  largest cluster and the average size of all clusters. As the occupation probability $p$
  is increased, the $Q$-factor for the system size $L$ grows systematically to its maximum
  value $Q_{max}(L)$ at a specific value $p_{max}(L)$ and then gradually decays. Our numerical
  study of site percolation problems on the square, triangular and the simple cubic lattices
  exhibits that the asymptotic values of $p_{max}$ though close, are distinctly different
  from the corresponding percolation thresholds of these lattices. We have also shown using
  the scaling analysis that at $p_{max}$ the value of $Q_{max}(L)$ diverges as $L^d$ ($d$
  denoting the dimension of the lattice) as the system size approaches to their asymptotic
  limit. We have further extended this idea to the non-equilibrium systems such as the
  sandpile model of self-organized criticality. Here, the $Q(\rho,L)$-factor is the quotient
  of the size of the largest avalanche and the cumulative average of the sizes of all the
  avalanches; $\rho$ being the drop density of the driving mechanism. This study has been
  prompted by some observations in Sociophysics.</description>

      <title>Geometry of optimal control in chemical reaction networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although optimal control (OC) has been studied in stochastic thermodynamics for systems with continuous state variables, less is known in systems with discrete state variables, such as Chemical Reaction Networks (CRNs). Here, we develop a general theoretical framework to study OC of CRNs for changing the system from an initial distribution of states to a final distribution with minimum dissipation. We derive a ``Kirchhoff's law" for the probability current in the adiabatic limit, from which the optimal kinetic rates are determined analytically for any given probability trajectory. By using the optimal rates, we show that the total dissipation is determined by a $L_2$-distance measure in the probability space and derive an analytical expression for the metric tensor that depends on the probability distribution, network topology, and capacity of each link. Minimizing the total dissipation leads to the geodesic trajectory in the probability space and the corresponding OC protocol is determined by the Kirchhoff's law. To demonstrate our general approach, we use it to find a lower bound for the minimum dissipation that is tighter than existing bounds obtained with only global constraints. We also apply it to simple networks, e.g., fully connected 3-state CRNs with different local constraints and show that indirect pathway and non-functional transient state can play a crucial role in switching between different probability distributions efficiently. Future directions in studying OC in CRNs by using our general framework are discussed.</description>

Abstract: The Hamiltonian of mean force is an effective Hamiltonian that allows a quantum system, non-weakly coupled to an environment, to be written in an effective Gibbs state. We present results on the structure of the Hamiltonian of mean force in extended quantum systems with local interactions. We show that its spatial structure exhibits a ``skin effect'' -- its difference from the system Hamiltonian dies off exponentially with distance from the system-environment boundary. For spin systems, we identify the terms that can appear in the Hamiltonian of mean force at different orders in the inverse temperature.</description>

      <title>Stochastic dynamics of granular hopper flows: a configurational mode controls the stability of clogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Granular flows in small-outlet hoppers exhibit several characteristic but poorly understood behaviors: temporary clogs (pauses) that last for an extended period before flow spontaneously restarts, permanent clogs that last indefinitely, and non-Gaussian, non-monotonic flow-rate statistics. These aspects have been extensively studied independently, but a model of hopper flow that includes all three has not been formulated. Here, we introduce such a phenomenological model that provides a unifying dynamical explanation of all three behaviors: a coupling between the flow rate and a hidden configurational mode that controls the stability of clogs. In the theory, flow rate evolves according to Langevin dynamics with multiplicative noise and an absorbing state at zero flow, conditional on the hidden mode. The model fully reproduces the statistics of pause and clog events taken from a large ($&gt;40,000$ flows) experimental dataset, including non-exponentially distributed clogging times and non-Gaussian flow rate distribution, and explains the stretched-exponential growth of the average clogging time with outlet size. Further, we highlight several microscopic configurational features of this hidden mode, including size and smoothness of the static arch structure formed during pauses and clogs. Our work provides a unifying framework for several poorly understood granular phenomena, and suggests numerous new paths toward further understanding of this complex system.</description>

      <title>Time-reversal symmetry breaking in the chemosensory array reveals mechanisms for dissipation-enhanced cooperative sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Escherichia coli chemoreceptors form an extensive array that achieves cooperative and adaptive sensing of extracellular signals. The receptors control the activity of histidine kinase CheA, which drives a nonequilibrium phosphorylation-dephosphorylation reaction cycle for response regulator CheY. Cooperativity and dissipation are both important aspects of chemotaxis signaling, yet their consequences have only been studied separately. Recent single-cell FRET measurements revealed that kinase activity of the array spontaneously switches between active and inactive states, with asymmetric switching times that signify time-reversal symmetry breaking in the underlying dynamics. Here, we present a nonequilibrium lattice model of the chemosensory array, which demonstrates that the observed asymmetric switching dynamics can only be explained by an interplay between the dissipative reactions within individual core units and the cooperative coupling between neighboring units. Microscopically, the switching time asymmetry originates from irreversible transition paths. The model shows that strong dissipation enables sensitive and rapid signaling response by relieving the speed-sensitivity trade-off, which can be tested by future single-cell experiments. Overall, our model provides a general framework for studying biological complexes composed of coupled subunits that are individually driven by dissipative cycles and the rich nonequilibrium physics within.</description>

      <title>Simulations of Classical Three-Body Thermalization in One Dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One-dimensional systems, such as nanowires or electrons moving along strong magnetic field lines, have peculiar thermalization physics. The binary collision of point-like particles, typically the dominant process for reaching thermal equilibrium in higher dimensional systems, cannot thermalize a 1D system. We study how dilute classical 1D gases thermalize through three-body collisions. We consider a system of identical classical point particles with pairwise repulsive inverse power-law potential $V_{ij} \propto 1/|x_i-x_j|^n$ or the pairwise Lennard-Jones potential. Using Monte Carlo methods, we compute a collision kernel and use it in the Boltzmann equation to evolve a perturbed thermal state with temperature $T$ toward equilibrium. We explain the shape of the kernel and its dependence on the system parameters. Additionally, we implement molecular dynamics simulations of a many-body gas and show agreement with the Boltzmann evolution in the low density limit. For the inverse power-law potential, the rate of thermalization is proportional to $\rho^2 T^{\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{n}}$ where $\rho$ is the number density. The corresponding proportionality constant decreases with increasing $n$.</description>

      <title>Emergence and evolution of electronic modes with temperature in spin-gapped Mott and Kondo insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electronic modes emerge within the band gap at nonzero temperature in strongly correlated insulators such as Mott and Kondo insulators, exhibiting momentum-shifted magnetic dispersion relations from the band edges. As the temperature increases, the emergent modes gain considerable spectral weights and form robust bands that differ from the zero-temperature bands. Here, the origin of the emergent modes, their relation to doping-induced modes, and how their spectral weights increase with temperature are clarified in the ladder and bilayer Hubbard models and one- and two-dimensional Kondo lattice models using effective theory for weak inter-unit-cell hopping and numerical calculations. The results indicate that the temperature-driven change in the band structure reflecting spin excitation, including the change in the number of bands, can be observed in various strongly correlated insulators even with a spin gap, provided that the temperature increases up to about spin-excitation energies. The controlled analyses developed in this study significantly contribute to the fundamental understanding of the band structure of strongly correlated insulators at nonzero temperature.</description>

      <title>Exact Fisher zeros and thermofield dynamics across a quantum critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By setting the inverse temperature $\beta$ loose to occupy the complex plane, Michael E. Fisher showed that the zeros of the complex partition function $Z$, if approaching the real $\beta$ axis, reveal a thermodynamic phase transition. More recently, Fisher zeros have been used to mark the dynamical phase transition in quench dynamics. The success of Fisher zeros however seems limited, and it is unclear how they can be employed to shed light on quantum phase transitions or the non-unitary dynamics of open quantum systems. Here we answer this question by a comprehensive analysis of the (analytically continued) one-dimensional transverse field Ising model. We exhaust all the Fisher zeros to show that in the thermodynamic limit they congregate into a remarkably simple pattern in the form of continuous open or closed lines. These Fisher lines evolve smoothly as the coupling constant is tuned, and a qualitative change identifies the quantum critical point. By exploiting the connection between $Z$ and the thermofield double states, we obtain analytical expressions for the short- and long-time dynamics of the survival amplitude and the scaling of recurrence time at the quantum critical point. We further point out $Z$ can be realized and probed in monitored quantum circuits. The analytical results are corroborated by numerical tensor renormalization group which elevates the approach outlined here to a powerful tool for interacting quantum systems.</description>
