      <title>Inquisitive Team Semantics of LTL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel team semantics of LTL inspired by inquisitive logic. The main features of the resulting logic, we call InqLTL, are the intuitionistic interpretation of implication and the Boolean semantics of disjunction. We show that InqLTL with Boolean negation is highly undecidable and strictly less expressive than TeamLTL with Boolean negation. On the positive side, we identify a meaningful fragment of InqLTL with a decidable model-checking problem which can express relevant classes of hyperproperties. To the best of our knowledge, this fragment represents
  the first hyper logic with a decidable model-checking problem which allows unrestricted use of temporal modalities and
  universal second-order quantification over traces.</description>

      <title>NoPE: The Counting Power of Transformers with No Positional Encodings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Positional Encodings (PEs) seem to be indispensable for ensuring expressiveness of transformers; without them attention transformers reduce to a bag-of-word model. NoPE-transformers (i.e. with No PEs) with unique hard attention mechanisms were very recently shown to only be able to express regular languages, i.e., with limited counting ability. This paper shows that, with average hard attention mechanisms, NoPE-transformers are still surprisingly expressive: they can express counting languages corresponding to nonnegative integer solutions to multivariate polynomial equations (i.e. Diophantine equations), reasoning about which is well-known to be undecidable. In fact, we provide a precise characterization of languages expressible by Average Hard Attention NoPE-Transformers (NoPE-AHATs): they correspond precisely to what we call \emph{semi-algebraic sets}, i.e., finite unions of sets of nonnegative integer solutions to systems of multivariate polynomial inequations. We obtain several interesting consequences of our characterization. Firstly, NoPE-transformers can express counting properties that are far more complex than established models like simplified counter machines and Petri nets, but cannot express a very simple counting property of PARITY. Secondly, the problem of analyzing NoPE-transformers is undecidable, e.g., whether a given NoPE transformer classifies all input strings in one class. To complement our results, we exhibit a counting language that is not expressible by average hard attention transformers even with arbitrary PEs but is expressible in the circuit complexity class TC$^0$, answering an open problem.</description>

      <title>On the Representation and State Complexity of Block Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider block languages, namely sets of words having the same length, and we propose a new representation for these languages. In particular, given an alphabet of size $k$ and a length $\ell$, a block language can be represented by a bitmap of length $k^\ell$, where each bit indicates whether the corresponding word, according to the lexicographical order, belongs, or not, to the language (bit equal to 1 or 0, respectively). First, we show how to convert bitmaps into deterministic and nondeterministic finite automata, and we prove that the machines are minimal. Then, we give an analysis of the maximum number of states sufficient to accept every block language in the deterministic and nondeterministic case. Finally, we study the deterministic and nondeterministic state complexity of several operations on these languages. Being a subclass of finite languages, the upper bounds of operational state complexity known for finite languages apply for block languages as well. However, in several cases, smaller values were found.</description>

      <title>The commutativity problem for effective varieties of formal series, and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A formal series in noncommuting variables $\Sigma$ over the rationals is a mapping $\Sigma^* \to \mathbb Q$. We say that a series is commutative if the value in the output does not depend on the order of the symbols in the input. The commutativity problem for a class of series takes as input a (finite presentation of) a series from the class and amounts to establishing whether it is commutative. This is a very natural, albeit nontrivial problem, which has not been considered before from an algorithmic perspective.
  We show that commutativity is decidable for all classes of series that constitute a so-called effective prevariety, a notion generalising Reutenauer's varieties of formal series. For example, the class of rational series, introduced by Sch\"utzenberger in the 1960's, is well-known to be an effective (pre)variety, and thus commutativity is decidable for it.
  In order to showcase the applicability of our result, we consider classes of formal series generalising the rational ones. We consider polynomial automata, shuffle automata, and infiltration automata, and we show that each of these models recognises an effective prevariety of formal series. Consequently, their commutativity problem is decidable, which is a novel result. We find it remarkable that commutativity can be decided in a uniform way for such disparate computation models.
  Finally, we present applications of commutativity outside the theory of formal series. We show that we can decide solvability in sequences and in power series for restricted classes of algebraic difference and differential equations, for which such problems are undecidable in full generality. Thanks to this, we can prove that the syntaxes of multivariate polynomial recursive sequences and of constructible differentially algebraic power series are effective, which are new results which were left open in previous work.</description>
