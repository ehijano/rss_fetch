      <title>Covariance Matrix Analysis for Optimal Portfolio Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In portfolio risk minimization, the inverse covariance matrix of returns is often unknown and has to be estimated in practice. This inverse covariance matrix also prescribes the hedge trades in which a stock is hedged by all the other stocks in the portfolio. In practice with finite samples, however, multicollinearity gives rise to considerable estimation errors, making the hedge trades too unstable and unreliable for use. By adopting ideas from current methodologies in the existing literature, we propose 2 new estimators of the inverse covariance matrix, one which relies only on the l2 norm while the other utilizes both the l1 and l2 norms. These 2 new estimators are classified as shrinkage estimators in the literature. Comparing favorably with other methods (sample-based estimation, equal-weighting, estimation based on Principal Component Analysis), a portfolio formed on the proposed estimators achieves substantial out-of-sample risk reduction and improves the out-of-sample risk-adjusted returns of the portfolio, particularly in high-dimensional settings. Furthermore, the proposed estimators can still be computed even in instances where the sample covariance matrix is ill-conditioned or singular</description>

      <title>Examples and Counterexamples of Cost-efficiency in Incomplete Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a number of examples and counterexamples to illustrate the results on cost-efficiency in an incomplete market obtained in [BS24]. These examples and counterexamples do not only illustrate the results obtained in [BS24], but show the limitations of the results and the sharpness of the key assumptions. In particular, we make use of a simple 3-state model in which we are able to recover and illustrate all key results of the paper. This example also shows how our characterization of perfectly cost-efficient claims allows to solve an expected utility maximization problem in a simple incomplete market (trinomial model) and recover results from [DS06, Chapter 3], there obtained using duality.</description>
