      <title>When does a Fermi puddle become a Fermi sea? Emergence of Pairing in Two-Dimensional Trapped Mesoscopic Fermi Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pairing lies at the heart of superfluidity in fermionic systems. Motivated by recent experiments in mesoscopic Fermi gases, we study up to six fermionic atoms with equal masses and equal populations in two different spin states, confined in a quasi-two-dimensional harmonic trap. We couple a stochastic variational approach with the use of an explicitly correlated Gaussian basis set, which enables us to obtain highly accurate energies and structural properties. Utilising two-dimensional two-body scattering theory with a finite-range Gaussian interaction potential, we tune the effective range to model realistic quasi-two-dimensional scattering. We calculate the excitation spectrum, pair correlation function, and paired fraction as a function of increasing attractive interaction strength. For up to six fermions in the ground state, we find that opposite spin and momentum pairing is maximised well below the Fermi surface in momentum space. By contrast, corresponding experiments on twelve fermions have found that pairing is maximal at the Fermi surface and strongly suppressed beneath [M. Holten et al., Nature 606, 287-291 (2022)]. This suggests that the Fermi sea $-$ which acts to suppress pairing at low momenta through Pauli blocking $-$ emerges in the transition from six to twelve particles.</description>

      <title>Analog Hawking radiation from a spin-sonic horizon in a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically study stimulated and spontaneous Hawking emission from an analog horizon for spin modes in a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate, both with and without a coherent coupling between the two components. We highlight the conceptual and practical advantages that these systems offer to the experimental observation of the phenomenon, namely the massive nature of elementary excitations and the experimental accessibility of the different quadratures of the spin excitations. In particular, we go beyond the relativistic regimes previously addressed in the literature, and identify various observables that show a signature of the Hawking process, as well as additional features associated with the massive nature of the modes, such as undulations. Semi-analytical calculations of the scattering properties of the horizon and of two-point correlation functions of the emitted radiation in an ideal stationary setup are supported by time-dependent numerical simulations based on Gross-Pitaevskii and Bogoliubov theory.</description>

      <title>Increasing superconducting $T_c$ by layering in the attractive Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The attractive Hubbard model has become a model readily realizable with ultracold atoms on optical lattices. However, the superconducting (superfluid) critical temperatures, $T_c$'s, are still somewhat smaller than the lowest temperatures achieved in experiments. Here we consider two possible routes, generically called layering, to increase $T_c$: a bilayer and a simple cubic lattice, both with tunable hopping, $t_z$, between attractive Hubbard planes. We have performed minus-sign--free determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations to calculate response functions such as pairing correlation functions, uniform spin susceptibility, and double occupancy, through which we map out some physical properties. We have found that by a judicious choice of fillings and intensity of on-site attraction, a bilayer can exhibit $T_c$'s between 1.5 and 1.7 times those of the single layer; for the simple-cubic lattice the enhancement can be 30\% larger than the maximum for the single layer. We also check the accuracy of both a BCS-like estimate for $T_c$ in the attractive Hubbard model, as well as of an upper bound for $T_c$ based on the superfluid density.</description>

      <title>Simulating Feedback Cooling of Incoherent Quantum Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a new approach for efficient and scalable simulations of measurement and control of quantum systems built upon existing phase-space methods, namely the Truncated Wigner Approximation (TWA). We benchmark against existing particle-filter methods by simulating measurement based feedback cooling in a two-mode system, whose low-dimensional nature permits a computation of an exact solution. The advantage of our method is multi-mode scalability, which we demonstrate through the first successful simulation of measurement-based feedback cooling of an incoherent quasi-1D thermal ensemble to quantum degeneracy. As the underlying principle of our approach exploits a general correspondence between measurement and coherent feedback, we anticipate it is also applicable across a broad range of other quantum control scenarios.</description>

      <title>Interference-induced suppression of particle emission from a Bose-Einstein condensate in lattice with time-periodic modulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emission of matter-wave jets from a parametrically driven condensate has attracted significant experimental and theoretical attention due to the appealing visual effects and potential metrological applications. In this work, we investigate the collective particle emission from a Bose-Einstein condensate confined in a one-dimensional lattice with periodically modulated interparticle interactions. We give the regimes for discrete modes, and find that the emission can be distinctly suppressed. The configuration induces a broad band, but few particles are ejected due to the interference of the matter waves. We further qualitatively model the emission process, and demonstrate the short-time behaviors. This engineering provides a way for manipulating the propagation of particles and the corresponding dynamics of condensates in lattices, and may find use in the dynamical excitation control of other nonequilibrium problems with time-periodic driving.</description>

      <title>Probing Goldstino excitation through the tunneling transport in a Bose-Fermi mixture with explicitly broken supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14524v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the tunneling transport in a repulsively interacting ultracold Bose-Fermi mixture. A two-terminal model is applied to such a mixture and the supersymmetric-like tunneling current through the junction can be induced by the bias of fermion chemical potential between two reservoirs. The Goldstino, which is the Nambu-Goldstone fermionic mode associated with the spontaneous sypersymmetry breaking and appears as a gapped mode in the presence of the explicit supersymmetry breaking in existing Bose-Fermi mixtures, is found to contribute to the tunneling transport as a supercharge exchanging process. Our study provides a potential way to detect the Goldstino transport in cold atom experiments.</description>

      <title>Universality of Efimov states in highly mass-imbalanced cold-atom mixtures with van der Waals and dipole interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02441v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study three-body systems in a mass-imbalanced two-component cold-atom mixture, and we investigate the three-body parameter of their Efimov states for both bosonic and fermionic systems, with a major focus on the Er-Er-Li Efimov states. For a system interacting solely via van der Waals interactions, the van der Waals universality of the three-body parameter is analytically derived using the quantum defect theory. With the addition of a perturbative dipole interaction between the heavy atoms, the three-body parameters of the bosonic and fermionic Efimov states are found to behave differently. When the dipole interaction is as strong as the van der Waals interaction, corresponding to realistic Er-Er-Li Efimov states, we show that the van der Waals universality persists once the effects of the non-perturbative dipole interaction are renormalized into the s-wave and p-wave scattering parameters between the heavy atoms. For a dipole interaction much stronger than the van der Waals interaction, we find that the universality of the Efimov states can be alternatively characterized by a quasi-one-dimensional scattering parameter due to a strong anisotropic deformation of the Efimov wavefunctions. Our work thus clarifies the interplay of isotropic and anisotropic forces in the universality of the Efimov states. Based on the renormalized van der Waals universality, the three-body parameter is estimated for specific isotopes of Er-Li cold-atom mixtures.</description>

      <title>Synthetic non-Abelian topological charges in ultracold atomic gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological phases associated with non-Abelian charges can exhibit a distinguished bulk-edge correspondence compared with Abelian phases, although elucidating this relationship remains challenging in traditional solid-state systems. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework for synthesizing non-Abelian quaternion charges in ultracold atomic gases. By designing artificial spin-orbit coupling patterns, the topological edge modes demonstrate a clear correspondence with the band topology determined by various quaternion charges. This paves the way for observing the interface modes whose existence is attributed to the nonconservation multiplication relation, which is fundamental to non-Abelian charges. This scheme can be readily implemented using current ultracold atom techniques, offering a promising approach to explore the intriguing non-Abelian characteristics of the system.</description>

      <title>Ground-state phase diagram of the SU($4$) Heisenberg model on a plaquette lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the ground state of the SU($4$) Heisenberg model on a square lattice with spatial anisotropy on each plaquette bond using the tensor-network method based on infinite projected entangled pair states. We find that the SU($4$) singlet ground state appears in the strongly anisotropic limit, whereas N\'eel and valence-bond crystal orders coexist in the nearly isotropic limit. By examining the intermediate parameter region, we identify a phase transition between these phases. The nature of the phase transition is likely to be of first order, and the transition point is estimated to be around $J'/J\approx 0.85(5)$, where $J$ and $J'$ are the interaction strengths of intra- and interplaquette bonds, respectively. We also calculate the anisotropy dependence of singlet correlations on a plaquette bond, which will be useful for future experiments of ultracold atoms in optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetic Ising model in a triangular vortex lattice of quantum fluids of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.01850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vortices are topologically distinctive objects appearing as phase twists in coherent fields of optical beams and Bose-Einstein condensates. Structured networks and artificial lattices of coupled vortices could offer a powerful platform to study and simulate interaction mechanisms between constituents of condensed matter systems, such as antiferromagnetic interactions, by replacement of spin angular momentum with orbital angular momentum. Here, we realize such a platform using a macroscopic quantum fluid of light based on exciton-polariton condensates. We imprint all-optical hexagonal lattice that results into a triangular vortex lattice, with each cell having a vortex of charge l = +-1. We reveal that pairs of coupled condensates spontaneously arrange their orbital angular momentum antiparallel, implying a form of artificial orbital "antiferromagnetism". We discover that correlation exists between the emergent vortex patterns in triangular condensate lattices and the low-energy solutions of the corresponding antiferromagnetic Ising system. Our study offers a path toward spontaneously ordered vortex arrays with nearly arbitrary configurations and controlled couplings.</description>

      <title>Particle production and hadronization temperature in the massive Schwinger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the pair production, string breaking, and hadronization of a receding electron-positron pair using the bosonized version of the massive Schwinger model in quantum electrodynamics in 1+1 space-time dimensions. Specifically, we study the dynamics of the electric field in Bjorken coordinates by splitting it into a coherent field and its Gaussian fluctuations. We find that the electric field shows damped oscillations, reflecting pair production. Interestingly, the computation of the asymptotic total particle density per rapidity interval for large masses can be fitted using a Boltzmann factor, where the temperature can be related to the hadronization temperature in QCD. Lastly, we discuss the possibility of an analog quantum simulation of the massive Schwinger model using ultracold atoms, explicitly matching the potential of the Schwinger model to the effective potential for the relative phase of two linearly coupled Bose-Einstein condensates.</description>
