      <title>All-optical radio-frequency phase detection for Rydberg atom sensors using oscillatory dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg atom radio frequency sensors are a unique platform for precision electromagnetic field measurement, e.g. they have extraordinary carrier bandwidth spanning MHz-THz and can be self-calibrated. These photonic sensors use lasers to prepare and read out the atomic response to a radio frequency electromagnetic field. Most work on Rydberg atom sensors centers on radio frequency electric field strength because the sensor functions as a square law detector, unless an external radio frequency heterodyning field is used. A heterodyning field acts as a local oscillator and enables phase read out at the expense of the radio frequency equipment necessary to generate it. In order to overcome the disadvantages of a radio frequency local oscillator, we investigate all-optical phase-sensitive detection using a five-level closed-loop excitation scheme. We show that under finite detuning of the loop fields, the atomic response oscillates at the frequency of the detuning. The oscillation is transferred to a probe laser absorption signal. The phase, frequency and amplitude of the radio frequency signal are imprinted on the oscillatory dynamics and can be determined using demodulation and matched filter techniques applied to the probe laser transmission signal.</description>

      <title>Rydberg Atom Electric Field Sensors as Linear Time-invariant Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, Rydberg atom electric field sensors have been under investigation as potential alternatives or complements to conventional antenna-based receivers for select applications in RF communications, remote sensing, and precision metrology. To understand the potential utility of these devices for various use cases, it is crucial to develop models that accurately predict key performance metrics such as instantaneous bandwidth and dynamic range. However, existing numerical models require solving a large set of coupled differential equations that is computationally intensive and lengthy to solve. We present an analytic approach that can be used to derive an impulse response function that allows up to two orders-of-magnitude reduction in computation time compared to the full time-dependent integration of the equations of motion. This approach can be used to enable rapid assessments of the Rydberg sensor's response to various waveforms.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Leveraging hybrid integration, we demonstrate dark-pulse formation at 780-nm wavelength band in integrated Si$_3$N$_4$ microresonators driven by high-power AlGaAs-based chip-scale lasers. The device outputs coherent frequency combs with electronically detectable repetition rates down to 20 GHz, paving a route to efficient and compact atom-chip interfaces for spectroscopy, metrology and sensing.</description>

      <title>Search for a parity-violating long-range spin-dependent interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-sensitivity quantum sensors are a promising tool for experimental searches for beyond-Standard-Model interactions. Here, we demonstrate an atomic comagnetometer operating under a resonantly-coupled hybrid spin-resonance (HSR) regime to probe P-odd, T-even interactions. The HSR regime enables robust nuclear-electron spin coupling, enhancing measurement bandwidth and stability without compromising the high sensitivity of spin-exchange relaxation-free magnetometers. To minimize vibration noise from velocity-modulated sources, we implement a multistage vibration isolation system, achieving a vibration noise reduction exceeding 700-fold. We establish new constraints on vector-boson-mediated parity-violating interactions, improving experimental sensitivity by three orders of magnitude compared to previous limits. The new constraints complement existing astrophysical and laboratory studies of potential extensions to the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing Ion Dynamics from Muon Diffusion in Muon Spin Relaxation II -- Extension to Paramagnetic Muons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23575v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the previously published model that distinguishes between the diffusive motion of diamagnetic muons and the dynamics of ions around the muon in matter, and propose a generalized model for {\sl paramagnetic muons} (Mu$^0$s, bound states of a muon and an unpaired electron) observed in non-metallic host materials. The new model distinguishes among the independent motion of unpaired electron associated with Mu$^0$, the self-diffusive motion of Mu$^0$ as single atomic entity, and that of the ions surrounding Mu$^0$, where the muon spin relaxation is induced by dynamical fluctuations of the hyperfine (HF) field exerted from the unpaired electron (e.g., due to spin/charge exchange reaction) and/or that of the nuclear hyperfine (NHF) interactions between the unpaired electron and the surrounding ions. We have applied this model to the muonated radicals (Mu$^0$s in a polaron state) in conducting polymers, and examined the validity of the interpretations claimed in the earlier literature that the spin relaxation is induced by quasi-one dimensional motion of the unpaired electron. The result suggests that experimental support for such a claim is still inadequate and needs to be reexamined, including the possibility of other origins for the fluctuations. It is expected that our model will prove a useful guide for $\mu$SR studies of various local dynamics involving paramagnetic muon states.</description>

      <title>On the non-Markovian quantum control dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study both open-loop control and closed-loop measurement feedback control of non-Markovian quantum dynamics resulting from the interaction between a quantum system and its environment. We use the widely studied cavity quantum electrodynamics (cavity-QED) system as an example, where an atom interacts with the environment composed of a collection of oscillators. In this scenario, the stochastic interactions between the atom and the environment can introduce non-Markovian characteristics into the evolution of quantum states, differing from the conventional Markovian dynamics observed in open quantum systems. As a result, the atom's decay rate to the environment varies with time and can be described by nonlinear equations. The solutions to these nonlinear equations can be analyzed in terms of the stability of a nonlinear control system. Consequently, the evolution of quantum state amplitudes follows linear time-varying equations as a result of the non-Markovian quantum transient process. Additionally, by using measurement feedback through homodyne detection of the cavity output, we can modulate the steady atomic and photonic states in the non-Markovian process. When multiple coupled cavity-QED systems are involved, measurement-based feedback control can influence the dynamics of high-dimensional quantum states, as well as the resulting stable and unstable subspaces.</description>
