      <title>Graphical view on linear extensions of finite posets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of possible cryptomorphic definitions of a partially ordered set (= a poset) $P$ on a non-empty finite basic set $N$ is in terms of the set ${\cal L}(P)$ of all its linear extensions, that is, in terms of the set of total orders of $N$ consonant with $P$. Any total order of $N$ can be interpreted as a node of a particular graph, called the permutohedral graph (over $N$), because it is indeed the graph of a certain polytope in $\mathbb{R}^{N}$, known as the permutohedron.
  It is shown in the paper that a non-empty set of total orders of $N$ equals to ${\cal L}(P)$ for some poset $P$ on $N$ iff it is a geodetically convex set in the permutohedral graph. This result means that a purely graphical concept of geodetical convexity in this graph is a cryptomorphic definition of a finite poset. In particular, the lattice of geodetically convex sets in this graph is graded and its height function is described in graphical terms. A counter-example, however, shows that the height function does not correspond to the usual graphical diameter, relating this matter to a combinatorial concept of the dimension of a poset.
  Two alternative cryptomorphic views on a poset $P$ on $N$ are also briefly commented. The geometric counterpart is its full-dimensional braid cone in $\mathbb{R}^{N}$, while a combinatorial alternative is a topology on $N$ distinguishing points, often referred as a distributive lattice.</description>

      <title>Optimal and Efficient Partite Decompositions of Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of partitioning the edges of a $d$-uniform hypergraph $H$ into a family $F$ of complete $d$-partite hypergraphs ($d$-cliques). We show that there is a partition $F$ in which every vertex $v \in V(H)$ belongs to at most $(\frac{1}{d!} + o_d(1))n^{d-1}/\lg n$ members of $F$. This settles the central question of a line of research initiated by Erd\H{o}s and Pyber (1997) for graphs, and more recently by Csirmaz, Ligeti, and Tardos (2014) for hypergraphs. The $d=2$ case of this theorem answers a 40-year-old question of Chung, Erd\H{o}s, and Spencer (1983). An immediate corollary of our result is an improved upper bound for the maximum share size for binary secret sharing schemes on uniform hypergraphs.
  Building on results of Nechiporuk (1969), we prove that every graph with fixed edge density $\gamma \in (0,1)$ has a biclique partition of total weight at most $(\tfrac{1}{2}+o(1))\cdot h_2(\gamma) \frac{n^2}{\lg n}$, where $h_2$ is the binary entropy function. Our construction implies that such biclique partitions can be constructed in time $O(m)$, which answers a question of Feder and Motwani (1995) and also improves upon results of Mubayi and Tur\'an (2010) as well as Chavan, Rabinia, Grosu, and Brocanelli (2025). Using similar techniques, we also give an $n^{1+o(1)}$ algorithm for finding a subgraph $K_{t,t}$ with $t = (1-o(1)) \frac{\gamma}{h_2(\gamma)} \lg n$.
  Our results show that biclique partitions are information-theoretically optimal representations for graphs at every fixed density. We show that with this succinct representation one can answer independent set queries and cut queries in time $O(n^2/ \lg n)$, and if we increase the space usage by a constant factor, we can compute a $2\alpha$-approximation for the densest subgraph problem in time $O(n^2/\lg \alpha)$ for any $\alpha &gt; 1$.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of Even Dimensional Partitions modulo 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The number of standard Young tableaux possible of shape corresponding to a partition $\lambda$ is called the dimension of the partition and is denoted by $f^{\lambda}$. Partitions with odd dimensions were enumerated by McKay and were further characterized by Macdonald using the theory of 2-core towers. We use the same theory to extend the results to partitions of $n$ with dimensions congruent to 2 modulo 4 which are enumerated by $a_2(n)$. We provide explicit results for $a_2(n)$ when $n$ has no consecutive 1s in its binary expansion and give a recursive formula to compute $a_2(n)$ for all $n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Menger's theorem - the maximum number of vertex-disjoint $X$-$Y$ paths is equal to the minimum size of an $X$-$Y$ separator - is generally not true in bidirected graphs. We prove that Menger's theorem holds true if we take the nontrivial $X$-$X$ paths and the nontrivial $Y$-$Y$ paths into account.</description>

      <title>Leading terms of relations on a level 5 module over the twisted affine Lie algebra $A_2^{(2)}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the starting points of this work was the duality of Borcea relating standard level $k$ representations of $A_1^{(1)}$ and level $2k+1$ of $A_2^{(2)}$. For $k=1$ the combinatorial bases in both cases yield the two Capparelli identities and we wanted to see if there is a correspondence between the bases in terms of partitions for all $k\in\mathbb N$. By using the vertex operator relations in the principal picture for level $5$ standard $A_2^{(2)}$-modules we reduce a spanning set of Poincare-Birkhoff-Witt-type vectors in $L(5\Lambda_0)$ by removing the leading terms of relations and rendering a list of 34 ``difference'' conditions for partitions.We have with computer programs sorted out the sets of partitions satisfying these conditions and formed the partial generating series which agrees with the principally specialized character for all powers of $q$ up to $41$. Although our list of leading terms is incomplete, our results show that the corresponding combinatorial identity for $L_{A_2^{(2)}}(5\Lambda_0)$ drastically differs from the one for the Borcea dual $L_{A_1^{(1)}}(2\Lambda_0)$.</description>

      <title>Reflection on the reflection complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The factor complexity ${\mathcal C}_{\mathbf u}$ of a sequence ${\mathbf u} = u_0u_1u_2 \cdots$ over a finite alphabet counts the number of factors of length $n$ occurring in $\mathbf u$, i.e., ${\mathcal C}_{\mathbf u}(n) = \#{\mathcal L}_n(\mathbf u)$, where ${\mathcal L}_n({\mathbf u)}= \{u_iu_{i+1}\cdots u_{i+n-1}: i \in \mathbb N\}$. Two factors of ${\mathcal L}_n(\mathbf u)$ are said to be equivalent if one factor is the reversal of the other one. Recently, Allouche et al. introduced the reflection complexity $r_{\mathbf u}$ which counts the number of non-equivalent factors of $\mathcal{L}_n(\mathbf u)$. They formulated the following conjecture: a sequence $\mathbf u$ is eventually periodic if and only if $r_{\mathbf u}(n+2) = r_{\mathbf u}(n)$ for some $n \in \mathbb N$. Here we prove the conjecture and characterize the sequences for which $r_{\mathbf u}(n+2) = r_{\mathbf u}(n)+1$ for every $n \in \mathbb N$ and also the sequences for which the equality is satisfied for every sufficiently large $n \in \mathbb N$.</description>

      <title>Cyclic Subgroup Lattices as Universal Sources of Power-Type Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power-type graphs, such as the power graph, the directed power graph, the enhanced power graph and the difference graph, encode significant information about the internal structure of a finite group. Despite substantial investigation in recent years, the precise relationship between these graphs and the subgroup lattice of the underlying group has remained only partially understood. In this paper we establish a complete, explicit, and purely combinatorial correspondence between the enhanced power graph and the lattice of cyclic subgroups $\mathcal{L}_c(G)$ of a finite group $G$. We prove that these two objects determine each other uniquely: an unlabeled enhanced power graph suffices to reconstruct $\mathcal{L}_c(G)$, and conversely, the labeled enhanced power graph can be reconstructed directly from $\mathcal{L}_c(G)$. Exploiting this duality, we demonstrate that the reconstruction principle applies equally to the power graph, the directed power graph, and the difference graph, which may all be derived solely from the cyclic subgroup lattice, independent of the group operation.
  This bidirectional correspondence yields a combinatorial equivalence between power-type graphs and the cyclic subgroup lattice, providing a new framework for analyzing finite groups through graph-theoretic and lattice-theoretic data, free from algebraic complexity.</description>

      <title>On gamma-vectors and Chow polynomials of restrictions of reflection arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simplicial arrangements are a special class of hyperplane arrangements, having the property that every chamber is a simplicial cone. It is known that the simpliciality property is preserved under taking restrictions. In this article we focus on the class of reflection arrangements and investigate two different polynomial invariants associated to them and their restrictions, the $h$-polynomial with its $\gamma$-vector and the Chow polynomial. We prove that all restrictions of reflection arrangements are $\gamma$-positive and give an explicit combinatorial formula of the Chow polynomial in type $B$. Furthermore we prove that for a special class of restrictions of arrangements of type $D$, called intermediate arrangements, both the $h$-polynomial as well as the Chow polynomial behave arithmetically, that is they interpolate linearly between the respective invariants for type $B$ and $D$.</description>

      <title>From Black Box to Bijection: Interpreting Machine Learning to Build a Zeta Map Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a large class of problems in algebraic combinatorics which can be distilled into the same challenge: construct an explicit combinatorial bijection. Traditionally, researchers have solved challenges like these by visually inspecting the data for patterns, formulating conjectures, and then proving them. But what is to be done if patterns fail to emerge until the data grows beyond human scale? In this paper, we propose a new workflow for discovering combinatorial bijections via machine learning. As a proof of concept, we train a transformer on paired Dyck paths and use its learned attention patterns to derive a new algorithmic description of the zeta map, which we call the \textit{Scaffolding Map}.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Recurrence for fully degenerate Bell polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the unnatural appearance of the two-variable degenerate Fubini polynomials in a recently derived Spivey-type recurrence relation for the fully degenerate Bell polynomials. To solve this, we introduce a new family of polynomial which we also call the fully degenerate Bell polynomials, along with their two-variable counterparts. Our main contribution is the derivation of natural Spivey-type recurrence relations using operator methods. We extend these results to the r-counterparts, the fully degenerate r-Bell polynomials providing Dobinski-like, finite sum, operator expressions, and Spivey-type recurrence relations for all the new polynomials.</description>

      <title>Mader's Conjecture and Its Variants for Cographs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The class of cographs is one of the most well-known graph classes, which is also known to be equivalent to the class of $P_4$-free graphs. We show that Mader's conjecture is true if we restrict ourselves to cographs, that is, for any tree $T$ of order $m$, every $k$-connected cograph $G$ with $\delta(G) \geq \left\lfloor \frac{3k}{2} \right\rfloor +m-1$ contains a subtree $T' \cong T$ such that $G-V(T')$ is still $k$-connected, where $\delta(G)$ denotes the minimum degree of $G$. Moreover, we show that three variants of Mader's conjecture hold for cographs, that is, for any tree $T$ of order $m$,
  $\bullet$ every $k$-connected (respectively, $k$-edge-connected) cograph $G$ with $\delta(G) \geq k+m-1$ contains a subtree $T' \cong T$ such that $G-E(T')$ is $k$-connected (respectively, $k$-edge-connected),
  $\bullet$ every $k$-edge-connected cograph $G$ with $\delta(G) \geq k+m-[k = 1]$ contains a subtree $T' \cong T$ such that $G-V(T')$ is $k$-edge-connected, where we use Iverson's convention for $[k = 1]$.
  We furthermore present tight lower bounds on the minimum degree of a cograph for the existence of disjoint connectivity keeping trees, a maximal connectedness keeping tree and a super edge-connectedness keeping tree.</description>

      <title>Rainbow subgraphs of star-coloured graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An edge-colouring of a graph $G$ can fail to be rainbow for two reasons: either it contains a monochromatic cherry (a pair of incident edges), or a monochromatic matching of size two. A colouring is a proper colouring if it forbids the first structure, and a star-colouring if it forbids the second structure. In this paper, we study rainbow subgraphs in star-coloured graphs and determine the maximum number of colours in a star-colouring of a large complete graph which does not contain a rainbow copy of a given graph $H$. This problem is a special case of one studied by Axenovich and Iverson on generalised Ramsey numbers and we extend their results in this case.</description>

      <title>Tetrahedron Conjecture in the $\ell_2$-norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12506v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The famous Tetrahedron Conjecture of Tur\'an from the 1940s asserts that the number of edges in an $n$-vertex $3$-graph without the tetrahedron, the complete $3$-graph on four vertices, cannot exceed that of the balanced complete cyclic $3$-partite $3$-graph, whose edges are of types $V_1 V_2 V_3$, $V_1 V_1 V_2$, $V_2 V_2 V_3$, and $V_3 V_3 V_1$. A recent surprising result of Balogh-Clemen-Lidick\'y [J. Lond. Math. Soc. (2) 106 (2022)] shows that this conjecture is asymptotically true in the $\ell_2$-norm, where the number of edges is replaced by the sum of squared codegrees. They further conjectured that, in this $\ell_2$-norm setting, the $3$-partite construction is uniquely extremal for large $n$. We confirm this conjecture.
  Two key ingredients in our proofs include establishing a Mantel theorem for vertex-colored graphs that forbid certain types of triangles, and introducing a novel procedure integrated into Simonovits' stability method, which essentially reduces the task to verifying that the $\ell_2$-norm of certain near-extremal constructions increases under suitable local modifications. The strategy in the latter may be of independent interest and potentially applicable to other extremal problems.</description>

      <title>Inverse descent statistic for Andr\'e and simsun permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simsun permutations, Andr\'e I permutations and Andr\'e II permutations are three combinatorial models for Euler numbers. It's known that the descent statistic is equidistributed over the set of Andr\'e I permutations and the set of simsun permutations. In this paper, we prove that the trivariate statistic (ides, des, maj), comprising the inverse descent, descent, and major index, are equidistributed over these three sets. This result is equivalent to showing that the inverse descent is equidistributed over these three sets that share the same tree shape.

      <title>Directed Hamiltonicity in Generalized Kneser Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the canonical orientation of the generalized Kneser graph $KG(n,k,s)$ contains a directed Hamiltonian cycle for all integers $s \geq 3$ and $n&gt;sk$. Furthermore, we establish that the dichromatic number of this oriented graph is exactly $k$. As a special case, our results apply to the $s$-stable Kneser graphs $K_{s\text{-stab}}(n,k)$, resolving their directed Hamiltonicity and dichromatic number. Our proof adapts the class graph framework of Ledezma and Pastine to the directed setting, leveraging cyclic rotations and friend class adjacencies to construct a single directed cycle spanning all vertices. This work provides a unified and strengthened perspective on the Hamiltonian properties of Kneser-type graphs.</description>

      <title>Explicit M-Polynomial and Degree-Based Topological Indices of Generalized Hanoi Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The M-polynomial, introduced by Deutsch and Klav\v{z}ar in 2015, provides a unifying algebraic framework for the computation of numerous degree-based topological indices such as the Zagreb, Randic, harmonic, and forgotten indices. Despite its broad applications in chemical graph theory and network analysis, closed expressions of the M-polynomial remain unknown for many important graph families.
  In this work we derive, for the first time, a complete explicit expression of the M-polynomial of the generalized Hanoi graphs $H_p^n$ for arbitrary positive $p$ and $n$. Our derivation relies on a detailed combinatorial analysis of the occupancy-based structure of $H_p^n$, refined using Stirling and $2$-associated Stirling numbers to enumerate all configurations with prescribed singleton and multiton counts. We obtain closed formulas for all diagonal and off-diagonal coefficients of the M-polynomial and show how these expressions yield exact values of the main degree-based topological indices. The correctness of the formulas is supported through numerical computation in small instances. These results provide a complete degree-based description of $H_p^n$ and make their structural complexity fully accessible through the M-polynomial framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The closed neighborhood complex $\mathcal{N}[G]$ of a simple graph $G$ is the simplicial complex whose simplices are finite sets of vertices contained in a closed neighborhood of a vertex in $G$. We reveal that the closed neighborhood complex has the close connections with other concepts, including the independence complex of the canonical double covering and the independence complex of the neighborhood hypergraph. Furthermore, we show that the fundamental group of the closed neighborhood complex is isomorphic to Grigor'yan--Lin--Muranov--Yau's fundamental group of a graph introduced in the study of path homology.</description>

      <title>Professor Preece's tredoku tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shortly before he died in 2014, Donald Preece gave two talks about what he called tredoku tilings, inspired by the puzzle of the same name. In these talks he presented a conjecture about the existence of these tilings that has been proved recently by Simon Blackburn. This paper provides an overview of Donald's work in this area, including his work on a natural generalisation of a tredoku tiling that he called a quadridoku tiling. Additionally, the paper gives alternative proofs of some parts of the existence theorem for tredoku tilings, presents a computer enumeration of the isomorphism classes of tredoku tilings with up to 16 tiles and provides a brief introduction to tilings with holes.</description>

      <title>On the Harmonic characteristic polynomial of specific graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the Harmonic matrix $MH(G)$ associated with a simple graph $ G $, where each entry corresponds to $ \frac{2}{d_i + d_j} $ for adjacent vertices $ v_i $ and $ v_j $. We investigate the spectral properties of this matrix, particularly focusing on its eigenvalues. A central objective of this work is to compute the Harmonic characteristic polynomial. Furthermore, we analyze the Harmonic energy $ HE(G) $ of a graph as the sum of the absolute values of the eigenvalues of $ MH(G) $. Explicit expressions for both the Harmonic characteristic polynomial and the Harmonic energy are derived for several specific classes of graphs.</description>

      <title>Packing coloring of graphs with long paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The packing coloring problem has diverse applications, including frequency assignment in wireless networks, resource distribution and facility location in smart cities and post-disaster management, as well as in biological diversity. Formally, the packing coloring of a graph is a vertex coloring in which any two vertices assigned color $i$ are at a distance of at least $i+1$, and the smallest number of colors admitting such a coloring is called the packing chromatic number. Goddard et al.~\cite{goddard2008broadcast} showed that the packing chromatic numbers of paths and cycles are at most 3 and 4, respectively. In this paper, we introduce \emph{path-aligned graph products}, a natural extension of paths with unbounded diameter. We extend the result of~\cite{goddard2008broadcast} by proving that the packing chromatic number remains bounded by a constant for several families of path-aligned cycle and path-aligned complete products. We then investigate the packing chromatic number of caterpillars, another class of graphs characterized by long induced paths. Sloper~\cite{sloper} proved that the packing chromatic number of caterpillars is at most 7; here, we provide a complete structural characterization of caterpillars with packing chromatic number at most 3. Finally, several open research questions are posed.</description>

      <title>Separating path systems for cubic graphs and for complete bipartite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A strongly separating path system in a graph $G$ is a collection $\mathcal{P}$ of paths in $G$ such that, for every two edges $e$ and $f$ of $G$, there is a paths in $\mathcal{P}$ with $e$ and not $f$, and vice-versa. The minimum number of such a system is the so called strong separation number of $G$. We prove that the strong separation number of every $2$-degenerate graph on $n$ vertices is at most $n$. Using this, we also provide upper bounds for the strong separation number of subcubic graphs, planar graphs, and planar bipartite graphs. On the other hand, we prove that the strong separation number a complete bipartite graph $K_{a,b}$ is at least $b$ if $a&lt;b/2$ and at least $(\sqrt{6(b/2)+4}-2)a$ if $b/2\leq a\leq b$, and we provide a construction that attains the former bound.</description>

      <title>Planar graphs without cycles of length 4 or 5 are $(7m:2m)$-DP-colorable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was conjectured by Steinberg in 1976 that planar graphs without cycles of length 4 or 5 are 3-colorable. This conjecture attracted a substantial amount of attention and was finally refuted by Cohen-Addad, Hebdige, Kr\'{a}l', Li and Salgado in 2017. Although Steinberg's conjecture is settled, coloring of this family of graphs, as well as some other families of planar graphs forbidding certain cycle lengths have been attracting a lot of recent attention and many challenging problems remain open. One problem of interest is multiple coloring and multiple list coloring of this family of graphs. It was proved by Dv\v{o}r\'{a}k and Hu that
  planar graphs without cycles of length 4 or 5 are $(11,3)$-colorable, and this result was improved by Wang, who proved that graphs in this family are $(7:2)$-colorable. On the other hand, it was proved by Xu and Zhu that for every positive integer $m$, there is a graph in this family which is not $(3m + \lfloor \frac{m-1}{12} \rfloor, m)$-choosable.
  In this paper, we prove that for any positive integer $m$, graphs in this family are $(7m:2m)$-DP-colorable, and hence $(7m,2m)$-choosable.</description>

      <title>The Minimum Number of Edges in $(p+1)K_2$-Saturated Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a family of graphs $\mathcal{F}$, a graph $G$ is $\mathcal{F}$-saturated if it is $\mathcal{F}$-free but the addition of any missing edge creates a copy of some $F \in \mathcal{F}$. The study of the minimum number of edges in $\mathcal{F}$-saturated graphs is a central topic in extremal graph theory.
  Let $(p+1)K_2$ denote a matching of size $p+1$. Determining the minimum number of edges in a $(p+1)K_{2}$-saturated graph is a fundamental question in this area, explicitly posed as Problem 9 in the survey by Faudree et al. (2011). In this paper, we refine the structural analysis of $(p+1)K_2$-saturated graphs and derive an explicit formula for the number of edges in terms of a single integer parameter. By minimizing this formula we determine $\mathrm{sat}(n,(p+1)K_2)$ for all $n&gt;2p$, thereby resolving Problem 9 in full generality and extending earlier results of K\'aszonyi--Tuza (1986) and Zhang--Lu--Yu (2024). Moreover, by maximizing the same formula we recover the classical Erd\H{o}s--Gallai (1959) upper bound on the number of edges in such graphs.</description>

      <title>The existence of even factors based on spectral conditions of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G=(V(G),E(G)) $ be a graph with vertex set $V(G)$ and edge set $E(G)$. An even factor of $G$ is a spanning subgraph $F$ such that every vertex in $F$ has a nonzero even degree. Note that $\delta(G)\geq 2$ is a trivial necessary condition for a graph to have an even factor, where \( \delta(G) \) is the minimum degree of \( G \). In this paper, for a connected graph $G$ with minimum degree $\delta$, we establish a lower bound on the signless
  Laplacian spectral radius of $G$ and an upper bound on the distance spectral radius of $G$ such
  that $G$ contains an even factor.</description>

      <title>Large cliques in graphs with forbidden semi-induced structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2022, Holmsen showed that any graph with at least \( c \binom{n}{r} \) \(r\)-cliques but no induced complete $r$-partite graph $K_{2,\ldots, 2}$ must contain a clique of order \(\Omega(c^{2^{r-1}} n)\). In this paper, we study graphs forbidding semi-induced substructures and show that every $n$-vertex graph $G$ containing at least $c\binom{n}{r}$ copies of $K_r$ (for some constant $c&gt;0$) and forbidding semi-induced substructures, related to $K_{2,\ldots, 2}$, must contain a clique of order $\Omega(cn)$. Our result strengthens Holmsen's bound by improving the dependence on $c$ from $c^{2^{r-1}}$ to linear in $c$ with bounded number of forbidden structures. Furthermore, our approach is naturally linked to the notion of VC-dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish an optimal $\chi$-binding function for $(P_2\cup P_4,\text{ diamond})$-free graphs. We prove that for any graph $G$ in this class, $\chi(G)\le 4$ when $\omega(G)=2$, $\chi(G)\le 6$ when $\omega(G)=3$, and $\chi(G)=\omega(G)$ when $\omega(G)\ge 4$, where $\chi(G)$ and $\omega(G)$ denote the chromatic number and clique number of $G$, respectively. This result extends the known chromatic bounds for $(P_2\cup P_3,\text{ diamond})$-free graphs by showing that $(P_2\cup P_4,\text{ diamond})$-free graphs admit the same $\chi$-binding function. It also refines the chromatic bound obtained by Angeliya, Karthick and Huang [arXiv:2501.02543v3 [math.CO], 2025] for $(P_2\cup P_4,\text{ diamond})$-free graphs.</description>

      <title>The star edge coloring of cubic Halin graphs with star chromatic index $5$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The star chromatic index of a graph $G$, denoted by $\chi'_{st}(G) $, is the minimum number of colors needed to properly color the edges of $G$ such that no path or cycle of length four is bi-colored. Casselgren et al. and Hou et al. independently proved that the star chromatic index of a cubic Halin graph, except a special graph, is at most $6$. It remains an open problem to determine which of such graphs have star chromatic index $5$. In this paper, we show that if $G\ne N_{e_2}$ is a cubic Halin graph whose tree is a caterpillar or a complete tree, then $\chi'_{st}(G)=5$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyclically ordered graphs, or cogs, sit between abstract graphs and cellularly embedded graphs. They arise naturally in topological graph theory, knot theory, and mathematical biology. We develop a formal theory of cogs and establish a number of invariants of cogs. In particular we detail several ways to present cogs and detail how these descriptions can be used to construct cog invariants by adapting the matching, transition and Yamada polynomials.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An orientation-preserving mapping is not always defined by how it acts on triples of elements. Although this fact is simple and well-known, it sometimes gets overlooked, resulting in wrong statements in publications. Automated proof assistants are a technology that is supposed to ensure that proofs exactly match the results, thus pre-empting mistakes. In this paper we successfully formalise the definition of orientation-preserving mappings in proof assistant software Lean and construct a computer-verified proof of the above fact.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of paths in a hexagonal circle packing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate paths in the hexagonal circle packing and enumerate them with respect to width, height, number of steps, area, and kissing number. Functional equations and the kernel method yield closed bivariate generating functions together with coefficient formulas and asymptotics. We establish bijections with skew Dyck paths, constrained Motzkin paths, and peakless Motzkin paths, and show that several of the associated counting arrays are Riordan arrays. Continued-fraction expansions for the area and kissing-number enumerators are also obtained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the higher Steklov eigenvalues of graphs on surfaces. We obtain the upper bound of higher Steklov eigenvalues of a finite graph $G$ with boundary $B$ and genus $g$ by using metrical deformation via probability flows. This result can be regarded as a discrete analogue of Karpukhin's bound in spectral geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tropicalisation (with trivial coefficients) is a process that turns a polynomial equation into a combinatorial predicate on subsets of the set of variables. We show that for each minuscule representation of a simple reductive group, there is a set of quadratic equations cutting out the orbit of the highest weight vector whose tropicalisation characterises the set of Coxeter matroids for that representation which satisfy the strong exchange property.</description>

      <title>Rankwidth of Graphs with Balanced Separations: Expansion for Dense Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that every graph of rankwidth at least $72r$ contains an induced subgraph whose minimum balanced cutrank is at least $r$, which implies a vertex subset where every balanced separation has $\mathbb{F}_2$-cutrank at least $r$. This implies a novel relation between rankwidth and a well-linkedness measure, defined entirely by balanced vertex cuts. As a byproduct, our result supports the notion of rank-expansion as a suitable candidate for measuring expansion in dense graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we prove that the adjoint polynomial of arbitrary convex polytopes is up to scaling uniquely determined by vanishing to the right order on the polytopes residual arrangement. This answers a problem posed by Kohn and Ranestad and generalizes their main theorem to non-simple polytopes. We furthermore prove that the adjoint polynomial is already characterized by vanishing to the right order on a zero-dimensional subset of the residual arrangement.</description>

      <title>Any fully graphic region of degree sequences can be sampled rapidly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $n&gt;c_1\ge c_2$ and $\Sigma$ be positive integers with $n\cdot c_1\ge \Sigma \ge n\cdot c_2.$ Let $\mD=\dds{n}{\Sigma}{c_1}{c_2}$ denote the set of all degree sequences of length $n$ with the even sum $\Sigma$ and satisfying $c_1\ge d_i\ge c_2.$ We show that if all degree sequences in $\mD$ are graphic, then $\mD$ is $3n^{13}$-stable. (The concept of $P$-stability was introduced by Jerrum and Sinclair in 1990.) In particular, this implies that the switch Markov-chain mixes rapidly on all such degree sequences.
  In this paper we also study the inverse direction. We show the following: if all graphic sequences of a degree sequence region satisfy the $p(n)$-stability condition then the overwhelming majority of the sequences in the region is graphic. This answers affirmatively a question raised in the paper \DOI{10.1016/j.aam.2024.102805}.</description>

      <title>A new generalization of the Narayana numbers inspired by linear operators on associative $d$-ary algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study a generalization of the Narayana numbers $N_d(n,k) = \frac{1}{n+1} \binom{n+1}{k+1} \binom{ n + (n-k)(d-2)+1}{k}$ for integers $d \geq 2$ and $n,k \geq 0$. This two-parameter array extends the classical Narayana numbers ($d=2$) and yields a $d$-ary analogue of the Catalan numbers $C_d(n) = \sum_{k=0}^n N_d(n,k)$. We give nine combinatorial interpretations of $N_d(n,k)$ that unify and generalize known combinatorial interpretations of the Narayana numbers and $C_3(n)$ in the literature. In particular, we show that $N_d(n,k)$ counts a natural class of operator monomials over a $d$-ary associative algebra, thereby extending a result of Bremner and Elgendy for the binary case. We also construct explicit bijections between these monomials and several families of classic combinatorial objects, including Schr\"{o}der paths, Dyck paths, rooted ordered trees, and $231$-avoiding permutations.</description>

      <title>A Note on Large Degenerate Induced Subgraphs in Sparse Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13693v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$ and a non-negative integer $d$ let $\alpha_d(G)$ be the order of a largest induced $d$-degenerate subgraph of $G$. We prove that for any pair of non-negative integers $k&gt;d$, if $G$ is a $k$-degenerate graph, then $\alpha_d(G) \geq \max\{ \frac{(d+1)n}{k+d+1}, n - \alpha_{k-d-1}(G)\}$. For $k$-degenerate graphs this improves a more general lower bound of Alon, Kahn, and Seymour. By modifying our argument we obtain improved lower bound on $\alpha_d(G)$ for graphs of bounded genus. This extends earlier work on degenerate subgraphs of planar graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide counterexamples to several conjectures concerning strongly maximal and strongly minimal structures in infinite graphs and hypergraphs. In particular, we construct 3-uniform hypergraphs without strongly maximal matchings and without strongly minimal covers, and from our construction for covers we build a graph with no strongly minimal colouring. We also consider several refinements of these problems.
  Our results resolve conjectures and questions of Aharoni; Aharoni and Berger; Aharoni, Berger, Georgakopoulos, and Spr\"{u}ssel; Aharoni and Korman; and Tardos.</description>

      <title>Thresholds and Fluctuations of Submultiplexes in Random Multiplex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a multiplex network a common set of nodes is connected through different types of interactions, each represented as a separate graph (layer) within the network. In this paper, we study the asymptotic properties of submultiplexes, the counterparts of subgraphs (motifs) in single-layer networks, in the correlated Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi multiplex model. This is a random multiplex model with two layers, where the graphs in each layer marginally follow the classical (single-layer) Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi model, while the edges across layers are correlated. We derive the precise threshold condition for the emergence of a fixed submultiplex $\boldsymbol{H}$ in a random multiplex sampled from the correlated Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi model. Specifically, we show that the satisfiability region, the regime where the random multiplex contains infinitely many copies of $\boldsymbol{H}$, forms a polyhedral subset of $\mathbb{R}^3$. Furthermore, within this region the count of $\boldsymbol{H}$ is asymptotically normal, with an explicit convergence rate in the Wasserstein distance. We also establish various Poisson approximation results for the count of $\boldsymbol{H}$ on the boundary of the threshold, which depends on a notion of balance of submultiplexes. Collectively, these results provide an asymptotic theory for small submultiplexes in the correlated multiplex model, analogous to the classical theory of small subgraphs in random graphs.</description>

      <title>Threshold Graphs Are Globally Synchronizing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Place n nodes on the unit circle and connect some pairs with springs that pull connected nodes toward each other. Which graphs always drive all nodes to converge to a single point, no matter where they start? This is known as the global synchronization problem of the Kuramoto model and is closely tied to the benign nonconvexity of its synchronization landscape. In this work, we show how this dynamical and continuous question can be reduced to a static and combinatorial one. We prove that threshold graphs, the graph class closed under adding isolated nodes and adding universal nodes, are globally synchronizing, based purely on a combinatorial analysis of unit-vector configurations in the plane. It is particularly striking that threshold graphs range from extremely sparse structures such as stars to the complete graph, suggesting that global synchronization in this class cannot be attributed to density. Our proof shows that global synchronization can instead emerge from a form of geometric symmetry.</description>

Abstract: This article gives a new upper bound for the resurgence number of symbolic powers of matroidal configuration in the following situations: the height of the matroidal configuration is big, or the height is small, and the corresponding simplicial complex of the matroidal configuration is peaked. The Peaked simplicial complex is a generalization of bipartite graph. Furthermore, the article also gives a clean formula to compute the resurgence number and the strict containment of generalized uniform matroidal configuration which includes case of star configuration of hypersurfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we determine the sharp threshold for universality of cokernels of random matrices over finite fields. More precisely, we prove the following: given any constant $c&gt;1$, let $A(n)$ be a random $n \times n$ matrix over $\mathbb{F}_p$ whose entries are independent and take any given value of $\mathbb{F}_p$ with probability at most $1 - \frac{c \log n}{n}$. Then the cokernels of $A(n)$ converge in distribution, as $n \to \infty$, to the same limiting law as the cokernels of uniform random $n \times n$ matrices over $\mathbb{F}_p$. This answers an open problem posed by Wood (2022).</description>

      <title>On the deep commuting graph of a finite group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group and let $\tilde{G}$ be a Schur cover of $G$. The deep commuting graph $\Delta_D(G)$ of $G$ is a simple graph with vertex set $G$, where two distinct vertices are adjacent if their pre-images commute in $\tilde{G}$. The deep commuting graph of a finite group was first introduced in [P. J. Cameron and B. Kuzma, Between the enhanced power graph and the commuting graph, {\it J. Graph Theory} {\bf 102} (2023), no. 2, 295--303], where the authors have shown that $\Delta_D(G)$ is fixed irrespective of the choice of the Schur cover $\tilde{G}$. In this paper, we first prove that $\Delta_D(G)$ is complete if and only if $G$ is cyclic. Also, we classify finite simple groups, symmetric groups and alternating groups, for which $\Delta_D(G)$ is perfect. In addition, explore several other properties of $\Delta_D(G)$ like Eulerianess, universality and connectedness of reduced deep commuting graphs.
  Next, we classify the finite abelian groups for which deep commuting graphs coincide with enhance power graphs. We also characterize the dominant vertices for the deep commuting graphs of finite abelian groups and examine the connectedness of the associated reduced deep commuting graphs. These properties of the deep commuting graphs for the non abelian groups like symmetric groups, alternating groups, dihedral groups, generalized quaternion group and Heisenberg groups are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a finite group $G$, the notion of a $G$-transfer system provides homotopy theorists with a combinatorial way to study equivariant objects. In this paper, we focus on the properties of transfer systems for non-abelian groups. We explicitly describe the width of all dihedral groups, quaternion groups, and dicyclic groups. For a given $G$, the set of all $G$-transfer systems forms a poset lattice under inclusion; these are a useful resource to homotopical combinatorialists for detecting patterns and checking conjectures. We expand the suite of known transfer system lattices for non-abelian groups including those which are dihedral, dicyclic, Frobenius, and alternating.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13477v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of simplicial complexes, called \emph{$t$-Young complexes}, arising from a Young diagram and a positive integer~$t$. We show that every $t$-Young complex is either contractible or homotopy equivalent to a wedge of spheres. A complete characterization of their vertex-decomposability is provided, and in several cases, we establish explicit formulas for their homotopy types. Interestingly, $t$-Young complexes naturally appear as the Alexander dual complexes of squarefree powers of $t$-path ideals of path graphs, as well as of certain ideals generated by subsets of their minimal generators. As an application, we derive formulas for the projective dimension and Krull dimension of these squarefree powers.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous variances of Pauli strings, weighted independence numbers, and a new kind of perfection of graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A set of Pauli stings is well characterized by the graph that encodes its commutatitivity structure, i.e., by its frustration graph. This graph provides a natural interface between graph theory and quantum information, which we explore in this work. We investigate all aspects of this interface for a special class of graphs that bears tight connections between the groundstate structures of a spin systems and topological structure of a graph. We call this class $\hbar$-perfect, as it extends the class of perfect and $h$-perfect graphs.
  Having an $\hbar$-perfect graph opens up several applications: we find efficient schemes for entanglement detection, a connection to the complexity of shadow tomography, tight uncertainty relations and a construction for computing good lower on bounds ground state energies. Conversely this also induces quantum algorithms for computing the independence number. Albeit those algorithms do not immediately promise an advantage in runtime, we show that an approximate Hamilton encoding of the independence number can be achieved with an amount of qubits that typically scales logarithmically in the number of vertices. We also we also determine the behavior of $\hbar$-perfectness under basic graph operations and evaluate their prevalence among all graphs.</description>

      <title>On some properties of free commutators with semicircular variables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate commutators of free variables of the form \( i[x, s] \), where \( s \) is a semicircular element. We show that although \( s \) and \( i[x, s] \) are not free, their sum nevertheless satisfies the free additive convolution identity \[ \mu_{s + i[x, s]} = \mu_s \boxplus \mu_{i[x, s]}. \] Furthermore, we prove that the polynomial \( x + i[x, s] \) is freely infinitely divisible whenever \( x \) itself is freely infinitely divisible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cyclotomic matrix is commonly used to arrange cyclotomic numbers in a convenient format. A natural question is whether the structure of the matrix can reflect properties of these numbers. In this article, we examine cyclotomic numbers through their associated cyclotomic matrix and reveal an algebraic structure by relating it to a basis element of a Schur ring. This viewpoint leads to structural identities and reinterpretations of classical results. As an application, we investigate the power difference set problem and establish conditions expressed through cyclotomic matrices, including spectral and determinant characterizations.</description>

      <title>Stability phenomena in Deligne-Mumford compactifications via Morse theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the rational homology of the Deligne-Mumford compactification $\overline{\mathcal M}_{g,n}$ of the moduli space of stable curves via a family of Morse functions, the $\text{sys}_T$ functions, which encode geometric information about short geodesics on hyperbolic surfaces. Exploiting the Morse-theoretic properties of $\text{sys}_T$, including the existence of an index gap and the behavior of critical points near boundary strata, we prove that in low degrees the homology of $\overline{\mathcal M}_{g,n}$ is supported entirely on the boundary $\partial \mathcal M_{g,n}$.
  Furthermore, we establish finite generation and stability phenomena for the rational homology across all genera and numbers of marked points. Using stable graphs and explicit attaching maps, we show that for each fixed degree $k$, a finite set of critical points generates all $k$-th homology classes via attaching stable graphs of stratum dimension $0$. This result recovers previously known stability in the genus direction, such as Tosteson's theorem, and provides a concrete, geometric construction of homology generators. Our approach unifies combinatorial, geometric, and Morse-theoretic techniques to give a comprehensive picture of the low-degree and stable homology of $\overline{\mathcal M}_{g,n}$.</description>

Abstract: The number of standard Young tableaux of shape a partition $\lambda$ is called the dimension of the partition and is denoted by $f^{\lambda}$. Partitions with odd dimensions were enumerated by McKay and were further characterized by Macdonald. Let $a_i(n)$ be the number of partitions of $n$ with dimension congruent to $i$ modulo 4. In this paper, we refine Macdonald's and McKay's results by computing $a_1(n)$ and $a_3(n)$ when $n$ has no consecutive 1s in its binary expansion or when the sum of binary digits of $n$ is 2.</description>

      <title>A 1.431-Competitive Algorithm for Combinatorial Group Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09320v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of fault-detection problems, the objective is to identify all defective items among a set of $n$ binary-state items using the minimum number of tests. The {group testing} paradigm, which allows testing a subset of items in a single test, serves as a fundamental technique for efficiently classifying large populations. We study a central problem in the combinatorial group testing model where the number $d$ of defective items is unknown in advance. Let $M_\alpha(d|n)$ denote the maximum number of tests required by an algorithm $\alpha$ for this problem, and $M(d,n)$ denote the minimum number of tests required in the worst case when $d$ is known in advance. An algorithm $\alpha$ is called a $c$-\emph{competitive algorithm} if there exist constants $c$ and $a$ such that, for $0\le d &lt; n$, $M_{\alpha}(d|n)\le cM(d,n)+a$. We design a new adaptive algorithm with a competitive constant $c \le 1.431$, thus pushing the competitive ratio below the best-known one of $1.452$. To achieve this, we propose a novel solution framework based on an unexplored up-zig-zag strategy and a studied strongly competitive algorithm.</description>

      <title>A Modular-Form Framework for Global Optimality in the Asymmetric Traveling-Salesman Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15546v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop an alternate formulation of Asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problem (ATSP). The equivalent problem is to find the zeros of a holomorphic cusp form on the principal congruence subgroup, $\Gamma(4) $. The resultant Poincar{\'e} series gives a cusp form whose interior zeros are in bijection with the arc that constitute optimal Hamiltonian cycle. We show that for any weight, $\ell$ and number of directed arcs, $|A|$ such that $4\ell-7&lt;2|A| $, the holomorphic cusp form vanishes at global optimum. Furthermore, a three step filter consisting of Fourier coefficients, Hecke recursions and completed $L$-function parity test provides a scalar certificate for global optimality. The framework is a potential bridge between discrete optimization and number theory suggesting an alternate view on complexity theory.</description>

Abstract: We prove a sharp upper bound on the number of distinct columns of a totally unimodular matrix with column sums $1$ improving upon Heller's classical bound. The proof uses Seymour's decomposition theorem. Such matrices are closely related to unimodular polytopes: lattice polytopes where the vertices of every full-dimensional subsimplex form an affine lattice basis. This is an interesting subclass of 0/1-polytopes and contains for instance edge polytopes of bipartite graphs. Our main result on totally unimodular matrices implies a sharp upper bound on the number of vertices of unimodular polytopes.</description>

Abstract: For non-negative integer parameters $r,u,m,n$ define \begin{align*}
  \cal{D}(r,u,m,n) := \big\{\ \sigma\in \cal{S}_{r+n}\ \big|\ \sigma(x)=y \textrm{ for exactly } u \textrm{ pairs } (x,y) \textrm{ such that } 1\leq x,y\leq r \textrm{ and } \sigma(t)=t \textrm{ for exactly } m \textrm{ elements } r+1\leq t\leq r+n\ \big\} \end{align*} and \begin{align*}
  \cal{D}_{r,u,m}(n) := \big\{\ \sigma\in \cal{S}_{r+n}\ \big|\ \forall_{1\leq x&lt;y\leq r} \ x \textrm{ and } y \textrm{ are in disjoint cycles of } \sigma \textrm{ and } \sigma(z)=z \textrm{ for exactly } u \textrm{ elements } 1\leq z\leq r, \textrm{ and } \sigma(t)=t \textrm{ for exactly } m \textrm{ elements } r+1\leq t\leq r+n\ \big\}, \end{align*} where $\mathcal{S}_{n}$ denotes the set of all the permutations of $\{1,\ldots ,n\}$.
  In this paper we study connections between the sets $\mathcal{D}(r,u,m,n)$, $\mathcal{D}_{r,u,m}(n)$, and the sets of (some classes of) $r$-derangements. We rely mostly on counting arguments.</description>

      <title>Monophonic position sets of Cartesian and lexicographic products of graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09837v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The general position problem in graph theory asks for the number of vertices in a largest set $S$ of vertices of a graph $G$ such that no shortest path of $G$ contains more than two vertices of $S$. The analogous monophonic position problem is obtained from the general position problem by replacing ``shortest path'' by ``induced path.'' In this paper the monophonic position number is studied on Cartesian and lexicographic products of graphs. It is proved that in Cartesian products, a monophonic position set can only be in one of three canonical forms, named layered, varied, and cliquey. The monophonic position number of an arbitrary Cartesian product is bounded from below and above. The two bounds coincide if neither of the factors has simplicial vertices. A formula for the monophonic position number of a lexicographic product is given which only contains the clique number and the structure of monophonic sets of the second factor.</description>

      <title>On Maximum Induced Forests of the Balanced Bipartite Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The decycling number $\nabla(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the minimum number of vertices that must be removed to eliminate all cycles in $G$. The forest number $f(G)$ is the maximum number of vertices that induce a forest in $G$. So $\nabla(G) + f(G) = |V(G)|$. For the Cartesian product $T \,\square\, T'$ of trees $T$ and $T'$ it is proved that $\nabla(S_n \,\square\, S_{n'}) \leq \nabla(T \,\square\, T')$, thus resolving the conjecture of Wang and Wu asserting that $f(T \,\square\, T') \leq f(S_n \,\square\, S_{n'})$. It is shown that $\nabla(T \,\square\, T') \ge\min\{ |V(T)|,|V(T')|\} - 1$ and the equality cases characterized. For prisms over trees, it is proved that $\nabla(T\,\square\, K_2) = \alpha'(T)$, and for arbitrary graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$, it is proved that $\nabla(G_1 \,\square\, G_2) \geq \alpha'(G_1) \alpha'(G_2)$, where $\alpha'$ is the matching number.</description>

      <title>Degree Realization by Bipartite Multigraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15515v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of realizing a given degree sequence by a multigraph can be thought of as a relaxation of the classical degree realization problem (where the realizing graph is simple). This paper concerns the case where the realizing multigraph is required to be bipartite.
  The problem of characterizing sequences that can be realized by a bipartite graph has two variants. In the simpler one, termed BDR$^P$, the partition of the sequence into two sides is given as part of the input. A complete characterization for realizability in this variant was given by Gale and Ryser over sixty years ago. However, the variant where the partition is not given, termed BDR, is still open.
  For bipartite multigraph realizations, there are also two variants. For BDR$^P$, where the partition is given as part of the input, a characterization was known for determining whether there is a multigraph realization whose underlying graph is bipartite, such that the maximum number of copies of an edge is at most $r$. We present a characterization for determining if there is a bipartite multigraph realization such that the total number of excess edges is at most $t$. We show that optimizing these two measures may lead to different realizations, and that optimizing by one measure may increase the other substantially. As for the variant BDR, where the partition is not given, we show that determining whether a given (single) sequence admits a bipartite multigraph realization is NP-hard. Moreover, we show that this hardness result extends to any graph family which is a sub-family of bipartite graphs and a super-family of paths. On the positive side, we provide an algorithm that computes optimal realizations for the case where the number of balanced partitions is polynomial, and present sufficient conditions for the existence of bipartite multigraph realizations that depend only on the largest degree of the sequence.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, topological indices play a significant role in the analysis of caterpillar trees, especially due to their applications in chemical graph theory. We presented a study on topological indices related to the Sigma index, which we carefully selected on caterpillar trees with multiple levels. Through the election of these topological indices, we provide efficient models of these indices on caterpillar trees, as it is known that the Albertson index is the basis on which most of the topological indices are built and we have shown this through the close correlation between the Albertson's index and the Sigma index.</description>

      <title>Parameter Identifiability of Linear-Compartmental Mammillary Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear compartmental models are a widely used tool for analyzing systems arising in biology, medicine, and more. In such settings, it is essential to know whether model parameters can be recovered from experimental data. This is the identifiability problem. For a class of linear compartmental models with one input and one output, namely, those for which the underlying graph is a bidirected tree, Bortner et al. completely characterized which such models are structurally identifiability, which means that every parameter is generically locally identifiable. Here, we delve deeper, by examining which individual parameters are locally versus globally identifiable. Specifically, we analyze mammillary models, which consist of one central compartment which is connected to all other (peripheral) compartments. For these models, which fall into five infinite families, we determine which individual parameters are locally versus globally identifiable, and we give formulas for some of the globally identifiable parameters in terms of the coefficients of input-output equations. Our proofs rely on a combinatorial formula due to Bortner et al. for these coefficients.</description>

      <title>Explicit geometric construction of Ramsey graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09235v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an explicit geometric construction of a large parametrized family of graphs with no $k$-cliques and with bounded independence number, generalizing the triangle-free Ramsey graphs of Codenotti, Pudl\'ak, and Resta and revisiting the previous generalization by Kostochka, Pudl\'ak and R\"odl. Within this framework, we provide a new combinatorial proof of the upper bound on the independence number for their constructions, offering additional insight into the structure of its independent sets. For our generalized family, we establish lower bounds on the independence number and identify necessary constraints on the parameters under which these graphs could yield improved constructive asymptotic lower bounds on $R(s,t)$, with particular emphasis on $R(3,t)$. As a byproduct, we provide a linear-time approximation algorithm for finding the largest independent set within this parametrized family. For a substantial subfamily, this algorithm achieves a $\frac{1}{2}$-approximation ratio. Special attention is given to the case of triangle-free graphs: we describe explicit constructions on $n$ vertices with independence number $O(n^{\frac{2}{3}})$, giving a constructive asymptotic lower bound of $\Omega(t^{\frac{3}{2}})$ for the Ramsey numbers $R(3,t)$, matching the best known constructive bound.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let \( G \) be a graph with order \( n(G) \geq 5 \), local metric dimension \( \dim_l(G) \), and clique number \( \omega(G) \). In this paper, we investigate the local metric dimension of \( K_5 \)-free graphs and prove that \( \dim_l(G) \leq \lfloor\frac{2}{3}n(G)\rfloor \) when \( \omega(G) = 4 \). As a consequence of this finding, along with previous publications, we establish that if \( G \) is a \( K_5 \)-free graph, then \( \dim_l(G) \leq \lfloor\frac{2}{5}n(G)\rfloor \) when \( \omega(G) = 2 \), \( \dim_l(G) \leq \lfloor\frac{1}{2}n(G)\rfloor \) when \( \omega(G) = 3 \), and \( \dim_l(G) \leq \lfloor\frac{2}{3}n(G)\rfloor \) when \( \omega(G) = 4 \). Notably, these bounds are sharp for planar graphs. These results for graphs with a clique number less than or equal to 4 provide a positive answer to the conjecture stating that if \( n(G) \geq \omega(G) + 1 \geq 4 \), then \( \dim_l(G) \leq \left( \frac{\omega(G) - 2}{\omega(G) - 1} \right)n(G) \).</description>

      <title>On the Maximum Spread of Non-Negative Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a directed graph $G$, the spread of $G$ is the largest distance between any two eigenvalues of its adjacency matrix. In 2022, Breen, Riasanovsky, Tait, and Urschel asked what $n$-vertex directed graph maximizes spread, and whether this graph is undirected. We prove the more general result that the spread of any $n \times n$ non-negative matrix $A$ with $\|A\|_{\max} \le 1$ is at most $2n/\sqrt{3}$, which is tight up to an additive factor and exact when $n$ is a multiple of three. Furthermore, our results show that the matrix with maximum spread is always symmetric.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial and Gaussian Foundations of Rational Nth Root Approximations: Theorems and Conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14095v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an approach (the biroot method) for nth root approximation that yields closed-form rational functions with coefficients derived from binomial structures, Gaussian functions, or qualifying DAG structures. The method emerges from an analysis of Newton's method applied to root extraction, revealing that successive iterations generate coefficients following rows of Pascal's triangle in an alternating numerator-denominator pattern. After further exploration of these patterns, we formulate three main conjectures: (1) the Binomial Biroot Conjecture establishing the fundamental alternating coefficient structure to approximate nth roots (for which we prove the square root case and optimal parameter conditions), (2) the Gaussian Biroot Conjecture, and (3) the General DAG Biroot Conjecture showing a structural invariance to nth root approximation using arbitrary linearly-constructed directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Computational evidence demonstrates superior convergence properties when compared to Taylor series and Pad\'e approximations, especially considering the more direct and less computationally intensive approach to the biroot function construction. A computational framework has been developed to support systematic exploration of the biroot method's parameter space and to enable extensive numerical and symbolic analysis. The method provides both theoretical insights and computational significance by connecting combinatorial structures to nth root rational approximation theory.</description>

      <title>Dominating Hadwiger's Conjecture for graphs $G$ with $\alpha(G)=2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hadwiger's Conjecture from 1943 states that every graph with chromatic number $t$ contains a $K_t$ minor. Illingworth and Wood [arXiv:2405.14299] introduced the concept of a ``dominating $K_t$ minor'' and asked whether every graph with chromatic number $t$ contains a dominating $K_t$ minor. This question is a substantial strengthening of Hadwiger's Conjecture. Norin referred to it as the ``Dominating Hadwiger's Conjecture'' and believes it is likely false. In this paper we first observe that a $t$-chromatic $G$ on $n$ vertices with independence number $\alpha(G)\le2$ contains a dominating $K_t$ minor if and only if $G$ contains a dominating $K_{\lceil n/2\rceil}$ minor. Building on this and using a deep result of Chudnovsky and Seymour on packing seagulls, we prove that every graph $G$ on $n$ vertices with $\alpha(G)\le 2$ and $2\omega(G)\ge \lceil n/2\rceil+1$ satisfies the Dominating Hadwiger's Conjecture, where $\omega(G)$ denotes the clique number of $G$. We further prove that every $H$-free graph $G$ with $\alpha(G)\le 2$ satisfies the Dominating Hadwiger's Conjecture, where $H\in\{2K_1+P_4, K_2+2K_2, K_2+(K_1\cup K_3), K_1+(K_1\cup K_5), W_5^&lt;, W_5^-, W_5, K_7^&lt;, K_7^-, K_7\}$, or $H\ne K_2\cup K_3$ is any graph on at most five vertices such that $\alpha(H)\le2$.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous random 2-SAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an inhomogeneous variant of random 2-SAT. Each variable $v_1,\ldots,v_n$ is assigned a type from a state space $\Lambda$, independently at random. Clause inclusion is governed by a symmetric measurable kernel $W$ on $(\Lambda \times \{+,-\})^2$, in analogy with the inhomogeneous random graph model of Bollob\'as, Janson, and Riordan: given literals $\ell_i\in\{v_i,\neg v_i\}$ and $\ell_j\in\{v_j,\neg v_j\}$, the clause $\{\ell_i,\ell_j\}$ appears with probability $W(\mathrm{type}(\ell_i),\mathrm{type}(\ell_j))/(2n)$. In particular, for a variable $v_i$ of type $x\in\Lambda$, the slices $W((+,x),\cdot)$ and $W((-,x),\cdot)$ describe how $v_i$ and $\neg v_i$ interact with other literals.
  We identify a parameter $\rho^*(W)$, defined as the spectral radius of an integral operator derived from $W$, and show that $\rho^*(W)&lt;1$ and $\rho^*(W)&gt;1$ correspond to asymptotically almost surely satisfiable and unsatisfiable instances, respectively. The satisfiability threshold for homogeneous random 2-SAT is well-established, occurring when the ratio of clauses to variables is $1$. This corresponds to a weight function of $W \equiv 1$ and a clause density of $1/(2n)$. Our result extends this classical result to a broad class of models controlled by types of variables.</description>

Abstract: Using the semiformal method in combinatorics we generalize P\'olya's theorem. This theorem determines the limiting probability that walks in the grid graph $\mathbb{Z}^d$ visit the given vertex. We generalize it to the countable complete graph $K_{\mathbb{N}}$ with edge weights in $\mathbb{C}$. In part II we treat edge weights in $\mathbb{C}[[x_1,\dots,x_k]]$.</description>

Abstract: Every graph G can be embedded in a Euclidean space as a two-distance set. This allows us to reformulate the analogue of Borsuk's conjecture for two-distance sets in terms of graphs. This conjecture remains open for dimensions from 4 to 63. This short note also discusses an approach for finding counterexamples using graphs, as well as its generalization for s-distance sets.</description>

      <title>On the Anti-Ramsey Number Under Edge Deletion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: According to a study by Erd\H{o}s et al. in 1975, the anti-Ramsey number of a graph \(G\), denoted as \(AR(n, G)\), is defined as the maximum number of colors that can be used in an edge-coloring of the complete graph \(K_n\) without creating a rainbow copy of \(G\). In this paper, we investigate the anti-Ramsey number under edge deletion and demonstrate that both decreasing and unchanging are possible outcomes. For three non-negative integers \(k\), \(t\), and \(n\), let \(G = kP_4 \cup tP_2\). Let \(E'\) be a subset of the edge set \(E(G)\) such that every endpoint of these edges has a degree of two in \(G\). We prove that if one of the conditions (i) \(t \geq k + 1 \geq 2\) and \(n \geq 8k + 2t - 4\); (ii) \(k, t \geq 1\) and \(n = 4k + 2t\); (iii) \(k = 1\), \(t \geq 1\), and \(n \geq 2t + 4\), occurs then the behavior of the anti-Ramsey number remains consistent when the edges in \(E'\) are removed from \(G\), i.e., \(AR(n, G) = AR(n, G - E')\). However, this is not the case when \(k \geq 2\), \(t = 0\), and \(n=4k\). As a result, we calculate \(AR(kP_4 \cup tP_2)\) for the cases: (i) \(t \geq k + 1 \geq 2\) and \(n \geq 8k + 2t - 4\); (ii) \(k, t \geq 1\) and \(n = 4k + 2t\); (iii) \(k = 1\), \(t \geq 0\), and \(n \geq 2t + 4\); (iv) \(k \geq 1\), \(t = 0\), and \(n = 4k\).</description>

      <title>Polynomial extensions of Raimi's theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Raimi's theorem guarantees the existence of a partition of $\mathbb{N}$ into two parts with an unavoidable intersection property: for any finite coloring of $\mathbb{N}$, some color class intersects both parts infinitely many times, after an appropriate shift (translation). We establish a polynomial extension of this result, proving that such intersections persist under polynomial shifts in any dimension. Given non-constant polynomials $P^{(1)},\dots,P^{(f)}\in\mathbb{Z}[x]$ with positive leading coefficients and $P^{(j)}(0)=0$, we construct a partition of $\mathbb{N}^k$ such that for any coloring of $\mathbb{N}^k$ with finitely many colors, there exist $x_0\in \mathbb{N}$ and a single color class that meets all partition pieces after shifts by $x_0+P^{(j)}(h)$ in each of the $k$ coordinate directions, for every $j$ and infinitely many values $h\in \mathbb{N}$. Our proof exploits Weyl's equidistribution theory, Pontryagin duality, and the structure of polynomial relation lattices. We also prove some finite analogues of the above results for abelian groups and $SL_2(\mathbb{F}_q)$.</description>

      <title>Minimal simplicial spherical mappings with a given degree</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the minimal number of vertices $\lambda(n,d)$ required in a triangulation of the $n$-sphere to admit a simplicial map to the boundary of a $(n+1)$-simplex with a given degree $d$. We establish upper bounds for $\lambda(n,d)$ in dimensions $n \geq 3$ and introduce a new function $\alpha(n):=\limsup_{d \to \infty}{\frac{\lambda(n,d)}{d}}. $ Our main result establishes that it does not exceed $\frac{n+2}{n}$. Furthermore, we provide exact formulas for small values of $d$, showing that $\lambda(n,d)=n+d+3$ for $n \geq 3$ and $d=2,3,4$. A key technical result is the identity $\lambda(n,d) = \lambda(d-1,d) + n - d + 1$ for $n \geq d$, which allows us to reduce higher-dimensional cases to lower-dimensional ones. The proofs involve constructive methods based on local modifications of triangulations and combinatorial arguments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.16769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider any fixed $d\in\mathbb{Z}_{&gt;0}$ number of second class particles in the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP), constructed via a basic coupling of two ASEPs. We give the joint distribution of the positions of the second class particles and also the probability of there being a second class particle at a given site, under the natural blocking measure for ASEP. In order to find these distributions we use results about the number of particles in half-infinite and finite site ranges of ASEP. Our investigations also lead to probabilistic proofs of well-known combinatorial identities; the Durfee rectangles identity, Euler's identity, and the $q$-Binomial Theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17224v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new combinatorial structure of linked tableaux, which generalize the semi-standard tableaux that index a SAGBI basis of the Pl\"ucker coordinate ring of a flag variety. We show that linked tableaux index Domokos-Zubkov semi-invariants, which span the semi-invariant ring of a quiver. The semi-invariant ring of a quiver coincides in many cases with the Cox ring of an associated quiver moduli space. We show that these semi-invariants satisfy straightening laws. In the case of the generalized Kronecker quiver, we prove that the semi-invariants associated to semi-standard linked tableaux are a (possibly infinite) SAGBI basis. For the generalized Kronecker quiver with dimension vector (2,2), we show that the SAGBI basis is finite and describe it explicitly.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics for $t$-Core Partitions and Stanton's Conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A partition is a $t$-core partition if $t$ is not one of its hook lengths. Let $c_t(N)$ be the number of $t$-core partitions of $N$. In 1999, Stanton conjectured $c_t(N) \le c_{t+1}(N)$ if $4 \le t \ne N-1$. This was proved for $t$ fixed and $N$ sufficiently large by Anderson, and for small values of $t$ by Kim and Rouse. In this paper, we prove Stanton's conjecture in general. Our approach is to find a saddle point asymptotic formula for $c_t(N)$, valid in all ranges of $t$ and $N$. This includes the known asymptotic formulas for $c_t(N)$ as special cases, and shows that the behavior of $c_t(N)$ depends on how $t^2$ compares in size to $N$. For example, our formula implies that if $t^2 = \kappa N + o(t)$, then $c_t(N) = \frac{\exp\left(2\pi\sqrt{A N}\right)}{B N} (1 + o(1))$ for suitable constants $A$ and $B$ defined in terms of $\kappa$.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Clustering and Degree Index in Random Graphs and Complex Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to analyze the degree index and clustering index in random graphs. The degree index in our setup is a certain measure of degree irregularity whose basic properties are well studied in the literature, and the corresponding theoretical analysis in a random graph setup turns out to be tractable. On the other hand, the clustering index, based on a similar reasoning, is first introduced in this manuscript. Computing exact expressions for the expected clustering index turns out to be more challenging even in the case of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs, and our results are on obtaining relevant upper bounds. These are also complemented with observations based on Monte Carlo simulations. Besides the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi case, we also do simulation-based analysis for random regular graphs, the Barab\'asi-Albert model and the Watts-Strogatz model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13070v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Starting from context-free inverse graphs, we introduce a new class of groups and study their structural properties. We establish closure properties, show that their co-word problems are context-free, analyze torsion elements, and realize them as subgroups of the asynchronous rational group. Context-freeness is preserved under a generalized free product of graphs, and using this construction we provide examples of groups that are not residually finite or not poly-context-free, making them relevant for testing the Lehnert and Brough conjectures. Moreover, we investigate how small local modifications of a graph affect the global structure of the transition group, showing that for locally quasi-transitive graphs with infinite orbits, the transition group decomposes into a highly structured quotient by a bounded torsion subgroup, showing strong global constraints induced by local graph properties.</description>

      <title>Moderate-length lifted quantum Tanner codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce new families of quantum Tanner codes, a class of quantum codes that first appeared in the work of Leverrier and Z\'emor (FOCS 2022). These codes are built from two classical Tanner codes, for which the underlying graphs are extracted from coverings of 2D geometrical complexes, and the local linear codes are tensor-products of cyclic or double-circulant linear codes. The advantage of code lifting is that, for any lift of odd index $t$ of an $[[n,k,d]]$-code, we can adapt the study of the transfer homomorphism arising in cellular homology to describe symmetries of its logical operators and to establish that its dimension is lower bounded by $k$, and its distance is upper bounded by $t\cdot d$. Moreover, when the dimension of the lifted code is equal to $k$, its distance is lower bounded by $d$. These parameter bounds also apply to the previous methods of code lifting of Gu\'emard (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 2025). Finally, We present several explicit families, and identify instances of moderate length quantum codes which are degenerate, have low check weight, and whose distance surpasses the square root of the code length. Among them, we report the existence of a $[[96,2,12]]$-code whose distance growth saturates our bound, and for which half of the checks are of weight 8 and the other half of weight 4.</description>

      <title>Smallest Suffixient Sets as a Repetitiveness Measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05638v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A suffixient set is a novel combinatorial object that captures the essential information of repetitive strings in a way that, provided with a random access mechanism, supports various forms of pattern matching. In this paper, we study the size $\chi$ of the smallest suffixient set as a repetitiveness measure: we place it between known measures and study its sensitivity to various string operations. As a corollary of our results, we give simple online algorithms to compute smallest suffixient sets.</description>

      <title>A strengthened bound on the number of states required to characterize maximum parsimony distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09888v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we prove that the distance $d_{\mathrm{MP}}(T_1,T_2) = k$ between two unrooted binary phylogenetic trees $T_1, T_2$ on the same set of taxa can be defined by a character that is convex on one of $T_1, T_2$ and which has at most $2k$ states. This significantly improves upon the previous bound of $7k-5$ states. We also show that for every $k \geq 1$ there exist two trees $T_1, T_2$ with $d_{\mathrm{MP}}(T_1,T_2) = k$ such that at least $k+1$ states are necessary in any character that achieves this distance and which is convex on one of $T_1, T_2$. We augment these lower and upper bounds with an empirical analysis which shows that in practice significantly fewer than $k+1$ states are usually required.</description>

      <title>Notes on the cohomology of partial Hessenberg varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hessenberg varieties are a family of subvarieties of full flag varieties. This family contains well-known varieties such as Springer fibers, Peterson varieties, and permutohedral varieties. It was introduced by De Mari-Procesi-Shayman in 1992 and has been actively studied in this decade. In particular, unexpected relations to hyperplane arrangements and the Stanley-Stembridge conjecture in graph theory have been discovered. Hessenberg varieties can be defined in partial flag varieties. In this paper, we study their cohomology by relating them to the cohomology of Hessenberg varieties in the full flag varieties.</description>

      <title>Representation Theory of $0$-Schur Algebras and Related Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Jensen, Su, and Yang described the projective indecomposable modules of the $0$-Schur algebra $\mathbf{S}_0(n,r)$ using its geometric realization. In this paper, the simple modules of $\mathbf{S}_0(n,r)$ are identified by computing the tops of the projective indecomposable modules. Furthermore, functorial relations among the module categories $\mathbf{H}_r(0)$\textsf{-mod}, $\mathbf{S}_0(n,r)$\textsf{-mod}, and $U_0(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$\textsf{-mod} are examined, where $\mathbf{H}_r(0)$ denotes the $0$-Hecke algebra and $U_0(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$ denotes the degenerate quantum group.</description>

      <title>Inversions in Random Permutations Under the Ewens Sampling Distribution With and Without a Prescribed Number of Fixed Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the first part of the paper, we study the inversion statistic of random permutations under the family $(\mathbb{P}_\theta^{(n)})_{\theta \ge 0}$ of Ewens sampling distributions on $S_n$. We obtain a rather simple exact formula for the expected number of inversions under $\mathbb{P}_\theta^{(n)}$. In particular, we show that this expected number of inversions is decreasing in the tilting parameter $\theta$ for any $n$ and that it is convex in $\theta$ for $n \not \in \{3,4\}$ only. Furthermore, we derive an exact formula for the probability that a specific pair of indices $(i,j) \in \{1,\dots,n\}^2$ is inverted and show that this probability is decreasing in $\theta$ if and only if $|j-i| \ge 2$ holds. We also exhibit the asymptotic behavior of these quantities as $n \to \infty$ and $\theta \to \infty$.
  In the second part of our paper, we analyze the inversion statistic of random permutations under~$(\mathbb{P}_\theta^{(n)})_{\theta &gt; 0}$ conditioned on having a prescribed number of fixed points. Again, we obtain exact formulas for the expected number of inversions and for the probability that a specific pair of indices is inverted. Since, as expected, the resulting formulas are rather complicated, we focus on the asymptotic behavior of these quantities as $n \to \infty$, $\theta \to \infty$ and $\theta \to 0$.</description>

      <title>The Dual Burnside Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Burnside process is a classical Markov chain for sampling uniformly from group orbits. We introduce the dual Burnside process, obtained by interchanging the roles of group elements and states. This dual chain has stationary law $\pi(g)\propto |X_g|$, is reversible, and admits a matrix factorization $Q=AB$, $K=BA$ with the classical Burnside kernel $K$. As a consequence the two chains share all nonzero eigenvalues and have mixing times that differ by at most one step. We further establish universal Doeblin floors, orbit and conjugacy-class lumpings, and transfer principles between $Q$ and $K$. We analyze explicit examples: the value-permutation model $S_k$ acting on $[k]^n$ and the coordinate-permutation model $S_n$ acting on $[k]^n$. These results show that the dual chain provides both a conceptual mirror to the classical Burnside process and practical advantages for symmetry-aware Markov chain Monte Carlo.</description>
