      <title>Cancellation properties for exotic $4$-dimensional positive scalar curvature metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ruberman constructed families $\{g_n\vert n \in \mathbb{N}\} \subset \mathcal{R}^+ (M)$ of metrics of positive scalar curvature on certain $4$-manifolds which are concordant but lie in different path components of $\mathcal{R}^+ (M)$. We prove a cancellation result along the following lines. For each closed manifold $N$, there is a map $\nu_N: \mathcal{R}^+ (M) \to \mathcal{R}^+ (M \times N)$, well-defined up to homotopy, that takes the product with $N$. We prove that when $N$ has positive dimension $\nu_N$ takes all metrics of Ruberman's family to the same path component. This is trivial when $N$ has a psc metric and follows from pseudoisotopy theory when $\dim (N) \geq 3$. Our proof is cobordism theoretic in nature and also applies to $\dim(N) =1,2$. The proof relies on rigidity properties for the action of the diffeomorphism group on $\mathcal{R}^+(L)$ for high-dimensional $N$ and a calculation of $\pi_1(\mathrm{MTSO(4)})$ that we also carry out.
  Recently, Auckly and Ruberman exhibited examples of elements in higher homotopy groups of $\mathcal{R}^+(M^4)$ for certain $M$. Using the same method, we also prove that these elements lie in the kernel of the induced map $(\nu_N)_*$ on rational homotopy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We can view the Lipschitz constant as a height function on the space of maps between two manifolds and ask (as Gromov did nearly 30 years ago) what its ``Morse landscape'' looks like: are there high peaks, deep valleys and mountain passes? A simple and relatively well-studied version of this question: given two points in the same component (homotopic maps), does a path between them (a homotopy) have to pass through maps of much higher Lipschitz constant? Now we also consider similar questions for higher-dimensional cycles in the space. We make this precise using the language of persistent homology and give some first results.</description>

      <title>Cobordism Utopia: U-Dualities, Bordisms, and the Swampland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The U-dualities of maximally supersymmetric supergravity theories lead to celebrated non-perturbative constraints on the structure of quantum gravity. They can also lead to the presence of global symmetries since manifolds equipped with non-trivial duality bundles can carry topological charges captured by non-trivial elements of bordism groups. The recently proposed Swampland Cobordism Conjecture thus predicts the existence of new singular objects absent in the low-energy supergravity theory, which break these global symmetries.
  We investigate this expectation in two directions, involving the different choices of U-duality groups $G_U$, as well as $k$, the dimension of the closed manifold carrying the topological charge. First, we compute for all supergravity theories in dimension $3 \leq D \leq 11$ the bordism groups $\Omega_1^{\text{Spin}}(BG_U)$. Second, we treat in detail the case of $D = 8$, computing all relevant bordism groups $\Omega_k^{\text{Spin}}(BG_U)$ for $1 \leq k \leq 7$. In all cases, we identify corresponding string, M-, or F-theory backgrounds which implement the required U-duality defects. In particular, we find that in some cases there is no purely geometric background available which implements the required symmetry-breaking defect. This includes non-geometric twists as well as non-geometric strings and instantons.
  This computation involves several novel computations of the bordism groups for $G_U = \mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z}) \times \mathrm{SL}(3,\mathbb{Z})$, which localizes at primes $p=2,3$. Whereas an amalgamated product structure greatly simplifies the calculation of purely $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ bundles, this does not extend to $\mathrm{SL}(3,\mathbb{Z})$. Rather, we leverage the appearance of product / ring structures induced from cyclic subgroups of $G_U$ which naturally act on the relevant bordism groups.</description>

      <title>Maps between circle bundles: Fiber-preserving, Finiteness and Realization of mapping degree sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $E_i$ be an oriented circle bundle over a closed oriented aspherical $n$-manifold $M_i$ with Euler class $e_i\in H^2(M_i;\mathbb{Z})$, $i=1,2$. We prove the following:
  (i) If every finite-index subgroup of $\pi_1(M_2)$ has trivial center, then any non-zero degree map from $E_1$ to $E_2$ is homotopic to a fiber-preserving map.
  (ii) The mapping degree set of fiber-preserving maps from $E_1$ to $E_2$ is given by $$\{0\} \cup\{k\cdot \mathrm{deg}(f) \ | \, k\ne 0, \ f\colon M_1\to M_2 \, \text{with} \, \mathrm{deg}(f)\ne 0 \ \text{such that}\, f^\#(e_2)=ke_1\},$$ where $f^\# \colon H^2(M_2;\mathbb{Z})\to H^2(M_1;\mathbb{Z})$ is the induced homomorphism.
  As applications of (i) and (ii), we obtain the following results with respect to the finiteness and the realization problems for mapping degree sets:
  ($\mathcal F$) The mapping degree set $D(E_1, E_2)$ is finite if $M_2$ is hyperbolic and $e_2$ is not torsion.
  ($\mathcal R$) For any finite set $A$ of integers containing $0$ and each $n&gt;2$, $A$ is the mapping degree set $D(M,N)$ for some closed oriented $n$-manifolds $M$ and $N$.
  Items (i) and ($\mathcal F$) extend in all dimensions $\geq 3$ the previously known $3$-dimensional case (i.e., for maps between circle bundles over hyperbolic surfaces). Item ($\mathcal R$) gives a complete answer to the realization problem for finite sets (containing $0$) in any dimension, establishing in particular the previously unknown cases in dimensions $n= 4, 5$.</description>

      <title>Realizability of fusion systems by discrete groups: II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compare four different types of realizability for saturated fusion systems over discrete $p$-toral groups. For example, when $G$ is a locally finite group all of whose $p$-subgroups are artinian (hence discrete $p$-toral), we show that it has ``weakly Sylow'' $p$-subgroups and give explicit constructions of saturated fusion systems and associated linking systems associated to $G$. We also show that a fusion system over a discrete $p$-toral group $S$ is saturated if its set of morphisms is closed under a certain topology and the finite subgroups of $S$ satisfy the saturation axioms, and prove a version of the Cartan-Eilenberg stable elements theorem for locally finite groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.14063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, firstly, we will study the structure of the path complex $(\Omega_*(G;\Z),\partial)$ of a digraph $G$ via the $\Z$-generators of $\Omega_*(G,\Z)$ under strongly regular condition, which is called the minimal path in \cite{HY}. In particular, we will study various examples of the minimal $3$-paths. Secondly, we will show that the supporting sub-digraph of minimal path has acyclic path homologies. Thirdly, we will consider the applications of such an acyclic model.</description>

      <title>Pruning vineyards: updating barcodes and representative cycles by removing simplices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The barcode of a filtration and its representative cycles encode rich information often useful in data analysis. However, obtaining them can be computationally expensive. Therefore, it is useful to have methods that update them if the associated filtration undergoes small changes. There are already efficient algorithms updating a barcode if simplices exchange entrance order or are added, but not if simplices are removed. We provide an implementation to update a reduced boundary matrix when simplices in the filtration are removed. Our algorithm, the Simplicial Removal Update Procedure (SiRUP), intrinsically updates also the representative cycles, and is compatible with the twist optimizations. We show that the complexity of our algorithm is lower than recomputing the barcode from scratch and that the number of executed matrix column additions is minimal, with both theoretical and experimental methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The edge group of a simplicial complex is a well-known, combinatorial version of the fundamental group. It is a group associated to a simplicial complex that consists of equivalence classes of edge loops and that is isomorphic to the ordinary (topological) fundamental group of the spatial realization. We define a counterpart to the edge group that likewise gives a combinatorial version of the second (higher) homotopy group. Working entirely combinatorially, we show our group is an abelian group and also respects products. We show that our combinatorially defined group is isomorphic to the ordinary (topological) second homotopy group of the spatial realization.</description>

      <title>Non-Hausdorff manifolds over locally ordered spaces via sheaf theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Locally ordered spaces can be used as topological models of concurrent programs: in that setting, the local order models the irreversibility of time during execution. Under certain conditions, one can even work with locally ordered manifolds. In this paper, we build the universal euclidean local order over every locally ordered space; in categorical terms, the subcategory of euclidean local orders is coreflective in the category of locally ordered spaces. Then we give conditions to ensure that it preserves the execution traces of the corresponding program. Our construction is based on a well-known correspondance between sheaves on a space and \'etale bundles over this space. This is a far reaching generalization of a result about realizations of graph products. We particularize the construction to locally ordered realization of precubical sets, and show that it admits a purely combinatorial description. With the same proof techniques, we show that, unlike for the topological realization, there is a unique precubical set whose locally ordered realization is isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$.</description>

      <title>The sheaves--spectrum adjunction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.04069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper demystifies the notion of the smashing spectrum of a stable presentably symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category, defined as a locale whose opens correspond to smashing localizations. Previously, this concept was studied in tensor-triangular geometry in the compactly generated rigid setting. Our main result identifies the smashing spectrum functor as the right adjoint to the spectral sheaves functor, providing in particular an external characterization that avoids explicit reference to objects, ideals, or localizations. The sheaves--spectrum adjunction formalizes the intuition that the smashing spectrum constitutes the best approximation of a given $\infty$-category by $\infty$-categories of sheaves. We establish an unstable generalization of this result by identifying the correct unstable analog of the smashing spectrum, which parametrizes smashing colocalizations instead.
  As an application, we give a categorical presentation of Clausen--Scholze's categorified locales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In \cite{TY}, we investigate the pair $(P, \Supp(P))$ of minimal path $P$ and its supporting sub-digraph $\Supp(P)$ in the path complex of a digraph $G$ under the strongly regular condition. In this paper, first, we consider the special minimal path $P$ specified by the admissible condition (Definition \ref{admpair}), which means that $(P,\Supp(P))$ admits a singular cubical realization. Based on such a subset, we systematically introduce the definitions of cellular chain complex associated to $G$ and prove the well-definedness. Then we study several properties of such cellular homologies. Finally, we present several intriguing examples as well as some important observations.</description>

      <title>Orbital categories and weak indexing systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate the combinatorial study of the poset $\mathrm{wIndex}_{\mathcal{T}}$ of weak $\mathcal{T}$-indexing systems, consisting of composable collections of arities for $\mathcal{T}$-equivariant algebraic structures, where $\mathcal{T}$ is an orbital $\infty$-category, such as the orbit category of a finite group. In particular, we show that these are equivalent to weak $\mathcal{T}$-indexing categories and characterize various unitality conditions.
  Within this sits a natural generalization $\mathrm{Index}_{\mathcal{T}} \subset \mathrm{wIndex}_{\mathcal{T}}$ of Blumberg-Hill's indexing systems, consisting of arities for structures possessing binary operations and unit elements. We characterize the relationship between the posets of unital weak indexing systems and indexing systems, the latter remaining isomorphic to transfer systems on this level of generality. We use this to characterize the poset of unital $C_{p^n}$-weak indexing systems.</description>

Abstract: We develop foundations for abstract homotopy theory based on Grothendieck's idea of a "derivator". The theory is model-independent, and does not depend on model categories, nor on simplicial sets. It is designed to accomodate all the usual potential applications, such as e.g. enhancements for derived categories of coherent sheaves, in a way that is as close as possible to usual category theory.</description>
