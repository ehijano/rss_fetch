      <title>Large-Parameter Asymptotics of Generalized Hasting-McLeod Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generalized Hastings-McLeod solutions to the inhomogeneous Painlev\'{e}-II equation arise in multi-critical unitary random matrix ensembles, the chiral two-matrix model for rectangular matrices, non-intersecting squared Bessel paths, and non-intersecting Brownian motions on the circle. We establish the leading-order asymptotic behavior of the generalized Hastings-McLeod functions as the inhomogeneous parameter approaches infinity using the Deift-Zhou nonlinear steepest-descent method for Riemann-Hilbert problems. This analysis is done in both the pole-free region and pole region. The asymptotic formulae show excellent agreement with numerically computed solutions in both regions.</description>

      <title>Sharp spectral transition for embedded eigenvalues of perturbed periodic Dirac operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Dirac equation on $L^2(\mathbb{R})\oplus L^2(\mathbb{R})$
  \begin{align}
  Ly=
  \begin{pmatrix}
  0&amp;-1
  1&amp;0
  \end{pmatrix}
  \begin{pmatrix}
  y_1
  y_2
  \end{pmatrix}'+
  \begin{pmatrix}
  p&amp;q
  q&amp;-p
  \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}
  y_1
  y_2
  \end{pmatrix}+
  V\begin{pmatrix}
  y_1
  y_2
  \end{pmatrix}=\lambda y,\nonumber
  \end{align}
  where $y=y(x,\lambda)=\tbinom{y_1(x,\lambda)}{y_2(x,\lambda)}$, $p$ and $q$ are real $1$-periodic, and
  \begin{align}
  V=\begin{pmatrix}
  V(x)&amp;0
  0&amp;-V(x)
  \end{pmatrix}\nonumber
  \end{align}
  is the perturbation which satisfies $V(x)=o(1)$ as $\abs{x}\to\infty.$
  Under such perturbation, the essential spectrum of $L$ coincides with that there is no perturbation.
  We prove that if $V(x)=\frac{o(1)}{1+\abs{x}}$ as $x\to\infty$ or $x\to-\infty$, then there is no embedded eigenvalues (eigenvalues appear in the essential spectrum). For any given finite set inside of the essential spectrum which satisfies the non-resonance assumption, we construct smooth potentials with $V(x)=\frac{O(1)}{1+\abs{x}}$ as $\abs{x}\to\infty$ so that the set becomes embedded eigenvalues. For any given countable set inside of the essential spectrum which satisfies the non-resonance assumption, we construct smooth potentials with $V(x)&lt;\frac{\abs{h(x)}}{1+\abs{x}}$ as $\abs{x}\to\infty$ so that the set becomes embedded eigenvalues, where $h(x)$ is any given function with $\lim_{x\to\pm\infty}\abs{h(x)}=\infty.$</description>

      <title>Generalized Hydrodynamics for the Volterra lattice: Ballistic and nonballistic behavior of correlation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, a lot of effort has been put in describing the hydrodynamic behavior of integrable systems. In this paper, we describe such picture for the Volterra lattice. Specifically, we are able to explicitly compute the susceptibility matrix and the current-field correlation matrix in terms of the density of states of the Volterra lattice endowed with a Generalized Gibbs ensemble. Furthermore, we apply the theory of linear Generalized Hydrodynamics to describe the Euler scale behavior of the correlation functions. We anticipate that the solution to the Generalized Hydrodynamics equations develops shocks at $\xi_0=\frac{x}{t}$; so this linear approximation does not fully describe the behavior of correlation functions. Intrigued but this fact, we performed several numerical investigations which show that, exactly when the solution to the hydrodynamic equations develops shock, the correlation functions show an highly oscillatory behavior. In view of this empirical observation, we believe that at this point $\xi_0$ the diffusive contribution are not sub-leading corrections to the ballistic transport, but they are of the same order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2009.12582v4 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main purpose of the present paper is to lay the foundations of generalizing the AdS/CFT (holography) idea beyond the conformal setting. The main tool is to find suitable realizations of the bulk and boundary via group theory. We use all ten families of classical real semisimple Lie groups $G$ and Lie algebras $\cal G$. For this are used several group and algebra decompositions: the global Iwasawa decomposition and the local Bruhat and Sekiguchi-like decomposititions. The same analysis is applied to the exceptional real semisimple Lie algebras.</description>

Abstract: In the present paper we continue the project of systematic construction of invariant differential operators on the example of the non-compact exceptional Lie algebra $F"_4$ which is the split rank one form of the exceptional Lie algebra $F_4$. We classify the reducible Verma modules over $F_4$ which are compatible with this induction. Thus, we obtain the classification of the corresponding invariant differential operators.</description>

Abstract: In the present paper we continue the project of systematic construction of invariant differential operators on the example of the non-compact algebra $G_{2(2)}$. We use both the minimal and the maximal Heisenberg parabolic subalgebras. We give the main multiplets of indecomposable elementary representations. This includes the explicit parametrization of the invariant differential operators between the ERs. These are new results applicable in all cases when one would like to use $G_{2(2)}$ invariant differential operators.</description>

Abstract: Source identities are fundamental identities between multivariable special functions. We give a geometric derivation of rational and trigonometric source identities. We also give a systematic derivation and extension of various determinant representations for source functions which appeared in previous literature as well as introducing the elliptic version of the determinants, and obtain identities between determinants. We also show several symmetrization formulas for the rational version.</description>

      <title>A stable decoupled perfectly matched layer for the 3D wave equation using the nodal discontinuous Galerkin method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In outdoor acoustics, the calculations of sound propagating in air can be computationally heavy if the domain is chosen large enough to fulfil the Sommerfeld radiation condition. By strategically truncating the computational domain with a efficient boundary treatment, the computational cost is lowered. One commonly used boundary treatment is the perfectly matched layer (PML) that dampens outgoing waves without polluting the computed solution in the inner domain. The purpose of this study is to propose and assess a new perfectly matched layer formulation for the 3D acoustic wave equation, using the nodal discontinuous Galerkin finite element method. The formulation is based on an efficient PML formulation that can be decoupled to further increase the computational efficiency and guarantee stability without sacrificing accuracy. This decoupled PML formulation is demonstrated to be long-time stable and an optimization procedure of the damping functions is proposed to enhance the performance of the formulation.</description>

      <title>Abelian Group Quantum Error Correction in Kitaev's Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a detailed mathematical description of the error correction process for Kitaev's model for finite Abelian groups. The number of errors Kitaev's model can correct depends on the lattice and its topology. Although there is a theoretical maximum number of errors that can be corrected, we prove that correcting this number of errors, in general, is an NP-complete problem. Consequently, we introduce a polynomial-time correction algorithm that corrects a number of errors below the theoretical maximum.</description>

      <title>Quantum entropy couples matter with geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a theory for coupling matter fields with discrete geometry on higher-order networks, i.e. cell complexes. The key idea of the approach is to associate to a higher-order network the quantum entropy of its metric. Specifically we propose an action given by the quantum relative entropy between the metric of the higher-order network and the metric induced by the matter and gauge fields. The induced metric is defined in terms of the topological spinors and the discrete Dirac operators. The topological spinors, defined on nodes, edges and higher-dimensional cells, encode for the matter fields. The discrete Dirac operators act on topological spinors, and depend on the metric of the higher-order network as well as on the gauge fields via a discrete version of the minimal substitution. We derive the coupled dynamical equations for the metric, the matter and the gauge fields, providing an information theory principle to obtain the field theory equations in discrete curved space.</description>

      <title>Pickl's Proof of the Quantum Mean-Field Limit and Quantum Klimontovich Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.13373v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper discusses the mean-field limit for the quantum dynamics of $N$ identical bosons in $\mathbf R^3$ interacting via a binary potential with Coulomb type singularity. Our approach is based on the theory of quantum Klimontovich solutions defined in [F. Golse, T. Paul, Commun. Math. Phys. 369 (2019), 1021-1053]. Our first main result is a definition of the interaction nonlinearity in the equation governing the dynamics of quantum Klimontovich solutions for a class of interaction potentials slightly less general than those considered in [T. Kato, Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 70 (1951), 195-211]. Our second main result is a new operator inequality satisfied by the quantum Klimontovich solution in the case of an interaction potential with Coulomb type singularity. When evaluated on an initial bosonic pure state, this operator inequality reduces to a Gronwall inequality for a functional introduced in [P. Pickl, Lett. Math. Phys. 97 (2011), 151-164], resulting in a convergence rate estimate for the quantum mean-field limit leading to the time-dependent Hartree equation.</description>

      <title>The theory of screws derived from a module over the dual numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.09636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theory of screws clarifies many analogies between apparently unrelated notions in mechanics, including the duality between forces and angular velocities. It is known that the real 6-dimensional space of screws can be endowed with an operator E, E^2 = 0, that converts it into a rank 3 free module over the dual numbers. In this paper we prove the converse, namely, given a rank 3 free module over the dual numbers, endowed with orientation and a suitable scalar product (D-module geometry), we show that it is possible to define, in a canonical way, a Euclidean space so that each element of the module is represented by a screw vector field over it. The new approach has the effectiveness of motor calculus while being independent of any reduction point. It gives insights into the transference principle by showing that affine space geometry is basically vector space geometry over the dual numbers. The main results of screw theory are then recovered by using this point of view.</description>

Abstract: An integro-differential equation for the probability density of the generalized stochastic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with jump diffusion is considered. It is shown that for a certain ratio between the intensity of jumps and the speed of reversion, the fundamental solution can be found explicitly. The properties of this solution are investigated. The fundamental solution allows one to obtain explicit formulas for the densities at each moment of time.</description>

      <title>Coherent States for infinite homogeneous waveguide arrays: Cauchy coherent states for $E(2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.00872v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Perelomov coherent states for equally spaced, infinite homogeneous waveguide arrays with Euclidean E(2) symmetry are defined, and a new resolution of the identity is obtained. The key point to construct this novel resolution of the identity is the fact that coherent states satisfy the Helmholtz equation (in coherent states labels), and thus every coherent state belongs to a one-parameter family uniquely determined by the Cauchy initial data of the coherent state in a one-dimensional Cauchy set. For this reason we call \textit{Cauchy coherent} states to these initial data. The novel, non-local resolution of the identity in terms of Cauchy coherent states is provided using frame theory. It is also shown that Perelomov coherent states for the Eucliean E(2) group have a simple and natural physical realization in these waveguide arrays.</description>

Abstract: We investigate eigenvalue attraction for open quantum systems, biophysical systems, and for Parity-Time symmetric materials. To determine whether an eigenvalue and its complex conjugate of a real matrix attract, we derive expressions for the second derivative of eigenvalues, which is dependent upon contributions from inertial forces, attraction between an eigenvalue and its complex conjugate, as well as the force of the remaining eigenvalues in the spectrum.</description>

Abstract: Buryak and Shadrin conjectured a tautological relation on moduli spaces of curves $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$ which has the form $B^m_{g, \textbf{d}}=0$ for certain tautological classes $B^m_{g, \textbf{d}}$ where $m \geq 2, n \geq 1$ and $|\textbf{d}| \geq 2g+m-1$. In this paper we prove that this conjecture holds if it is true for the $m=2$ and $|\textbf{d}| = 2g+1$ case. This result reduces the proof of this conjecture to checking finitely many cases for each genus $g$. We will also prove this conjecture for the $g=1$ case.</description>

      <title>A Canonical Quantization of Poisson Manifolds: a 2-Groupoid Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We canonically quantize a Poisson manifold to a Lie 2-groupoid, complete with a quantization map, and show that it relates geometric and deformation quantization: the perturbative expansion in $\hbar$ of the (formal) convolution of two quantized functions yields Kontsevich's star product. Meanwhile, we can push forward this quantization map (by integrating over homotopies of paths) to obtain a quantization map in traditional geometric quantization. This gives a polarization-free, path integral definition of the quantization map, which does not have a prior prescription for Poisson manifolds and which only has a partial prescription for symplectic manifolds. We show that in conventional quantum mechanics our operators are defined on the entire prequantum Hilbert space and that they all preserve polarized sections, contrary to the Kostant-Souriau approach.</description>
