      <title>Detecting the full photoemission cone from laser-based ARPES experiments by leveraging deflector technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) provides a direct access to the electronic band structure of solid and molecular systems. The momentum range accessible by this technique depends directly on the photon energy used, and low-photon-energy sources are insufficient to photoemit electrons over the full Brillouin zone of most quantum materials. In addition, while electrons are emitted over a 2$\pi$ solid angle, conventional hemispherical analyzers only collect a small subset of those electrons. A previous work [RSI 92, 123907 (2021)] demonstrated that electrons emitted over a larger field-of-view can be acquired in one fixed configuration by accelerating them towards the analyzer with a bias voltage. Here, we extend this work by leveraging the deflector technology of novel ARPES hemispherical analyzers. We demonstrate the ability to detect all $2\pi$ photoemitted electrons in a fixed configuration for various materials such as gold, cuprates and transition-metal dichalcogenides. This approach is especially advantageous for time-resolved ARPES, as electron dynamics over a large momentum range can be accessed with identical measurement conditions.</description>

      <title>On-the-Fly Machine-Learned Force Fields for High-Fidelity Polymer Glass Transition Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting polymer glass transition temperatures (Tg) with first-principles fidelity has long remained out of reach, as cooling multi-thousand-atom systems over a broad temperature range at acceptable rates exceeds the computational limits of ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD). Here we employ a hybrid scheme that merges AIMD with accelerated on-the-fly (OTF) machine-learned force-field (MLFF) construction, enabling Tg prediction at quantum-mechanical accuracy with near-classical computational cost. The OTF protocol to construct MLFFs adaptively triggers first-principles calculations only when newly encountered configurations lie outside the current model's domain of confidence, allowing robust, parameter-free MLFFs to be built from merely 1000 AIMD-sampled configurations per polymer. These MLFFs are then utilized to perform long-time cooling simulations on amorphous supercells containing several thousand atoms. Applied across twelve polymers spanning aromatic, aliphatic, heteroatomic, and branched chemistries, the method yields predictions in excellent accord with experiment while reducing computational cost by approximately six orders of magnitude relative to AIMD. This work establishes a new paradigm for predictive polymer modeling, demonstrating that OTF-MLFFs provide a generalizable, accurate, and scalable route to simulating the thermophysical behavior of complex disordered materials at quantum-mechanical fidelity.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of Ferroelectric and Optical Properties in KNbO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Potassium niobate (KNbO3) is a prototypical perovskite ferroelectric with large electro-optic and nonlinear optical responses, high optical damage thresholds and a rich sequence of temperature-driven phase transformations, making it a promising platform for tunable photonic devices. In this work, we develop a thermodynamic model for the coupled ferroelectric and optical properties of KNbO3. By separating the total polarization into lattice and electronic contributions, the model provides a unified description of both the anisotropic ferroelectric and optical properties. The thermodynamic coefficients are determined by fitting to experimental measurements of the spontaneous polarization, dielectric susceptibilities, lattice parameters, and refractive indices. Without any further fitting, the model quantitatively predicts the temperature dependence of the electro-optic and piezoelectric coefficients in close agreement with experimental measurements. By utilizing the electronic polarization equation of motion, the model further captures the optical dispersion in the near infrared to visible spectrum. This work provides the thermodynamic foundation for future studies of coupled ferroelectric and optical phenomena in KNbO3.</description>

      <title>Discontinuous character of the ultrafast exciton Mott transition in monolayer WS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are conflicting predictions and reports on the character of the exciton Mott transition (EMT) in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides. It could be either a discontinuous or a continuous transition from the excitonic to the plasma phase, with important implications for devices such as photoswitches. To resolve the nature of the transition in monolayer WS$_2$, we study its ultrafast optical response upon resonant photoexcitation of the A exciton across a broad range of photoexcitation densities. In agreement with previously reported measurements we observe that the A exciton quenches gradually with increasing excitation density. However, a detailed lineshape analysis unveils an abrupt red shift in the transient peak positions of the A and B exciton resonances above an excitation density threshold. This is attributed to band gap renormalization arising from the formation of free charge carrier plasma, i.e., the EMT. The plasma phase decays with a time constant of 0.65 ps back into the excitonic state. The abrupt appearance of the plasma phase at the threshold density suggests that the EMT is a discontinuous and not a continuous transition. This work demonstrates how transient optical spectroscopy combined with lineshape analysis of two excitonic resonances simultaneously can be used to investigate the EMT in 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Materials design based on a material-motif network and heterogeneous graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning models for functional materials design require precise and informative representations of material systems. Common representations encode atomic composition and bonding but often do not include local coordination environments across chemically diverse crystals. Recurring structural motifs provide a motif level description of crystalline solids and can serve as interpretable descriptors for structure property learning. To analyze the motif connectivity in materials, we construct a bipartite material motif network from 131,548 Materials Project entries, with materials and motifs as the two node sets. Edges connect materials to their constituent motifs and are weighted by motif distortion, which quantifies the strength of each material motif association. Network connectivity is analyzed to identify motif-defined material clusters that capture recurring local geometries relevant to structure property trends. Most shared motifs act as hubs that connect otherwise disconnected regions of the network, enabling motif guided screening by expanding from known motifs to nearby materials in the same neighborhoods. A network embedding step converts this weighted connectivity into vector representations of materials. Using these motif informed embeddings, property prediction yields a formation energy mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.157 eV per atom and a bandgap MAE of 0.601 eV. These results indicate that motif connectivity provides a compact, interpretable representation that complements existing descriptors for scalable screening and structure property modeling.</description>

      <title>Minimal model for vortex nucleation and reversal in spherical magnetic nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic nanoparticles beyond the single-domain limit often develop vortex-like magnetization textures arising from the competition between exchange and magnetostatic energies. While such states are routinely studied using micromagnetic simulations, transparent analytical descriptions of vortex-mediated hysteresis and nucleation remain scarce. Here, we develop a semi-analytical minimal framework for vortex states in spherical magnetic nanoparticles. Guided by micromagnetic simulations, we introduce a parametrized vortex magnetization Ansatz based on hyperbolic functions that continuously interpolates between uniform and vortex states. In this way, we achieve a complexity reduction leading to a minimal Hamiltonian, which enables the efficient computation of magnetization curves and provides insight into vortex-mediated magnetization reversal. As an application, we derive analytical estimates for the critical vortex nucleation radius and field, recovering the functional form of Brown's classic result and extending it within a variational framework.</description>

      <title>Polarization Switching of Piezoelectric Films due to Proximity of Ferroelectric Nanoclusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire thermodynamical approach and finite element modelling, we studied the influence of nanoclusters shape on the polarization switching and domain nucleation emerging in otherwise non-switchable piezoelectric films due to the proximity of ferroelectric nanoclusters. The boundary of the ferroelectric nanocluster embedded in the piezoelectric film is a compositionally graded layer. We analyzed the conditions, which allow switching the electric polarization of the piezoelectric AlN film at coercive field significantly lower than the electric breakdown field due to the proximity of ferroelectric Al1-xScxN clusters. Due to proximity effect, the spontaneous polarization switches in all elements of the nanopatterned film, and corresponding coercive fields can be reduced significantly in the presence of spike-like Al1-xScxN clusters. We also explored the underlaying physical mechanisms of the proximity effects in the piezoelectric films with ferroelectric nanoclusters. The internal field, which is depolarizing inside the piezoelectric film (due to the larger spontaneous polarization of AlN) and polarizing in the ferroelectric cluster (due to the smaller spontaneous polarization of Al1-xScxN), lowers the potential barrier in the clusters and facilitates the instant growth of nanodomains (emerging in the clusters) through the piezoelectric film. Since considered nanostructured materials can be created by implantation of Sc ions into AlN films, obtained theoretical results can be useful for creation of nanopatterned ferroelectrics by chemical engineering, with exciting prospects for previously unrealizable ferroelectric memory technologies.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-protected topological polarons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emergent quasiparticles in solids often exhibit unique topological properties as a result of the complex interplay between charge, orbital, spin and lattice degrees of freedom. Among these quasiparticles, the polaron occupies a special place as the first known manifestation of the interaction between a fermion and a boson field. While polarons have been investigated for almost a century, whether these quasiparticles exhibit topological properties and why remain open questions. Here, we establish the universal symmetry principles governing the topology of polar textures in large polarons. Using a group-theoretic analysis, we identify four distinct classes of polar textures in time-reversal-invariant systems, and we show that they carry integer topological charges. We validate this classfication by performing state-of-the-art first-principles calculations of materials representative of each class. For these materials, we compute the fingerprints of polaron topology in Huang diffuse scattering, and propose ultrafast electron and X-ray scattering experiments to detect these quasiparticles.</description>

      <title>Assessment of the synthetic feasibility of hypothetical zeolite-like materials based on ZeoNet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A suite of classifiers was developed to distinguish real, experimentally realized zeolites from computationally predicted zeolite like structures. Using 3D convolutional neural networks applied to volumetric distance grids, these classifiers achieve accuracies more than an order of magnitude higher than previous approaches based on geometric filters or other machine learning methods. The best-performing model differentiates among hypothetical zeolites and those that can be synthesized as silicates, as aluminophosphates, or as both. This four-class classifier attains a false negative rate of 3.4% and a false positive rate of 0.4%, misidentifying only 1,207 of over 330,000 hypothetical structures -- even though the hypothetical structures exhibit similar formation energies as real zeolites and chemically reasonable bond lengths and angles. We hypothesize that the ZeoNet representation captures essential structural features correlated with synthetic feasibility. In the absence of comprehensive physics-based criteria for synthesizability, the small subset of misclassified hypothetical structures likely represents promising candidates for future experimental synthesis.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised clustering algorithm for efficient processing of 4D-STEM and 5D-STEM data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) enables mapping of diffraction information with nanometer-scale spatial resolution, offering detailed insight into local structure, orientation, and strain. However, as data dimensionality and sampling density increase, particularly for in situ scanning diffraction experiments (5D-STEM), robust segmentation of spatially coherent regions becomes essential for efficient and physically meaningful analysis. Here, we introduce a clustering framework that identifies crystallographically distinct domains from 4D-STEM datasets. By using local diffraction-pattern similarity as a metric, the method extracts closed contours delineating regions of coherent structural behavior. This approach produces cluster-averaged diffraction patterns that improve signal-to-noise and reduce data volume by orders of magnitude, enabling rapid and accurate orientation, phase, and strain mapping. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach to in situ liquid-cell 4D-STEM data of gold nanoparticle growth. Our method provides a scalable and generalizable route for spatially coherent segmentation, data compression, and quantitative structure-strain mapping across diverse 4D-STEM modalities. The full analysis code and example workflows are publicly available to support reproducibility and reuse.</description>

      <title>Predicting Interface Structure using the Minima Hopping Method with a Machine Learning Interatomic Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting atomic-scale interfacial structures remains a central challenge in materials science due to their structural complexity and the difficulty of direct comparison between computational and experimental results. In this study, we present an efficient approach for interface structure prediction that integrates the Minima Hopping Method (MHM) with the state-of-the-art machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP), Allegro. We demonstrate that the MHM-Allegro approach provides a robust and computationally efficient route for predicting interfacial structures in the benchmark system SrTiO3 Sigma 3 (112)[110] tilt grain boundaries (GBs), consistently identifying the lowest-energy configurations across different stoichiometries. Furthermore, we introduce a strategy for constructing defect-representative training datasets without explicitly including defective configurations, achieving excellent extrapolative performance in interface predictions. The predictive capability is further validated through direct comparison with experimental observations of the SrTiO3 Sigma 5 (310)[001] GB, where the predicted atomic configurations show strong agreement with experimental measurements. This work represents a significant step toward bridging the gap between ab initio predictions and experimentally observed interfacial structures.</description>

      <title>Catalog of phonon emergent particles and chiral phonons: Symmetry-based classification and materials database investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chirality and topology are fundamental and ubiquitous in nature. Symmetry has proven to be a powerful tool for predicting topological phonons. However, to date, topological phonon emergent particles (EMPs) have not been systematically cataloged in material databases. Moreover, traditional symmetry methods are often inadequate for predicting chiral phonons, because realistic calculations can yield negative results even when symmetry analysis permits phonon chirality. Here, we first establish a complete symmetry-based classification: given any space group and Wyckoff positions (WYPOs) occupied by atoms, the number of occurrences of all (co-)irreducible representations ((co-)irreps) (that can host EMPs) can be unambiguously known without omission prior to expensive and parameter-dependent calculation. Moreover, whether a phonon mode (belonging to one (co-)irrep) is chiral can also be determined from the occupied WYPOs. We then perform a materials database investigation identifying over 25 million EMPs at high-symmetry points and along high-symmetry lines and computing the concrete value of phonon angular momentum for each mode. We demonstrate two main applications: identifying ideal materials with surface chirality momentum locking and identifying materials with giant phonon magnetic moment. All computational data are compiled into a website: http://phonon.nju.edu.cn, which is expected to stimulate future studies on topological and chiral phonons.</description>

      <title>Resistive-Switching Dynamics in Poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) Thin Films under Perforated Bottom Electrode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect on the resistive switching (RS) mechanism in organic semiconductor (OSC), Poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT), due to the presence of the perforated bottom electrode (PBE) is investigated. The simulation shows a high local electric field at the edges of a patterned bottom electrode (BE), which can increase the probability of metal filament formation due to high current density, suggesting that the use of a PBE can assist the RS mechanism. RS involves switching from the high resistive state (HRS) to the low resistive state (LRS) known as the "SET" process at higher positive bias, and returning to HRS from LRS is known as the "RESET" process, which can be achieved at a negative bias. Various switching mechanisms are segregated from each other by the obtained current response to applied voltage. RS due to the formation of complete metal filaments between the top and bottom electrodes showed Ohm's law behaviour. On the other hand, a slope of approximately 2 in the log-log plot signifies that the space charge limited current (SCLC) dominates the device, and hence RS comes from incomplete metal filament formation or some changes in the P3HT polymer itself. Similarly, high current density can transform the molecular arrangement from crystalline to an amorphous state due to joule heating, which leads to an intermediate OFF state. The high current density joule heating RS are from HRS to LRS, which is opposite to the metal filament based RS, hence it is called an inverted RS. The optical images of the fresh device and after multiple cycles indicate the metal percolation inside the OSC responsible for the RS. EDX spectrum at LRS in a cross-sectional transmission electron microscope (TEM) confirms the top metal percolation through the OSC and touches the BE. Therefore, the metal filament formation is the fundamental reason for these observed switching behaviours in P3HT.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanostructured transition metal oxides (TMO) are extensively explored materials for non-enzymatic glucose sensors. TMOs such as Iron oxides( {\alpha}-Fe2O3, {\gamma}-Fe2O3, Fe3O4, etc.), NiO, CuO, Cr2O3, etc. have been utilized as electrocatalysts for glucose determination. Tremendous efforts have been put into identifying the impact of different morphologies of these materials on the glucose-sensing performance. The larger surface area of the flower and wire-shaped catalysts make them better performing amongst other morphologies. Interestingly, it is important to note that most of such studies are on standard Glassy Carbon electrodes. Further to enhance the Electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of the electrode, Carbon nanomaterials such as reduced Graphene Oxide (r-GO) and Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) are used as additives. Exfoliated Graphite paper electrodes offer better electrochemical characteristics than GCE electrodes due to their much larger ECSA. This study presents the non-enzymatic glucose sensing properties of NiO nanoflower-decorated Exfoliated Graphite electrodes. The amperometric detection of glucose shows a linear increase in current over a physiologically relevant wide range of 0-10 mM. The electrodes offer a better sensitivity of 304.12 microA per mM per cm square and a Limit Of Detection (LOD) of 100 microM. In addition, the electrodes showed high selectivity towards glucose in the presence of other interfering species such as Ascorbic acid, Fructose, Sucrose, and NaCl.</description>

      <title>Complex spin dynamics induced metamagnetic phase transitions in Dirac semimetal EuAuBi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a comprehensive investigation of the physical properties of the Dirac semimetal compound EuAuBi single crystals, using neutron diffraction, magnetization, electrical transport, and specific heat measurements. EuAuBi crystallizes in a hexagonal structure with space group P63mc (No. 186). First-principles calculations using density functional theory characterize it as a Dirac semimetal, with a notable band-crossing in proximity to the Fermi level (EF ) along the {\Gamma}-A direction. The crystal exhibits three distinct magnetic phases at 4 K (TN1), 3.5 K (TN2), and 2.8 K (TN3)as observed from magnetic and specific heat measurements. However, zero-field neutron diffraction resolves only two magnetic phases: a commensurate antiferromagnetic phase and a canted antiferromagnetic phase. Field-dependent ac and dc magnetization measurements uncover field-induced non-trivial spin textures in the magnetic field range 1.5 to 3 T, manifested as a tilted plateau in the magnetization curves. The interplay between conduction carriers and these spin textures is further evidenced by unique features in the magnetic field-dependent longitudinal resistivity in the system. Finally, we present a comprehensive magnetic phase diagram of EuAuBi, highlighting diverse spin alignments present in the material. EuAuBi thus emerges as a rare material system in which both momentum-space and real-space Berry curvature effects may coexist, providing a unique opportunity to investigate their interplay.</description>

      <title>Non-monotonic roughness evolution in film growth on weakly interacting substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin film deposition on weakly interacting substrates exhibits a unique growth mode characterized by initially strong island formation and rapidly increasing roughness, which reaches a maximum and subsequently decreases as the film returns to a smooth morphology. Here we show this rough-to-smooth growth mode experimentally for two molecular systems with substantially different geometries, namely, the effectively spherical buckminsterfullerene (C$_{60}$) and the disk-like 1,4,5,8,9,11-hexaazatriphenylenehexacarbonitrile (HATCN). This growth mode is explained by a geometrical model that captures the basic mechanisms of multilayer island growth, island coalescence, and formation of a continuous film. Additionally, kinetic Monte Carlo simulations with minimal ingredients demonstrate that this mode generally occurs for weakly interacting substrates, providing quantitative estimates of parameters that characterize adsorbate-adsorbate and adsorbate-substrate interactions. Both the model and simulations accurately describe the experimental data and highlight the generic nature of the phenomenon, independently of the details of the interactions and the molecular flux, which opens up a path for controlling nanoscale film roughness.</description>

      <title>Electrical and Structural Response of Nine-Atom-Wide Armchair Graphene Nanoribbon Transistors to Gamma Irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials and devices used in space and advanced energy systems are continuously exposed to high-energy photons and particles, leading to gradual changes in their structural and electronic properties. Gamma-ray exposure is particularly critical because their strong penetrating power allows them to traverse conventional shielding and device packaging. Real-time monitoring of exposure-induced changes in compact, chip-integrated devices remains limited despite the availability of external radiation detectors. Atomically precise graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) present an attractive platform for probing such effects due to their structural uniformity, tunable electronic properties, and exceptional sensitivity of charge transport to even subtle lattice modifications. Here, we investigate the structural and electronic response of atomically precise GNRs under gamma irradiation. Nine-atom-wide armchair GNRs (9-AGNRs) were synthesized via a bottom-up on-surface approach, integrated into field-effect transistors (FETs), and characterized before and after exposure using Raman spectroscopy and electrical transport measurements. Raman spectroscopy indicates preservation of the primary GNR lattice structure, accompanied by subtle spectral changes suggestive of irradiation-induced oxidation or local lattice perturbations. While these measurements do not indicate severe structural damage, electrical transport measurements reveal a pronounced degradation in device performance, demonstrating the strong susceptibility of GNRFETs to gamma-ray exposure. This pronounced response may be attributed to Anderson localization of charge carriers, potentially arising from enhanced quantum interference in atomically narrow, quasi-one-dimensional GNRs. These results highlight the potential of GNR-based nanoelectronic devices for sensing and monitoring under extreme operational conditions.</description>

      <title>Environmental Breakdown of Topological Interface States in Armchair Graphene Nanoribbon Heterostructures: Is it true?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the environmental stability of topological interface states (IFs) in two sandwich nanostructures, BNNR/AGNRH/BNNR and BNNR/AGNRH/NBNR, where AGNRH denotes an armchair graphene nanoribbon heterostructure and BNNR (NBNR) represents a boron nitride nanoribbon. The former corresponds to a same-topology configuration, whereas the latter realizes a reverse-topology configuration. Using a bulk boundary perturbation approach, we show that in BNNR/AGNRH/BNNR the IFs are destroyed by chirality breaking induced by symmetric BN environments at both interfaces. In contrast, the IFs in the reverse-topology structure remain robust against lateral interface interactions from BN atoms. Transport calculations further demonstrate that the surviving IFs in BNNR/AGNRH/NBNR exhibit the characteristic behavior of topological double quantum dots, with an enhanced interdot hopping strength compared with vacuum boundary conditions. These results reveal that BN environments can either suppress or reinforce topological interface states, depending critically on the topology of the surrounding nanoribbons.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a full 3D Method of Moments (MoM) simulation for analysis of scattering from nano-scale chiral ribbon structures under optical vortex illumination to aim to investigate electromagnetic mechanism of circular dichroism (CD) and optical vortex dichroism (VD). Both twist and helical nano-ribbons are modeled as dispersive materials scatterer. CD and VD are evaluated quantitatively by differences in scattering power. Numerical results demonstrate that angular momentum of optical light induces dichroic response effectively.</description>

      <title>An autonomous living database for perovskite photovoltaics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific discovery is severely bottlenecked by the inability of manual curation to keep pace with exponential publication rates. This creates a widening knowledge gap. This is especially stark in photovoltaics, where the leading database for perovskite solar cells has been stagnant since 2021 despite massive ongoing research output. Here, we resolve this challenge by establishing an autonomous, self-updating living database (PERLA). Our pipeline integrates large language models with physics-aware validation to extract complex device data from the continuous literature stream, achieving human-level precision (&gt;90%) and eliminating annotator variance. By employing this system on the previously inaccessible post-2021 literature, we uncover critical evolutionary trends hidden by data lag: the field has decisively shifted toward inverted architectures employing self-assembled monolayers and formamidinium-rich compositions, driving a clear trajectory of sustained voltage loss reduction. PERLA transforms static publications into dynamic knowledge resources that enable data-driven discovery to operate at the speed of publication.</description>

      <title>An AI-ready fine-tuning framework for accurate machine-learning interatomic potentials in solid-solid battery interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomistic modeling of solid-solid battery interfaces is essential for understanding electro-chemo-mechanical coupling, but the complex interfacial chemistry and heterogeneous environments pose major challenges for quantum-accurate, data-efficient modeling. Herein, we propose an approach of fine-tuning with integrated replay and efficiency (FIRE), a general framework for universal machine-learning interatomic potentials by combining efficient configurational sampling with a replay-argumented continual strategy, achieving quantum-level accuracy at moderate cost. Across six solid-solid battery interface systems, FIRE consistently achieves root-mean-square errors in energy below 1 meV/atom and in force near 20 meV/angstrom, marking an order-of-magnitude improvement over existing models while requiring only 10% of the original datasets. In addition, the fine-tuned model successfully reproduces key mechanical and electrochemical properties of the materials, in close agreement with experimental data. The FIRE offers a generalizable and data-efficient approach for developing accurate interatomic potentials across diverse materials, enabling predictive simulations beyond the reach of first-principles methods.</description>

      <title>Instability-driven mechanically locked states in functional oxide membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical instabilities in thin solids offer a powerful route to engineer nonlinear responses, yet their controlled use in functional crystalline oxides has remained largely unexplored. Notably, by changing the aspect ratio of solids, the energy landscape around equilibrium can be modified to induce non-linearities under lateral stresses through non-lateral deformations. These nonlinear systems can develop multiple local energy minima where the system can settle and switch between states through the application of a driving force. Crucially, recent advances in oxide thin film growth have enabled the fabrication of freestanding oxide membranes, paving a viable path for their use in bistable architecture, particularly at the nanoscale. Here, we demonstrate that freestanding oxide membranes, such as SrTiO3 (STO) and BaTiO3 (BTO), relax into well-defined metastable buckling states when transferred onto lithographically defined cavities. The membrane deformation is determined by the interplay between built-in residual strain, bending stiffness, and cavity geometry, resulting in reproducible bistable states with distinct strain distributions. Using a combination of atomic force microscopy, in-contact Kelvin probe measurements, and finite-element modelling, we reveal that these mechanically locked states directly shape the electromechanical potential landscape of ferroelectric BaTiO3. We further demonstrate reversible snapthrough transitions between mechanically degenerate states, establishing complex oxides as deterministic, geometry-tunable building blocks for nonlinear nanoelectromechanical architectures. Our results illustrate a general strategy for exploiting mechanical instabilities to encode and manipulate functional responses in ultrathin crystalline membranes.</description>

      <title>Crystal Representation in the Reciprocal Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In crystallography, a structure is typically represented by the arrangement of atoms in the direct space. Furthermore, space group symmetry and Wyckoff site notations are applied to characterize crystal structures with only a few variables. While this representation is effective for data records and human learning, it lacks one-to-one correspondence between the crystal structure and its representation. This is problematic for many applications, such as crystal structure determination, comparison, and more recently, generative model learning. To address this issue, we propose to represent crystals in a four-dimensional (4D) reciprocal space featured by their Cartesian coordinates and scattering factors, which can naturally handle translation invariance and space group symmetry with the help of structure factors. In order to achieve rotational invariance, the 4D coordinates are then transformed into a power spectrum representation under the orthogonal spherical harmonic and radial basis. Hence, this representation captures both periodicity and symmetry of the crystal structure while also providing a continuous representation of the atomic positions and cell parameters in the direct space. Its effectiveness is demonstrated by applying it to several crystal structure matching and reconstruction tasks.</description>

      <title>Thicker amorphous grain boundary complexions reduce plastic strain localization in nanocrystalline Cu-Zr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amorphous grain boundary complexions have been shown to increase the plasticity of nanocrystalline alloys as compared to ordered grain boundaries. Here, the effect of an important structural descriptor, amorphous complexion thickness, on the plasticity and failure modes of nanocrystalline Cu-Zr is studied with in-situ compression testing, with over 50 micropillars tested. Two model materials were created that differ only in their complexion thickness, with one having a thicker complexion population than the other. The sample with thinner complexions was more likely to experience non-uniform plastic deformation in the form of localized plastic flow or shear banding. In contrast, the sample with thicker complexions displayed more homogeneous plasticity and higher damage tolerance; thicker amorphous complexions suppress localization by absorbing defects. This work demonstrates that increasing complexion thickness can be beneficial for stable plastic flow in nanocrystalline alloys, by improving resistance to strain localization and premature failure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic-field-driven Lifshitz transitions are typically considered zero-temperature phenomena involving Fermi-surface reconstruction without symmetry breaking. Here, we report an unconventional Lifshitz transition in TaCo2Te2 that emerges exclusively within a narrow finite-temperature window under cooperative tuning by both temperature and magnetic field. Bulk-sensitive transport and thermoelectric measurements demonstrate continuous Fermi-surface renormalization at low temperatures, where the transition is sharply triggered by a critical magnetic field. Crucially, neutron diffraction reveals the absence of structural or magnetic phase transitions, while angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy shows no spectral anomalies in electronic structure without magnetic field. These observations constrain the mechanism to a Zeeman-driven process invisible to equilibrium probes, establishing a paradigm where Fermi-surface topology is jointly controlled by temperature and magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Functionalities of Au2O, Au2O3, Au2O3-x, and nanosheets, including spontaneous polarization, using DFT and hybrid functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We used density functional theories (DFT) to investigate the properties of Au2O and Au2O3-x (x = 00.08) to reveal their remarkable functionalities. Hybrid functional theories accurately estimate the band gap (Eg) of oxides, and the present hybrid functional calculations determined Eg values of 0.96 eV for Au2O and 2.86 eV for Au2O3, which is &gt;300% of the commonly accepted Eg of Au2O3 (0.85 eV). Moreover, we discovered spontaneous polarization (PS) in Au2O3, which is unusually large and advantageous for catalysis. The PS was retained even in 2-nm-thick Au2O3 nanosheets, similar to hyperferroelectric, generating a potential of 0.6 eV despite screening caused by surface reconstruction, which is a novel screening mechanism. Below a thickness of 0.8 nm, the PS vanished, and inversion symmetry emerged at 0.4 nm, suggesting a new approach to finding a paraelectric phase. Au2O was supersoft under shear distortion.</description>

      <title>Accurate semiempirical analytical formulas for spontaneous polarization by crystallographic parameters of SrTiO3-BaTiO3 system by ab initio calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spontaneous polarizations (PSs) of BaTiO3 and SrTiO3 under various conditions are calculated ab initio using different exchange-correlation functionals. The extensive theoretical sets of PS vs. ion positions are found to lie on a single curve, despite the chemical differences and the wide variations of PS and lattice parameters. This uncovers accurate simple analytical formulas of PS of SrTiO3-BaTiO3 system expressed by ion positions; a single formula predicts both macroscopic and atomic-scale PS of SrTiO3, BaTiO3 and SrTiO3-BaTiO alloys. The accuracy of the formula is demonstrated by the application to experiments, BaTiO3-SrTiO3 (-CaTiO3) alloys, Sr4Ti4O12 with PS // a-axis, a parallel domain, and a headon domain. In addition, the present results verify empirically that oxygen displacement is the primary identifier and the origin of PS of SrTiO3 and BaTiO3 and indicate that BaTiO3 and SrTiO3 may transforms into new state by an extremely large strain, e.g., -3%. Furthermore, the earlier prediction of headon domain without aid of defects was confirmed. The present procedures for finding formulas can be applied to other materials.</description>

      <title>Understanding Interface Stability in RENi2/Ni through First-Principles Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystallographic orientation analysis revealed that DyNi2 grew epitaxially on Ni, whereas NdNi2 does not. To elucidate the microscopic origin of this contrasting behavior, we constructed atomistic models of Ni/Rare-earth (RE)Ni2 interfaces with well-defined crystallographic alignment and performed first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT).
  The computed interfacial energies exhibit a clear correlation with lattice mismatch: larger mismatch leads to higher interfacial energy and reduced interface stability. Consequently, Ni/DyNi2 exhibits a significantly lower interfacial energy than Ni/NdNi2, consistent with experimental observations.
  A comparison between interfacial and strain energies for Ni/RENi2 (RE = Sc, Y, Nd, Gd, Dy, and Lu) reveals that the elemental dependence of interfacial stability is dominated by elastic strain rather than chemical bonding. Based on this insight, we developed a simple regression model using the absolute lattice mismatch as a descriptor, enabling qualitative predictions of stability for Ni/RENi2 interfaces with RE other than those examined in DFT.</description>

      <title>Effect of ballistic re-solution on the nucleation kinetics of precipitates in diluted binary alloys under irradiation. Part 1: Stoichiometric gamma' precipitates in Ni-Al alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A modification of classical nucleation theory is carried out as applied to solid solutions under irradiation, taking into account the influence of ballistic re-solution on the nucleation kinetics of pure unary (single-component) and stoichiometric binary precipitates. The effects of excessive point defects formed under steady irradiation conditions and operating alongside the ballistic re-solution mechanism are incorporated into the new model for a consistent description of the nucleation of incoherent and coherent particles. The developed model was applied to interpret the results of Nelson, Hudson and Mazey (NHM) tests, in which the stability of gamma' phase (Ni3Al) precipitates in diluted Ni-Al alloys under irradiation was studied.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On the base of a critical analysis of existing models for nucleation of new phase precipitates in metastable binary alloys, a new kinetic model of homogeneous nucleation and growth of alpha'-phase precipitates in Fe-Cr alloys was developed within the framework of the Reiss kinetic theory of binary nucleation. The model was further modified to account for the influence of ballistic re-solution on the kinetics of nucleation and growth of alpha' precipitates, following the general approach proposed in Part 1. The model was used for qualitative interpretation of the results of recent tests, in which the stability of alpha' precipitates in Fe-15Cr alloys under irradiation was studied.</description>

      <title>Unusual Dual Flat Bands and two-dimensional Dirac-node Arc State in Kagome Metal Ni3In2S2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kagome materials are at the frontier of condensed matter physics. An ideal kagome lattice features only one geometrically frustrated flat band spanning the entire momentum space and a single Dirac cone at the Brillouin-zone corners. However, for the first time, here we observe unusual flat-band and Dirac physics in the newly discovered "322" kagome material Ni3In2S2 by combining high-resolution synchrotron- and laser-based angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with a micro-focused beam, scanning tunneling microscopy, and first-principles calculations. We resolve two distinct electronic flat-band states located in close proximity to the Fermi level: a robust Topological Surface Flat Band at ~40 meV below the Fermi level on the Sulfur-terminated surface, originating from weak topological insulator states, and a kagome lattice-derived flat band at ~100 meV binding energy with an ultranarrow bandwidth (~5 meV). Instead of the single Dirac cone, the Indium-terminated surface hosts a rare two-dimensional Dirac-node arc state, where the gapless Dirac nodes extend along an open one-dimensional line crossing the Brillouin-zone boundary, exhibiting sharp linear dispersion, exceptionally high Fermi velocity, and pronounced circular dichroism. These findings establish Ni3In2S2 as a unique topological kagome metal in which multiple flat-band states of different physical origin coexist with an unusual Dirac-node arc, opening an avenue for discovering flat-band--driven and topology-enabled quantum phenomena.</description>

      <title>NuMagSANS: a GPU-accelerated open-source software package for the generic computation of nuclear and magnetic small-angle neutron scattering observables of complex systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present NuMagSANS, a GPU-accelerated software package for calculating nuclear and magnetic small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) cross sections and correlation functions. The program allows users to import position-dependent nuclear density and magnetization data, providing a large flexibility for analyzing the scattering signatures of complex systems, particularly magnetic materials. Full rotational control of the sample is supported, allowing a comprehensive exploration of angular-dependent scattering features. NuMagSANS includes a versatile library of approximately 100 response functions that encompass two-dimensional SANS cross sections, correlation functions, and azimuthally averaged quantities. These capabilities allow users to gain detailed insight into the structural and magnetic characteristics of their samples. GPU acceleration ensures rapid computations, even for large data sets, making NuMagSANS a powerful and efficient tool for advanced SANS analysis.</description>

      <title>First-principles study of bulk stacking, $J_{\rm eff}$ picture, magnetic Hamiltonian, $g$ factors, and structural distortions of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ is a candidate Kitaev material that exhibits zigzag antiferromagnetic ordering below 7 K. One contentious issue regarding this material is its bulk structure in the low-temperature phase. Recently, it has become generally accepted from experiments that the low- and high-temperature structures belong to the $R\bar{3}$ and $C2/m$ space groups, respectively. However, there was no theoretical study supporting the $R\bar{3}$-type structure as the low-temperature structure. In this study, we use constrained density functional theory to show that the $R\bar{3}$ structure is lower in energy than the $C2/m$ structure, in agreement with experimental observations. Then, we show that the conduction band minimum states are almost of the $J_\textrm{eff}=1/2$ and $m_\textrm{eff}=-1/2$ character, if we set the angular momentum quantization axis to be parallel to the N\'eel vector; this is the first analysis of the $J_\textrm{eff}$ picture for $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ from this perspective. In addition, we compute the anisotropic magnetic exchange parameters and $g$ factors of monolayer $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, thereby providing a comprehensive understanding of its magnetism. Our results demonstrate that both second-nearest-neighbor exchange interactions and magnetic moments not captured by the conventional atomic orbital projection method are necessary for accurate description of the magnetism in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. Moreover, the calculated $g$ factors are in fairly good agreement with experimental measurements, especially the small anisotropy between their in-plane and out-of-plane components. Finally, we examine the effects of structural distortions from a perfect RuCl$_6$ octahedron, already present in bulk $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ without any external perturbation, on the magnetic properties.

      <title>On-surface dehydrogenative lateral homo-coupling and aromatization of n-octane on Pt(111)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as normal alkanes, constitute a naturally abundant source of carbon atoms. Of special interest is the formation of cyclic and aromatic products from aliphatic reactants. Combining scanning tunneling microscopy and ab initio calculations, we investigate the thermal induced aromatization of linear n octane molecules on the catalytic Pt(111) surface and the reactions of intermolecular homocoupling between them at temperatures above 600 K. The cycloaromatization of individual n octane molecules requires bending the linear adsorbates prior to their dehydrogenation and the formation of an intramolecular C-C bond, yielding adsorbed benzene rings. In addition, the Pt(111) surface catalyzes a homocoupling reaction by initiating the formation of a C-C bond between the dehydrogenated methyl ends of the chemisorbed n octane molecules and then propagating along the carbon backbone in a zipper like fashion. Our findings provide molecular level insight into the heterogeneous catalytic processes underlying the generation of aromatic products and stable on surface polycyclic species.</description>

      <title>A New Layered Kagome Strip Structure Na2Co3(AsO4)2(OH)2: Static and Dynamic Magnetic Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-dimensional kagome strip chains share much of the same frustrated structural motif as two-dimensional kagome antiferromagnets, making them valuable for deepening our understanding of kagome lattice magnetism. In this paper, we report the hydrothermal synthesis and detailed structural and property characterization of Na2Co3(AsO4)2(OH)2, a striped kagome system. The crystal structure was characterized using single crystal X-ray diffraction, which reveals that Na2Co3(AsO4)2(OH)2 crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system C2/m. The structure features a one-dimensional kagome strip lattice built from Co2+ ions and undergoes an antiferromagnetic transition at TN = 14 K. The magnetic ground state at zero field was characterized using neutron powder diffraction. Below the magnetic transition, Na2Co3(AsO4)2(OH)2 orders into an antiferromagnetic structure with a k-vector (0.5, 0.5, 0.5). In the proposed model, the Co1 moment is predominantly confined to the ac-plane while the Co2 moment is primarily aligned along the b-axis. Two flat bands were observed in the inelastic neutron spectra below the magnetic transition at 5 and 10 meV. Inelastic neutron spectra were modeled with a Heisenberg Hamiltonian including three nearest-neighbor exchange interactions (J1, J2, J3) and strong single-ion anisotropy to stabilize the observed magnetic structure. Our study highlights the complexity of the Co2+-based kagome strip magnetic lattice compound Na2Co3(AsO4)2(OH)2, which provides an excellent platform to broaden our understanding of the frustrated kagome magnetic lattice space.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in non-centrosymmetric rhombohedral NbSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crystal stacking offers a powerful yet underexplored route to engineer symmetry in layered superconductors. Here we report superconductivity in rhombohedral-stacked NbSe2 (3R-NbSe2), a non-centrosymmetric polytype in which global inversion symmetry is removed by stacking alone. Using comprehensive structural, transport, magnetic, and thermodynamic measurements, we establish superconductivity as a bulk property of the 3R phase and find that the in-plane upper critical field exceeds the Pauli paramagnetic limit, indicating the persistence of strong Ising-type spin-orbit coupling. Unlike the thickness-dependent superconductivity in centrosymmetric 2H-NbSe2, the superconducting transition temperature in 3R-NbSe2 shows little dependence on layer number but exhibits an unusually strong sensitivity to disorder. We further observe strongly enhanced nonlinear optical and electrical responses near the superconducting transition, consistent with stacking-induced inversion-symmetry breaking. Our results identify 3R-NbSe2 as a single-phase platform in which stacking engineering reshapes superconductivity and enables nonlinear transport phenomena in layered materials.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Surface Chemistry of irreversible reduction of iron oxides through the Time-Resolved APXPS and Chemometrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a study on the application of Time-Resolved Ambient Pressure X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (TR-APXPS) in association with chemometric techniques, specifically Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Multivariate Curve Resolution with Alternating Least Squares (MCR-ALS), to investigate the surface chemistry and dynamics of Fe2O3 reduction processes. The use of TR-APXPS allows for real-time monitoring of chemical changes at the surface of Iron oxides during reduction, providing valuable insights into the reaction mechanisms and kinetics involved. One key challenge in analyzing TR-APXPS data is the presence of overlapping peaks and complex spectral features, which can make accurate quantification and interpretation difficult. Traditional spectral fitting methods may struggle with these complexities and result in ambiguous or inaccurate results. However, the chemometric approaches are promising tools to overcome these challenges by extracting pure spectral profiles of individual chemical species and their temporal profiles from the complex and overlapping data. The results obtained from the TR-APXPS coupled with PCA and MCR-ALS analysis provide a detailed and precise understanding of the surface chemical changes during the Fe2O3 reduction. This includes identifying and following the formation of various intermediate species and their evolution over time, which permits later to establish correlations between surface chemistry and process conditions. The integration of both chemometric tools in TR-APXPS data analysis not only addresses the challenges associated with complex spectral features, but also contributes to a deeper understanding of the underlying chemical changes and their dynamics. The obtained results have significant implications for process optimization, material synthesis, and tailoring of material properties for specific applications.</description>

      <title>A Local Structural Basis to Resolve Amorphous Ices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phases with distinct thermodynamic properties must differ in their underlying distributions of microscopic structures. While ordered phases are readily distinguished by unit cells and space groups, the local structural basis differentiating amorphous phases is less apparent. Here, using a new probabilistic data-driven framework applied to molecular simulation data on water, we identify local collective variables that discriminate low-density and high-density amorphous (LDA and HDA) ices and characterize pressure-induced transitions between these phases. As expected, descriptors related to local density capably distinguish LDA and HDA; however, phase identity is surprisingly encoded within the first coordination shell. Furthermore, LDA transitions to HDA by a simple redistribution of LDA- and HDA-like environments with no evident intermediate structures, in accordance with a first-order-like transition that contrasts with the gradual evolution observed in other amorphous systems such as metallic glasses. These findings are robust across force fields, which themselves exhibit structural differences, and exemplify how other systems lacking obvious distinguishing features can be characterized.</description>

      <title>In-situ On-demand Digital Image Correlation: A New Data-rich Characterization Paradigm for Deformation and Damage Development in Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital image correlation (DIC) has become one of the most popular methods for deformation characterization in experimental mechanics. DIC is based on optical images taken during experimentation and post-test image processing. Its advantages include the capability to capture full-field deformation in a non-contact manner, the robustness in characterizing excessive deformation induced by events such as yielding and cracking, and the versatility to integrate optical cameras with a variety of open-source and commercial codes. In this paper, we developed a new paradigm of DIC analysis by integrating camera control into the DIC process flow. The essential idea is to dynamically increase the camera imaging frame rate with excessive deformation or deformation rate, while maintaining a relatively low imaging frame rate with small and slow deformation. We refer to this new DIC paradigm as in-situ on-demand (ISOD) DIC. ISOD DIC enables real-time deformation analysis, visualization, and closed-loop camera control. ISOD DIC has captured approximately 178% more images than conventional DIC for samples undergoing crack growth due to its dynamically adjusted frame rate, with the potential to significantly enhance data richness for damage inspection without consuming excessive storage space and analysis time, thereby benefiting the characterization of intrinsic constitutive behaviors and damage mechanisms</description>

      <title>Effect of Spin-Texture Dynamics on Three-Dimensional Orbital Dirac Semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the minimal coupling of a Dirac semimetal Hamiltonian to a generic spin-texture in this work. A simple unitary transformation gauges away the spatial dependence in the exchange term, leading to the generation of effective corrections to the Dirac dispersion. A full function's worth of freedom is obtained as a result. Choosing different pitch vectors, we show that many forms of novel phenomena arise in such systems. For example, a linear pitch vector leads to the generation of type-I Weyl semimetal -- we observe the anomalous Hall effect and the chiral magnetic effect. The anomalous Hall coefficient requires a non-zero pitch vector whereas the CME is proportional to the exchange coupling. The band structure of the model in the presence of a magnetic field shows a Lifshitz transition. The introduction of a suitable time dependent pitch vector leads to the formation of nodal spheres in the Sambe space of effective Hamiltonians. This nodal sphere is robust to all orders in van-Vleck perturbation theory as proven explicitly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the first experimental realization of multi-material dielectric mirror coatings designed through a multi-objective optimization algorithm to simultaneously minimize thermal noise and optical losses. We validate this design strategy by fabricating and characterizing two distinct ternary systems: a SiNx -based proof-of-concept and a Ti:GeO2 -based system targeting lower optical losses. The performance of the SiN x coating shows remarkable agreement with predictions, demonstrating a noise amplitude spectral density reduction of 0.82 with respect to current reference coatings, and validating our design-to-fabrication pipeline. The Ti:GeO2 -based system achieves the crucial goal of sub-ppm absorption; its measured thermal noise, however, is higher than the theoretically predicted level of 0.71, extrapolated from single-layer material characterization. A dedicated tolerance analysis confirms that this discrepancy is not attributable to random thickness errors, emphasizing that further studies of the manufacturing process are needed to fully exploit this combination of materials. This work establishes a robust methodology for producing complex, high-performance optical coatings tailored for precision experiments.</description>

      <title>Colour Centre Formation in Silicon-On-Insulator for On-Chip Photonic Integration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Colour centres in silicon have great potential as single photon sources for quantum technologies. Some of them - like the T centre - also possess optically-active spins that enable spin-photon interfaces for generating entangled photons and multi-spin registers. This paper explores the generation of several types of colour centres in silicon for mass-manufacturable silicon-on-insulator quantum devices. We investigate how different processes in the device development affect the presence of the quantum emitters, including thermal annealing and fabrication steps for optical nanostructures. The study reveals coupled formation dynamics between different colour centres, identifies optimal parameters for annealing processes, and reports on the sensitivity to annealing duration and nanofabrication procedures for photonic integrated circuits. Furthermore, we discern stable optical signals from colour centres in silicon which have not been identified before.</description>

      <title>Large temperature-up-jump simulations of a binary Lennard-Jones system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents simulations of the physical aging of a binary Kob-Andersen-type Lennard-Jones liquid following large temperature up-jumps from equilibrated states of high relaxation time. The purpose is to investigate how well the Tool-Narayanaswamy (TN) material-time concept works for this rather extreme case of aging. First the triangular relation of the potential energy is studied. This is found to be well obeyed, making it possible to define a potential-energy-based material time $\xi$. We proceed to study aging toward equilibrium at the final temperature 0.48 for jumps from the temperatures 0.43 and 0.37, monitoring the following five quantities: the potential energy, the self-intermediate scattering function, the mean-square displacement, the dynamic susceptibility $\chi_4$, and the non-Gaussian parameter $\alpha_2$. The TN material-time prediction is that all time-autocorrelation functions should collapse to only depend on the material-time difference $\xi_2-\xi_1$. This is found to work much better for the $0.43\to 0.48$ temperature jump than for the $0.37\to 0.48$ jump. Our findings thus confirm the general understanding that the TN aging formalism works best for systems that are never very far from equilibrium. This raises two questions for future work: Is the collapse significantly improved if each aging quantity is allowed its own material time? Can better collapse be obtained if the material-time is generalized to be defined locally in order to reflect dynamic heterogeneity?</description>

      <title>Multimodal Machine Learning for Soft High-k Elastomers under Data Scarcity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dielectric materials are critical building blocks for modern electronics such as sensors, actuators, and transistors. With the rapid recent advance in soft and stretchable electronics for emerging human- and robot-interfacing applications, there is a surging need for high-performance dielectric elastomers. However, it remains a grand challenge to develop soft elastomers that simultaneously possess high dielectric constants (k, related to energy storage capacity) and low Young's moduli (E, related to mechanical flexibility). While some new elastomer designs have been reported in individual (mostly one-off) studies, almost no structured dataset is currently available for dielectric elastomers that systematically encompasses their molecular sequence, dielectric, and mechanical properties. Within this context, we curate a compact, high-quality dataset of acrylate-based dielectric elastomers, one of the most widely explored elastomer backbones due to its versatile chemistry and molecular design flexibility, by screening and aggregating experimental results from the literature over the past 10 years. Building on this dataset, we propose a multimodal learning framework that leverages large-scale pretrained polymer representations from graph- and sequence-based encoders. These pretrained embeddings transfer rich chemical and structural knowledge from vast polymer corpora, enabling accurate few-shot prediction of both dielectric and mechanical properties from molecular sequences. Our results represent a new paradigm for transferring knowledge from pretrained multimodal models to overcome severe data scarcity, which can be readily translated to other polymer backbones (e.g., silicones, urethanes) and thus accelerate data-efficient discovery of soft high-k dielectric elastomers. Our source code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/HySonLab/Polymers</description>

      <title>Pulse-driven photonic transitions and nonreciprocity in space-time modulated metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-varying photonic systems open new possibilities for controlling light, enabling photonic time crystals, time reflection and refraction, frequency conversion, synthetic gauge fields, optical nonreciprocity, among others. These effects emerge from the dynamic modulation of optical properties, which can mediate photonic transitions between eigenstates of different frequencies and/or wavevectors. To achieve such transitions, conventional approaches rely on periodic modulation schemes that demand ultrafast modulation rates and continuous energy input, posing significant practical challenges at optical frequencies. Here, we demonstrate that periodic-modulation-driven photonic transitions within the radiation continuum can be effectively mimicked using a single-period ultrafast pulse modulation, eliminating the need for sustained continuous modulation. By leveraging dispersion engineering in metasurfaces to tailor the density of states in the radiation continuum, we achieve controlled frequency transitions and theoretically demonstrate strong nonreciprocity for free-space waves as a key application. Our findings may guide future experimental research on time-varying photonics using materials such as transparent conductive oxides and semiconductors, expanding the possibilities for ultrafast and reconfigurable optical technologies. More broadly, our work may establish a practical and energy-efficient framework for dynamic photonic systems, with potential applications ranging from spatio-temporal wavefront manipulation to photonic computing and ultrafast signal processing.</description>

      <title>Programming Nonlinear Interfacial Mechanics of Synthetic Cells: Lipid Geometry and DNA Nanostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soft interfaces formed by lipid membranes are fundamental to living cells, synthetic cells, and membrane-based soft materials. However, a quantitative framework linking molecular organization with nonlinear interfacial mechanics remains elusive. Here, we establish an analytical framework that captures the nonlinear elastic response of lipid-membrane-coated synthetic cells under micropipette aspiration. Incorporating both area stretching and curvature bending enables the model to quantitatively reproduce the complete pressure-displacement response within the small-deformation regime. This approach reduces interfacial mechanics to two parameters: the in-plane area-stretching modulus and an out-of-plane bending-related term.
  Using this unified framework, we experimentally demonstrate that nonlinear interfacial mechanics can be programmed by altering the molecular geometry and effective dimensionality of adsorbed elements. The lipid molecular shape and curvature-dependent packing regulate in-plane stiffness, while DNA nanostructures, the other adsorbed element, introduce an orthogonal control axis via dimensionality: isolated motifs primarily enhance area stretching, whereas three-dimensional network architectures markedly reinforce bending resistance. Together, these results establish a general molecular design principle for programming interfacial mechanics and provide a quantitative foundation for engineering mechanically tunable synthetic cells and soft interfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type-II superconductors under magnetic fields are in a quantum coherent non-dissipative state as long as vortices remain pinned. Dissipation appears when vortices depin, eventually driven by thermal fluctuations. This can be associated to a melting transition between a vortex solid and a vortex liquid. This transition is almost always observed very close to T$_c$ when probed by macroscopic experiments. However, it remains unclear how the vortex solid responds to thermal fluctuations at the scale of individual vortices far from the melting transition. Here we use scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to visualize vortices in CaKAs$_4$Fe$_4$ (T$_c \approx$ 35 K). We find vortex liquid droplets-localized regions in space where vortices strongly fluctuate due to thermal exctiation-at temperatures as low as 0.5\,T$_c$. Our results show that the onset of dissipation at the local scale occurs at temperatures considerably below T$_c$ in type-II superconductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The physics of phase transitions in low-dimensional systems has long been a subject of significant research interest. Long-range magnetic order in the strict two-dimensional limit, whose discovery circumvented the Mermin-Wagner theorem, has rapidly emerged as a research focus. However, the demonstration of a non-trivial topological spin textures in two-dimensional limit has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate the out-of-plane electric field breaks inversion symmetry while simultaneously modulating the electronic band structure, enabling electrically tunable spin-orbit interaction for creation and manipulation of topological spin textures in monolayer CrI3. The realization of ideal two-dimensional topological spin textures may offer not only an experimental testbed for probing the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless mechanism, but also potential insights into unresolved quantum phenomena including superconductivity and superfluidity. Moreover, voltage-controlled spin-orbit interaction offers a novel pathway to engineer two-dimensional spin textures with tailored symmetries and topologies, while opening avenues for skyrmion-based next-generation information technologies.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous epicuticular charging affects droplet dynamics on living leaves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How water droplets move and slide on leaves influences plant ecophysiological and abiotic interactions, as well as the design of advanced bio-inspired wetting materials. Despite cross-disciplinary relevance, current descriptions of the in situ dynamics of droplets on living leaves focus almost exclusively on surface structure and chemistry, treating the leaf as a static, electrically neutral substrate. Here, three decades after the mechanistic discovery of the Lotus effect, we show that a yet 'hidden' force due to instantaneous electrical phenomena affect the dynamic droplet motion on living leaves. Using high-speed motion tracking and precision charge measurements, we show that droplets sliding on the pristine epicuticular wax layer on superhydrophobic Colocasia esculenta leaves strongly charge affecting its dynamics, previously observed only on synthetic (highly electronegative fluorinated) surfaces. Droplets accumulate charges of Qp,D1 = -0.02 to -0.15 nC per 30 uL droplet on pristine leaves. However, we specifically demonstrate the crucial role of the epicuticular wax layer plasticity: by a structural modification that decreases its roughness amplitude, the same leaves gain an impressive 30-40 fold enhancement in charge transfer (reaching Qt,D1 = -2.8 to -5.2 nC) slowing the droplet by half due to an estimated electrostatic force of 11 uN dominating the resistive forces. The charge accumulation is surface-history-dependent and charge quantities per droplet are surprisingly similar or even exceeding those recently reported from artificial surfaces. Our findings prove that electrostatic charging is a fundamental component of droplet-leaf interactions, opening new research directions from charge-affected leaf ecology to sustainable materials for droplet-based energy harvesting by tuning surface treatments and, moreover,...</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines electrostatic screening effects in graphene using tight binding calculations under the BBC and modified BBC models, with sigmav ranging from 0.00 to 3.00. Our results demonstrate that the modified BBC potential decays, which effectively suppresses electron-electron interactions. Hopping integrals decrease by 65% over distance and shift 7% with sigmav, while on site energy rises linearly by 0.045 eV. A band gap opens for sigmav greater than or equal to 1.00. The density of states peaks near the Fermi level, with the low energy region largely unaffected. Graphene's low energy helical wave functions yield topological features like pseudospin momentum locking and a pi Berry phase, leading to distinct transport behavior. The model avoids the Coulomb singularity, offering insights for 2D screening engineering and topological device design.</description>

      <title>Global Optimization of Atomic Clusters via Physically-Constrained Tensor Train Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The global optimization of atomic clusters represents a fundamental challenge in computational chemistry and materials science due to the exponential growth of local minima with system size (i.e., the curse of dimensionality). We introduce a novel framework that overcomes this limitation by exploiting the low-rank structure of potential energy surfaces through Tensor Train (TT) decomposition. Our approach combines two complementary TT-based strategies: the algebraic TTOpt method, which utilizes maximum volume sampling, and the probabilistic PROTES method, which employs generative sampling. A key innovation is the development of physically-constrained encoding schemes that incorporate molecular constraints directly into the discretization process. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method by identifying global minima of Lennard-Jones clusters containing up to 45 atoms. Furthermore, we establish its practical applicability to real-world systems by optimizing 20-atom carbon clusters using a machine-learned Moment Tensor Potential, achieving geometries consistent with quantum-accurate simulations. This work establishes TT-decomposition as a powerful tool for molecular structure prediction and provides a general framework adaptable to a wide range of high-dimensional optimization problems in computational material science.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: McSAS3 is the refactored successor to the original McSAS Monte Carlo small-angle scattering analysis software. It is intended to be integrated in automated data processing pipelines, but can also be used to process individual (batches of) scattering data.
  McSAS3 comes with a graphical user interface (McSAS3GUI), complete with guides, examples and videos. McSAS3GUI will help to generate and test the three configuration files that McSAS3 needs for data read-in, Monte Carlo optimization and histogramming. The user interface can also be used to process individual files or batches, and can be augmented with machine-specific use templates.
  The Monte Carlo (MC) approach is able to fit most practical scattering patterns extremely well, resulting in form-free model parameter distributions. Theoretically, these can be distributions on any model parameter, but in practice the MC-optimized parameter is usually a (volume-weighted) size distribution, in absolute volume fraction for absolute-scaled data.</description>

Abstract: Achieving parametric excitation in an oscillating physical system involves periodically adjusting one of its parameters to modulate the oscillator's natural frequency. This phenomenon has been observed in numerous systems within physics and engineering, profoundly transforming modern science and technology. Despite rapid progress, the parametric control of collective excitations, such as phonons, remains a challenge while promising to generate novel and intriguing effects in a largely unexplored field. Here, we investigate the terahertz (THz) field-induced dynamics of Raman-active phonons in the perovskite structure of LaAlO$_3$ (LAO). Utilizing intense THz pulses, we demonstrate a novel mechanism of parametric phonon excitation marked by substantial subharmonic components. Theoretical analysis can successfully capture the hallmarks of the observed phenomena in a physical scenario with the THz field inducing a parametric coupling between the Raman mode and pairs of acoustic phonon excitations.</description>

Abstract: Rare earth/transition metal (RE/TM) multilayers with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy are key ingredients for the development of spintronic applications. Their compensation temperature depends on the ratio of the thicknesses of rare earth and transition metal, allowing their magnetic properties to be tuned with temperature while maintaining their anisotropy even in nanometer-scale devices. In this work, we performed a thorough structural characterization and systematically investigate the magnetic properties of a whole family of ferrimagnetic [Tb/Co]$_{\times 5}$ multilayers varying the Tb thickness in the range of 0.4 nm - 1.25 nm. A linear dependence of the compensation temperature on the Tb layer thickness was observed. Moreover, a uniaxial anisotropy constant of 330$\pm$30 kJ/m$^3$, which is close to the values reported by other authors, was estimated. Additionally, we proposed a model to gain a better understanding of the angular dependence of the magnetization loops and the linear dependence of the compensation temperature. We present strong evidence demonstrating that the perpendicular anisotropy must be tilted away from the perpendicular axis in order to explain the observed features, particularly the hysteresis in the in-plane loops. Our work advances the understanding of DC magnetic properties in thin RE/TM ferrimagnetic films, which has the potential to impact different fields where these materials are involved.</description>

      <title>Strong lead-free bioinspired piezoceramics for durable energy transducers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Durable, high-performance and eco-friendly lead-free piezoceramics are essential for next-generation sustainable energy transducers and electromechanical systems. While significant performance enhancements have been made, through chemical composition, texture, or crystal defects, piezoceramics are intrinsically weak mechanically, which negatively impact their working conditions and durability. What's more, improving comprehensive mechanical durability without sacrificing piezoelectric performance remains a key challenge. Here, we design bioinspired Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 (BNT) ceramics using a scalable colloidal process that enables multiscale control over the microstructure. The design comprises plate-like monocrystalline BNT bricks stacked to induce a crystallographic texture along the poling direction, bonded together by a silica-based mortar, forming the brick-and-mortar phase. This deliberate microstructure design yields 2- to 3-fold increase in flexural strength, and 1.6- to 2-fold increase in fracture toughness compared with a BNT synthesized conventionally, comparable to common structural ceramics, without sacrificing the piezoelectric performance. In addition, the bioinspired BNT exhibit dramatically enhanced ferroelectric fatigue resistance, with a 10- to 15-folds improvement in the number of field-induced electromechanical cycles before failure. These gains originate from anisotropic residual stress fields, revealed by Raman spectroscopy and XRD, which delay crack initiation events. Furthermore, we demonstrated enhanced transducing capability and electromechanical fatigue resistance using a cantilever beam-based piezoelectric transducer under bending mode. Given its non-chemical-compositional origin, this bioinspired strategy could be broadly applicable to other piezoelectric material systems for applications where both functional and structural performance are critical.</description>

      <title>Time-resolved measurement of Seebeck effect for superionic metals during structural phase transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new time (t)-resolved method of both vertical- and horizontal-temperature gradients in an orthogonal configuration (t-resolved T(t)-HVOT) to have real interpretations of the enhancement in thermoelectric Seebeck effect (SE) observed during the structural phase transition. We apply our new method to superionic-state semiconductors of p-type Cu2Se and n-type Ag2S. The experimental data differentiate the two types of enhancements during the phase transition: a colossal SE (Scolossal), exhibiting an enormous value of up to 5 mV/K, and a slight enhancement in SE (Sstructure), approximately 1.5-2.0 times larger than those in the absence of the phase transition. We provide critical insights that both enhancements in SE arising during the structural phase transition are not intrinsic phenomena.</description>

      <title>InSpecLearn4SDL: Interpretable Spectral Features Predict Conductivity in Self-Driving Doped Conjugated Polymer Labs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To accelerate materials discovery using self-driving labs (SDLs), we present a machine learning pipeline that predicts the electrical conductivity of doped conjugated polymers using rapid, non-destructive optical spectroscopy. Our approach automates spectral featurization by combining a genetic algorithm with adaptive area-under-the-curve (AUC) computations, creating a quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) that links optical response and processing parameters to conductivity. By incorporating SHAP-guided selection and domain-knowledge-based feature expansion, the model matches expert-curated performance while theoretically reducing experimental effort by $\sim 33\%$ by minimizing the need for costly direct conductivity measurements. Notably, the model recovers known physical descriptors in pBTTT and identifies informative tail-state regions correlated with polymer bleaching upon successful doping. This generic, interpretable, small-data-friendly methodology can be extended to other spectroscopic modalities, such as Raman or FTIR, providing a framework for autonomous decision-making in SDLs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03897v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the emergence of adsorption-induced magnetism from heterohelicene molecules on a non-magnetic Cu(100) surface. Spin-polarized low-energy electron microscopy (SP-LEEM) measurements reveal spin-dependent electron reflectivity for enantiopure 7,12,17-trioxa[11]helicene (TO[11]H) monolayers, indicating the formation of a spin-polarized state localized in the topmost copper layer. Control experiments on clean Cu(100) and TO[11]H on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite show no such effect, excluding artifacts and chirality-induced spin selectivity as origins. Spin-polarized density functional theory calculations with hybrid functionals attribute the magnetism to strong chemisorption, which induces hybridization between the molecular HOMO and copper s- and d-states, driving asymmetric spin-polarized charge redistribution at the interface. An extended Newns-Anderson-Grimley model incorporating on-site Coulomb repulsion in Cu d-orbitals reproduces the emergence of interfacial spin polarization above a threshold interaction strength, highlighting the key roles of hybridization parameters and Coulomb correlation. These findings reveal a mechanism for inducing magnetism at molecule-metal interfaces without inherently magnetic components, offering avenues for engineering spin-polarized states in organic-inorganic hybrid systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26471v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uniaxial spintronic heterostructures constitute compact THz emitters under femtosecond optical excitation, with emission amplitude and polarization governed by the applied magnetic field is presented. We demonstrate here efficient magnetically tunable THz amplitude control in ultrathin, exchange-biased Co/Pt/Co/IrMn spin valve. Terahertz spintronic magnetometry resolves reversible switching between parallel and antiparallel magnetization states and correlates the high- and low-emission regimes with constructive and destructive interference of charge transients generated by the inverse spin Hall effect in the Pt spacer. A residual low-emission signal is traced to spin-to-charge conversion in IrMn. Phase inversion under front- versus back-side excitation confirms the ISHE origin of the emission, while a macrospin Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert model reproduces the field dependence of its amplitude and separates layer-specific contributions. Together, these results define a wafer-compatible spin valve device architecture that enables efficient, low-field THz amplitude control.</description>

      <title>Compatibilities and supercompatibility conditions in shape memory alloys determined from correspondence, metrics and symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00633v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The phenomenological theory of martensite crystallography (PTMC) developed in the 1950s explains the main crystallographic and microstructural features of martensite in shape memory alloys, such as the habit planes of bi-variant laminate martensite product, and the transformation twins between the variants. It also permits to determine the austenite and martensite lattice parameters that allow supercompatibility, which has driven important research and development of new shape memory alloys with low hysteresis and high cyclability. Supercompatibility takes the form of three mathematical equations called cofactor conditions. The calculations are in great part based mathematical tools from continuum mechanics (polar decompositions and stretch tensors). They were recently replaced by pure crystallographic tools (metric tensors, group of symmetries and correspondence) in an alternative approach called correspondence theory (CT). The CT allows for the direct calculation of the transformation twins and their generic and non-generic characteristics. These twins ensure the compatibility at martensite/martensite (M/M) junction planes. Here, we show that the CT can also be used to determine the conditions of austenite/martensite (A/M) compatibility, and A/M/M supercompatibility.</description>

      <title>Precise, efficient and flexible modeling of crystallizing elastomers based on physics-augmented neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a precise and efficient physics-augmented neural network (PANN) to model strain-induced crystallization in rubbery polymers. We demonstrate that the model can be flexibly employed for both unfilled and filled natural rubber (NR). The approach is based on a two potential framework, similar to the concept of generalized standard materials (GSMs). To describe the material behavior, neural network-based free energy and dissipation potentials are employed. The evolution of crystallinity is derived from the two potentials. To ensure boundedness of the crystallinity, a novel constrained GSM-type evolution problem is proposed. To this end, two additional Lagrange multipliers together with the corresponding Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions are introduced. As a result, it is guaranteed that crystallinity can be interpreted as a variable of concentration type. The neural network-based potentials ensure all physically desirable properties by construction. Most importantly, objectivity, material symmetry and thermodynamic consistency are automatically fulfilled. In addition, an alternative derivation of the governing model equations in time-discrete form is presented based on an incremental variational framework, which also serves as the basis for a finite element implementation. We demonstrate the predictive capability of the PANN using three different experimental data sets from literature, considering both stress and crystallinity evolution at material point level as well as the corresponding field distributions in a notched specimen. Moreover, we show that model parameterization is also possible when experimental crystallinity data is not available, still enabling suitable stress predictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting degradation rates is an important task in the development of new perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this paper, we explore the feasibility of solving this problem using Machine Learning models supported by LLM tools. We consider both the "lifetime" prediction of the device and the prediction of degree of its degradation at specific time intervals. We demonstrate the ability of common LLM tools (ChatGPT, DeepSeek) to suggest and justify prediction methods in a dialogue with the user under conditions of incomplete information about the physical models of PSC degradation and the influence of the environment, providing rather accurate prediction. The results cover the formation of time series of efficiency with a given architecture, calculated using various available mathematical models together with environmental characteristics archived in various meteorological databases (illumination, temperature, humidity, UV level). We conclude that ChatGPT currently has sufficient access to training samples, can suggest to PSC designer various PSC models in the literature, and has adequate solutions for predicting degradation trends.</description>

      <title>Spin Dynamics in the van der Waals Ferromagnet CrTe2 Engineered by Niobium Doping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling spin dynamics in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnets is essential for their application in magnonics and hybrid quantum platforms. Here, we investigate the spin dynamics of the vdW ferromagnet 1T-CrTe_{2} and demonstrate their systematic tunability via niobium (Nb) substitution in Cr_{1-x}Nb_{x}Te_{2}(x=0-0.2). Ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectroscopy reveals that Nb doping enables wide-band tuning of the resonance frequency from 40 GHz down to the few-GHz regime, accompanied by a moderate increase in the Gilbert damping constant from ~0.066 to ~0.14, while preserving robust room-temperature ferromagnetism. Complementary magnetometry shows a concurrent reduction of the Curie temperature and saturation magnetization with increasing Nb content. Density functional theory calculations attribute the observed spin-dynamic trends to Nb-induced modifications of magnetic anisotropy and magnetic exchange interactions. Furthermore, CrTe_{2} flakes (~100nm thick) exhibit lower resonance frequencies than bulk crystals, consistent with thickness-dependent magnetic anisotropy. These results establish Nb-doped CrTe_{2} as a tunable vdW ferromagnet with controllable spin dynamics, extending its functionality from spintronics to broadband magnonics and quantum magnonics.</description>

      <title>Temperature dependence of the spontaneous magnetization of Ni2MnGa and other ferromagnets. The superellipse equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The temperature dependence of the spontaneous magnetization of Ni2MnGa and other ferromagnets can be described in reduced coordinates by the superellipse equation using a single dimensionless parameter. This critical exponent parameter equals 2.4 for Ni2MnGa, 2.7 for nickel and cobalt, 3.0 for iron and 2.05 for gadolinium. Because reduced magnetization and reduced temperature enter the equation symmetrically, the Ms(T) dependence can be measured only in the low temperature range, from 0 to 0.5Tc. The magnetization curve from 0.5Tc to Tc can then be obtained by interchanging reduced magnetization and temperature in the superellipse equation. In this way, the experimentally challenging task of measuring spontaneous magnetization near Tc is avoided, as the behavior near Tc is effectively determined from measurements performed near T = 0. The Ms(T) dependence in a whole temperature range is fully determined by two parameters - the Curie temperature, Ts and the critical exponent, n.</description>

Abstract: In this work, three InAs/InAs$_{0.65}$Sb$_{0.35}$ superlattices with different periods were investigated using photoluminescence and photoreflectance measurements and their band structure was simulated using a 14 bulk-band kp model. The structures were studied by analyzing the evolution of the spectral features in temperature and excitation power to determine the origin of optical transitions. After identifying which of these are related to the superlattice mini-bands, a rich collection of observed higher-order optical transitions was compared with refractive-index calculations. This procedure was used to adjust the parameters of the theoretical model, namely the bowing parameters of the InAsSb valence band offset and bandgap. It was also shown that the spectroscopy of the higher-order states combined with numerical modeling of the refractive index is a powerful tool for improvement of the material parameters, presenting a new approach to material studies of advanced semiconductor heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Ligand Engineering for Precise Control of Ultrathin CsPbI3 Nanoplatelet Superlattices for Efficient Light-Emitting Diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strongly-confined perovskite nanoplatelets (PeNPLs) offer opportunities not found in conventional isotropic nanocubes, especially in producing linearly polarized light, as well as enhancing outcoupling through control over the transition dipole moment. But this requires ultrathin nanoplatelets with three or fewer monolayers of PbI6 octahedra across the thickness, which are challenging to synthesise uniformly, and their luminescence is strongly affected by surface defects. Together, these limit the performance of ultrathin PeNPLs in light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Here, we address these challenges with an ancillary ligand engineering strategy. We demonstrate that ligands with phosphoryl functional groups strongly bind to the perovskite surface, while having an organic backbone that is not sterically bulky ensures high ligand density. By modulating nucleation and growth, these ancillary ligands lead to monodisperse PeNPLs that stack more uniformly when self-assembled into superlattices, with suppressed agglomeration. As a result, from edge-up PeNPL superlattices, we achieve enhanced degree of polarization, while from face-down PeNPL superlattices, we achieve enhanced outcoupling that results in LEDs with 13.1% external quantum efficiency, the highest reported for ultrathin PeNPL LEDs. This work establishes ancillary ligand-induced synthesis as a decisive route to achieve uniform nanoplatelets with robust orientation control, enabling full utilization of the multifunctionality of anisotropic PeNPLs.</description>

      <title>MiST: Understanding the Role of Mid-Stage Scientific Training in Developing Chemical Reasoning Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21231v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models can develop reasoning capabilities through online fine-tuning with rule-based rewards. However, recent studies reveal a critical constraint: reinforcement learning succeeds only when the base model already assigns non-negligible probability to correct answers -- a property we term 'latent solvability'. This work investigates the emergence of chemical reasoning capabilities and what these prerequisites mean for chemistry. We identify two necessary conditions for RL-based chemical reasoning: 1) Symbolic competence, and 2) Latent chemical knowledge. We propose mid-stage scientific training (MiST): a set of mid-stage training techniques to satisfy these, including data-mixing with SMILES/CIF-aware pre-processing, continued pre-training on 2.9B tokens, and supervised fine-tuning on 1B tokens. These steps raise the latent-solvability score on 3B and 7B models by up to 1.8x, and enable RL to lift top-1 accuracy from 10.9 to 63.9% on organic reaction naming, and from 40.6 to 67.4% on inorganic material generation. Similar results are observed for other challenging chemical tasks, while producing interpretable reasoning traces.
