      <title>Supervised and unsupervised learning the many-body critical phase, phase transitions and critical exponents in disordered quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we begin by questioning the existence of a new kind of nonergodic extended phase, namely, the many-body critical (MBC) phase in finite systems of an interacting quasiperiodic system. We find that this phase can be separately detected from the other phases such as the many-body ergodic (ME) and many-body localized (MBL) phases in the model through supervised neural networks made for both binary and multi-class classification tasks, utilizing, rather un-preprocessed, eigenvalue spacings and eigenvector probability densities as input features. Moreover, the output of our trained neural networks can also indicate the critical points separating ME, MBC and MBL phases, which are consistent with the same obtained from other conventional methods. We also employ unsupervised learning techniques, particularly principal component analysis (PCA) of eigenvector probability densities to investigate how this framework, without any training, captures the, rather unknown, many-body phases (ME, MBL and MBC) and single particle phases (delocalized, localized and critical) of the interacting and non-interacting systems, respectively. Our findings reveal that PCA entropy serves as an effective indicator (order parameter) for detecting phase transitions in the single-particle systems. Moreover, this method proves applicable to many-body systems when the data undergoes a suitable pre-processing. Interestingly, when it comes to extraction of critical (correlation length) exponents through a finite size-scaling, we find that for single-particle systems, scaling collapse of neural network outputs is obtained using components of inverse participation ratio (IPR) as input data. Remarkably, we observe identical critical exponents as obtained from scaling collapse of the IPR directly for different single-particle phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Critical properties in the non-Hermitian Aubry-Andre-Stark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the critical properties of the localization transition in the non-Hermitian Aubry-Andre-Stark (AAS) model with quasiperiodic and Stark potentials, where the non-Hermiticity comes from the nonreciprocal hopping. The localization length, the inverse participation ratio and the energy gap are adopted as the characteristic quantities. We perform the scaling analysis to derive the scaling functions of the three quantities with critical exponents in several critical regions, with respect to the quasiperiodic and Stark potentials and the nonreciprocal strength. We numerically verify the finite-size scaling forms and extract the critical exponents in different situations. Two groups of new critical exponents for the non-Hermitian AAS model and its pure Stark limit are obtained, which are distinct to those for the non-Hermitian Aubry-Andre model and their Hermitian counterparts. Our results indicate that the Hermitian and non-Hermitian AAS, Aubry-Andre, and Stark models belong to different universality classes. We demonstrate that these critical exponents are independent of the nonreciprocal strength, and remain the same in different critical regions and boundary conditions. Furthermore, we establish a hybrid scaling function with a hybrid exponent in the overlap region between the critical regions for the non-Hermitian AAS and Stark models.</description>

      <title>Patterns robust to Disorder in spatially-interacting Generalized Lotka-Volterra Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How do interactions between species influence their spatial distribution in an ecosystem? To answer this question, we introduce a spatially-extended ecosystem of Generalized Lotka-Volterra type, where species can diffuse and interactions are nonlocal. We compute the criterion for the loss of stability of the spatially homogeneous ecosystem, and we show that the stability of the uniform state crucially depends on the most abundant species, and on the interplay between space exploration during one species generation and the interaction range. Focusing on the spectrum of the interaction matrix weighted by the species abundances, we identify a Baik-Ben Arous-P\'ech\'e transition that translates into a transition in the final patterns of the species repartition. Finally assuming that the disorder is small, we exhibit an explicit solution of the dynamical mean-field equation for the species density, obtained as the fixed point of a nonlocal Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovski-Piskounov equation. Our work paves the way of future combined approaches at the frontier of active matter and disordered systems, with the hope of better understanding complex ecosystems like bacterial communities.</description>

      <title>A precise asymptotic analysis of learning diffusion models: theory and insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we consider the problem of learning a flow or diffusion-based generative model parametrized by a two-layer auto-encoder, trained with online stochastic gradient descent, on a high-dimensional target density with an underlying low-dimensional manifold structure. We derive a tight asymptotic characterization of low-dimensional projections of the distribution of samples generated by the learned model, ascertaining in particular its dependence on the number of training samples. Building on this analysis, we discuss how mode collapse can arise, and lead to model collapse when the generative model is re-trained on generated synthetic data.</description>

      <title>Types of dynamical behavior in a quasiperiodic mosaic lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasiperiodic mosaic systems with the quasiperiodic potential being added periodically with a fixed lattice interval have attracted significant attention due to their peculiar spectral properties with exactly known mobility edges, which separate localized from delocalized states. These mobility edges do not vanish even in the region of large quasiperiodic potential strength, although the width of the energy window of extended states decreases with the increase in potential strength and thus becomes very narrow in the limit of strong quasiperiodic disorder. In this paper, we study the dynamics of a quasiperiodic mosaic lattice and unravel its peculiar dynamical properties. By scrutinizing the expansion dynamics of wave packet and the evolution of density distribution, we unveil that the long-time density distribution displays obviously different behaviors at odd and even sites in the region of large quasiperiodic potential strength. Particularly, the timescale of dynamics exhibits an inverse relationship with the quasiperiodic potential strength. To understand these behaviors, we derive an effective Hamiltonian in the large quasiperiodic potential strength region, which is composed of decoupled Hamiltonians defined on the odd and even sites, respectively. While all eigenstates of the effective Hamiltonian defined on even sites are localized, the eigenstates of effective Hamiltonian defined on odd sites include both localized and extended eigenstates. Our results suggest that the effective Hamiltonian can describe the dynamical behaviors well in the large quasiperiodic potential strength region and provides an intuitive framework for understanding the peculiar dynamical behaviors in the quasiperiodic mosaic lattice.</description>

      <title>Trade-off relations between quantum coherence and measure of many-body localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10449v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum coherence, a fundamental resource in quantum computing and quantum information, often competes with localization effects that affects quantum states in disordered systems. In this work, we prove exact trade-off relations between quantum coherence and a measure of localization and many-body localization, namely, the inverse participation ratio (IPR). We prove that for a pure quantum state, $l_1$-norm of quantum coherence and the relative entropy of coherence satisfy complementarity relations with IPR. For a mixed state, IPR and the $l_2$-norm of quantum coherence as well as relative entropy of coherence satisfy trade-off inequalities. These relations suggest that quantum coherence, in disordered quantum systems is also an ideal characterization of the delocalisation to many-body localisation transition, much like IPR, which is a well-known diagnostic of MBL. These relations also provide insight into the unusual properties of bipartite entanglement entropy across the MBL transition. We believe that these trade-off relations can help in better understanding of how coherence can be preserved or lost in realistic many-body quantum systems, which is vital for developing robust quantum technologies and uncovering new phases of quantum matter.</description>

      <title>On Computational Complexity of 3D Ising Spin Glass: Lessons from D-Wave Annealer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding an exact ground state of a 3D Ising spin glass is proven to be an NP-hard problem. Given validity of the exponential time hypothesis, its computational complexity was proven to be no less than $2^{N^{2/3}}$, where $N$ is the total number of spins. Here we report results of extensive experimentation with D-Wave 3D annealer with $N\leq 5627$. We found exact ground states (in a probabilistic sense) for typical realizations of 3D spin glasses with the efficiency, which scales as $2^{N/\beta}$ with $\beta\approx 10^{3}$. Based on statistical analysis of low energy states, we argue that with an improvement of annealing protocols and device noise reduction, $\beta$ can be increased even further. This suggests that, for $N&lt;\beta^3$, annealing devices provide a most efficient way to find the ground state.</description>

      <title>Dataset-Free Weight-Initialization on Restricted Boltzmann Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In feed-forward neural networks, dataset-free weight-initialization methods such as LeCun, Xavier (or Glorot), and He initializations have been developed. These methods randomly determine the initial values of weight parameters based on specific distributions (e.g., Gaussian or uniform distributions) without using training datasets. To the best of the authors' knowledge, such a dataset-free weight-initialization method is yet to be developed for restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs), which are probabilistic neural networks consisting of two layers. In this study, we derive a dataset-free weight-initialization method for Bernoulli--Bernoulli RBMs based on statistical mechanical analysis. In the proposed weight-initialization method, the weight parameters are drawn from a Gaussian distribution with zero mean. The standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution is optimized based on our hypothesis that a standard deviation providing a larger layer correlation (LC) between the two layers improves the learning efficiency. The expression of the LC is derived based on a statistical mechanical analysis. The optimal value of the standard deviation corresponds to the maximum point of the LC. The proposed weight-initialization method is identical to Xavier initialization in a specific case (i.e., when the sizes of the two layers are the same, the random variables of the layers are $\{-1,1\}$-binary, and all bias parameters are zero). The validity of the proposed weight-initialization method is demonstrated in numerical experiments using a toy and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Mechanical hysterons with tunable interactions of general sign</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hysterons are elementary units of hysteresis that underlie many complex behaviors of non-equilibrium matter. Because models of interacting hysterons can describe disordered matter, this suggests that artificial systems could respond to mechanical inputs in precise and targeted ways. Specifying the properties of hysterons and their interactions could thus be a general method for realizing arbitrary non-equilibrium behaviors. Elastic structures including slender beams, creased sheets, and shells are clear candidates for artificial hysterons, but complete control of their interactions has seemed impractical or impossible. Here we report a mechanical hysteron composed of rigid bars and linear springs, which has controllable properties and tunable interactions of general sign that can be reciprocal or non-reciprocal. We derive a mapping from the system parameters to the hysteron properties, and we show how collective behaviors of multiple hysterons can be targeted by adjusting geometric parameters on the fly. By transforming an abstract hysteron model into a physical design platform, our work demonstrates a route toward designed materials that can sense, compute, and respond to their mechanical environment.</description>

      <title>Strong and weak symmetries and their spontaneous symmetry breaking in mixed states emerging from the quantum Ising model under multiple decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discovering and categorizing quantum orders in mixed many-body systems are currently one of the most important problems. Specific types of decoherence applied to typical quantum many-body states can induce a novel kind of mixed state accompanying characteristic symmetry orders, which has no counterparts in pure many-body states. We study phenomena generated by interplay between two types of decoherence applied to the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model (TFIM). We show that in the doubled Hilbert space formalism, the decoherence can be described by filtering operation applied to matrix product states (MPS) defined in the doubled Hilbert system. The filtering operation induces specific deformation of the MPS, which approximates the ground state of a certain parent Hamiltonian in the doubled Hilbert space. In the present case, such a parent Hamiltonian is the quantum Ashkin-Teller model, having a rich phase diagram with a critical lines and quantum phase transitions. By investigating the deformed MPS, we find various types of mixed states emergent from the ground states of the TFIM, and clarify phase transitions between them. In that study, strong and weak $Z_2$ symmetries play an important role, for which we introduce efficient order parameters, such as R\'{e}nyi-2 correlators, entanglement entropy, etc., in the doubled Hilbert space.</description>
