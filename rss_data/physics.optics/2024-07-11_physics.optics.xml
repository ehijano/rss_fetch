      <title>Electrically tunable spin-orbit coupled photonic lattice in a liquid crystal microcavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We create a one-dimensional photonic crystal with strong polarization dependence and tunable by an applied electric field. We accomplish this in a planar microcavity by embedding a cholesteric liquid crystal (LC), which spontaneously forms a uniform lying helix (ULH). The applied voltage controls the orientation of the LC molecules and, consequently, the strength of a polarization-dependent periodic potential. It leads to opening or closing of photonic band gaps in the dispersion of the massive photons in the microcavity. In addition, when the ULH structure possesses a molecular tilt, it induces a spin-orbit coupling between the lattice bands of different parity. This interband spin-orbit coupling (ISOC) is analogous to optical activity and can be treated as a synthetic non-Abelian gauge potential. Finally, we show that doping the LC with dyes allows us to achieve lasing that inherits all the above-mentioned tunable properties of LC microcavity, including dual and circularly-polarized lasing.</description>

      <title>Serial coherent diffraction imaging of dynamic samples based on inter-frame constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We proposed a novel approach to coherent imaging of dynamic samples. The inter-frame similarity of the sample's local structures is found to be a powerful constraint in phasing a sequence of diffraction patterns. We devised a new image reconstruction algorithm that exploits this inter-frame constraint enabled by an adaptive similar region determination approach. We demonstrated the feasibility of this technique in visible light experiments with various real samples, achieving reconstructions of good quality within a few hundred iterations. With a setup as simple as conventional coherent diffraction imaging but with much-improved convergence and robustness to missing data and noise, our method is expected to enrich X-ray imaging techniques and electron microscopy, offering a new tool for dynamics studies.</description>

      <title>Electrically Tuning Quasi-Bound States in the Continuum with Hybrid Graphene-Silicon Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metasurfaces have become one of the most prominent research topics in the field of optics owing to their unprecedented properties and novel applications on an ultrathin platform. By combining graphene with metasurfaces, electrical tunable functions can be achieved with fast tuning speed, large modulation depth and broad tuning range. However, the tuning efficiency of hybrid graphene metasurfaces within the short-wavelength infrared (SWIR) spectrum is typically low because of the small resonance wavelength shift in this wavelength range. In this work, through the integration of graphene and silicon metasurfaces that support quasi-bound states in the continuum (quasi-BIC), we experimentally demonstrate significant transmittance tuning even with less than 30 nm resonance wavelength shift thanks to the high quality-factor of quasi-BIC metasurfaces. The tunable transmittance spectrum was measured using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) with a modified reflective lens to improve the accuracy, and the electrical tuning was realized utilizing the cut-and-stick method of ion gel. At the wavelength of 3.0 um, the measured change of transmittance T_max-T_min and modulation depth (T_max-T_min)/T_max can reach 22.2% and 28.9%, respectively, under a small bias voltage ranging from -2 V to +2 V. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first experimental demonstration of tunable graphene/quasi-BIC metasurfaces, which have potential applications in optical modulation, reconfigurable photonic devices, and optical communications.</description>

      <title>Targeting low micro-roughness for 3D printed aluminium mirrors using a hot isostatic press</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Additive manufacturing (AM; 3D printing) in aluminium using laser powder bed fusion provides a new design space for lightweight mirror production. Printing layer-by-layer enables the use of intricate lattices for mass reduction, as well as organic shapes generated by topology optimisation, resulting in mirrors optimised for function as opposed to subtractive machining. However, porosity, a common AM defect, is present in printed aluminium and it is a result of the printing environment being either too hot or too cold, or gas entrapped bubbles within the aluminium powder. When present in an AM mirror substrates, porosity manifests as pits on the reflective surface, which increases micro-roughness and therefore scattered light. There are different strategies to reduce the impact of porosity: elimination during printing, coating the aluminium print in nickel phosphorous, or to apply a heat and pressure treatment to close the pores, commonly known as a hot isostatic press (HIP).
  This paper explores the application of HIP on printed aluminium substrates intended for mirror production using single point diamond turning (SPDT). The objective of the HIP is to reduce porosity whilst targeting a small grain growth within the aluminium, which is important in allowing the SPDT to generate surfaces with low micro-roughness. For this study, three disks, 50 mm diameter by 5 mm, were printed in AlSi10Mg at 0 deg, 45 deg, and 90 deg with respect to the build plate. X-ray computed tomography (XCT) was conducted before and after the HIP cycle to confirm the effectiveness of HIP to close porosity. The disks were SPDT and the micro-roughness evaluated. Mechanical testing and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) was used to quantify the mechanical strength and the grain size after HIP.</description>

      <title>Waveguide Superlattices with Artificial Gauge Field Towards Colorless and Crosstalkless Ultrahigh-Density Photonic Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense waveguide arrays with low crosstalk and ultra-broadband remain a vital issue for chip-scale integrated photonics. However, the sub-wavelength regime of such devices has not been adequately explored in practice. Herein, we propose the advanced waveguide superlattices leveraging the artificial gauge field mechanism. This approach achieves remarkable -24 dB crosstalk suppression with an ultra-broadband bandwidth, experimentally demonstrated over 500 nm, in silicon nitride waveguides. Moreover, the 112 Gbit/s signal encoded per channel of ultra-compact circuits with a bit error rate below the 7% forward error correction limit verified the capability for high-speed on-chip transmission. This design is compatible with metal back end-of-the-line (BEOL) processes and can be readily transferred to other platforms. Thus it holds great promise for significant reduction in on-chip footprint and cost in large-scale integrated photonics, and salient enhancement in the performance of a wide range of active and passive photonic devices and systems.</description>

      <title>Narrow Linewidth Laser Based on Extended Topological Interface States in One-Dimensional Photonic Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in topological one-dimensional photonic crystal concepts have enabled the development of robust light-emitting devices by incorporating a topological interface state (TIS) at the cavity center. In this study, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate a one-dimensional TIS-extended photonic crystal (1D-TISE-PC) structure. By integrating a linearly dispersive zero-index one-dimensional photonic crystal structure with a four-phase shift sampled grating, photons propagate along the cavity without phase differences, enhancing the robustness to material variations and extending the TIS. Our findings indicate that extending the TIS promotes a more uniform photon distribution along the laser cavity and mitigates the spatial hole burning (SHB) effect. We fabricated and characterized a 1550 nm sidewall 1D-TISE-PC semiconductor laser, achieving stable single-mode operation across a wide current range from 60 to 420 mA, with a side-mode suppression ratio of 50 dB. The 1D-TISE-PC structure exhibited a linewidth narrowing effect to approximately 150 kHz Lorentzian linewidth. Utilizing reconstruction equivalent-chirp technology for the 4PS sampled grating enabled precise wavelength control in 1D-TISE-PC laser arrays, achieving a wavelength spacing of 0.796 nm +- 0.003 nm. We show that the TIS still exists in the TISE cavity and topological protection is preserved. Its mode extension characteristics mitigate the SHB so narrows the linewidth. We argue that the design simplicity and improvement of the fabrication tolerance make this architecture suitable for high-power and narrow-linewidth semiconductor lasers development.</description>

      <title>Speckle tweezers at fluid-fluid interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contemporary approaches to optical multiple micro-manipulation typically involve careful pre-engineering of the laser beam shape. In various biomedical and microfluidic scenarios, especially those necessitating unconventional specimen chambers, there is a demand for controlling the collection of micro-objects at fluid-fluid interfaces. This requirement arises in contexts such as the transport of materials across liquid interfaces for applications like living cell manipulation, drug delivery, soft functional material creation, and various industrial processes. For many of these cases, a regular array of trap sites as well as tightly confinement are not essential. For such applications at interfaces, we expand on the concept of speckle tweezers (ST), which incorporate randomly distributed light fields for quasi-2D optical manipulation. The proposed technique is demonstrated experimentally by applying ST to govern the movement of PS micro-particles at water-oil and water-air interfaces. The efficacy of the method is validated through the temporal characterization of micro-particle motions using digital video microscopy.</description>

      <title>Observation of non-Abelian band topology without time-reversal symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Going beyond the conventional theory, non-Abelian band topology uncovers the global quantum geometry of Bloch bands with multiple gaps and thus unveil a new paradigm for topological physics. However, to date, all non-Abelian topological materials are restricted to systems with time-reversal symmetry (T). Here, starting from a Kagome lattice inspired by Haldane model and designer gyromagnetic photonic crystals (PhCs), we show that T breaking can lead to rich non-Abelian topological physics, particularly the emergence of multigap antichiral edge states. Simply changing the magnetic flux of the Kagome lattice, or in-situ tuning the local magnetic field of the gyromagnetic PhCs, can lead to the unconventional creation, braiding, merging, and splitting of non-Abelian charged band nodes, alongside with the direct manipulation of the multigap antichiral edge states. Particularly, the quadratic point can be split into four Dirac points, a phenomenon unique in T-broken systems. Our theoretical and experimental findings will inspire a new direction in the study of non-Abelian physics in T-broken systems and open an unprecedent pathway for topological manipulation of electromagnetic waves.</description>

      <title>Phase-sensitive symmetry breaking in bidirectionally pumped Kerr microresonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate theoretically and experimentally that linear coupling due to the backscattering between two counterpropagating modes in a Kerr microresonator leads to extreme sensitivity of the intensity asymmetry of nonlinear light states to the relative phase between the bidirectional pumps of equal power. In the absence of linear coupling, the relative pump phase does not affect counterpropagating intraresonator intensities, and two asymmetric states arise due to spontaneous symmetry breaking. Contrariwise, in the presence of weak linear intermode coupling, the asymmetry of the states is deterministically controlled via changes in phase (for all phases except 0 and $\pi$). Spontaneous symmetry breaking at zero phase is suppressed when the linear intermode coupling is increased, while for the $\pi$ phase it can be enhanced, so that the overall threshold for the spontaneous symmetry breaking can be significantly lower for nonzero linear coupling. These results are important for fundamental understanding of the processes in Kerr resonators and other systems with Kerr-like nonlinearities and linear intermode coupling and have high prospects for the development of photonic devices such as ultrasensitive sensors.</description>

      <title>Localizing axial dense emitters based onsingle-helix point spread function andcompressed sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the approaches in three-dimensional (3D) single molecule localization microscopy, there are several point spread function (PSF) engineering approaches, in which depth information of molecules is encoded in 2D images. Usually,the molecules are excited sparsely in each raw image. The consequence is that the temporal resolution has to be sacrificed. In order to improve temporal resolution and ensure localization accuracy, we propose a method, SH-CS, based on light needle excitation, detection system with single helix-point spread function (SH-PSF), and compressed sensing (CS). Although the SH-CS method still has a limitation about the molecule density, it is suited for relatively dense molecules. For each light needle scanning position, an SH image of excited molecules is processed with CS algorithm to decode their axial information. Simulations demonstrated, for random distributed 1 ~ 15 molecules in depth range of 4 {\mu}m, the axial localization accuracy is 12.1 nm ~ 73.5 nm. The feasibility of this method is validated by experimental data.</description>

      <title>High power GaSb-based distributed feedback laser with laterally coupled dielectric gratings at 1.95{\mu}m</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional Distributed Feedback (DFB) or Distributed Bragg Reflector (DBR) lasers typically utilize buried gratings as frequency-selective optical feedback mechanisms. However, the fabrication of such gratings often necessitates regrowth processes, which can pose technical challenges for materials platforms such as GaAs and GaSb. Metal gratings were also used for GaSb lasers but they introduce additional absorption loss that limits device efficiency and output power. In this paper, we introduce a novel laterally coupled dielectric Bragg grating structure, which enables highly controllable, deterministic, and stable coupling between the grating and the optical mode. Our device demonstrates a continuous-wave output power of 47.02 mW at room temperature, exhibiting stable single-mode operation from 300-1000 mA and achieving a maximum side mode suppression ratio of 46.7 dB. These results underscore the innovative lateral coupled dielectric grating as a feasible and technologically superior approach for fabricating DFB and DBR lasers, which hold universal applicability across different material platforms and wavelength bands.</description>

      <title>Terahertz Digital Reconfigurable Metamaterial Array for Dynamic Beamforming Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel digital reconfigurable 2_bit metamaterial, equipped with a substrate integrated feeding system, is designed for industrial quality control applications within the terahertz frequency range. The proposed feeding mechanism facilitates azimuthal beam steering, spanning from negative 90 degree to positive 90 degree, thereby enabling the reconfiguration of beam patterns within the digital metamaterial. Utilizing the phase distribution concept and comprehensive analysis of coupling and the e_field effect on individual unit cells, the metamaterial array spacing is meticulously designed. Operational at 0.7 THz, the system offers versatile reconfigurability, supporting single, dual, and multibeam modes. Through meticulous optimization, the system demonstrates an impressive negative 138 degree to positive 138 degree beam steering capability. This dynamic beamforming ability, transitioning seamlessly from a singular beam to multibeam configurations, requires minimal software-hardware integration for scanning and inter_satellite links, thus presenting significant potential for enhancing product quality within industrial environments and satellite communication.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light-in-flight (LiF) measurements allow to resolve and visualize the path that light travels through an arbitrary volumetric scene. Traditional LiF methods involve expensive high-speed electronics or narrow-pulse light sources. We present a novel computational LiF approach that only requires continuous-wave (CW) lasers and off-the-shelf CMOS cameras to capture the full LiF information about the scene. From multiple CW scene measurements at different optical wavelengths, we create multiple "synthetic fields," each at a "synthetic wave" which is the beat wave of two respective optical waves. Due to their robustness to speckle, the synthetic fields can be computationally combined into a "synthetic light pulse," which precisely sections the volumetric scene. Moreover, the complex synthetic fields can be freely manipulated in the computer after their acquisition, which allows for spatial and temporal shaping of different sets of pulses from the same set of measurements to maximize the decoded information output for each scene. In addition, the relative speed at which the pulse travels through the scene can be used to characterize physical scene properties such as depth or indices of refraction.</description>

      <title>Bound States in Continuum via Singular Transfer Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, bound states in continuum (BICs) have gained significant value for practitioners in both theoretical and applied photonics. This paper focuses on devices that utilize non-homogeneous thin patterned laminae. The properties, design principles, and behavior of BICs for this class of devices are frequently explained through a variety of models, ranging from numerical or semi-analytical solutions for the Maxwell equations to heuristic approaches that rely on fitting functions to provide phenomenological descriptions. The field of devices under study has given less attention to approaches that integrate exact analytical solutions of the transfer matrix with numerical data. In this vein, this paper aims to adopt an approach where exact analytical formulas, detailed in our previous manuscript arXiv:2303.06765 (2023), are translated into equations to explore the origins and properties of the bound states in continuum, as well as their practical implementation. The geometric parameters of the device and its operating frequency band emerge from the null space of the transfer matrix.</description>

      <title>Pentagonal Photonic Crystal Mirrors: Scalable Lightsails with Enhanced Acceleration via Neural Topology Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Starshot Breakthrough Initiative aims to send one-gram microchip probes to Alpha Centauri within 20 years, using gram-scale lightsails propelled by laser-based radiation pressure, reaching velocities nearing a fifth of light speed. This mission requires lightsail materials that challenge the fundamentals of nanotechnology, requiring innovations in optics, material science and structural engineering. Unlike the microchip payload, which must be minimized in every dimension, such lightsails need meter-scale dimensions with nanoscale thickness and billions of nanoscale holes to enhance reflectivity and reduce mass. Our study employs neural topology optimization, revealing a novel pentagonal lattice-based photonic crystal (PhC) reflector. The optimized designs shorten acceleration times, therefore lowering launch costs significantly. Crucially, these designs also enable lightsail material fabrication with orders-of-magnitude reduction in costs. We have fabricated a 60 x 60 mm$^2$, 200nm thick, single-layer reflector perforated with over a billion nanoscale features; the highest aspect-ratio nanophotonic element to date. We achieve this with nearly 9,000 times cost reduction per m$^2$. Starshot lightsails will have several stringent requirements but will ultimately be driven by costs to build at scale. Here we highlight challenges and possible solutions in developing lightsail materials - showcasing the potential of scaling nanophotonics for cost-effective next-generation space exploration.</description>

      <title>A note on the emission spectrum and trapping states in the Jaynes-Cummings model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emission of light from an atom represents a fundamental process that provides valuable insights into the atom-light interaction. The Jaynes-Cummings model is one of the simplest fully quantized models to deal with these interactions, allowing for an analytical solution, while exhibiting notable non-trivial effects. We explore new features in the fluorescence emission spectrum for initial "trapping states", which suppress the atomic population inversion. Despite the seemingly dormant activity of the atom, the resulting emission spectra exhibit rich features, and using a dressed-state coordinates formalism, we are able to quantitatively explain the different profiles in the spectrum. We generalize the trapping conditions for non-zero atom-field detuning and also unveil two types of trapping states that lead to spectra with three peaks, in contrast to previously known states: a center peak and one secondary peak on each side. These are a trapping state formed by a Schr\"odinger cat state with Poissonian statistics (Yurke-Stoler state) and also a different type of "perfect trapping state".</description>

      <title>Modeling of Hot-Carrier Degradation driven by silicon-hydrogen bond dissociation in SPADs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel approach for modeling Dark Count Rate (DCR) drift in Single-Photon Avalanche Diodes (SPADs) is proposed based on Hot-Carrier Degradation (HCD) inducing silicon-hydrogen bond dissociation at the Si/SiO2 interface. The energy and the quantity of hot-carriers are modeled by the interplay of carrier energy distribution and current density. The carrier energy distribution, achieved by a Full-Band Monte-Carlo simulation considering the band structure and the scattering mechanisms, establishes a crucial link to the degradation of the top SPAD interface, primarily influenced by hot electrons due to their broader energy spread. The current density is determined by analyzing the generation rates of carriers under dark and photo conditions, along with the multiplication rate, through a combination of experimental data and modeling techniques. Subsequently,these hot carriers are correlated with the distribution of bond dissociation energy, which is modeled by the disorder-induced local variations among the Si-H bond energy at the Si/SiO2 interface. The impact-ionization probability between hot carriers and Si-H bonds is then calculated by differentiating their energies, thereby determining the degradation kinetics. This enables the capture of the rise in dark current density with stress duration by the increasing number of defects, which in turn affects the modeling of degradation rate. For the first time, a direct correlation between the dark current and DCR, along with their drift over stress time, has been established, relying on the carrier generation rate originating from these defects together with the position-dependent breakdown probability Pt.This physic-based model allows to predict DCR for unprecedented long-term stress measurement time up to 10e6s, covering a whole set of characterization and stress conditions for SPAD devices.</description>

      <title>Uniaxial plasmon polaritons $\textit{via}$ charge transfer at the graphene/CrSBr interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphene is a privileged 2D platform for hosting confined light-matter excitations known as surface plasmon-polaritons (SPPs), as it possesses low intrinsic losses with a high degree of optical confinement. However, the inherently isotropic optical properties of graphene limit its ability to guide and focus SPPs, making it less suitable than anisotropic elliptical and hyperbolic materials as a platform for polaritonic lensing and canalization. Here, we present the graphene/CrSBr heterostructure as an engineered 2D interface that hosts highly anisotropic SPP propagation over a wide range of frequencies in the mid-infrared and terahertz. Using a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM), and first-principles calculations, we demonstrate mutual doping in excess of 10$^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$ holes/electrons between the interfacial layers of graphene/CrSBr heterostructures. SPPs in graphene activated by charge transfer interact with charge-induced anisotropic intra- and interband transitions in the interfacial doped CrSBr, leading to preferential SPP propagation along the quasi-1D chains that compose each CrSBr layer. This multifaceted proximity effect both creates SPPs and endows them with anisotropic transport and propagation lengths that differ by an order-of-magnitude between the two in-plane crystallographic axes of CrSBr.</description>

Abstract: We explore the interaction between a three-level atom and a single-mode quantized cavity, known as the three-level ladder-type Jaynes-Cummings model. By employing the exact solution of the Schr\"odinger equation, we investigate how the initial conditions of the atom influence the occupation probabilities of the atomic energy levels, average photon number, and the nonclassicality of light, assessed through the Mandel $\mathcal{Q} (t)$ parameter and the Wigner function. Our findings are rigorously validated through comprehensive numerical simulations, ensuring robust and consistent outcomes.</description>

      <title>Prediction of Frequency-Dependent Optical Spectrum for Solid Materials: A Multi-Output &amp; Multi-Fidelity Machine Learning Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The frequency-dependent optical spectrum is pivotal for a broad range of applications, from material characterization to optoelectronics and energy harvesting. Data-driven surrogate models, trained on density functional theory (DFT) data, have effectively alleviated the scalability limitations of DFT while preserving its chemical accuracy, expediting material discovery. However, prevailing machine learning (ML) efforts often focus on scalar properties such as the band gap, overlooking the complexities of optical spectra. In this work, we employ deep graph neural networks (GNNs) to predict the frequency-dependent complex-valued dielectric function across the infrared, visible, and ultraviolet spectra directly from crystal structures. We explore multiple architectures for multi-output spectral representation of the dielectric function and utilize various multi-fidelity learning strategies, such as transfer learning and fidelity embedding, to address the challenges associated with the scarcity of high-fidelity DFT data. Additionally, we model key solar cell absorption efficiency metrics, demonstrating that learning these parameters is enhanced when integrated through a learning bias within the learning of the frequency-dependent absorption coefficient. This study demonstrates that leveraging multi-output and multi-fidelity ML techniques enables accurate predictions of optical spectra from crystal structures, providing a versatile tool for rapidly screening materials for optoelectronics, optical sensing, and solar energy applications across an extensive frequency spectrum.</description>

      <title>Direct electrical modulation of surface response in a single plasmonic nanoresonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01423v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical electrodynamics describes the optical response of systems using bulk electronic properties and infinitesimally thin boundaries. However, due to the quantum nature of electrons, interfaces have a finite thickness. Non-classical surface effects become increasingly important as ever smaller nanoscale systems are realized and eventually dominate over volume-related phenomena. Investigating the response of surface electrons in such systems, therefore, becomes imperative. One way to gain control over non-classical interface effects and study them is through electrical gating, as the static screening charges reside exclusively at the surface. Here, we investigate the modulation of the surface response upon direct electric charging of a single plasmonic nanoresonator by measuring the resulting changes in resonance. We analyze the observed effects within the general framework of surface-response functions and provide a basic model derived from electron spill-out within the local-response approximation (LRA). Our observed change in resonance frequency is well accounted for by assuming a modulation of the in-plane surface current. Surprisingly, we also measure a change in the resonance width, where adding electrons to the surface leads to a narrowing of the plasmonic resonance, i.e., reduced losses. The description of such effects requires considering nonlocal effects and the inclusion of a possible anisotropy of the perturbed surface permittivity. Our experiment, therefore, opens a vast field of investigations on how to gain control over the surface response in plasmonic resonators and to develop ultrafast and extremely small electrically driven plasmonic modulators and metasurfaces by leveraging electrical control over non-classical surface effects.</description>

      <title>Optical reflection signature of an axion dielectric with magnetic current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the reflection properties on the interface between an ordinary dielectric medium and a dielectric supporting a magnetic current (equivalent to a dielectric governed by axion electrodynamics). Considering the usual Maxwell equations and constitutive relations, we derive the general Fresnel coefficients for reflection for an incident wave with $s$ and $p$ polarization, assuming an isotropic magnetic current on a dielectric substrate. We determine all total internal reflection and critical angles (Brewster angles) conditions, which are given by strict relations between all relevant electromagnetic quantities of the system and the frequency. For $s$- and $p$-polarized incident waves, total internal reflection can occur under certain conditions on the constitutive parameters (for each propagating mode) at specific frequency windows and certain incidence angle intervals. All possible conditions to define critical angles for null reflection are determined. This scenario allows polarization changes by reflection. Considering a $p$-polarized incident wave, the frequency and the Brewster angle, allowing null reflection for both propagating modes, are determined. The Goos-H\"anchen shift and the complex Kerr rotation are also evaluated. The Kerr ellipticity angle presents a frequency-dependent behavior, also reported in Weyl semimetals, having maximum values $\eta_{Kerr}=\pm \pi/4$ for specific values of frequency, which may work as a signature of this axion chiral dielectric.</description>

      <title>Identity-enabled CDMA LiDAR for massively parallel ranging with a single-element receiver</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) have emerged as a crucial tool for high-resolution 3D imaging, particularly in autonomous vehicles, remote sensing, and augmented reality. However, the increasing demand for faster acquisition speed and higher resolution in LiDAR systems has highlighted the limitations of traditional mechanical scanning methods. This study introduces a novel wavelength-multiplexed code-division multiple access (CDMA) parallel laser ranging approach with a single-pixel receiver to address these challenges. By leveraging the unique properties of Gold-sequences in a direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) framework, our design enables comprehensive parallelization in detection and ranging activities to significantly enhance system efficiency and user capacity. The proposed coaxial architecture simplifies hardware requirements using a single avalanche photodiode (APD) for multi-reception, reducing susceptibility to ambient noise and external interferences. We demonstrate 3D imaging at 5 m and 10 m, and the experimental results highlight the capability of our CDMA LiDAR system to achieve 40 parallel ranging channels with centimeter-level depth resolution and an angular resolution of 0.03 degree. Furthermore, our system allows for user identification modulation, enabling identity-based ranging among different users. The robustness of our proposed system against interference and speckle noise and near-far signal problems, combined with its potential for miniaturization and integration into chip-scale optics, presents a promising avenue to develop high-performance, compact LiDAR systems suitable for commercial applications.</description>

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) is an emerging analysis tool across sciences and engineering. Encouraged by the successes of DL in revealing quantitative trends in massive imaging data, we applied this approach to nano-scale deeply sub-diffractional images of propagating polaritonic waves in complex materials. We developed a practical protocol for the rapid regression of images that quantifies the wavelength and the quality factor of polaritonic waves utilizing the convolutional neural network (CNN). Using simulated near-field images as training data, the CNN can be made to simultaneously extract polaritonic characteristics and materials parameters in a timescale that is at least three orders of magnitude faster than common fitting/processing procedures. The CNN-based analysis was validated by examining the experimental near-field images of charge-transfer plasmon polaritons at Graphene/{\alpha}-RuCl3 interfaces. Our work provides a general framework for extracting quantitative information from images generated with a variety of scanning probe methods.</description>

      <title>Electronic interactions in Dirac fluids visualized by nano-terahertz spacetime interference of electron-photon quasiparticles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11502v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultraclean graphene at charge neutrality hosts a quantum critical Dirac fluid of interacting electrons and holes. Interactions profoundly affect the charge dynamics of graphene, which is encoded in the properties of its electron-photon collective modes: surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs). Here we show that polaritonic interference patterns are particularly well suited to unveil the interactions in Dirac fluids by tracking polaritonic interference in time at temporal scales commensurate with the electronic scattering. Spacetime SPP interference patterns recorded in tera-hertz (THz) frequency range provided unobstructed readouts of the group velocity and lifetime of polariton that can be directly mapped onto the electronic spectral weight and the relaxation rate. Our data uncovered prominent departures of the electron dynamics from the predictions of the conventional Fermi-liquid theory. The deviations are particularly strong when the densities of electrons and holes are approximately equal. The proposed spacetime imaging methodology can be broadly applied to probe the electrodynamics of quantum materials.</description>
