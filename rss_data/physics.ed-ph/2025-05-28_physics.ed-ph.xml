      <title>Seeing through the light cone: Visualizing electromagnetic fields in special relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theoretical framework of electromagnetism played a foundational role in Einstein's development of special relativity. To support conceptual understanding, we present a fully special relativistic computer simulation that visualizes electromagnetic fields from the perspective of a moving observer. In this simulation, the user observes electromagnetic phenomena through their past light cone and directly experiences the Lorentz force acting at that spacetime point. The electromagnetic field is computed from the subluminal motion of point charges at the intersection of their worldlines with the observer's past light cone, ensuring causal consistency and Lorentz covariance. This approach offers an interactive and intuitive representation of relativistic electromagnetism. It provides insight into how electric and magnetic fields transform across inertial frames, and serves as a bridge between abstract formalism and physical intuition. The simulation also lends itself to pedagogical use in courses on special relativity or electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Physics Computational Literacy: Programming, modeling and collaboration at the journeyman level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21246v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computation has become an integral part of physics research. However, little is known about how students learn to productively use computation as a tool beyond the introductory level, especially as they transition into physics research. In this study, we apply the theory of Physics Computational Literacy and the Novice-Expert framework to describe the development of expertise in computational physics, as students transition from novice to journeymen computational physicists. We base this description on a thematic analysis of interviews with 13 computational physics master's students with extensive experience using computation. We first describe the most important elements driving the development of computational physics expertise, identifying two distinct transitions of competence during their studies, driven by experience with large computational projects and professional research. We then present an overview of the various skills students attain on this path toward the journeyman level of computational physics expertise. Based on these results, we argue for the need to assist students in collaborative coding and the learning of new tools, as well as the importance of large, scaffolded, computational projects for helping students develop the advanced skills needed for computational research.</description>

      <title>Dissecting Physics Reasoning in Small Language Models: A Multi-Dimensional Analysis from an Educational Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) offer computational efficiency and accessibility, making them promising for educational applications. However, their capacity for complex reasoning, particularly in domains such as physics, remains underexplored. This study investigates the high school physics reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art SLMs (under 4 billion parameters), including instruct versions of Llama 3.2, Phi 4 Mini, Gemma 3, and Qwen series. We developed a comprehensive physics dataset from the OpenStax High School Physics textbook, annotated according to Bloom's Taxonomy, with LaTeX and plaintext mathematical notations. A novel cultural contextualization approach was applied to a subset, creating culturally adapted problems for Asian, African, and South American/Australian contexts while preserving core physics principles. Using an LLM-as-a-judge framework with Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash, we evaluated answer and reasoning chain correctness, along with calculation accuracy. The results reveal significant differences between the SLMs. Qwen 3 1.7B achieved high `answer accuracy' (85%), but `fully correct reasoning' was substantially low (38%). The format of the mathematical notation had a negligible impact on performance. SLMs exhibited varied performance across the physics topics and showed a decline in reasoning quality with increasing cognitive and knowledge complexity. In particular, the consistency of reasoning was largely maintained in diverse cultural contexts, especially by better performing models. These findings indicate that, while SLMs can often find correct answers, their underlying reasoning is frequently flawed, suggesting an overreliance on pattern recognition. For SLMs to become reliable educational tools in physics, future development must prioritize enhancing genuine understanding and the generation of sound, verifiable reasoning chains over mere answer accuracy.</description>

      <title>Covariant Electromagnetism in Past-Light-Cone Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05481v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a manifestly covariant formulation of relativistic electromagnetism, focusing on the computation of electromagnetic fields from moving charges in a manifestly Lorentz-covariant manner. The electromagnetic field at a given spacetime point is determined by the motion of point charges at the intersection of their worldlines with the past light cone of the spacetime point, ensuring causal consistency. This formalism provides a manifestly covariant generalization of the Li\'enard-Wiechert potentials and allows direct implementation on computers. We compare our formulation with standard textbook approaches and analyze its behavior in various physical limits.</description>
