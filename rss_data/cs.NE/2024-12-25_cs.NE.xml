      <title>Foxtsage vs. Adam: Revolution or Evolution in Optimization?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimization techniques are pivotal in neural network training, shaping both predictive performance and convergence efficiency. This study introduces Foxtsage, a novel hybrid optimisation approach that integrates the Hybrid FOX-TSA with Stochastic Gradient Descent for training Multi-Layer Perceptron models. The proposed Foxtsage method is benchmarked against the widely adopted Adam optimizer across multiple standard datasets, focusing on key performance metrics such as training loss, accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and computational time. Experimental results demonstrate that Foxtsage achieves a 42.03% reduction in loss mean (Foxtsage: 9.508, Adam: 16.402) and a 42.19% improvement in loss standard deviation (Foxtsage: 20.86, Adam: 36.085), reflecting enhanced consistency and robustness. Modest improvements in accuracy mean (0.78%), precision mean (0.91%), recall mean (1.02%), and F1-score mean (0.89%) further underscore its predictive performance. However, these gains are accompanied by an increased computational cost, with a 330.87% rise in time mean (Foxtsage: 39.541 seconds, Adam: 9.177 seconds). By effectively combining the global search capabilities of FOX-TSA with the stability and adaptability of SGD, Foxtsage presents itself as a robust and viable alternative for neural network optimization tasks.</description>

      <title>Contemporary implementations of spiking bio-inspired neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extensive development of the field of spiking neural networks has led to many areas of research that have a direct impact on people's lives. As the most bio-similar of all neural networks, spiking neural networks not only allow the solution of recognition and clustering problems (including dynamics), but also contribute to the growing knowledge of the human nervous system. Our analysis has shown that the hardware implementation is of great importance, since the specifics of the physical processes in the network cells affect their ability to simulate the neural activity of living neural tissue, the efficiency of certain stages of information processing, storage and transmission. This survey reviews existing hardware neuromorphic implementations of bio-inspired spiking networks in the "semiconductor", "superconductor" and "optical" domains. Special attention is given to the possibility of effective "hybrids" of different approaches</description>

      <title>Neural auto-association with optimal Bayesian learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural associative memories are single layer perceptrons with fast synaptic learning typically storing discrete associations between pairs of neural activity patterns. Previous works have analyzed the optimal networks under naive Bayes assumptions of independent pattern components and heteroassociation, where the task is to learn associations from input to output patterns. Here I study the optimal Bayesian associative network for auto-association where input and output layers are identical. In particular, I compare performance to different variants of approximate Bayesian learning rules, like the BCPNN (Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network), and try to explain why sometimes the suboptimal learning rules achieve higher storage capacity than the (theoretically) optimal model. It turns out that performance can depend on subtle dependencies of input components violating the ``naive Bayes'' assumptions. This includes patterns with constant number of active units, iterative retrieval where patterns are repeatedly propagated through recurrent networks, and winners-take-all activation of the most probable units. Performance of all learning rules can improve significantly if they include a novel adaptive mechanism to estimate noise in iterative retrieval steps (ANE). The overall maximum storage capacity is achieved again by the Bayesian learning rule with ANE.</description>

      <title>A Many Objective Problem Where Crossover is Provably Indispensable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses theory in evolutionary multiobjective optimisation (EMO) and focuses on the role of crossover operators in many-objective optimisation. The advantages of using crossover are hardly understood and rigorous runtime analyses with crossover are lagging far behind its use in practice, specifically in the case of more than two objectives. We present a many-objective problem class together with a theoretical runtime analysis of the widely used NSGA-III to demonstrate that crossover can yield an exponential speedup on the runtime. In particular, this algorithm can find the Pareto set in expected polynomial time when using crossover while without crossover it requires exponential time to even find a single Pareto-optimal point. To our knowledge, this is the first rigorous runtime analysis in many-objective optimisation demonstrating an exponential performance gap when using crossover for more than two objectives.</description>

      <title>TNNGen: Automated Design of Neuromorphic Sensory Processing Units for Time-Series Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal Neural Networks (TNNs), a special class of spiking neural networks, draw inspiration from the neocortex in utilizing spike-timings for information processing. Recent works proposed a microarchitecture framework and custom macro suite for designing highly energy-efficient application-specific TNNs. These recent works rely on manual hardware design, a labor-intensive and time-consuming process. Further, there is no open-source functional simulation framework for TNNs. This paper introduces TNNGen, a pioneering effort towards the automated design of TNNs from PyTorch software models to post-layout netlists. TNNGen comprises a novel PyTorch functional simulator (for TNN modeling and application exploration) coupled with a Python-based hardware generator (for PyTorch-to-RTL and RTL-to-Layout conversions). Seven representative TNN designs for time-series signal clustering across diverse sensory modalities are simulated and their post-layout hardware complexity and design runtimes are assessed to demonstrate the effectiveness of TNNGen. We also highlight TNNGen's ability to accurately forecast silicon metrics without running hardware process flow.</description>

      <title>DelGrad: Exact event-based gradients in spiking networks for training delays and weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) inherently rely on the timing of signals for representing and processing information. Incorporating trainable transmission delays, alongside synaptic weights, is crucial for shaping these temporal dynamics. While recent methods have shown the benefits of training delays and weights in terms of accuracy and memory efficiency, they rely on discrete time, approximate gradients, and full access to internal variables like membrane potentials. This limits their precision, efficiency, and suitability for neuromorphic hardware due to increased memory requirements and I/O bandwidth demands. To address these challenges, we propose DelGrad, an analytical, event-based method to compute exact loss gradients for both synaptic weights and delays. The inclusion of delays in the training process emerges naturally within our proposed formalism, enriching the model's search space with a temporal dimension. Moreover, DelGrad, grounded purely in spike timing, eliminates the need to track additional variables such as membrane potentials. To showcase this key advantage, we demonstrate the functionality and benefits of DelGrad on the BrainScaleS-2 neuromorphic platform, by training SNNs in a chip-in-the-loop fashion. For the first time, we experimentally demonstrate the memory efficiency and accuracy benefits of adding delays to SNNs on noisy mixed-signal hardware. Additionally, these experiments also reveal the potential of delays for stabilizing networks against noise. DelGrad opens a new way for training SNNs with delays on neuromorphic hardware, which results in less number of required parameters, higher accuracy and ease of hardware training.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks Are Evolutionary Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we reveal the intrinsic duality between graph neural networks (GNNs) and evolutionary algorithms (EAs), bridging two traditionally distinct fields. Building on this insight, we propose Graph Neural Evolution (GNE), a novel evolutionary algorithm that models individuals as nodes in a graph and leverages designed frequency-domain filters to balance global exploration and local exploitation. Through the use of these filters, GNE aggregates high-frequency (diversity-enhancing) and low-frequency (stability-promoting) information, transforming EAs into interpretable and tunable mechanisms in the frequency domain. Extensive experiments on benchmark functions demonstrate that GNE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms such as GA, DE, CMA-ES, SDAES, and RL-SHADE, excelling in complex landscapes, optimal solution shifts, and noisy environments. Its robustness, adaptability, and superior convergence highlight its practical and theoretical value. Beyond optimization, GNE establishes a conceptual and mathematical foundation linking EAs and GNNs, offering new perspectives for both fields. Its framework encourages the development of task-adaptive filters and hybrid approaches for EAs, while its insights can inspire advances in GNNs, such as improved global information propagation and mitigation of oversmoothing. GNE's versatility extends to solving challenges in machine learning, including hyperparameter tuning and neural architecture search, as well as real-world applications in engineering and operations research. By uniting the dynamics of EAs with the structural insights of GNNs, this work provides a foundation for interdisciplinary innovation, paving the way for scalable and interpretable solutions to complex optimization problems.</description>

      <title>SpikingSSMs: Learning Long Sequences with Sparse and Parallel Spiking State Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Known as low energy consumption networks, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have gained a lot of attention within the past decades. While SNNs are increasing competitive with artificial neural networks (ANNs) for vision tasks, they are rarely used for long sequence tasks, despite their intrinsic temporal dynamics. In this work, we develop spiking state space models (SpikingSSMs) for long sequence learning by leveraging on the sequence learning abilities of state space models (SSMs). Inspired by dendritic neuron structure, we hierarchically integrate neuronal dynamics with the original SSM block, meanwhile realizing sparse synaptic computation. Furthermore, to solve the conflict of event-driven neuronal dynamics with parallel computing, we propose a light-weight surrogate dynamic network which accurately predicts the after-reset membrane potential and compatible to learnable thresholds, enabling orders of acceleration in training speed compared with conventional iterative methods. On the long range arena benchmark task, SpikingSSM achieves competitive performance to state-of-the-art SSMs meanwhile realizing on average 90\% of network sparsity. On language modeling, our network significantly surpasses existing spiking large language models (spikingLLMs) on the WikiText-103 dataset with only a third of the model size, demonstrating its potential as backbone architecture for low computation cost LLMs.</description>

      <title>SageAttention2: Efficient Attention with Thorough Outlier Smoothing and Per-thread INT4 Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10958v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although quantization for linear layers has been widely used, its application to accelerate the attention process remains limited. To further enhance the efficiency of attention computation compared to SageAttention while maintaining precision, we propose SageAttention2, which utilizes significantly faster 4-bit matrix multiplication (Matmul) alongside additional precision-enhancing techniques. First, we propose to quantize matrixes $(Q, K)$ to INT4 in a hardware-friendly thread-level granularity and quantize matrixes $(\widetilde P, V)$ to FP8. Second, we propose a method to smooth $Q$, enhancing the accuracy of INT4 $QK$. Third, we propose to use an FP32 Matmul buffer for $PV$ to enhance the accuracy of FP8 $\widetilde PV$. The operations per second (OPS) of SageAttention2 surpass FlashAttention2 and xformers by about 3x and 5x on RTX4090, respectively. Comprehensive experiments confirm that our approach incurs negligible end-to-end metrics loss across diverse models, including those for large language processing, image generation, and video generation. The codes are available at https://github.com/thu-ml/SageAttention.</description>

      <title>Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy-oriented Multi-Modal Meta-Learning for Fine-grained Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fine-grained emotion recognition (FER) plays a vital role in various fields, such as disease diagnosis, personalized recommendations, and multimedia mining. However, existing FER methods face three key challenges in real-world applications: (i) they rely on large amounts of continuously annotated data to ensure accuracy since emotions are complex and ambiguous in reality, which is costly and time-consuming; (ii) they cannot capture the temporal heterogeneity caused by changing emotion patterns, because they usually assume that the temporal correlation within sampling periods is the same; (iii) they do not consider the spatial heterogeneity of different FER scenarios, that is, the distribution of emotion information in different data may have bias or interference. To address these challenges, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy-oriented Multi-modal Meta-learning framework (ST-F2M). Specifically, ST-F2M first divides the multi-modal videos into multiple views, and each view corresponds to one modality of one emotion. Multiple randomly selected views for the same emotion form a meta-training task. Next, ST-F2M uses an integrated module with spatial and temporal convolutions to encode the data of each task, reflecting the spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Then it adds fuzzy semantic information to each task based on generalized fuzzy rules, which helps handle the complexity and ambiguity of emotions. Finally, ST-F2M learns emotion-related general meta-knowledge through meta-recurrent neural networks to achieve fast and robust fine-grained emotion recognition. Extensive experiments show that ST-F2M outperforms various state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and model efficiency. In addition, we construct ablation studies and further analysis to explore why ST-F2M performs well.</description>

      <title>CwA-T: A Channelwise AutoEncoder with Transformer for EEG Abnormality Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are critical for detecting abnormal brain activity, but their high dimensionality and complexity pose significant challenges for effective analysis. In this paper, we propose CwA-T, a novel framework that combines a channelwise CNN-based autoencoder with a single-head transformer classifier for efficient EEG abnormality detection. The channelwise autoencoder compresses raw EEG signals while preserving channel independence, reducing computational costs and retaining biologically meaningful features. The compressed representations are then fed into the transformer-based classifier, which efficiently models long-term dependencies to distinguish between normal and abnormal signals. Evaluated on the TUH Abnormal EEG Corpus, the proposed model achieves 85.0% accuracy, 76.2% sensitivity, and 91.2% specificity at the per-case level, outperforming baseline models such as EEGNet, Deep4Conv, and FusionCNN. Furthermore, CwA-T requires only 202M FLOPs and 2.9M parameters, making it significantly more efficient than transformer-based alternatives. The framework retains interpretability through its channelwise design, demonstrating great potential for future applications in neuroscience research and clinical practice.
