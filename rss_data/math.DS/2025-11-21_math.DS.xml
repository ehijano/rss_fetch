      <title>Nilpotent Holomorphic Foliations on $(\mathbb{C}^n,\mathbf{0})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study nilpotent holomorphic foliations in complex dimension $n+1$, at the origin, defined by germs of integrable 1-forms whose linear part is given by \(zdz\). These foliations generalize the classical nilpotent foliations in dimension two. We show that every nilpotent foliation in higher dimensions can be described as the pullback of Takens' normal form, which naturally leads to the existence of cuspidal hypersurfaces as invariant sets.
  We focus on the case where the separatrix is a quasi-ordinary cuspidal hypersurface, and we provide a characterization of those foliations that are of generalized hypersurface type. Furthermore, we recall the Newton polyhedron of a foliation and prove that, for foliations with a quasi-ordinary cuspidal separatrix, being of generalized hypersurface type is equivalent to the coincidence of the Newton polyhedra of the foliation and its separatrix. This provides a new criterion that extends previous results studied by Fern\'andez-S\'anchez and J. Mozo (2006), and later partially generalized by the second-named author.</description>

      <title>Constructing bounded orbits of special types on homogeneous spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X = G/\Gamma$ be a quotient of a real Lie group by a non-uniform lattice. Consider a one-parameter subgroup $F$ of $G$ that is $\operatorname{Ad}$-diagonalizable over $\mathbb{C}$ and whose action on $(X,m_X)$ is mixing. In this dynamical system we study the set of points $x \in X$ with a precompact orbit, written as $E(F,\infty)$, which is known to be a dense subset of $X$ of full Hausdorff dimension. We prove that $E(F,\infty)$ is indecomposable in the following sense: given any $y \in E(F,\infty)$, the set of $x \in E(F,\infty)$ for which $y \in \overline{F_+x}$, where $F_+$ denotes the positive ray in $F$, is uncountable and dense in $E(F,\infty)$. When the dimension of the neutral subgroup of $G$ with respect to $F$ is $1$ we demonstrate, for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$, the existence of many points $x \in X$ whose orbit closure $\overline{F_+x} \subset X$ is compact and has Hausdorff dimension at least $\dim X - \varepsilon$.</description>

      <title>Random Attractors for McKean-Vlasov SDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we mainly focus on the existence of random attractors for McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations on a separable Hilbert space $H$. A significant challenge arises from the distribution-dependence of the coefficients, thereby causing the lack of the stochastic flow property on $H$. To address this issue, we first transform the original equation into a system on the product space $H \times \mathcal{P}(H)$ and consider the existence of random attractors on this space. We then analyze cocycles associated with two parametric dynamical systems. Within this framework, we define the corresponding pullback random attractor and develop a general theory for the existence of random attractors for such cocycles. Finally, we apply our theoretical results to McKean-Vlasov stochastic ordinary differential equations, McKean-Vlasov stochastic reaction-diffusion equations, and McKean-Vlasov stochastic 2D Navier-Stokes equations. In the case where the attractor reduces to a singleton set $\mathcal{A}(\omega):=(\xi(\omega),\mu_\infty)$, we show that $\xi$ corresponds to the stationary solution for the decoupled SPDE,satisfying $\mathbb{P}\circ[\xi]^{-1}=\mu_\infty$.</description>

      <title>Sequential dichotomies and uniformities for a neutral equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential dichotomies of general delay equations are not uniform, which was proved two decades ago. This however reminds whether the countably infinite many dichotomies of a neutral equation have the sequential uniformity. In this paper, considering a scalar neutral equation, we give a negative answer and prove that the series of the projections of dichotomies is divergent.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Analysis of the Random Spectral Radius for a Matrix Family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate joint spectral characteristics of a family of matrices $\mathcal{F}$, associated with products in the semigroup generated by $\mathcal{F}$. In the literature, extremal measures such as the well-known joint spectral radius and the lower spectral radius have been extensively studied. However, these measures fail to capture the typical growth rate of matrix products, focusing instead on the worst and best-case scenarios. Nevertheless, when examining, for instance, a switching dynamical system, a probabilistic rate of growth, which characterizes typical trajectories, emerges as a highly intriguing and significant measure.
  In this article, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first rigorous analysis of the random spectral radius. This joint spectral characteristic is computed on the set of length-$n$ products from a semigroup by random sampling according to a given probability measure. We establish asymptotic results-including a Law of Large Numbers and a Central Limit Theorem-for cases where the matrices are either diagonal (equivalently, commuting), upper- or lower-triangular, or small perturbations of diagonal matrices.
  Subsequently, we provide numerical evidence that the random spectral radius of arbitrary (that is structurally unconstrained) families of matrices exhibits asymptotic behavior similar to that of diagonal or nearly diagonal matrix families.</description>

      <title>Numerical Transitivity and Numerical Leo Properties for Lorenz Maps with Applications to Courbage-Nekorkin-Vdovin Neuron Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research investigates the dynamic behavior of one dimensional discrete systems using two computational algorithms, the numerical transitivity and the numerical locally eventually onto (LEO) tests. Both algorithms are systematically applied to a variety of interval maps, including classical examples such as beta transformations and expanding Lorenz maps, in order to assess and characterize their chaotic dynamics. We perform a detailed comparison of the two methods in terms of accuracy, computational efficiency, and their sensitivity in detecting transitions between regular and chaotic regimes. Particular emphasis is placed on the Courbage Nekorkin Vdovin (CNV) model of a single neuron, known for its rich, spiking like dynamics and its mathematical reducibility to Lorenz type maps. By analyzing both the piecewise linear and nonlinear versions of the CNV model, we illustrate how the proposed numerical tests reliably capture qualitative changes in the system dynamics, focusing on the onset of chaos and chaotic regimes. The results highlight the practical potential of these numerical approaches as diagnostic tools for studying complex dynamical systems arising in nonlinear science and mathematical neuroscience.</description>

      <title>Selfconsistent Transfer Operators for Heterogeneous Coupled Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of large heterogeneous network dynamical systems composed of nonlocally coupled chaotic maps. We show that the mean-field limit of such systems is governed by a suitably defined Self-Consistent Transfer Operator (STO) acting on graphons, describing the infinite-size limits of dense graphs, thereby allowing for a rigorous analysis of the system as the network size tends to infinity. We construct appropriate functional spaces on which the STO has an attracting fixed point, which corresponds to the equilibrium state for the mean-field limit, and we draw a connection between the regularity properties of the graphons and the regularity of the fixed points. This work combines operator theory and graph limits tools to offer a framework for understanding emergent behavior in complex networks.</description>

      <title>Interplay between Quantitative Aspects of Locally Conformally Symplectic Geometry and Contact Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate quantitative properties of exact locally conformally symplectic (LCS) manifolds, namely the homotheties of the Lee form that still produce an exact LCS form. This gives the notion of elasticity of an exact LCS pair. Using this, we characterize LCS manifolds of the first kind. We then generalize a result of Bazzoni and Marrero on the latter, by showing that an exact LCS manifold of rank one admitting an exact LCS pair, whose complementary of elasticity is bounded, is isomorphic to an LCS mapping torus. Conversely, we show that any LCS mapping tori over a closed contact manifold satisfies this condition, thereby providing a characterization of LCS mapping tori over closed contact manifolds. In doing so, we establish a link between the limit values of the elasticity of an LCS mapping torus over a closed contact manifold and the Birkhoff average of the conformal factor of its contactomorphism. As a consequence, we obtain a lower bound on the maxima and an upper bound on the minima of the various conformal factors associated with a contactomorphism on a closed contact manifold.</description>

      <title>A Hamiltonian approach for point vortices on non-orientable surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.06160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the motion of point vortices on the Mobius band and Klein bottle. Since these are non-orientable surfaces, the standard Hamiltonian approach does not apply. We therefore begin by establishing a modified Hamiltonian approach which works for arbitrary non-orientable surfaces, through describing the phase space, the Hamiltonian and the local equations of motion. We use a combination of twisted functions and oriented double covers to adapt some of the known notions of vortex dynamics to non-orientable surfaces. For both of the surfaces of interest, we write Hamiltonian-type equations of vortex motion explicitly and follow that by the description of relative equilibria and an investigation of the motion of one and two vortices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Markov tree-shifts given by $k$ transition matrices, one for each of its $k$ directions. We provide a method to characterize the complexity function for these tree-shifts, used to calculate the tree entropies defined by Ban and Chang arXiv:1509.08325 and Petersen and Salama arXiv:1712.02251. Moreover, we compare these definitions of entropy in order to determine some of their properties. The characterization of the complexity function provided is used to calculate the entropy of some examples. The question of existence of a specific type of invariant measures for such tree-shifts is addressed. Finally, we analyse some topological properties introduced by Ban and Chang arXiv:1509.01355 for the purpose of answering two of the questions raised by these authors.</description>

      <title>Limit Laws for Poincar\'e Recurrence and the Shrinking Target Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(X,T,\mu,d)$ be a metric measure-preserving system. If $B(x,r_n(x))$ is a sequence of balls such that, for each $n$, the measure of $B(x,r_n(x))$ is constant, then we obtain a self-norming CLT for recurrence for systems satisfying a multiple decorrelation property. When $\mu$ is absolutely continuous, we obtain a distributional limit law for recurrence for the sequence of balls $B(x,r_n)$. In the latter case, the density of the limiting distribution is an average over Gaussian densities. An important assumption in the CLT for recurrence is that the CLT holds for the shrinking target problem. Because of this, we also prove an ASIP for expanding and Axiom A systems for non-autonomous H\"older observables and apply it to the shrinking target problem, thereby obtaining a CLT.</description>

      <title>Finite and infinite invariant measures for adic transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We classify the invariant Borel measures for adic transformations, where the alphabets have bounded size and the measure is finite on the path space of some sub-Bratteli diagram.
  We develop a nonstationary version of the Frobenius normal form for a reducible matrix, present an appropriate nonstationary notion of distinguished eigenvector, and prove a nonstationary Frobenius--Victory theorem. This parallels the approach to the stationary case developed by Bezuglyi, Kwiatkowski, Medynets and Solomyak in arXiv:0812.1088 where they classify the locally finite invariant measures. In later work, they also address the nonstationary case. We extend this in two ways. Firstly, in both the stationary and nonstationary settings, we allow for measures which are locally infinite, motivating this extension with examples. Secondly we give a complete classification, presenting a necessary and sufficient condition for a measure which is finite on some subdiagram to be infinite for the original diagram. As part of our program, we introduce a related object called an adic tower and a construction called the canonical cover of the subdiagram: if the measure is finite on the subdiagram but locally infinite on the original space it will be locally finite on the cover space, though the path spaces for the original diagram and the cover are measure-theoretically isomorphic. Our examples include two new models for the Integer Cantor Set transformation of [Fisher1992], one locally finite and one locally infinite, which lead to a new class of examples related to fractal sets of integers: nested circle rotations, where one rotation is embedded in another. The resulting tower measure inside the original rotation can have finite or infinite total mass as determined by our general criterion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study planar bicycle dynamics via the rotation number function associated with a closed front track and bicycle length R. We prove that mode-locking plateaus occur only at integer rotation numbers and that the rotation number function is real-analytic off resonance. From the rotation number function we introduce two new geometric invariants: the critical B-length (right end of the first plateau) and the turning B-length (left end of the maximal monotone interval). We prove that, for a star-shaped curve, these invariants coincide, yielding a sharp transition of the bicycle monodromy: hyperbolic for R below the critical B-length and elliptic for R above it. The proofs combine projectivized SU(1,1) dynamics with Riccati equations and rotation-number theory.</description>

      <title>Congruence counting in Schottky and continued fractions semigroups of $\operatorname{SO}(n, 1)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.00545v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the two settings we are concerned with are $\Gamma &lt; \operatorname{SO}(n, 1)$ a Zariski dense Schottky semigroup and $\Gamma &lt; \operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb C)$ a Zariski dense continued fractions semigroup. In both settings, we prove a uniform asymptotic counting formula for the associated congruence subsemigroups, generalizing the work of Magee-Oh-Winter [arXiv:1601.03705] in $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb R)$ to higher dimensions. Superficially, the proof requires two separate strategies: the expander machinery of Golsefidy-Varj\'u, based on the work of Bourgain-Gamburd-Sarnak, and Dolgopyat's method. However, there are several challenges in higher dimensions. Firstly, using the expander machinery requires a key input: the Zariski density and full trace field property of the return trajectory subgroups, newly introduced in [arXiv:2006.07787]. Secondly, we need to adapt Stoyanov's version of Dolgopyat's method to circumvent some technical issues while the main difficulty is to prove the key inputs: the local non-integrability condition (LNIC) and the non-concentration property (NCP).</description>

      <title>Fredholm Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09484v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the family of explainable machine-learning, we present Fredholm neural networks (Fredholm NNs): deep neural networks (DNNs) architectures motivated by fixed- point iteration schemes for the solution of linear and nonlinear Fredholm integral equations (FIEs) of the second kind. We also show how the proposed framework can be used for the solution of inverse problems. Applications of FIEs include the solution of ordinary, as well as partial differential equations (ODEs, PDEs) and many more. We first prove that Fredholm NNs provide accurate solutions. We then provide insight into the values of the hyperparameters and trainable/explainable weights and biases of the DNN, by directly connecting their values to the underlying mathematical theory. For our illustrations, we use Fredholm NNs to solve both linear and nonlinear problems, including elliptic PDEs and boundary value problems. We show that the proposed scheme achieves significant numerical approximation accuracy across both the domain and boundary. The proposed methodology provides insight into the connection between neural networks and classical numerical methods, and we posit that it can have applications in fields such as Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). Thus, we believe that it will trigger further advances in the intersection between scientific machine learning and numerical analysis.</description>

      <title>Rational approximation with chosen numerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08335v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of approaching real numbers with rational numbers with prime denominator and with a single numerator allowed for each denominator. We obtain basic results, both probabilistic and deterministic, draw connections to twisted diophantine approximation, and present a simple application, related to possible correlations between trace functions and dynamical sequences.</description>

      <title>Candidate Voter Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We model dynamically changing candidate positions in the face of a dynamic electorate. To formulate our equations, we use a space-time-continuous Hegselmann-Krause equation, which we solve using a particle method. We use the combined candidate-voter model to demonstrate the possibility of discontinuous jumps in candidate behavior as parameters of the model are varied. We also extend the analysis to a three candidate scenario. We observe that depending on the parameters, candidates do not always come or stay together at their dynamically evolving position.</description>

      <title>MMP for generalized foliated threefolds of rank one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the minimal model program (MMP) for generalized foliated threefolds $(X, \mathcal{F}, B, \mathbf{M})$ of rank 1, extending the result of Cascini and Spicer in [CS25d]. As an application of the generalized foliated MMP, we prove a base-point-free theorem for foliated triples on threefolds. We also prove the ACC for log canonical thresholds for generalized foliated threefolds of rank 1.</description>

      <title>On the irrationality exponent of real numbers with low complexity expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\xi$ be a real number and $b \ge 2$ an integer. We study the relationship between the irrationality exponent of $\xi$ and the subword complexity $p(n, \mathbf{x})$ of the $b$-ary expansion $\mathbf{x}$ of $\xi$, where $p(n, \mathbf{x})$ counts the number of distinct blocks of length $n$ in $\mathbf{x}$, for $n \ge 1$. If the irrationality exponent of $\xi$ is equal to $2$, which is the case for almost all real numbers $\xi$, we show that the limit superior of the sequence $(p(n, \mathbf{x}) / n)_{n \ge 1}$ is at least equal to 4/3. The proof is based on a careful study of the evolution of the Rauzy graphs of infinite words of low complexity.</description>

      <title>Twisted operator algebras of self-similar groupoid actions on arbitrary graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study self-similar groupoid actions on arbitrary directed graphs together with $\mathbb{T}$-valued twists that exhaust the second cohomology group of the associated Zappa-Sz\'ep product category. We define and analyse the associated universal, reduced, and essential $C^*$-algebras, along with their Toeplitz versions and core subalgebras. In fact, we develop our theory in the more general setting of $L^P$-operator algebras, where $P\subseteq [1,\infty]$ is any non-empty set of parameters. This includes $C^*$-algebras, $L^p$-operator algebras and symmetrised $L^{p,*}$-operator algebras for $p\in [1,\infty]$, as special cases.
  We use three complementary approaches: twisted inverse semigroups, twisted ample groupoids, and $C^*$-correspondences. We provide, in terms of the self-similar action, general characterisations of topological freeness, minimality, Hausdorffness, finite non-Hausdorffness, effectiveness, and local contractiveness for the associated ample groupoids. We generalise the classical Cuntz--Krieger Uniqueness and Coburn--Toeplitz Uniqueness Theorems for graph $C^*$-algebras to twisted $L^P$-operator algebras of self-similar groupoid actions. We characterise when the natural inclusions are Cartan, give checkable criteria for simplicity and pure infiniteness of the essential algebras, and discuss when the universal and reduced algebras coincide.
  We also provide conditions that ensure the singular ideals vanish. Using the groupoid model we show that for any $P\subseteq [1,\infty]$, the $L^P$-operator algebra of a contracting self-similar action is simple if and only if the corresponding Steinberg algebra is simple. Using the Toeplitz-Pimsner model, we prove that for the universal groupoid of any self-similar groupoid action on a row-finite graph, the singular $C^*$-algebraic ideal always vanishes.</description>

      <title>Discrete Event System Modeling of Neuromorphic Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Excitable neuromorphic circuits are physical models of event behaviors: their continuous-time trajectories consist of sequences of discrete events. This paper explores the possibility of extracting a discrete-event model out of the physical continuous-time model. We discuss the potential of this methodology for analysis and design of neuromorphic control systems.</description>
