      <title>Partially compactified quantum cluster algebras and coordinate rings of simple algebraic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The construction of partially compactified cluster algebras on coordinate rings is handled by using codimension 2 arguments on cluster covers. An analog of this in the quantum situation is highly desirable but has not been found yet. In this paper, we present a general method for the construction of partially compactified quantum cluster algebra structures on quantized coordinate rings from that of quantum cluster algebra structures on localizations. As an application, we construct a partially compactified quantum cluster algebra structure on the quantized coordinate ring of every connected, simply connected complex simple algebraic group. Along the way, we also prove that the Berenstein--Zelevinsky seeds on a quantum double Bruhat cell associated to arbitrary unshuffled signed words can be obtained from each other by successive mutations.</description>

      <title>Inclusions of Operator Algebras from Tensor Categories: beyond irreducibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive faithful inclusions of C*-algebras from a coend-type construction in unitary tensor categories. This gives rise to different potential notions of discreteness for an inclusion in the non-irreducible case, and provides a unified framework that encloses the theory of compact quantum group actions. We also provide examples coming from semi-circular systems and from factorization homology. In the irreducible case, we establish conditions under which the C*-discrete and W*-discrete conditions are equivalent.</description>

      <title>Relative braid group symmetries on $\imath$quantum groups of Kac-Moody type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.12860v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, relative braid group actions on $\imath$quantum groups of arbitrary finite types have been constructed by Wang and the author. In this paper, we extend that construction to $\imath$quantum groups of Kac-Moody type. We formulate root vectors for $\imath$quantum groups in both recursive forms and closed $\imath$divided power forms. We show that the relative braid group symmetries send root vectors to root vectors.</description>

      <title>Associated varieties of simple affine VOAs $L_k(sl_3)$ and $W$-algebras $W_k(sl_3,f)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03552v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we first prove that the maximal ideal of the universal affine vertex operator algebra $V^k(sl_n)$ for $k=-n+\frac{n-1}{q}$ is generated by two singular vectors of conformal weight $3q$ if $n=3$, and by one singular vector of conformal weight $2q$ if $n\geq 4$. We next determine the associated varieties of the simple vertex operator algebras $L_k(sl_3)$ for all the non-admissible levels $k=-3+\frac{2}{2m+1}$, $m\geq 0$. The varieties of the associated simple affine $W$-algebras $W_k(sl_3,f)$, for nilpotent elements $f$ of $sl_3$, are also determined.</description>

      <title>Analytic Conformal Blocks of $C_2$-cofinite Vertex Operator Algebras II: Convergence of Sewing and Higher Genus Pseudo-$q$-traces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07707v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb V=\bigoplus_{n\in\mathbb N}\mathbb V(n)$ be a $C_2$-cofinite vertex operator algebra. We prove the convergence of Segal's sewing of conformal blocks associated to analytic families of pointed compact Riemann surfaces and grading-restricted generalized $\mathbb V^{\otimes N}$-modules (where $N=1,2,\dots$) that are not necessarily tensor products of $\mathbb V$-modules, generalizing significantly the results on convergence in [Gui23].
  We show that ``higher genus pseudo-$q$-traces" (called pseudo-sewing in this article) can be recovered from Segal's sewing. Therefore, our result on the convergence of Segal's sewing implies the convergence of pseudo-sewing, and hence covers both the convergence of genus-$0$ sewing in [HLZ12] and the convergence of pseudo-$q$-traces in [Miy04] and [Fio16].
  Using a similar method, we also prove the convergence of Virasoro uniformization, i.e., the convergence of conformal blocks deformed by non-automomous meromorphic vector fields near the marked points. The local freeness of the analytic sheaves of conformal blocks is a consequence of this convergence. It will be used in the third paper of this series to prove the sewing-factorization theorem.</description>

      <title>Analytic Conformal Blocks of $C_2$-cofinite Vertex Operator Algebras III: The Sewing-Factorization Theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb V=\bigoplus_{n\in\mathbb N}\mathbb V(n)$ be a $C_2$-cofinite VOA, not necessarily rational or self-dual. In this paper, we establish various versions of the sewing-factorization (SF) theorems for conformal blocks associated to grading-restricted generalized modules of $\mathbb V^{\otimes N}$ (where $N\in\mathbb N$). In addition to the versions announced in the Introduction of [GZ23], we prove the following coend version of the SF theorem:
  Let $\mathfrak F$ be a compact Riemann surface with $N$ incoming and $R$ outgoing marked points, and let $\mathfrak G$ be another compact Riemann surface with $K$ incoming and $R$ outgoing marked points. Assign $\mathbb W\in\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb V^{\otimes N})$ and $\mathbb X\in\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb V^{\otimes K})$ to the incoming marked points of $\mathfrak F$ and $\mathfrak G$ respectively. For each $\mathbb{M} \in \mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb{V}^{\otimes R})$, assign $\mathbb{M}$ and its contragredient $\mathbb M'$ to the outgoing marked points of $\mathfrak F$ and $\mathfrak G$ respectively. Denote the corresponding spaces of conformal blocks by $\mathscr T_{\mathfrak F}^*(\mathbb M\otimes\mathbb W)$ and $\mathscr T_{\mathfrak{G}}^*(\mathbb M'\otimes\mathbb X)$. Let the $\mathfrak X$ be the $(N+K)$-pointed surface obtained by sewing $\mathfrak F$, $\mathfrak G$ along their outgoing marked points. Then the sewing of conformal blocks-proved to be convergent in [GZ24]-yields an isomorphism of vector spaces $$\int^{\mathbb{M}\in\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb V^{\otimes R})}\mathscr T_{\mathfrak F}^*(\mathbb M\otimes\mathbb{W})\otimes_{\mathbb C} \mathscr T_{\mathfrak G}^*(\mathbb M'\otimes \mathbb X)\simeq\mathscr T_{\mathfrak X}^*(\mathbb W\otimes \mathbb X)$$
  We also discuss the relation between conformal blocks and the modular functors defined using Lyubashenko's coend in the case where $\mathbb V$ is strongly finite and rigid.</description>

      <title>Efficient Sampling for Pauli Measurement-Based Shadow Tomography in Direct Fidelity Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03512v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A constant number of random Clifford measurements allows the classical shadow protocol to perform direct fidelity estimation (DFE) with high precision. However, estimating properties of an unknown quantum state is expected to be more feasible with random Pauli measurements than with random Clifford measurements in the near future. Inspired by the importance sampling technique applied to sampling Pauli measurements for DFE, we show that similar strategies can be derived from classical shadows. Specifically, we describe efficient methods using only local Pauli measurements to perform DFE with GHZ, W, and Dicke states, establishing tighter bounds (by factor of $14.22$ and $16$ for GHZ and W, respectively) on the number of measurements required for desired precision. These protocols are derived by adjusting the distribution of observables. Notably, they require no preprocessing steps other than the sampling algorithms.</description>

      <title>Diamond of triads</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The triad refers to embedding of two systems of polynomials, symmetric ones and those of the Baker-Akhiezer type into a power series of the Noumi-Shiraishi type. It provides an alternative definition of Macdonald theory and its extensions. The basic triad is associated with the vector representation of the Ding-Iohara-Miki (DIM) algebra. We discuss lifting this triad to two elliptic generalizations and further to the bi-elliptic triad. At the algebraic level, it corresponds to elliptic and bi-elliptic DIM algebras. This completes the list of polynomials associated with Seiberg-Witten theory with adjoint matter in various dimensions.</description>

      <title>The Mathematics of Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I report the existence of exactly one non-trivial solution to the equation $i(A,B)+i(A,\neg B)+i(\neg A,B)+i(\neg A,\neg B)= 0$, where $i(A,B)=\log\frac{P(A\text{ and }B)}{P(A)P(B)}$, and $P(A)$ is the probability of the proposition $A$. The equation specifies an information balance condition between two logical propositions, which is satisfied only by independence and by this new solution. The solution is a new elementary informational relationship between logical propositions, which we denote as $A \sim B$.
  The $\sim$ relation cannot be expressed as a relationship between probabilities without the use of complex numbers. It can, however, be greatly simplified by expressing each proposition as a combination of a question and an answer, for example, writing, ``All men are mortal'', as (Are all men mortal?, Yes).
  We will study the mathematics of questions and find out what role the $\sim$ relationship plays inside the algebra. We will find that, like propositions, questions can act on probability distributions. A proposition, $X$, can be given, setting $P(X)$ to 1. The question of $X$ can be raised, setting $P(X)$ to $1/2$. Giving the proposition adds information to the probability distribution, but raising the question takes information away. Introducing questions into probability theory makes it possible to represent subtraction of information as well as addition.
  We will examine how questions can be related to each other geometrically. Remarkably, the simplest way of orienting questions in space has the same structure as the simplest quantum system -- the two-state system. We will find that the essential mathematical structure of the two-state quantum system can be derived from the mathematics of questions, including non-commutativity, complementarity, wavefunction collapse, the Hilbert space representation and the Born rule, as well as quantum entanglement and non-locality.</description>
