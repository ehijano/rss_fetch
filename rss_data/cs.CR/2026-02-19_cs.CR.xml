      <title>From Tool Orchestration to Code Execution: A Study of MCP Design Choices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model Context Protocols (MCPs) provide a unified platform for agent systems to discover, select, and orchestrate tools across heterogeneous execution environments. As MCP-based systems scale to incorporate larger tool catalogs and multiple concurrently connected MCP servers, traditional tool-by-tool invocation increases coordination overhead, fragments state management, and limits support for wide-context operations. To address these scalability challenges, recent MCP designs have incorporated code execution as a first-class capability, an approach called Code Execution MCP (CE-MCP). This enables agents to consolidate complex workflows, such as SQL querying, file analysis, and multi-step data transformations, into a single program that executes within an isolated runtime environment. In this work, we formalize the architectural distinction between context-coupled (traditional) and context-decoupled (CE-MCP) models, analyzing their fundamental scalability trade-offs. Using the MCP-Bench framework across 10 representative servers, we empirically evaluate task behavior, tool utilization patterns, execution latency, and protocol efficiency as the scale of connected MCP servers and available tools increases, demonstrating that while CE-MCP significantly reduces token usage and execution latency, it introduces a vastly expanded attack surface. We address this security gap by applying the MAESTRO framework, identifying sixteen attack classes across five execution phases-including specific code execution threats such as exception-mediated code injection and unsafe capability synthesis. We validate these vulnerabilities through adversarial scenarios across multiple LLMs and propose a layered defense architecture comprising containerized sandboxing and semantic gating. Our findings provide a rigorous roadmap for balancing scalability and security in production-ready executable agent workflows.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Tabletop Exercise (TTX) based on a Mathematical Simulation-based Model for the Maritime Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As cyber threats grow in complexity and scale, many security incidents remain poorly managed due to the lack of proper training among C-level executives. Thus, there is a need for targeted cybersecurity education to enhance executive decision-making and crisis response. Traditional training methods, such as cyber wargames and Tabletop Exercises (TTX), aim to develop abilities to face critical incidents, however, they often lack the interactive and dynamic elements required to prepare individuals for real-world cyber incidents. This paper presents a novel approach to cybersecurity and cyberdefense education through the design of a specialized hybrid TTX for the maritime domain, which uses a framework to model mathematically how a cyberattack spreads along multiple nodes and impacts infrastructure. Our proposal was validated through exercises in Argentina and the United States, demonstrating a positive impact in developing the comprehension and projection levels of Cyber Situational Awareness (CSA), and reinforcing governance. Documentation about the Hybrid TTX, scenario, datasets and implementation of the SERDUX-MARCIM model, is available at the project repository at https://github.com/diegocabuya/SERDUX-MARCIM</description>

      <title>Collaborative Zone-Adaptive Zero-Day Intrusion Detection for IoBT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT) relies on heterogeneous, bandwidth-constrained, and intermittently connected tactical networks that face rapidly evolving cyber threats. In this setting, intrusion detection cannot depend on continuous central collection of raw traffic due to disrupted links, latency, operational security limits, and non-IID traffic across zones. We present Zone-Adaptive Intrusion Detection (ZAID), a collaborative detection and model-improvement framework for unseen attack types, where "zero-day" refers to previously unobserved attack families and behaviours (not vulnerability disclosure timing). ZAID combines a universal convolutional model for generalisable traffic representations, an autoencoder-based reconstruction signal as an auxiliary anomaly score, and lightweight adapter modules for parameter-efficient zone adaptation. To support cross-zone generalisation under constrained connectivity, ZAID uses federated aggregation and pseudo-labelling to leverage locally observed, weakly labelled behaviours. We evaluate ZAID on ToN_IoT using a zero-day protocol that excludes MITM, DDoS, and DoS from supervised training and introduces them during zone-level deployment and adaptation. ZAID achieves up to 83.16% accuracy on unseen attack traffic and transfers to UNSW-NB15 under the same procedure, with a best accuracy of 71.64%. These results indicate that parameter-efficient, zone-personalised collaboration can improve the detection of previously unseen attacks in contested IoBT environments.</description>

      <title>Federated Graph AGI for Cross-Border Insider Threat Intelligence in Government Financial Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-border insider threats pose a critical challenge to government financial schemes, particularly when dealing with distributed, privacy-sensitive data across multiple jurisdictions. Existing approaches face fundamental limitations: they cannot effectively share intelligence across borders due to privacy constraints, lack reasoning capabilities to understand complex multi-step attack patterns, and fail to capture intricate graph-structured relationships in financial networks. We introduce FedGraph-AGI, a novel federated learning framework integrating Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) reasoning with graph neural networks for privacy-preserving cross-border insider threat detection. Our approach combines: (1) federated graph neural networks preserving data sovereignty; (2) Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) aggregation for heterogeneous jurisdictions; and (3) AGI-powered reasoning via Large Action Models (LAM) performing causal inference over graph data. Through experiments on a 50,000-transaction dataset across 10 jurisdictions, FedGraph-AGI achieves 92.3% accuracy, significantly outperforming federated baselines (86.1%) and centralized approaches (84.7%). Our ablation studies reveal AGI reasoning contributes 6.8% improvement, while MoE adds 4.4%. The system maintains epsilon = 1.0 differential privacy while achieving near-optimal performance and scales efficiently to 50+ clients. This represents the first integration of AGI reasoning with federated graph learning for insider threat detection, opening new directions for privacy-preserving cross-border intelligence sharing.</description>

      <title>Weak Zero-Knowledge and One-Way Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the implications of the existence of weak Zero-Knowledge (ZK) protocols for worst-case hard languages. These are protocols that have completeness, soundness, and zero-knowledge errors (denoted $\epsilon_c$, $\epsilon_s$, and $\epsilon_z$, respectively) that might not be negligible. Under the assumption that there are worst-case hard languages in NP, we show the following:
  1. If all languages in NP have NIZK proofs or arguments satisfying $ \epsilon_c+\epsilon_s+ \epsilon_z &lt; 1 $, then One-Way Functions (OWFs) exist.
  This covers all possible non-trivial values for these error rates. It additionally implies that if all languages in NP have such NIZK proofs and $\epsilon_c$ is negligible, then they also have NIZK proofs where all errors are negligible. Previously, these results were known under the more restrictive condition $ \epsilon_c+\sqrt{\epsilon_s}+\epsilon_z &lt; 1 $ [Chakraborty et al., CRYPTO 2025].
  2. If all languages in NP have $k$-round public-coin ZK proofs or arguments satisfying $ \epsilon_c+\epsilon_s+(2k-1).\epsilon_z &lt; 1 $, then OWFs exist.
  3. If, for some constant $k$, all languages in NP have $k$-round public-coin ZK proofs or arguments satisfying $ \epsilon_c+\epsilon_s+k.\epsilon_z &lt; 1 $, then infinitely-often OWFs exist.</description>

      <title>Quantum Oracle Distribution Switching and its Applications to Fully Anonymous Ring Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ring signatures are a powerful primitive that allows a member to sign on behalf of a group, without revealing their identity. Recently, ring signatures have received additional attention as an ingredient for post-quantum deniable authenticated key exchange, e.g., for a post-quantum version of the Signal protocol, employed by virtually all end-to-end-encrypted messenger services. While several ring signature constructions from post-quantum assumptions offer suitable security and efficiency for use in deniable key exchange, they are currently proven secure in the random oracle model (ROM) only, which is insufficient for post-quantum security.
  In this work, we provide four security reductions in the quantum-accessible random oracle model (QROM) for two generic ring signature constructions: two for the AOS framework and two for a construction paradigm based on ring trapdoors, whose generic backbone we formalize. The two security proofs for AOS ring signatures differ in their requirements on the underlying sigma protocol and their tightness. The two reductions for the ring-trapdoor-based ring signatures exhibit various differences in requirements and the security they provide. We employ the measure-and-reprogram technique, QROM straightline extraction tools based on the compressed oracle, history-free reductions and QROM reprogramming tools. To make use of R\'enyi divergence properties in the QROM, we study the behavior of quantum algorithms that interact with an oracle whose distribution is based on one of two different distributions over the set of outputs. We provide tight bounds for the statistical distance, show that the R\'enyi divergence can not be used to replace the entire oracle and provide a workaround.</description>

      <title>Mind the Gap: Evaluating LLMs for High-Level Malicious Package Detection vs. Fine-Grained Indicator Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prevalence of malicious packages in open-source repositories, such as PyPI, poses a critical threat to the software supply chain. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising tool for automated security tasks, their effectiveness in detecting malicious packages and indicators remains underexplored. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of 13 LLMs for detecting malicious software packages. Using a curated dataset of 4,070 packages (3,700 benign and 370 malicious), we evaluate model performance across two tasks: binary classification (package detection) and multi-label classification (identification of specific malicious indicators). We further investigate the impact of prompting strategies, temperature settings, and model specifications on detection accuracy. We find a significant "granularity gap" in LLMs' capabilities. While GPT-4.1 achieves near-perfect performance in binary detection (F1 $\approx$ 0.99), performance degrades by approximately 41\% when the task shifts to identifying specific malicious indicators. We observe that general models are best for filtering out the majority of threats, while specialized coder models are better at detecting attacks that follow a strict, predictable code structure. Our correlation analysis indicates that parameter size and context width have negligible explanatory power regarding detection accuracy. We conclude that while LLMs are powerful detectors at the package level, they lack the semantic depth required for precise identification at the granular indicator level.</description>

      <title>The Weight of a Bit: EMFI Sensitivity Analysis of Embedded Deep Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fault injection attacks on embedded neural network models have been shown as a potent threat. Numerous works studied resilience of models from various points of view. As of now, there is no comprehensive study that would evaluate the influence of number representations used for model parameters against electromagnetic fault injection (EMFI) attacks.
  In this paper, we investigate how four different number representations influence the success of an EMFI attack on embedded neural network models. We chose two common floating-point representations (32-bit, and 16-bit), and two integer representations (8-bit, and 4-bit). We deployed four common image classifiers, ResNet-18, ResNet-34, ResNet-50, and VGG-11, on an embedded memory chip, and utilized a low-cost EMFI platform to trigger faults. Our results show that while floating-point representations exhibit almost a complete degradation in accuracy (Top-1 and Top-5) after a single fault injection, integer representations offer better resistance overall. Especially, when considering the the 8-bit representation on a relatively large network (VGG-11), the Top-1 accuracies stay at around 70% and the Top-5 at around 90%.</description>

      <title>SRFed: Mitigating Poisoning Attacks in Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning with Heterogeneous Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without exposing clients' private data, and has been widely adopted in privacy-sensitive scenarios. However, FL faces two critical security threats: curious servers that may launch inference attacks to reconstruct clients' private data, and compromised clients that can launch poisoning attacks to disrupt model aggregation. Existing solutions mitigate these attacks by combining mainstream privacy-preserving techniques with defensive aggregation strategies. However, they either incur high computation and communication overhead or perform poorly under non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data settings. To tackle these challenges, we propose SRFed, an efficient Byzantine-robust and privacy-preserving FL framework for Non-IID scenarios. First, we design a decentralized efficient functional encryption (DEFE) scheme to support efficient model encryption and non-interactive decryption. DEFE also eliminates third-party reliance and defends against server-side inference attacks. Second, we develop a privacy-preserving defensive model aggregation mechanism based on DEFE. This mechanism filters poisonous models under Non-IID data by layer-wise projection and clustering-based analysis. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments show that SRFed outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in privacy protection, Byzantine robustness, and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Phase-Based Bit Commitment Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning, a new wave of private information is being flushed into applications. This development raises privacy concerns, as private datasets can be stolen or abused for non-authorized purposes. Secure function computation aims to solve such problems by allowing a service provider to compute functions of datasets in the possession of a a data provider without reading the data itself. A foundational primitive for such tasks is Bit Commitment (BC), which is known to be impossible to realize without added assumptions. Given the pressing nature of the topic, it is thus important to develop BC systems and prove their security under reasonable assumptions. In this work, we provide a novel quantum optical BC protocol that uses the added assumption that the network provider will secure transmission lines against eavesdropping. Under this added assumption, we prove security of our protocol in the honest but curious setting and discuss the hardness of Mayer's attack in the context of our protocol.</description>

      <title>Recursive language models for jailbreak detection: a procedural defense for tool-augmented agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jailbreak prompts are a practical and evolving threat to large language models (LLMs), particularly in agentic systems that execute tools over untrusted content. Many attacks exploit long-context hiding, semantic camouflage, and lightweight obfuscations that can evade single-pass guardrails. We present RLM-JB, an end-to-end jailbreak detection framework built on Recursive Language Models (RLMs), in which a root model orchestrates a bounded analysis program that transforms the input, queries worker models over covered segments, and aggregates evidence into an auditable decision. RLM-JB treats detection as a procedure rather than a one-shot classification: it normalizes and de-obfuscates suspicious inputs, chunks text to reduce context dilution and guarantee coverage, performs parallel chunk screening, and composes cross-chunk signals to recover split-payload attacks. On AutoDAN-style adversarial inputs, RLM-JB achieves high detection effectiveness across three LLM backends (ASR/Recall 92.5-98.0%) while maintaining very high precision (98.99-100%) and low false positive rates (0.0-2.0%), highlighting a practical sensitivity-specificity trade-off as the screening backend changes.</description>

      <title>Policy Compiler for Secure Agentic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16708v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM-based agents are increasingly being deployed in contexts requiring complex authorization policies: customer service protocols, approval workflows, data access restrictions, and regulatory compliance. Embedding these policies in prompts provides no enforcement guarantees. We present PCAS, a Policy Compiler for Agentic Systems that provides deterministic policy enforcement.
  Enforcing such policies requires tracking information flow across agents, which linear message histories cannot capture. Instead, PCAS models the agentic system state as a dependency graph capturing causal relationships among events such as tool calls, tool results, and messages. Policies are expressed in a Datalog-derived language, as declarative rules that account for transitive information flow and cross-agent provenance. A reference monitor intercepts all actions and blocks violations before execution, providing deterministic enforcement independent of model reasoning.
  PCAS takes an existing agent implementation and a policy specification, and compiles them into an instrumented system that is policy-compliant by construction, with no security-specific restructuring required. We evaluate PCAS on three case studies: information flow policies for prompt injection defense, approval workflows in a multi-agent pharmacovigilance system, and organizational policies for customer service. On customer service tasks, PCAS improves policy compliance from 48% to 93% across frontier models, with zero policy violations in instrumented runs.</description>

      <title>NLP Privacy Risk Identification in Social Media (NLP-PRISM): A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) is integral to social media analytics but often processes content containing Personally Identifiable Information (PII), behavioral cues, and metadata raising privacy risks such as surveillance, profiling, and targeted advertising. To systematically assess these risks, we review 203 peer-reviewed papers and propose the NLP Privacy Risk Identification in Social Media (NLP-PRISM) framework, which evaluates vulnerabilities across six dimensions: data collection, preprocessing, visibility, fairness, computational risk, and regulatory compliance. Our analysis shows that transformer models achieve F1-scores ranging from 0.58-0.84, but incur a 1% - 23% drop under privacy-preserving fine-tuning. Using NLP-PRISM, we examine privacy coverage in six NLP tasks: sentiment analysis (16), emotion detection (14), offensive language identification (19), code-mixed processing (39), native language identification (29), and dialect detection (24) revealing substantial gaps in privacy research. We further found a (reduced by 2% - 9%) trade-off in model utility, MIA AUC (membership inference attacks) 0.81, AIA accuracy 0.75 (attribute inference attacks). Finally, we advocate for stronger anonymization, privacy-aware learning, and fairness-driven training to enable ethical NLP in social media contexts.</description>

      <title>Hardware-Agnostic Modeling of Quantum Side-Channel Leakage via Conditional Dynamics and Learning from Full Correlation Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a sequential coherent side-channel model in which an adversarial probe qubit interacts with a target qubit during a hidden gate sequence. Repeating the same hidden sequence for $N$ shots yields an empirical full-correlation record: the joint histogram $\widehat{P}_g(b)$ over probe bit-strings $b\in\{0,1\}^k$, which is a sufficient statistic for classical post-processing under identically and independently distributed (i.i.d.) shots but grows exponentially with circuit depth. We first describe this sequential probe framework in a coupling- and measurement-agnostic form, emphasizing the scaling of the observation space and why exact analytic distinguishability becomes intractable with circuit depth.
  We then specialize to a representative instantiation (a controlled-rotation probe coupling with fixed projective readout and a commuting $R_x$ gate alphabet) where we (i) derive a depth-dependent leakage envelope whose maximizer predicts a "Goldilocks" coupling band as a function of depth, and (ii) provide an operational decoder, via machine learning, a single parameter-conditioned map from $\widehat{P}_g$ to Alice's per-step gate labels, generalizing across coupling and noise settings without retraining. Experiments over broad coupling and noise grids show that strict sequence recovery concentrates near the predicted coupling band and degrades predictably under decoherence and finite-shot estimation.</description>

      <title>A Theoretical Approach to Stablecoin Design via Price Windows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the short- and long-term stability of backed stablecoins offering constant mint and redeem prices to all agents. We refer to such designs as price window-based, since the mint and redeem prices constrain the stablecoin's market equilibrium. We show that, without secondary stabilization mechanisms, price window designs cannot achieve both short- and long-term stability unless they are backed by already-stable reserves. In particular, the mechanism faces a tradeoff: either risk eventual reserve depletion through persistent arbitrage by a speculator, or widen the distance between mint and redeem prices enough to disincentivize arbitrage. In the latter case, however, the market price of the stablecoin inherits the volatility of its backing asset, with fluctuations that can be proportional to the backing asset's own volatility.</description>

      <title>DARTH-PUM: A Hybrid Processing-Using-Memory Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analog processing-using-memory (PUM; a.k.a. in-memory computing) makes use of electrical interactions inside memory arrays to perform bulk matrix-vector multiplication (MVM) operations. However, many popular matrix-based kernels need to execute non-MVM operations, which analog PUM cannot directly perform. To retain its energy efficiency, analog PUM architectures augment memory arrays with CMOS-based domain-specific fixed-function hardware to provide complete kernel functionality, but the difficulty of integrating such specialized CMOS logic with memory arrays has largely limited analog PUM to being an accelerator for machine learning inference, or for closely related kernels. An opportunity exists to harness analog PUM for general-purpose computation: recent works have shown that memory arrays can also perform Boolean PUM operations, albeit with very different supporting hardware and electrical signals than analog PUM.
  We propose DARTH-PUM, a general-purpose hybrid PUM architecture that tackles key hardware and software challenges to integrating analog PUM and digital PUM. We propose optimized peripheral circuitry, coordinating hardware to manage and interface between both types of PUM, an easy-to-use programming interface, and low-cost support for flexible data widths. These design elements allow us to build a practical PUM architecture that can execute kernels fully in memory, and can scale easily to cater to domains ranging from embedded applications to large-scale data-driven computing. We show how three popular applications (AES encryption, convolutional neural networks, large-language models) can map to and benefit from DARTH-PUM, with speedups of 59.4x, 14.8x, and 40.8x over an analog+CPU baseline.</description>

      <title>Managing Credible Anonymous Identities in Web 3.0 Services: A Scalable On-Chain Admission Framework with Recursive Proof Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open Web 3.0 platforms increasingly operate as \emph{service ecosystems} (e.g., DeFi, DAOs, and decentralized social applications) where \emph{admission control} and \emph{account provisioning} must be delivered as an always-on service under bursty demand. Service operators face a fundamental tension: enforcing Sybil resistance (one-person-one-account) while preserving user privacy, yet keeping on-chain verification cost and admission latency predictable at scale. Existing credential-based ZK admission approaches typically require per-request on-chain verification, making the provisioning cost grow with the number of concurrent joiners. We present \textbf{ZK-AMS}, a scalable admission and provisioning layer that bridges real-world \emph{Personhood Credentials} to anonymous on-chain service accounts. ZK-AMS combines (i) zero-knowledge credential validation, (ii) a \emph{permissionless} batch submitter model, and (iii) a decentralized, privacy-preserving folding pipeline that uses Nova-style recursive aggregation together with multi-key homomorphic encryption, enabling batch settlement with \emph{constant} on-chain verification per batch. We implement ZK-AMS end-to-end on an Ethereum testbed and evaluate admission throughput, end-to-end latency, and gas consumption. Results show stable verification cost across batch sizes and substantially improved admission efficiency over non-recursive baselines, providing a practical and cost-predictable admission service for large-scale Web 3.0 communities.</description>

      <title>push0: Scalable and Fault-Tolerant Orchestration for Zero-Knowledge Proof Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zero-knowledge proof generation imposes stringent timing and reliability constraints on blockchain systems. For ZK-rollups, delayed proofs cause finality lag and economic loss; for Ethereum's emerging L1 zkEVM, proofs must complete within the 12-second slot window to enable stateless validation. The Ethereum Foundation's Ethproofs initiative coordinates multiple independent zkVMs across proving clusters to achieve real-time block proving, yet no principled orchestration framework addresses the joint challenges of (i) strict head-of-chain ordering, (ii) sub-slot latency bounds, (iii) fault-tolerant task reassignment, and (iv) prover-agnostic workflow composition. We present push0, a cloud-native proof orchestration system that decouples prover binaries from scheduling infrastructure. push0 employs an event-driven dispatcher--collector architecture over persistent priority queues, enforcing block-sequential proving while exploiting intra-block parallelism. We formalize requirements drawn from production ZK-rollup operations and the Ethereum real-time proving specification, then demonstrate via production Kubernetes cluster experiments that push0 achieves 5 ms median orchestration overhead with 99--100% scaling efficiency at 32 dispatchers for realistic workloads--overhead negligible (less than 0.1%) relative to typical proof computation times of 7+ seconds. Controlled Docker experiments validate these results, showing comparable performance (3--10 ms P50) when network variance is eliminated. Production deployment on the Zircuit zkrollup (14+ million mainnet blocks since March 2025) provides ecological validity for these controlled experiments. Our design enables seamless integration of heterogeneous zkVMs, supports automatic task recovery via message persistence, and provides the scheduling primitives necessary for both centralized rollup operators and decentralized multi-prover networks.</description>

      <title>Learning with Locally Private Examples by Inverse Weierstrass Private Stochastic Gradient Descent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Releasing data once and for all under noninteractive Local Differential Privacy (LDP) enables complete data reusability, but the resulting noise may create bias in subsequent analyses. In this work, we leverage the Weierstrass transform to characterize this bias in binary classification. We prove that inverting this transform leads to a bias-correction method to compute unbiased estimates of nonlinear functions on examples released under LDP. We then build a novel stochastic gradient descent algorithm called Inverse Weierstrass Private SGD (IWP-SGD). It converges to the true population risk minimizer at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/n)$, with $n$ the number of examples. We empirically validate IWP-SGD on binary classification tasks using synthetic and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>A Scalable Approach to Solving Simulation-Based Network Security Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce MetaDOAR, a lightweight meta-controller that augments the Double Oracle / PSRO paradigm with a learned, partition-aware filtering layer and Q-value caching to enable scalable multi-agent reinforcement learning on very large cyber-network environments. MetaDOAR learns a compact state projection from per node structural embeddings to rapidly score and select a small subset of devices (a top-k partition) on which a conventional low-level actor performs focused beam search utilizing a critic agent. Selected candidate actions are evaluated with batched critic forwards and stored in an LRU cache keyed by a quantized state projection and local action identifiers, dramatically reducing redundant critic computation while preserving decision quality via conservative k-hop cache invalidation. Empirically, MetaDOAR attains higher player payoffs than SOTA baselines on large network topologies, without significant scaling issues in terms of memory usage or training time. This contribution provide a practical, theoretically motivated path to efficient hierarchical policy learning for large-scale networked decision problems.</description>

      <title>Arc2Morph: Identity-Preserving Facial Morphing with Arc2Face</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Face morphing attacks are widely recognized as one of the most challenging threats to face recognition systems used in electronic identity documents. These attacks exploit a critical vulnerability in passport enrollment procedures adopted by many countries, where the facial image is often acquired without a supervised live capture process. In this paper, we propose a novel face morphing technique based on Arc2Face, an identity-conditioned face foundation model capable of synthesizing photorealistic facial images from compact identity representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by comparing the morphing attack potential metric on two large-scale sequestered face morphing attack detection datasets against several state-of-the-art morphing methods, as well as on two novel morphed face datasets derived from FEI and ONOT. Experimental results show that the proposed deep learning-based approach achieves a morphing attack potential comparable to that of landmark-based techniques, which have traditionally been regarded as the most challenging. These findings confirm the ability of the proposed method to effectively preserve and manage identity information during the morph generation process.</description>

      <title>Sequential Membership Inference Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern AI models are not static. They go through multiple updates in their lifecycles. Thus, exploiting the model dynamics to create stronger Membership Inference (MI) attacks and tighter privacy audits are timely questions. Though the literature empirically shows that using a sequence of model updates can increase the power of MI attacks, rigorous analysis of the `optimal' MI attacks is limited to static models with infinite samples. Hence, we develop an `optimal' MI attack, SeMI*, that uses the sequence of model updates to identify the presence of a target inserted at a certain update step. For the empirical mean computation, we derive the optimal power of SeMI*, while accessing a finite number of samples with or without privacy. Our results retrieve the existing asymptotic analysis. We observe that having access to the model sequence avoids the dilution of MI signals unlike the existing attacks on the final model, where the MI signal vanishes as training data accumulates. Furthermore, an adversary can use SeMI* to tune both the insertion time and the canary to yield tighter privacy audits. Finally, we conduct experiments across data distributions and models trained or fine-tuned with DP-SGD demonstrating that practical variants of SeMI* lead to tighter privacy audits than the baselines.</description>

      <title>The Role of Common Randomness Replication in Symmetric PIR on Graph-Based Replicated Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In symmetric private information retrieval (SPIR), a user communicates with multiple servers to retrieve from them a message in a database, while not revealing the message index to any individual server (user privacy), and learning no additional information about the database (database privacy). We study the problem of SPIR on graph-replicated database systems, where each node of the graph represents a server and each link represents a message. Each message is replicated at exactly two servers; those at which the link representing the message is incident. To ensure database privacy, the servers share a set of common randomness, independent of the database and the user's desired message index. We study two cases of common randomness distribution to the servers: i) graph-replicated common randomness, and ii) fully-replicated common randomness. Given a graph-replicated database system, in i), we assign one randomness variable independently to every pair of servers sharing a message, while in ii), we assign an identical set of randomness variable to all servers, irrespective of the underlying graph. In both settings, our goal is to characterize the SPIR capacity, i.e., the maximum number of desired message symbols retrieved per downloaded symbol, and quantify the minimum amount of common randomness required to achieve the capacity. To this goal, in setting i), we derive a general lower bound on the SPIR capacity, and show it to be tight for path and regular graphs through a matching converse. Moreover, we establish that the minimum size of common randomness required for SPIR is equal to the message size. In setting ii), the SPIR capacity improves over the first, more restrictive setting. We show this through capacity lower bounds for a class of graphs, by constructing SPIR schemes from PIR schemes.</description>

      <title>VerifiableFL: Verifiable Claims for Federated Learning using Exclaves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10537v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In federated learning (FL), data providers jointly train a machine learning model without sharing their training data. This makes it challenging to provide verifiable claims about the trained FL model, e.g., related to the employed training data, any data sanitization, or the correct training algorithm-a malicious data provider can simply deviate from the correct training protocol without detection. While prior FL training systems have explored the use of trusted execution environments (TEEs) to protect the training computation, such approaches rely on the confidentiality and integrity of TEEs. The confidentiality guarantees of TEEs, however, have been shown to be vulnerable to a wide range of attacks, such as side-channel attacks. We describe VerifiableFL, a system for training FL models that establishes verifiable claims about trained FL models with the help of fine-grained runtime attestation proofs. Since these runtime attestation proofs only require integrity protection, VerifiableFL generates them using the new abstraction of exclaves. Exclaves are integrity-only execution environments, which do not contain software-managed secrets and thus are immune to data leakage attacks. VerifiableFL uses exclaves to attest individual data transformations during FL training without relying on confidentiality guarantees. The runtime attestation proofs then form an attested dataflow graph of the entire FL model training computation. The graph is checked by an auditor to ensure that the trained FL model satisfies its claims, such as the use of data sanitization by data providers or correct aggregation by the model provider. VerifiableFL extends NVFlare FL framework to use exclaves. We show that VerifiableFL introduces less than 12% overhead compared to unprotected FL training.</description>

      <title>Targeting Alignment: Extracting Safety Classifiers of Aligned LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16534v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Alignment in large language models (LLMs) is used to enforce guidelines such as safety. Yet, alignment fails in the face of jailbreak attacks that modify inputs to induce unsafe outputs. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate a new technique for jailbreak attacks. We observe that alignment embeds a safety classifier in the LLM responsible for deciding between refusal and compliance, and seek to extract an approximation of this classifier: a surrogate classifier. To this end, we build candidate classifiers from subsets of the LLM. We first evaluate the degree to which candidate classifiers approximate the LLM's safety classifier in benign and adversarial settings. Then, we attack the candidates and measure how well the resulting adversarial inputs transfer to the LLM. Our evaluation shows that the best candidates achieve accurate agreement (an F1 score above 80%) using as little as 20% of the model architecture. Further, we find that attacks mounted on the surrogate classifiers can be transferred to the LLM with high success. For example, a surrogate using only 50% of the Llama 2 model achieved an attack success rate (ASR) of 70% with half the memory footprint and runtime -- a substantial improvement over attacking the LLM directly, where we only observed a 22% ASR. These results show that extracting surrogate classifiers is an effective and efficient means for modeling (and therein addressing) the vulnerability of aligned models to jailbreaking attacks.

      <title>Bayesian and Multi-Objective Decision Support for Real-Time Incident Mitigation in Critical Infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Critical infrastructure increasingly relies on interconnected cyber-physical systems whose security incidents can escalate rapidly into safety and operational failures. Existing decision-support approaches struggle to support real-time incident response because they rely on static assumptions, incomplete vulnerability data, and single-objective risk models that do not adequately capture trade-offs between attack likelihood, impact severity, and system availability. This paper proposes a real-time, adaptive decision-support framework for incident mitigation in critical infrastructure that combines hierarchical system modelling with Bayesian probabilistic reasoning. The framework leverages probabilistic graphical models (Bayesian Networks) constructed from system architecture and vulnerability data, and employs confidence-calibrated exposure estimation to integrate complementary vulnerability scoring metrics under epistemic uncertainty. Mitigation strategies are explored as countermeasure portfolios and refined using multi-objective optimisation to identify Pareto-optimal trade-offs suitable for time- and resource-constrained response scenarios. Frequency-based heuristics are applied to prioritise robust mitigation actions across optimisation runs. The framework is evaluated on three representative cyber-physical attack scenarios, demonstrating its ability to adapt to evolving threats and provide actionable decision support under real-time constraints, thereby enhancing the operational resilience of critical infrastructure.</description>

      <title>The Trojan Example: Jailbreaking LLMs through Template Filling and Unsafety Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integral to computing infrastructure, safety alignment serves as the primary security control preventing the generation of harmful payloads. However, this defense remains brittle. Existing jailbreak attacks typically bifurcate into white-box methods, which are inapplicable to commercial APIs due to lack of gradient access, and black-box optimization techniques, which often yield unnatural (e.g., syntactically rigid) or non-transferable (e.g., lacking cross-model generalization) prompts. In this work, we introduce TrojFill, a black-box exploitation framework that bypasses safety filters by targeting a fundamental logic flaw in current alignment paradigms: the decoupling of unsafety reasoning from content generation. TrojFill structurally reframes malicious instructions as a template-filling task required for safety analysis. By embedding obfuscated payloads (e.g., via placeholder substitution) into a "Trojan" structure, the attack induces the model to generate prohibited content as a "demonstrative example" ostensibly required for a subsequent sentence-by-sentence safety critique. This approach effectively masks the malicious intent from standard intent classifiers. We evaluate TrojFill against representative commercial systems, including GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5, DeepSeek-3.1, and Qwen-Max. Our results demonstrate that TrojFill achieves near-universal bypass rates: reaching 100% Attack Success Rate (ASR) on Gemini-flash-2.5 and DeepSeek-3.1, and 97% on GPT-4o, significantly outperforming existing black-box baselines. Furthermore, unlike optimization-based adversarial prompts, TrojFill generates highly interpretable and transferable attack vectors, exposing a systematic vulnerability inaligned LLMs.</description>

      <title>"Someone Hid It": Query-Agnostic Black-Box Attacks on LLM-Based Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00364v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been serving as effective backbones for retrieval systems, including Retrieval-Augmentation-Generation (RAG), Dense Information Retriever (IR), and Agent Memory Retrieval. Recent studies have demonstrated that such LLM-based Retrieval (LLMR) is vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which manipulates documents by token-level injections and enables adversaries to either boost or diminish these documents in retrieval tasks. However, existing attack studies mainly (1) presume a known query is given to the attacker, and (2) highly rely on access to the victim model's parameters or interactions, which are hardly accessible in real-world scenarios, leading to limited validity.
  To further explore the secure risks of LLMR, we propose a practical black-box attack method that generates transferable injection tokens based on zero-shot surrogate LLMs without need of victim queries or victim models knowledge. The effectiveness of our attack raises such a robustness issue that similar effects may arise from benign or unintended document edits in the real world. To achieve our attack, we first establish a theoretical framework of LLMR and empirically verify it. Under the framework, we simulate the transferable attack as a min-max problem, and propose an adversarial learning mechanism that finds optimal adversarial tokens with learnable query samples. Our attack is validated to be effective on benchmark datasets across popular LLM retrievers.</description>

      <title>Do Vision-Language Models Respect Contextual Integrity in Location Disclosure?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in image geolocation, a capability further sharpened by frontier multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs). This poses a significant privacy risk, as these widely accessible models can be exploited to infer sensitive locations from casually shared photos, often at street-level precision, potentially surpassing the level of detail the sharer consented or intended to disclose. While recent work has proposed applying a blanket restriction on geolocation disclosure to combat this risk, these measures fail to distinguish valid geolocation uses from malicious behavior. Instead, VLMs should maintain contextual integrity by reasoning about elements within an image to determine the appropriate level of information disclosure, balancing privacy and utility. To evaluate how well models respect contextual integrity, we introduce VLM-GEOPRIVACY, a benchmark that challenges VLMs to interpret latent social norms and contextual cues in real-world images and determine the appropriate level of location disclosure. Our evaluation of 14 leading VLMs shows that, despite their ability to precisely geolocate images, the models are poorly aligned with human privacy expectations. They often over-disclose in sensitive contexts and are vulnerable to prompt-based attacks. Our results call for new design principles in multimodal systems to incorporate context-conditioned privacy reasoning.</description>

      <title>Lite-BD: A Lightweight Black-box Backdoor Defense via Reviving Multi-Stage Image Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Due to the nature of Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) applications, black-box defenses are more practical than white-box methods, yet existing purification techniques suffer from key limitations: a lack of justification for specific transformations, dataset dependency, high computational overhead, and a neglect of frequency-domain transformations. This paper conducts a preliminary study on various image transformations, identifying down-upscaling as the most effective backdoor trigger disruption technique. We subsequently propose \texttt{Lite-BD}, a lightweight two-stage blackbox backdoor defense. \texttt{Lite-BD} first employs a super-resolution-based down-upscaling stage to neutralize spatial triggers. A secondary stage utilizes query-based band-by-band frequency filtering to remove triggers hidden in specific bands. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art attacks demonstrate that \texttt{Lite-BD} provides robust and efficient protection. Codes can be found at https://github.com/SiSL-URI/Lite-BD.</description>

      <title>Weight space Detection of Backdoors in LoRA Adapters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LoRA adapters let users fine-tune large language models (LLMs) efficiently. However, LoRA adapters are shared through open repositories like Hugging Face Hub \citep{huggingface_hub_docs}, making them vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Current detection methods require running the model with test input data -- making them impractical for screening thousands of adapters where the trigger for backdoor behavior is unknown. We detect poisoned adapters by analyzing their weight matrices directly, without running the model -- making our method data-agnostic. Our method extracts simple statistics -- how concentrated the singular values are, their entropy, and the distribution shape -- and flags adapters that deviate from normal patterns. We evaluate the method on 500 LoRA adapters -- 400 clean, and 100 poisoned for Llama-3.2-3B on instruction and reasoning datasets: Alpaca, Dolly, GSM8K, ARC-Challenge, SQuADv2, NaturalQuestions, HumanEval, and GLUE dataset. We achieve 97\% detection accuracy with less than 2\% false positives.</description>

Abstract: We introduce SecCodeBench-V2, a publicly released benchmark for evaluating Large Language Model (LLM) copilots' capabilities of generating secure code. SecCodeBench-V2 comprises 98 generation and fix scenarios derived from Alibaba Group's industrial productions, where the underlying security issues span 22 common CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) categories across five programming languages: Java, C, Python, Go, and JavaScript. SecCodeBench-V2 adopts a function-level task formulation: each scenario provides a complete project scaffold and requires the model to implement or patch a designated target function under fixed interfaces and dependencies. For each scenario, SecCodeBench-V2 provides executable proof-of-concept (PoC) test cases for both functional validation and security verification. All test cases are authored and double-reviewed by security experts, ensuring high fidelity, broad coverage, and reliable ground truth. Beyond the benchmark itself, we build a unified evaluation pipeline that assesses models primarily via dynamic execution. For most scenarios, we compile and run model-generated artifacts in isolated environments and execute PoC test cases to validate both functional correctness and security properties. For scenarios where security issues cannot be adjudicated with deterministic test cases, we additionally employ an LLM-as-a-judge oracle. To summarize performance across heterogeneous scenarios and difficulty levels, we design a Pass@K-based scoring protocol with principled aggregation over scenarios and severity, enabling holistic and comparable evaluation across models. Overall, SecCodeBench-V2 provides a rigorous and reproducible foundation for assessing the security posture of AI coding assistants, with results and artifacts released at https://alibaba.github.io/sec-code-bench. The benchmark is publicly available at https://github.com/alibaba/sec-code-bench.</description>

      <title>PromptGuard: Soft Prompt-Guided Unsafe Content Moderation for Text-to-Image Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03544v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent text-to-image (T2I) models have exhibited remarkable performance in generating high-quality images from text descriptions. However, these models are vulnerable to misuse, particularly generating not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content, such as sexually explicit, violent, political, and disturbing images, raising serious ethical concerns. In this work, we present PromptGuard, a novel content moderation technique that draws inspiration from the system prompt mechanism in large language models (LLMs) for safety alignment. Unlike LLMs, T2I models lack a direct interface for enforcing behavioral guidelines. Our key idea is to optimize a safety soft prompt that functions as an implicit system prompt within the T2I model's textual embedding space. This universal soft prompt (P*) directly moderates NSFW inputs, enabling safe yet realistic image generation without altering the inference efficiency or requiring proxy models. We further enhance its reliability and helpfulness through a divide-and-conquer strategy, which optimizes category-specific soft prompts and combines them into holistic safety guidance. Extensive experiments across five datasets demonstrate that PromptGuard effectively mitigates NSFW content generation while preserving high-quality benign outputs. PromptGuard achieves 3.8 times faster than prior content moderation methods, surpassing eight state-of-the-art defenses with an optimal unsafe ratio down to 5.84%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While several studies have examined the security of code generated by GPT and other Large Language Models (LLMs), most have relied on controlled experiments rather than real developer interactions. This paper investigates the security of GPT-generated code extracted from the DevGPT dataset and evaluates the ability of current LLMs to detect and repair vulnerabilities in this real-world context. We analysed 2,315 C, C++, and C# code snippets using static scanners combined with manual inspection, identifying 56 vulnerabilities across 48 files. These files were then assessed using GPT-4.1, GPT-5, and Claude Opus 4.1 to determine whether these could identify the security issues and, where applicable, to specify the corresponding Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) numbers and propose fixes. Manual review and re-scanning of the modified code showed that GPT-4.1, GPT-5, and Claude Opus 4.1 correctly detected 46, 44, and 45 vulnerabilities, and successfully repaired 42, 44, and 43 respectively. A comparison of experiments conducted in October 2024 and September 2025 indicates substantial progress, with overall detection and remediation rates improving from roughly 50 % to around 75 - 80 %. We also observe that LLM-generated code is about as likely to contain vulnerabilities as developer-written code, and that LLMs may confidently provide incorrect information, posing risks for less experienced developers.</description>

      <title>Protocol as Poetry: A Case Study of Pak's Smart Contract-Based Protocol Art</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Protocol art has recently proliferated through blockchain-based smart contracts, building on a century-long lineage of conceptual, participatory, interactive, systematic, algorithmic, and generative art practices. Few studies have examined the characteristics and appreciation of this emerging art form. To address this gap, this paper presents an annotated portfolio analysis of protocol artworks by Pak, a pioneering and influential pseudonymous artist who treats smart contracts as medium and collective participation through protocol as message. Tracing the evolution from early open-edition releases of The Fungible (2021) and the dynamic mechanics of Merge (2021) to the soul-bound messaging of Censored (2022) and the reflective absence of Not Found (2023), we examine how Pak choreographs distributed agency across collectors and autonomous code, demonstrating how programmable protocols become a social fabric in artistic meaning-making. Through thematic analysis of Pak's works, we identify seven core characteristics distinguishing protocol art from other art forms: (1) system-centric rather than object-centric composition, (2) autonomous governance enabling open-ended control, (3) distributed agency and communal authorship, (4) temporal dynamism and lifecycle aesthetics, (5) economy-driven engagement, (6) poetic message embedded in interaction rituals, and (7) interoperability enabling composability for emergent complexity. We then discuss how these features set protocol art apart from adjacent movements such as conceptual, generative, participatory, interactive, and performance art. By analyzing principles grounded in Pak's practice, we contribute to the emerging literature on protocol art (or "protocolism") and offer design implications for future artists exploring this evolving form.</description>

      <title>Navigating the Deep: End-to-End Extraction on Deep Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural network model extraction has recently emerged as an important security concern, as adversaries attempt to recover a network's parameters via black-box queries. Carlini et al. proposed in CRYPTO'20 a model extraction approach, consisting of two steps: signature extraction and sign extraction. However, in practice this signature-extraction method is limited to very shallow networks only, and the proposed sign-extraction method is exponential in time. Recently, Canales-Martinez et al. (Eurocrypt'24) proposed a polynomial-time sign-extraction method, but it assumes the corresponding signatures have already been successfully extracted and can fail on so-called low-confidence neurons.
  In this work, we first revisit and refine the signature extraction process by systematically identifying and addressing for the first time critical limitations of Carlini et al.'s signature-extraction method. These limitations include rank deficiency and noise propagation from deeper layers. To overcome these challenges, we propose efficient algorithmic solutions for each of the identified issues. Our approach permits the extraction of much deeper networks than previously possible. In addition, we propose new methods to improve numerical precision in signature extraction, and enhance the sign extraction part by combining two polynomial methods to avoid exponential exhaustive search in the case of low-confidence neurons. This leads to the very first end-to-end model extraction method that runs in polynomial time.
  We validate our attack through extensive experiments on ReLU-based neural networks, demonstrating significant improvements in extraction depth. For instance, our attack extracts consistently at least eight layers of neural networks trained on either the MNIST or CIFAR-10 datasets, while previous works could barely extract the first three layers of networks of similar width.</description>

      <title>SoK: Data Minimization in Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data minimization (DM) describes the principle of collecting only the data strictly necessary for a given task. It is a foundational principle across major data protection regulations like GDPR and CPRA. Violations of this principle have substantial real-world consequences, with regulatory actions resulting in fines reaching hundreds of millions of dollars. Notably, the relevance of data minimization is particularly pronounced in machine learning (ML) applications, which typically rely on large datasets, resulting in an emerging research area known as Data Minimization in Machine Learning (DMML). At the same time, existing work on other ML privacy and security topics often addresses concerns relevant to DMML without explicitly acknowledging the connection. This disconnect leads to confusion among practitioners, complicating their efforts to implement DM principles and interpret the terminology, metrics, and evaluation criteria used across different research communities. To address this gap, we present the first systematization of knowledge (SoK) for DMML. We introduce a general framework for DMML, encompassing a unified data pipeline, adversarial models, and points of minimization. This framework allows us to systematically review data minimization literature as well as DM-adjacent methodologies whose link to DM was often overlooked. Our structured overview is designed to help practitioners and researchers effectively adopt and apply DM principles in ML, by helping them identify relevant techniques and understand underlying assumptions and trade-offs through a DM-centric lens.</description>

      <title>Watch Out for the Lifespan: Evaluating Backdoor Attacks Against Federated Model Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large models adaptation through Federated Learning (FL) addresses a wide range of use cases and is enabled by Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). However, this distributed learning paradigm faces several security threats, particularly to its integrity, such as backdoor attacks that aim to inject malicious behavior during the local training steps of certain clients. We present the first analysis of the influence of LoRA on state-of-the-art backdoor attacks targeting model adaptation in FL. Specifically, we focus on backdoor lifespan, a critical characteristic in FL, that can vary depending on the attack scenario and the attacker's ability to effectively inject the backdoor. A key finding in our experiments is that for an optimally injected backdoor, the backdoor persistence after the attack is longer when the LoRA's rank is lower. Importantly, our work highlights evaluation issues of backdoor attacks against FL and contributes to the development of more robust and fair evaluations of backdoor attacks, enhancing the reliability of risk assessments for critical FL systems. Our code is publicly available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03310v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The current literature on memorization in Natural Language Models, especially Large Language Models (LLMs), poses severe security and privacy risks, as models tend to memorize personally identifying information (PIIs) from training data. We introduce Randomized Masked Fine-Tuning (RMFT), a novel privacy-preserving fine-tuning technique that reduces PII memorization while minimizing performance impact. Using the Enron Email Dataset, we demonstrate that RMFT achieves an 80.81% reduction in Total Extraction Rate and 80.17% reduction in Seen Extraction Rate compared to baseline fine-tuning, outperforming deduplication methods while maintaining only a 5.73% increase in perplexity. We present MaxTER, a Pareto-optimal evaluation framework for assessing privacy-utility tradeoffs, and show the performance of RMFT vs Deduplication by Area Under The Response Curve (AURC) metric.</description>

      <title>ForesightSafety Bench: A Frontier Risk Evaluation and Governance Framework towards Safe AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rapidly evolving AI exhibits increasingly strong autonomy and goal-directed capabilities, accompanied by derivative systemic risks that are more unpredictable, difficult to control, and potentially irreversible. However, current AI safety evaluation systems suffer from critical limitations such as restricted risk dimensions and failed frontier risk detection. The lagging safety benchmarks and alignment technologies can hardly address the complex challenges posed by cutting-edge AI models. To bridge this gap, we propose the "ForesightSafety Bench" AI Safety Evaluation Framework, beginning with 7 major Fundamental Safety pillars and progressively extends to advanced Embodied AI Safety, AI4Science Safety, Social and Environmental AI risks, Catastrophic and Existential Risks, as well as 8 critical industrial safety domains, forming a total of 94 refined risk dimensions. To date, the benchmark has accumulated tens of thousands of structured risk data points and assessment results, establishing a widely encompassing, hierarchically clear, and dynamically evolving AI safety evaluation framework. Based on this benchmark, we conduct systematic evaluation and in-depth analysis of over twenty mainstream advanced large models, identifying key risk patterns and their capability boundaries. The safety capability evaluation results reveals the widespread safety vulnerabilities of frontier AI across multiple pillars, particularly focusing on Risky Agentic Autonomy, AI4Science Safety, Embodied AI Safety, Social AI Safety and Catastrophic and Existential Risks. Our benchmark is released at https://github.com/Beijing-AISI/ForesightSafety-Bench. The project website is available at https://foresightsafety-bench.beijing-aisi.ac.cn/.</description>

      <title>Closing the Distribution Gap in Adversarial Training for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adversarial training for LLMs is one of the most promising methods to reliably improve robustness against adversaries. However, despite significant progress, models remain vulnerable to simple in-distribution exploits, such as rewriting prompts in the past tense or translating them into other languages. We argue that this persistent fragility stems from a fundamental limitation in current adversarial training algorithms: they minimize adversarial loss on their training set but inadequately cover the data distribution, resulting in vulnerability to seemingly simple attacks. To bridge this gap, we propose Distributional Adversarial Training, DAT. We leverage Diffusion LLMs to approximate the true joint distribution of prompts and responses, enabling generation of diverse, high-likelihood samples that address generalization failures. By combining optimization over the data distribution provided by the diffusion model with continuous adversarial training, DAT achieves substantially higher adversarial robustness than previous methods.</description>

      <title>A Content-Based Framework for Cybersecurity Refusal Decisions in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models and LLM-based agents are increasingly used for cybersecurity tasks that are inherently dual-use. Existing approaches to refusal, spanning academic policy frameworks and commercially deployed systems, often rely on broad topic-based bans or offensive-focused taxonomies. As a result, they can yield inconsistent decisions, over-restrict legitimate defenders, and behave brittlely under obfuscation or request segmentation. We argue that effective refusal requires explicitly modeling the trade-off between offensive risk and defensive benefit, rather than relying solely on intent or offensive classification. In this paper, we introduce a content-based framework for designing and auditing cyber refusal policies that makes offense-defense tradeoffs explicit. The framework characterizes requests along five dimensions: Offensive Action Contribution, Offensive Risk, Technical Complexity, Defensive Benefit, and Expected Frequency for Legitimate Users, grounded in the technical substance of the request rather than stated intent. We demonstrate that this content-grounded approach resolves inconsistencies in current frontier model behavior and allows organizations to construct tunable, risk-aware refusal policies.</description>
