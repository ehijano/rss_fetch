      <title>Chaotic behavior in Lotka-Volterra and May-Leonard models of biodiversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantification of chaos is a challenging issue in complex dynamical systems. In this paper, we discuss the chaotic properties of generalized Lotka-Volterra and May-Leonard models of biodiversity, via the Hamming distance density. We identified chaotic behavior for different scenarios via the specific features of the Hamming distance and the method of q-exponential fitting. We also investigated the spatial autocorrelation length to find the corresponding characteristic length in terms of the number of species in each system. In particular, the results concerning the characteristic length are in good accordance with the study of the chaotic behavior implemented in this work.</description>

      <title>Network reconstruction via the minimum description length principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental problem associated with the task of network reconstruction from dynamical or behavioral data consists in determining the most appropriate model complexity in a manner that prevents overfitting, and produces an inferred network with a statistically justifiable number of edges. The status quo in this context is based on $L_{1}$ regularization combined with cross-validation. As we demonstrate, besides its high computational cost, this commonplace approach unnecessarily ties the promotion of sparsity with weight "shrinkage". This combination forces a trade-off between the bias introduced by shrinkage and the network sparsity, which often results in substantial overfitting even after cross-validation. In this work, we propose an alternative nonparametric regularization scheme based on hierarchical Bayesian inference and weight quantization, which does not rely on weight shrinkage to promote sparsity. Our approach follows the minimum description length (MDL) principle, and uncovers the weight distribution that allows for the most compression of the data, thus avoiding overfitting without requiring cross-validation. The latter property renders our approach substantially faster to employ, as it requires a single fit to the complete data. As a result, we have a principled and efficient inference scheme that can be used with a large variety of generative models, without requiring the number of edges to be known in advance. We also demonstrate that our scheme yields systematically increased accuracy in the reconstruction of both artificial and empirical networks. We highlight the use of our method with the reconstruction of interaction networks between microbial communities from large-scale abundance samples involving in the order of $10^{4}$ to $10^{5}$ species, and demonstrate how the inferred model can be used to predict the outcome of interventions in the system.</description>

      <title>Two competing populations with a common environmental resource</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feedback-evolving games is a framework that models the co-evolution between payoff functions and an environmental state. It serves as a useful tool to analyze many social dilemmas such as natural resource consumption, behaviors in epidemics, and the evolution of biological populations. However, it has primarily focused on the dynamics of a single population of agents. In this paper, we consider the impact of two populations of agents that share a common environmental resource. We focus on a scenario where individuals in one population are governed by an environmentally "responsible" incentive policy, and individuals in the other population are environmentally "irresponsible". An analysis on the asymptotic stability of the coupled system is provided, and conditions for which the resource collapses are identified. We then derive consumption rates for the irresponsible population that optimally exploit the environmental resource, and analyze how incentives should be allocated to the responsible population that most effectively promote the environment via a sensitivity analysis.</description>

      <title>Two-type branching processes with immigration, and the structured coalescents</title>

Abstract: We consider a population constituted by two types of individuals; each of them can produce offspring in two different islands (as a particular case the islands can be interpreted as active or dormant individuals). We model the evolution of the population of each type using a two-type Feller diffusion with immigration, and we study the frequency of one of the types, in each island, when the total population size in each island is forced to be constant at a dense set of times. This leads to the solution of a SDE which we call the asymmetric two-island frequency process. We derive properties of this process and obtain a large population limit when the total size of each island tends to infinity. Additionally, we compute the fluctuations of the process around its deterministic limit. We establish conditions under which the asymmetric two-island frequency process has a moment dual. The dual is a continuous-time two-dimensional Markov chain that can be interpreted in terms of mutation, branching, pairwise branching, coalescence, and a novel mixed selection-migration term. Also, we conduct a stability analysis of the limiting deterministic dynamical system and present some numerical results to study fixation and a new form of balancing selection. When restricting to the seedbank model, we observe that some combinations of the parameters lead to balancing selection. Besides finding yet another way in which genetic reservoirs increase the genetic variability, we find that if a population that sustains a seedbank competes with one that does not, the seed producers will have a selective advantage if they reproduce faster, but will not have a selective disadvantage if they reproduce slower: their worst case scenario is balancing selection.</description>

      <title>Concepts and methods for predicting viral evolution</title>

Abstract: The seasonal human influenza virus undergoes rapid evolution, leading to significant changes in circulating viral strains from year to year. These changes are typically driven by adaptive mutations, particularly in the antigenic epitopes, the regions of the viral surface protein haemagglutinin targeted by human antibodies. Here we describe a consistent set of methods for data-driven predictive analysis of viral evolution. Our pipeline integrates four types of data: (1) sequence data of viral isolates collected on a worldwide scale, (2) epidemiological data on incidences, (3) antigenic characterization of circulating viruses, and (4) intrinsic viral phenotypes. From the combined analysis of these data, we obtain estimates of relative fitness for circulating strains and predictions of clade frequencies for periods of up to one year. Furthermore, we obtain comparative estimates of protection against future viral populations for candidate vaccine strains, providing a basis for pre-emptive vaccine strain selection. Continuously updated predictions obtained from the prediction pipeline for influenza and SARS-CoV-2 are available on the website https://previr.app.</description>

      <title>Stochastic dynamics of two-compartment models with regulatory mechanisms for hematopoiesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an asymptotic analysis of a stochastic two-compartmental cell proliferation system with regulatory mechanisms. We model the system as a state-dependent birth and death process. Proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is regulated by population density of HSC-derived clones and differentiation of HSC is regulated by population density of HSCs. By scaling up the initial population, we show the density of dynamics converges in distribution to the solution of a system of ordinary differential equations. The system of ODE has a unique non-trivial equilibrium that is globally stable. Furthermore, we show the scaled fluctuation of the population converges in law to a linear diffusion. With initial data being Gaussian, the limit is a Gauss-Markov process and we prove the process will stabilize exponentially fast in the 2-Wasserstein metric. We apply our results to analyze and compare two regulatory mechanisms in the hematopoietic system. Simulations are conducted to verify our large-scale and long-time approximation of the dynamics. We demonstrate some regulatory mechanisms are efficient (converge to steady state rapidly) but not effective (have large fluctuation around the steady state).</description>
