      <title>Detecting Model Misspecification in Cosmology with Scale-Dependent Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current and upcoming cosmological surveys will produce unprecedented amounts of high-dimensional data, which require complex high-fidelity forward simulations to accurately model both physical processes and systematic effects which describe the data generation process. However, validating whether our theoretical models accurately describe the observed datasets remains a fundamental challenge. An additional complexity to this task comes from choosing appropriate representations of the data which retain all the relevant cosmological information, while reducing the dimensionality of the original dataset. In this work we present a novel framework combining scale-dependent neural summary statistics with normalizing flows to detect model misspecification in cosmological simulations through Bayesian evidence estimation. By conditioning our neural network models for data compression and evidence estimation on the smoothing scale, we systematically identify where theoretical models break down in a data-driven manner. We demonstrate a first application to our approach using matter and gas density fields from three CAMELS simulation suites with different subgrid physics implementations.</description>

      <title>Can dynamic dark energy explain the $S_8$ tension, the `lensing is low' effect, or strong baryon feedback?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of a DESI motivated dynamic dark energy cosmology on three cosmological anomalies, the $S_8$ tension, the `lensing is low' effect, and observations of strong baryonic feedback. We analyze how these observations vary in $\Lambda$CDM versus dynamic dark energy. We find that the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal is reduced by up to 7% with respect to galaxy clustering and that cosmic shear is suppressed by 14%. These differences are primarily caused by changes to cosmological distance measures which enter the lensing efficiency kernels. In contrast, we find that dynamic dark energy increases the thermal Sunyaev Zeldovich signal by about 15%, but that this is insufficient to substantially reduce the magnitude of baryonic effects. Thus, we find that dynamic dark energy may help explain two out of these three cosmological anomalies. DESI's dynamic dark energy has an important impact on cosmic expansion at $z\lesssim 0.5$, a regime where baryon acoustic oscillations are limited by the small volume. Because lensing is sensitive to distances, in addition to growth, we argue that lensing measurements are a promising alternative to constrain expansion deviations from $\Lambda$ at low redshifts.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Parameter Estimation using Particle Swarm Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for the model or ingredients that describe the current vision of our cosmos has led to the creation of a set of highly favorable experiments, and therefore a great flow of information. Due to this torrent of information and the need to analyze it exhaustively, the main aim of this paper is to introduce the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) as a complement to traditional cosmological data analysis. The PSO is one of the most representative Bio-inspired algorithms as provides excellent robustness in high-dimensional or complex problems with relative simplicity and small number of parameters during the implementation. In this work we implemented two versions of the canonical PSO algorithm: global best and local best, to explore dark energy models in the light of Type Ia Supernovae and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations observations, in particular, DESI and DESI+Union3 datasets. The results achieved validate the performance of the PSO algorithm in finding the best-fit parameters from observational data and confirm that PSO, under certain conditions, can deliver competitive results, at a fraction of time, compared to standard MCMC methods. Finally, the PSO output can also serve as a valuable input to the MCMC methods to speed up its analysis.</description>

      <title>CLAPP: The CLASS LLM Agent for Pair Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce CLAPP (CLASS LLM Agent for Pair Programming), an interactive AI assistant designed to support researchers working with the Einstein-Boltzmann solver CLASS. CLAPP leverages large language models (LLMs) and domain-specific retrieval to provide conversational coding support for CLASS-answering questions, generating code, debugging errors, and producing plots. Its architecture combines multi-agent LLM orchestration, semantic search across CLASS documentation, and a live Python execution environment. Deployed as a user-friendly web application, CLAPP lowers the entry barrier for scientists unfamiliar with AI tools and enables more productive human-AI collaboration in computational and numerical cosmology. The app is available at https://classclapp.streamlit.app</description>

      <title>Stable Islands of Weak Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an exploration of the phenomenology of Horndeski gravity, focusing on regimes that produce weak gravity compared to General Relativity. This letter introduces a novel method to generate models of modified gravity theories that produce a specific observational behaviour while fulfilling stability criteria, without imposing a fixed parametrisation. We start from the inherently stable basis of linear Horndeski theory, implemented in the recently released Einstein-Boltzmann solver mochi_class. The time evolution of the basis functions is designed with Gaussian processes that directly include the stability and phenomenology criteria during the generation. Here, we focus on models with weak gravity that suppress the growth of Large-Scale Structure at late times. To achieve this behaviour, we mainly focus on the design of a dynamical effective Planck mass for theories with a vanishing fifth force. We find a broad range of weak-gravity islands in Horndeski theory space. We also include additional features, like a vanishing modification to gravity at $z=0$, and extend the exploration to islands of gravity with a non-zero fifth force. Finally, we show that replacing the $\Lambda$CDM expansion model by the DESI $w_0w_a$CDM best fit also produces stable islands of weak gravity.</description>

      <title>A long time ago in an LAE far, far away: a signpost of early reionization or a nascent AGN at $z=13$?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The JADES survey recently reported the discovery of JADES-GS-z13-1-LA at $z = 13$, the highest redshift Ly$\alpha$ emitter (LAE) ever observed. This observation suggests that either the intergalactic medium (IGM) surrounding JADES-GS-z13-1-LA is highly ionized, or the galaxy's intrinsic Ly$\alpha$ emission properties are extreme. We use radiative transfer simulations of reionization that capture the distribution of ionized gas in the $z = 13$ IGM to investigate the implications of JADES-GS-z13-1-LA for reionization. We find that if JADES-GS-z13-1-LA is a typical star forming galaxy (SFG) with properties characteristic of LAEs at $z \sim 6$, its detection suggests that the universe is $\gtrsim 5\%$ ionized by $z = 13$. We also investigate the possibility that the extreme properties of JADES-GS-z13-1-LA are driven by an AGN. Using a simple analysis based on the fact that AGN are expected to produce more ionizing photons than SFGs, we estimate that the likelihood that JADES-GS-z13-1-LA hosts an AGN is $88\%$, $66\%$, and $33\%$ if the IGM is $&lt; 1\%$, $\approx 5\%$ and $\approx 25\%$ ionized, respectively. We also highlight other features in the spectrum of JADES-GS-z13-1-LA that may be indicative of AGN activity, including strong Ly$\alpha$ damping wing absorption extending to $\sim 1300$ angstroms, and a possible CII*$\lambda1335$ emission line. Our findings strongly motivate dedicated follow-up observations of JADES-GS-z13-1-LA to determine whether it hosts an AGN.</description>

      <title>Stacked Hybrid RNN-CNN Reconstruction of X-ray Influence on 21-cm Brightness Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The X-ray photons substantially affect the thermal and ionization states of the intergalactic medium (IGM) during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), thereby significantly influencing the 21-cm line observables such as its sky-averaged (global) brightness temperature. Nevertheless, the complicated dependency of astrophysical processes on a broad spectrum of parameters, including X-ray efficiency, spectral characteristics, and gas dynamics, makes precisely simulating the effect of X-ray flux challenging. Traditional approaches, including N-body and hydrodynamical simulations, are computationally intensive and struggle to explore high-dimensional parameter spaces efficiently. We present a stacked hybrid model trained on a specific simulation intended to reconstruct the effect of X-ray flux on the global 21-cm brightness temperature during the EoR. Along with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), this architecture combines two substantial forms of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), therefore enabling fast adaptation to several X-ray flux levels. Without demanding repeated simulations, this emulator preserves temporal and spatial dependencies and generalizes to unseen parameter combinations. This matter reduces computation time by a factor of one million while preserving excellent prediction accuracy of 99.93\%, facilitating studies on high-dimensional parameter inference and sensitivity with an error margin of less than 0.35 mK. Our LSTM-GRU-CNN emulator combines recurrent and convolutional architectures to enable a robust and scalable analysis of X-ray heating effects on the global 21-cm brightness temperature during the EoR.</description>

      <title>AllBRICQS: The Discovery of Luminous Quasars in the Northern Hemisphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the second catalog of bright quasars from the All-sky BRIght, Complete Quasar Survey (AllBRICQS), focusing on spectroscopically observed quasars in the Northern Hemisphere with Galactic latitude $|b| &gt; 10^\circ$. This catalog includes their spectral data, redshifts, and luminosities. AllBRICQS aims to identify the last remaining optically bright quasars using data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and Gaia all-sky survey Data Release 3 (DR3). AllBRICQS searches for quasars that are brighter than $B_P = 16.5$ or $R_P = 16$ mag in Gaia DR3, based on simple selection criteria. Here, we report 62 new AllBRICQS quasars spanning various types, which include typical broad emission line quasars and the most luminous iron low-ionization broad absorption line quasars discovered to date. Spectroscopic observations were conducted using the Long-Slit Spectrograph on the 1.8-meter telescope at Bohyunsan Optical Astronomy Observatory, YFOSC on the 2.4-meter telescope at Lijiang Observatory, and BFOSC on the 2.16-meter telescope at Xinglong Observatory. We applied flux calibration using ZTF broadband photometry to correct for attenuation due to intermittent thin clouds during the observations. Redshifts were determined using inverse-variance weighted cross-correlation methods. Our targets span the bolometric luminosity range of $44.9&lt;\log \left( L_{\rm bol} / {\rm erg~s^{-1}} \right)&lt;48.0$ at redshifts between 0.09 and 2.48. These confirmed AllBRICQS quasars provide a valuable resource for future research into quasar evolution, black holes, their environments, and their host galaxies across multiple wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Illuminating Scalar Dark Matter Co-Scattering in EFT with Monophoton Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the co-scattering mechanism for dark matter production in an EFT framework which contains new $Z_2$-odd singlets, namely two fermions $N_{1,2}$ and a real scalar $\chi$. The singlet scalar $\chi$ is the dark matter candidate. The dimension-5 operators play a vital role to set the observed DM relic density. We focus on a nearly degenerate mass spectrum for the $Z_2$ odd particles to allow for a significant contribution from the co-scattering or co-annihilation mechanisms. We present two benchmark points where either of the two mechanisms primarily set the DM relic abundance. The main constraint on the model at the LHC arise from the ATLAS mono-$\gamma$ search. We obtain the parameter space allowed by the observed relic density and the mono-$\gamma$ search after performing a scan over the key parameters, the masses $M_{N_{1,2}}, M_\chi$ and couplings $c_3^\prime, Y^\prime_{11,22}$. We find the region of parameter space where the relic abundance is set primarily by the co-scattering mechanism while being allowed by the LHC search. We also determine how the model can be further probed at the HL-LHC via the mono-$\gamma$ signature.</description>

      <title>A Targeted Gamma-Ray Search of Five Prominent Galaxy Merger Systems with 17 years of Fermi-LAT Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxy mergers are among the most energetic astrophysical phenomena, driving intense star formation and potentially fueling cosmic ray acceleration, which can produce high energy $\gamma$-ray emission through hadronic processes. We present a targeted search for $\gamma$-ray emission from five prominent galaxy merger systems, NGC~3256, NGC~660, UGC~813/816, UGC~12914/12915, and VV~114 using 16.8 years of Fermi-LAT data in the 1--300~GeV energy range. Employing a binned maximum likelihood analysis, we model the emission with power-law spectra and derive spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to constrain $\gamma$-ray fluxes and spectral indices. Marginal detections are found for NGC~3256 (TS = 15.4, $\sim$3.51$\sigma$) and NGC~660 (TS = 8.16, $\sim$2.39$\sigma$), with photon fluxes of $(7.21 \pm 3.17) \times 10^{-11}$ and $(8.28 \pm 3.56) \times 10^{-11}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, respectively, suggesting merger driven star formation contributes to $\gamma$-ray emission. The remaining systems yield non-detections (TS $&lt; 5$). This is the first targeted study of $\gamma$-ray emission from these aforementioned galaxy merger systems.</description>

      <title>Fermi-LAT Galactic Center Excess morphology of dark matter in simulations of the Milky Way galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strongest experimental evidence for dark matter is the Galactic Center gamma-ray excess observed by the Fermi telescope and even predicted prior to discovery as a potential dark matter signature via WIMP dark matter self-annihilations. However, an equally compelling explanation of the excess gamma-ray flux appeals to a population of old millisecond pulsars that also accounts for the observed boxy morphology inferred from the bulge old star population. We employ a set of Milky Way-like galaxies found in the Hestia constrained simulations of the local universe to explore the rich morphology of the central dark matter distribution, motivated by the GAIA discovery of a vigorous early merging history of the Milky Way galaxy. We predict a significantly non-spherical gamma-ray morphology from the WIMP interpretation. Future experiments, such as the Cherenkov Telescope Array, that extend to higher energies, should distinguish between the competing interpretations.</description>

      <title>Dark Sector Electroweak Baryogenesis In Light Of The Galactic Center Excess</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit a model of electroweak baryogenesis that includes a dark matter candidate, and sequesters the new CP violation required to produce the baryon asymmetry in a dark sector. The model can successfully explain the baryon asymmetry, dark matter relic density, and the long-standing excess of gamma rays from the galactic center. The first order electroweak phase transition induced by the new physics can give rise to gravitational waves that may be observed in future experiments. The model predicts dark matter signals in direct detectors, and a significant contribution to the Higgs boson invisible decay width.</description>

      <title>Leakage of power from dipole to higher multipoles due to non-symmetric WMAP beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1307.0001</link>
      <description>arXiv:1307.0001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A number of studies of WMAP and Planck claimed the low multipole (specially quadrupole) power deficiency in CMB power spectrum. Anomaly in the orientations of the low multipoles have also been claimed. There is a possibility that the power deficiency at low multipoles may not be of primordial origin and is only an observation artifact coming from the scan procedure adapted in the WMAP or Planck satellites. Therefore, it is always important to investigate all the observational artifacts that can mimic them. The CMB dipole which is much higher than the quadrupole, can leak to the higher multipoles due to the non-symmetric beam shape of the WMAP or Planck. We observe that a non-negligible amount of power from the dipole can get transferred to the quadrupole and the higher multipoles due to the non-symmetric beam shapes and contaminate the observed measurements. The orientation of the quadrupole generated by this power transfer is surprisingly very close to the quadrupole observed from the WMAP and Planck maps. However, our analysis shows that the orientation of the quadrupole can not be explained using only the dipole power leakage. In this paper we calculate the amount of quadrupole power leakage for different WMAP bands. For Planck we present the results in terms of upper limits on asymmetric beam parameters that can lead to significant amount of power leakage.</description>

      <title>Ultradense Dark Matter Halos with Poisson Noise from Stellar-Mass Primordial Black Holes</title>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the impact of Poisson noise from stellar-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) on the formation of ultradense dark matter halos (UDMHs). Our findings reveal that the discrete spatial distribution of PBHs significantly enhances small-scale density fluctuations, particularly for massive stellar-mass PBHs. Our results indicate that the modified power spectrum, incorporating both adiabatic and isocurvature contributions from PBH-induced Poisson noise, strongly depends on PBH mass and fraction. Specifically, increasing PBH mass shifts the differential mass function of UDMHs toward higher masses, while variations in the suppression parameter $n$ modulate the efficiency of UDMH formation at small scales. For lower values of $n$, our findings show a significant boost in UDMH abundance, favoring multi-component dark matter scenarios. Conversely, at higher values of $n$, the predicted UDMH distributions align more closely with single-component models dominated by stellar-mass PBHs. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that more realistic halo mass functions, which account for angular momentum and dynamical friction, consistently predict higher UDMH abundances compared to traditional Press-Schechter formalism.</description>

      <title>The Proper Motion of Strongly Lensed Binary Neutron Star Mergers in LIGO/Virgo/Kagra can be Constrained by Measuring Doppler Induced Gravitational Wave Dephasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strongly lensed binary neutron star (NS-NS) mergers are expected to be observed once LIGO/Virgo/Kagra reaches the planned A+ or proposed A\# sensitivity. We demonstrate that the relative transverse velocity of the source-lens system can be constrained by comparing the phase of the two associated gravitational wave (GW) images, using both semi-analytical and numerical Bayesian methods. For A+ sensitivity, a one-sigma NS-NS merger signal in magnification $(\mu=200)$ and redshift $(z_{\rm S}=1)$ will carry a marginally detectable dephasing signature for a source transverse velocity of $\sim 1800$ km/s. This is comparable to the velocity dispersion of large galaxy clusters. Assuming the same population distribution, the most likely source parameters of $\mu=100$ and $z_{\rm S}=1.4$ are always expected to showcase detectable dephasing imprints for A\# sensitivity, provided they are moving with transverse velocities larger than $\sim 2000$ km/s. We conclude that a first measurement of the relative transverse velocity of a source via GW dephasing methods is likely only a few years away.</description>

      <title>Precision calculation of the EFT likelihood with primordial non-Gaussianities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10915v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a precision calculation of the effective field theory (EFT) conditional likelihood for large-scale structure (LSS) using the saddle-point expansion method in the presence of primordial non-Gaussianities (PNG). The precision is manifested at two levels: one corresponding to the consideration of higher-order noise terms, and the other to the inclusion of contributions around the saddle points. In computing the latter, we encounter the same issue of the negative modes as in the context of false vacuum decay, which necessitates deforming the original integration contour into a combination of the steepest descent contours to ensure a convergent and real result. We demonstrate through detailed calculations that, upon incorporating leading-order PNG, both types of extensions introduce irreducible field-dependent contributions to the conditional likelihood. This insight motivates the systematic inclusion of additional effective terms within the forward modeling framework. Our work facilitates Bayesian forward modeling under non-Gaussian initial conditions, thereby enabling more stringent constraints on the parameters describing PNG.</description>

      <title>Dark energy constraints in light of theoretical priors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to derive model-independent observational bounds on dark energy/modified gravity theories, a typical approach is to constrain parametrised models intended to capture the space of dark energy theories. Here we investigate in detail the effect that the nature of these parametrisations can have, finding significant effects on the resulting cosmological dark energy constraints. In order to observationally distinguish well-motivated and physical parametrisations from unphysical ones, it is crucial to understand the theoretical priors that physical parametrisations place on the phenomenology of dark energy. To this end we discuss a range of theoretical priors that can be imposed on general dark energy parametrisations, and their effect on the constraints on the phenomenology of dynamical dark energy. More specifically, we investigate both the phenomenological $\{\mu,\Sigma\}$ parametrisation as well as effective field theory (EFT) inspired approaches to model dark energy interactions. We compare the constraints obtained in both approaches for different phenomenological and theory-informed time-dependences for the underlying functional degrees of freedom, discuss the effects of priors derived from gravitational wave physics, and investigate the interplay between constraints on parameters constraining only the background evolution vs. parameters controlling linear perturbations.</description>

      <title>One-Loop Galaxy Bispectrum: Consistent Theory, Efficient Analysis with COBRA, and Implications for Cosmological Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an efficient and accurate pipeline for the analysis of the redshift-space galaxy bispectrum multipoles at one-loop order in effective field theory (EFT). We provide a systematic theory derivation based on power counting, which features the first comprehensive treatment of stochastic EFT contributions -- these are found to significantly improve the match to data. Our computational pipeline utilizes the COBRA technique that expands the linear matter power spectrum over a basis of principal components based on a singular value decomposition, allowing the cosmology dependence to be captured to sub-permille accuracy with just eight templates. This transforms the problem of computing the one-loop EFT bispectrum to a simple tensor multiplication, reducing the computation time to around a second per cosmology with negligible loss of accuracy. Using these tools, we study the cosmological information in the bispectrum by analyzing PTChallenge simulations, whose gigantic volume provides the most powerful test of the one-loop EFT bispectrum so far. We find that the one-loop prediction provides an excellent match to the bispectrum data up to $k_{\rm max}=0.15~h$ Mpc$^{-1}$, as evidenced by the precise recovery of the dark matter density $\omega_\text{cdm}$, Hubble constant $H_0$, and mass fluctuation amplitude $\sigma_8$ parameters, and the amplitude of equilateral primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm equil}$. Combined with the power spectrum, the COBRA-based one-loop bispectrum multipoles yield tighter constraints than the tree-level bispectrum monopole, with the posteriors on $\omega_{\text{cdm}}$, $H_0$, and $\sigma_8$ shrinking by 41\%, 25\%, and 19\%, respectively. This suggests that the COBRA-based bispectrum analysis will be an important tool in the interpretation of data from ongoing redshift surveys such as DESI and Euclid.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the evolution of cosmic acceleration in a spatially flat $w_0w_a$CDM universe, in which the equation of state of dark energy takes the CPL parametrization, using the latest baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), in combination with Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) data and several type Ia supernova datasets, including PantheonPlus, Union3, and DESY5. We analyze the deceleration parameter $q(z)$ and the jerk parameter $j(z)$ and further validate our results using the $Om(z)$ diagnostic. Our findings indicate significant deviations from the predictions of the $\Lambda$CDM model. Specifically, DESI BAO, DESI BAO + CMB, DESI BAO + CMB + Union3, and DESI BAO + CMB + DESY5 all provide strong evidence for a slowing down of cosmic acceleration at late times, as indicated by $j(0) &lt; 0$ at more than 1$\sigma$ confidence level, within the framework of $w_0w_a$CDM model. These results suggest that in the $w_0w_a$CDM universe cosmic acceleration has already peaked and is now in a phase of decline.</description>

      <title>Euclid: Photometric redshift calibration with self-organising maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Euclid survey aims to trace the evolution of cosmic structures up to redshift $z$ $\sim$ 3 and beyond. Its success depends critically on obtaining highly accurate mean redshifts for ensembles of galaxies $n(z)$ in all tomographic bins, essential for deriving robust cosmological constraints. However, photometric redshifts (photo-$z$s) suffer from systematic biases arising from various sources of uncertainty. To address these challenges, we utilised self-organising maps (SOMs) with mock samples resembling the Euclid Wide Survey (EWS), to validate Euclid's uncertainty requirement of $|\Delta\langle z \rangle| = \langle z_{\text{est}} \rangle - \langle z \rangle \leq 0.002 (1+z)$ per tomographic bin, assuming DR3-level data. We observe that defining the redshift tomography using the mean spectroscopic redshift (spec-$z$) per SOM cell, results in none of the ten tomographic redshift bins satisfying the requirement. In contrast, the redshift tomography on the photo-$z$s of the EWS-like sample yields superior results, with eight out of ten bins [$0 &lt; z\leq 2.5$] meeting the Euclid requirement. To enhance the realism of our study, we morph our calibration sample to mimic the C3R2 survey in incremental steps. In this context, a maximum of six out of ten bins meet the requirement, strongly advocating the adoption of a redshift tomography defined by the photo-$z$s of individual galaxies rather than the commonly used mean spec-$z$ of SOM cells. To examine the impact on the expected biases for $\Omega_{\text{m}}$, $\sigma_{8}$, and $\Delta w_{0}$ measured by Euclid, we perform a Fisher forecast for cosmic shear only, based on our redshift uncertainties. Here, we find that even under an evaluation of the uncertainty where the impact of the redshift bias is substantial, most absolute biases remain below 0.1$\sigma$ in the idealised scenario and below 0.3$\sigma$ in the more realistic case.</description>

      <title>Illuminating Black Hole Shadow with Dark Matter Annihilation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16673v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has significantly advanced our ability to study black holes, achieving unprecedented spatial resolution and revealing horizon-scale structures. Notably, these observations feature a distinctive dark shadow--primarily arising from faint jet emissions--surrounded by a bright photon ring. Anticipated upgrades of the EHT promise substantial improvements in dynamic range, enabling deeper exploration of low-background regions, particularly the inner shadow defined by the lensed equatorial horizon. Our analysis shows that observations of these regions transform supermassive black holes into powerful probes for annihilating dark matter, which is expected to accumulate densely in their vicinity. By analyzing the black hole image morphology and performing electron-positron propagation calculations in realistic plasma backgrounds derived from general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we set stringent constraints on dark matter annihilation, requiring contributions below the astrophysical emission. These constraints, derived from both current EHT observations and projections for future upgraded arrays, exclude a substantial region of previously unexplored parameter space and remain robust against astrophysical uncertainties, including black hole spin and plasma temperature variations.</description>

      <title>Perturbative unitarity bounds from momentum-space entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physical theories have a limited regime of validity and hence must be accompanied by a breakdown diagnostic to establish when they cease to be valid as parameters are varied. For perturbative theories, estimates of the first neglected order offer valuable guidance, but one is often interested in sharp bounds beyond which perturbation theory necessarily fails. In particle physics, it is common to employ the bounds on partial waves imposed by unitarity as such a diagnostic. Unfortunately, these bounds don't extend to curved spacetime, where scattering experiments are challenging to define. Here, we propose to use the growth of entanglement in momentum space as a breakdown diagnostic for perturbation theory in general field theories. This diagnostic can be readily used in cosmological spacetimes and does not require any flat spacetime limit. More in detail, we consider the so-called purity of the reduced density operator constructed by tracing out all but one of the Fourier modes in an effective theory and we present a diagrammatic technique to compute it perturbatively. Constraints on the regime of validity of perturbation theory are then derived when the perturbative purity violates its unitarity bounds.
  In flat spacetime, we compare these purity bounds to those from partial waves. We find general qualitative agreement but with remarkable differences: purity bounds can be sometimes weaker, but other times they exist when no partial wave bounds exist. We then derive purity bounds for scalar field theories in de Sitter spacetime for a variety of interactions that appear in inflationary models. Importantly, our bounds make no reference to time evolution and in de Sitter they depend exclusively on scale-invariant ratios of the physical kinematics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a broad class of modular inflation models predicts the emergence of new physics within an energy range of approximately \( 10^{15} \, \mathrm{GeV} \) to \( 10^{17} \, \mathrm{GeV} \). This prediction arises by comparing the moduli-dependent species scale with observational constraints on inflation. Specifically, we illustrate this within the context of \( SL(2, \mathbb{Z}) \)-modular inflation models by re-expressing inflationary observables in terms of the species scale. We further discuss the implications of this approach for generic Calabi-Yau threefolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00636v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe updated scientific goals for the wide-field, millimeter-wave survey that will be produced by the Simons Observatory (SO). Significant upgrades to the 6-meter SO Large Aperture Telescope (LAT) are expected to be complete by 2028, and will include a doubled mapping speed with 30,000 new detectors and an automated data reduction pipeline. In addition, a new photovoltaic array will supply most of the observatory's power. The LAT survey will cover about 60% of the sky at a regular observing cadence, with five times the angular resolution and ten times the map depth of Planck. The science goals are to: (1) determine the physical conditions in the early universe and constrain the existence of new light particles; (2) measure the integrated distribution of mass, electron pressure, and electron momentum in the late-time universe, and, in combination with optical surveys, determine the neutrino mass and the effects of dark energy via tomographic measurements of the growth of structure at $z &lt; 3$; (3) measure the distribution of electron density and pressure around galaxy groups and clusters, and calibrate the effects of energy input from galaxy formation on the surrounding environment; (4) produce a sample of more than 30,000 galaxy clusters, and more than 100,000 extragalactic millimeter sources, including regularly sampled AGN light-curves, to study these sources and their emission physics; (5) measure the polarized emission from magnetically aligned dust grains in our Galaxy, to study the properties of dust and the role of magnetic fields in star formation; (6) constrain asteroid regoliths, search for Trans-Neptunian Objects, and either detect or eliminate large portions of the phase space in the search for Planet 9; and (7) provide a powerful new window into the transient universe on time scales of minutes to years, concurrent with observations from Rubin of overlapping sky.</description>

      <title>Environmental effects in stellar mass gravitational wave sources I: Expected fraction of signals with significant dephasing in the dynamical and AGN channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24084v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first overview of the expected quantity of signals which will showcase significant gravitational wave phase shifts caused by astrophysical environments, considering the upcoming A+ and A\# LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA, Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope detectors. We construct and analyse two general families of dephasing prescriptions with extensions to eccentric sources, as well as collect five specific prescriptions for the fundamental smoking gun physical mechanisms at play in the dynamical and AGN formation channel for stellar mass binary black holes: Roemer delays, tidal forces and hydrodynamical interactions. We compute the expected fraction of signals containing astrophysical dephasing, as a function of environmental properties and based on observed distributions of binary parameters. We find that next generation detectors can expect to find environmental effects in hundreds of detected signals.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave signals from primordial black holes orbiting solar-type stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses between $10^{14}$ and $10^{20}$ kg are candidates to contribute a substantial fraction of the total dark matter abundance. When in orbit around the center of a star, which can possibly be a completely interior orbit, such objects would emit gravitational waves, as predicted by general relativity. In this work, we examine the gravitational wave signals emitted by such objects when they orbit typical stars, such as the Sun. We show that the magnitude of the waves that could eventually be detected on Earth from a possible PBH orbiting the Sun or a neighboring Sun-like star within our galaxy can be significantly stronger than those originating from a PBH orbiting a denser but more distant neutron star (NS). Such signals may be detectable by the LISA gravitational-wave detector. In addition, we estimate the contribution that a large collection of such PBH-star systems would make to the stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) within a range of frequencies to which pulsar timing arrays are sensitive.</description>

      <title>Dissecting environmental effects with eccentric gravitational wave sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09140v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We model the effect of resonances between time-varying perturbative forces and the epi-cyclical motion of eccentric binaries in the gravitational wave (GW) driven regime. These induce secular drifts in the orbital elements which are reflected in a dephasing of the binary's GW signal, derived here systematically. The resulting dephasing prescriptions showcase a much richer phenomenology with respect to typically adopted power-laws, and are better able to model realistic environmental effects (EE). The most important consequences are for gas embedded binaries, which we analyse in detail with a series of analytical calculations, numerical experiments and a curated set of hydrodynamical simulations for equal masses. Even in these simplified tests, we find the surprising result that dephasing caused by epi-cyclical resonances dominate over expectations based on smoothed or orbit averaged gas drag models in GW signals that retain mild eccentricity in the detector band ($e&gt; 0.05$). We discuss how dissecting GW dephasing in its component Fourier modes can be used to probe the coupling of binaries with their surrounding environment in unprecedented detail.</description>

      <title>Absolute Calibration of Cluster Mira Variables to Provide a New Anchor for the Hubble Constant Determination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mira variables in globular clusters can provide an accurate and precise absolute calibration of their period-luminosity relations (PLRs) to independently anchor the cosmic distance scale and determine the Hubble constant. We present homogeneous near-infrared ($JHK_s$) time-series photometric observations of a sample of 55 candidate long-period variables in 18 globular clusters covering a wide metallicity range ($-1.7 &lt; \textrm{[Fe/H]} &lt; -0.1$ dex). The Gaia proper motions, long-period variability information, and optical-infrared colors are used to identify 41 oxygen-rich Miras as members of the globular clusters. Mean luminosities of Miras in the $JHK_s$ bands are independently calibrated using the recommended distances and mean parallaxes to their host clusters. Cluster Mira PLRs exhibit scatter comparable to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) variables and do not show any dependence on iron abundance for a wide range of metallicities. We establish the accuracy of cluster Miras as independent anchors by determining a distance modulus to the LMC, $18.45 \pm 0.04$ mag, in agreement with the 1.2\% precise geometric distance. Our $H$-band photometry is transformed to derive Hubble Space Telescope F160W PLR for cluster Miras providing a three-anchor baseline with the LMC and NGC 4258. We employ three-anchor solution to determine distances to two type Ia supernovae host galaxies, NGC 1559 ($31.39\pm0.05$ mag) and M101 ($29.07\pm0.04$ mag), and provide a $3.7\%$ measurement of the Hubble constant, $H_0 = 73.06\pm 2.67$ km~s$^{-1}$~Mpc$^{-1}$. Similar to Cepheids, our independent baseline solution results in a local $H_0$ determination that is systematically larger than its inference from the early universe probes, further supporting the ongoing Hubble tension.</description>
