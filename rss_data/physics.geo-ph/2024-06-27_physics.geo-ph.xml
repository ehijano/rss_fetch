      <title>Modeling Soils' Failure Envelope with Virtual Displacements (LSVD)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes the Least Squares with Virtual Displacements (LSVD) method to obtain the shear strength of n soil samples for the cohesionless, frictionless and mixed resistance conditions. Finding a common tangent line of more than two samples may not have an exact solution, especially if there are measurement errors. LSVD is an iterative method to find the best common tangent line or function to the n soil samples. There are soils that can be modeled with a linear failure envelope but the LSVD can be formulated in different forms, adapting itself to other criterion too, like the logarithmic failure envelope. The tested data is analyzed with LSVD and compared between other commonly used methods, like p-q method and CTPAC. The soils' samples were subjected to random noise to simulate errors from measurements to study the method's results. Also with that analysis a common reference point can be found to compare the methods given that all of them take different points of the Mohr Circles.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous determination of the dielectric relaxation behavior and soilwater characteristic curve of undisturbed soil samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The frequency dependence of soil electromagnetic properties contain valuable information of the porous material due to strong contributions to the dielectric relaxation behavior by interactions between aqueous pore solution and mineral phases due to interface effects. Soil hydraulic properties such as matric potential are also influenced by different surface bonding forces due to interface processes. For this reason, a new analysis methodology was developed, which allows a simultaneous determination of the soil water characteristic curve and the dielectric relaxation behavior of undisturbed soil samples. This opens the possibility to systematically analyze coupled hydraulic/dielectric soil properties for the development of pedotransfer functions to estimate physico-chemical parameters with broadband HF-EM measurement techniques.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Multiphase Flow Simulations with Denoising Diffusion Model Driven Initializations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a hybrid fluid simulation approach that integrates generative diffusion models with physics-based simulations, aiming at reducing the computational costs of flow simulations while still honoring all the physical properties of interest. These simulations enhance our understanding of applications such as assessing hydrogen and CO$_2$ storage efficiency in underground reservoirs. Nevertheless, they are computationally expensive and the presence of nonunique solutions can require multiple simulations within a single geometry. To overcome the computational cost hurdle, we propose a hybrid method that couples generative diffusion models and physics-based modeling. We introduce a system to condition the diffusion model with a geometry of interest, allowing to produce variable fluid saturations in the same geometry. While training the model, we simultaneously generate initial conditions and perform physics-based simulations using these conditions. This integrated approach enables us to receive real-time feedback on a single compute node equipped with both CPUs and GPUs. By efficiently managing these processes within one compute node, we can continuously evaluate performance and stop training when the desired criteria are met. To test our model, we generate realizations in a real Berea sandstone fracture which shows that our technique is up to 4.4 times faster than commonly used flow simulation initializations.</description>

      <title>Latent diffusion models for parameterization and data assimilation of facies-based geomodels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14815v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Geological parameterization entails the representation of a geomodel using a small set of latent variables and a mapping from these variables to grid-block properties such as porosity and permeability. Parameterization is useful for data assimilation (history matching), as it maintains geological realism while reducing the number of variables to be determined. Diffusion models are a new class of generative deep-learning procedures that have been shown to outperform previous methods, such as generative adversarial networks, for image generation tasks. Diffusion models are trained to "denoise", which enables them to generate new geological realizations from input fields characterized by random noise. Latent diffusion models, which are the specific variant considered in this study, provide dimension reduction through use of a low-dimensional latent variable. The model developed in this work includes a variational autoencoder for dimension reduction and a U-net for the denoising process. Our application involves conditional 2D three-facies (channel-levee-mud) systems. The latent diffusion model is shown to provide realizations that are visually consistent with samples from geomodeling software. Quantitative metrics involving spatial and flow-response statistics are evaluated, and general agreement between the diffusion-generated models and reference realizations is observed. Stability tests are performed to assess the smoothness of the parameterization method. The latent diffusion model is then used for ensemble-based data assimilation. Two synthetic "true" models are considered. Significant uncertainty reduction, posterior P$_{10}$-P$_{90}$ forecasts that generally bracket observed data, and consistent posterior geomodels, are achieved in both cases.</description>
