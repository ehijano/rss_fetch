      <title>Tilings with Infinite Local Complexity and n-Fold Rotational Symmetry, n=13,17,21</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A tiling is said to have infinite local complexity (ILC) if it contains infinitely many two-tile patches up to rigid motions. In this work, we provide examples of substitution rules that generate tilings with ILC. The proof relies on Danzer's algorithm, which assumes that the substitution factor is non-Pisot. In addition to ILC, the tiling space of each substitution rule contains a tiling that exhibits global n-fold rotational symmetry, n=13,17,21.</description>

      <title>Analytically one-dimensional planes and the Combinatorial Loewner Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is a major problem in analysis on metric spaces to understand when a metric space is quasisymmetric to a space with strong analytic structure, a so-called Loewner space. A conjecture of Kleiner, recently disproven by Anttila and the second author, proposes a combinatorial sufficient condition. The counterexamples constructed are all topologically one dimensional, and the sufficiency of Kleiner's condition remains open for most other examples.
  A separate question of Kleiner and Schioppa, apparently unrelated to the problem above, asks about the existence of "analytically $1$-dimensional planes": metric measure spaces quasisymmetric to the Euclidean plane but supporting a $1$-dimensional analytic structure in the sense of Cheeger.
  In this paper, we construct an example for which the conclusion of Kleiner's conjecture is not known to hold. We show that either this conclusion fails in our example or there exists an "analytically $1$-dimensional plane". Thus, our construction either yields a new counterexample to Kleiner's conjecture, different in kind from those of Anttila and the second author, or a resolution to the problem of Kleiner--Schioppa.</description>

      <title>Tubes in sub-Riemannian geometry and a Weyl's invariance result for curves in the Heisenberg groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of the paper is threefold: first, we prove optimal regularity results for the distance from $C^k$ submanifolds of general rank-varying sub-Riemannian structures. Then, we study the asymptotics of the volume of tubular neighbourhoods around such submanifolds. Finally, for the case of curves in the Heisenberg groups, we prove a Weyl's invariance result: the volume of small tubes around a curve does not depend on the way the curve is isometrically embedded, but only on its Reeb angle. The proof does not need the computation of the actual volume of the tube, and it is new even for the three-dimensional Heisenberg group.</description>

      <title>The Star Geometry of Critic-Based Regularizer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variational regularization is a classical technique to solve statistical inference tasks and inverse problems, with modern data-driven approaches parameterizing regularizers via deep neural networks showcasing impressive empirical performance. Recent works along these lines learn task-dependent regularizers. This is done by integrating information about the measurements and ground-truth data in an unsupervised, critic-based loss function, where the regularizer attributes low values to likely data and high values to unlikely data. However, there is little theory about the structure of regularizers learned via this process and how it relates to the two data distributions. To make progress on this challenge, we initiate a study of optimizing critic-based loss functions to learn regularizers over a particular family of regularizers: gauges (or Minkowski functionals) of star-shaped bodies. This family contains regularizers that are commonly employed in practice and shares properties with regularizers parameterized by deep neural networks. We specifically investigate critic-based losses derived from variational representations of statistical distances between probability measures. By leveraging tools from star geometry and dual Brunn-Minkowski theory, we illustrate how these losses can be interpreted as dual mixed volumes that depend on the data distribution. This allows us to derive exact expressions for the optimal regularizer in certain cases. Finally, we identify which neural network architectures give rise to such star body gauges and when do such regularizers have favorable properties for optimization. More broadly, this work highlights how the tools of star geometry can aid in understanding the geometry of unsupervised regularizer learning.</description>

      <title>Convexity of sums of eigenvalues of a segment of unitaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a $n\times n$ unitary matrix $u=e^z$ with $z$ skew-Hermitian, the angles of $u$ are the arguments of its spectrum, i.e. the spectrum of $-iz$. For $1\le m\le n$, we show that $s_m(t)$, the sum of the first $m$ angles of the path $t\mapsto e^{tx}e^y$ of unitary matrices, is a convex function of $t$ (provided the path stays in a vecinity of the identity matrix). This vecinity is described in terms of the opertor norm of matrices, and it is optimal. We show that the when all the maps $t\mapsto s_m(t)$ are linear, then $x$ commutes with $y$. Several application to unitarily invariant norms in the unitary group are given. Then we extend these applications to $Ad$-invariant Finsler norms in the special unitary group of matrices. This last result is obtained by proving that any $Ad$-invariant Finsler norm in a compact semi-simple Lie group $K$ is the supremum of a family of what we call orbit norms, induced by the Killing form of $K$.</description>

      <title>Metric surfaces and conformally removable sets in the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize conformally removable sets in the plane with the aid of the recent developments in the theory of metric surfaces. We prove that a compact set in the plane is $S$-removable if and only if there exists a quasiconformal map from the plane onto a metric surface that maps the given set to a set of linear measure zero. The statement fails if we consider maps into the plane rather than metric surfaces. Moreover, we prove that a set is $S$-removable (resp. $CH$-removable) if and only if every homeomorphism from the plane onto a metric surface (resp. reciprocal metric surface) that is quasiconformal in the complement of the given set is quasiconformal everywhere.</description>

      <title>Persistent equivariant cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article has two goals. First, we hope to give an accessible introduction to persistent equivariant cohomology. Given a topological group $G$ acting on a filtered space, persistent Borel equivariant cohomology measures not only the shape of the filtration, but also attributes of the group action on the filtration, including in particular its fixed points. Second, we give an explicit description of the persistent equivariant cohomology of the circle action on the Vietoris-Rips metric thickenings of the circle, using the Serre spectral sequence and the Gysin homomorphism. Indeed, if $\frac{2\pi k}{2k+1} \le r &lt; \frac{2\pi(k+1)}{2k+3}$, then $H^*_{S^1}(\mathrm{VR}^\mathrm{m}(S^1;r))\cong \mathbb{Z}[u]/(1\cdot3\cdot5\cdot\ldots \cdot (2k+1)\, u^{k+1})$ where $\mathrm{deg}(u)=2$.</description>

      <title>A Universal Triangulation for Flat Tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.05496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A result due to Burago and Zalgaller (1960, 1995) states that every orientable polyhedral surface, one that is obtained by gluing Euclidean polygons, has an isometric piecewise linear (PL) embedding into Euclidean space $\mathbb{E}^3$. A flat torus, resulting from the identification of the opposite sides of a Euclidean parallelogram, is a simple example of polyhedral surface. In a first part, we adapt the proof of Burago and Zalgaller, which is partially non-constructive, to produce PL isometric embeddings of flat tori. Our implementation produces embeddings with a huge number of vertices, moreover distinct for every flat torus. In a second part, based on another construction of Zalgaller (2000) and on recent works by Arnoux et al. (2021), we exhibit a universal triangulation with 2434 triangles which can be embedded linearly on each triangle in order to realize the metric of any flat torus.</description>

      <title>Brunn-Minkowski inequalities for sprays on surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.04585v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of the Minkowski average of two subsets of a Riemannian manifold, in which geodesics are replaced by an arbitrary family of parametrized curves. Under certain assumptions, we characterize families of curves on a Riemannian surface for which a Brunn-Minkowski inequality holds with respect to a given volume form. In particular, we prove that under these assumptions, a family of constant-speed curves on a Riemannian surface satisfies the Brunn-Minkowski inequality with respect to the Riemannian area form if and only if the geodesic curvature of its members is determined by a function $\kappa$ on the surface, and $\kappa$ satisfies the inequality $$K + \kappa^2 - |\nabla\kappa| \ge 0$$ where $K$ is the Gauss curvature.</description>
