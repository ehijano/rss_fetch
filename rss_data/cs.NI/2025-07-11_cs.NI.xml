      <title>Synergistic Localization and Sensing in MIMO-OFDM Systems via Mixed-Integer Bilevel Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless localization and sensing technologies are essential in modern wireless networks, supporting applications in smart cities, the Internet of Things (IoT), and autonomous systems. High-performance localization and sensing systems are critical for both network efficiency and emerging intelligent applications. Integrating channel state information (CSI) with deep learning has recently emerged as a promising solution. Recent works have leveraged the spatial diversity of multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems and the frequency granularity of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveforms to improve spatial resolution. Nevertheless, the joint modeling of localization and sensing under the high-dimensional CSI characteristics of MIMO-OFDM systems remains insufficiently investigated. This work aims to jointly model and optimize localization and sensing tasks to harness their potential synergy. We first formulate localization and sensing as a mixed-integer bilevel deep learning problem and then propose a novel stochastic proximal gradient-based mixed-integer bilevel optimization (SPG-MIBO) algorithm. SPG-MIBO is well-suited for high-dimensional and large-scale datasets, leveraging mini-batch training at each step for computational and memory efficiency. The algorithm is also supported by theoretical convergence guarantees. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets validate its effectiveness and highlight the performance gains from joint localization and sensing optimization.</description>

      <title>DAF: An Efficient End-to-End Dynamic Activation Framework for on-Device DNN Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in on-device training for deep neural networks have underscored the critical need for efficient activation compression to overcome the memory constraints of mobile and edge devices. As activations dominate memory usage during training and are essential for gradient computation, compressing them without compromising accuracy remains a key research challenge. While existing methods for dynamic activation quantization promise theoretical memory savings, their practical deployment is impeded by system-level challenges such as computational overhead and memory fragmentation.
  To address these challenges, we introduce DAF, a Dynamic Activation Framework that enables scalable and efficient on-device training through system-level optimizations. DAF achieves both memory- and time-efficient dynamic quantization training by addressing key system bottlenecks. It develops hybrid reduction operations tailored to the memory hierarchies of mobile and edge SoCs, leverages collaborative CPU-GPU bit-packing for efficient dynamic quantization, and implements an importance-aware paging memory management scheme to reduce fragmentation and support dynamic memory adjustments.
  These optimizations collectively enable DAF to achieve substantial memory savings and speedup without compromising model training accuracy. Evaluations on various deep learning models across embedded and mobile platforms demonstrate up to a $22.9\times$ reduction in memory usage and a $3.2\times$ speedup, making DAF a scalable and practical solution for resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>PHandover: Parallel Handover in Mobile Satellite Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The construction of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations has recently attracted tremendous attention from both academia and industry. The 5G and 6G standards have identified LEO satellite networks as a key component of future mobile networks. However, due to the high-speed movement of satellites, ground terminals often experience frequent and high-latency handovers, which significantly deteriorate the performance of latency-sensitive applications. To address this challenge, we propose a parallel handover mechanism for mobile satellite networks that can considerably reduce handover latency. The main idea is to employ plan-based handovers instead of measurement-based handovers to avoid interactions between the access and core networks, thereby eliminating the significant time overhead associated with traditional handover procedures. Specifically, we introduce a novel network function named the Satellite Synchronized Function (SSF), which is designed to be fully compliant with the standard 5G core network. In addition, we propose a machine learning model for signal strength prediction, coupled with an efficient handover scheduling algorithm. We have conducted extensive experiments, and the results demonstrate that our proposed handover scheme can reduce handover latency by 21\times compared to the standard NTN handover scheme and two other existing handover approaches, along with significant improvements in network stability and user-level performance.</description>

      <title>Energy Transfer and Data Collection from Batteryless Sensors in Low-altitude Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of wireless power transfer (WPT) with Internet of Things (IoT) offers promising solutions for sensing applications, but faces significant challenges when deployed in hard-to-access areas such as high-temperature environments. In such extreme conditions, traditional fixed WPT infrastructure cannot be safely installed, and batteries rapidly degrade due to hardware failures. In this paper, we propose an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted data collection and WPT framework for batteryless sensor (BLS) networks deployed in these challenging environments. Specifically, we consider a practical scenario where a UAV first transfers energy to BLS nodes via WPT, enabling these nodes to subsequently transmit their collected data to the UAV through orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA). Then, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem that aims to maximize the fair data collection volume while minimizing the UAV energy consumption through joint optimization of transmit power allocation and flight trajectory planning. Due to the non-convex nature and dynamic characteristics of this problem, conventional optimization methods prove inadequate. To address these challenges, we propose an enhanced soft actor-critic algorithm with parameter-free attention, prioritized experience replay, and value-based reward centering (SAC-PPV), thereby improving the exploration efficiency and learning stability of the algorithm in complex WPT scenarios. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently outperforms benchmark algorithms under various network configurations.</description>

      <title>A Fragmentation-Aware Adaptive Bilevel Search Framework for Service Mapping in Computing Power Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing Power Network (CPN) unifies wide-area computing resources through coordinated network control, while cloud-native abstractions enable flexible resource orchestration and on-demand service provisioning atop the elastic infrastructure CPN provides. However, current approaches fall short of fully integrating computing resources via network-enabled coordination as envisioned by CPN. In particular, optimally mapping services to an underlying infrastructure to maximize resource efficiency and service satisfaction remains challenging. To overcome this challenge, we formally define the service mapping problem in CPN, establish its theoretical intractability, and identify key challenges in practical optimization. We propose Adaptive Bilevel Search (ABS), a modular framework featuring (1) graph partitioning-based reformulation to capture variable coupling, (2) a bilevel optimization architecture for efficient global exploration with local optimality guarantees, and (3) fragmentation-aware evaluation for global performance guidance. Implemented using distributed particle swarm optimization, ABS is extensively evaluated across diverse CPN scenarios, consistently outperforming existing approaches. Notably, in complex scenarios, ABS achieves up to 73.2% higher computing resource utilization and a 60.2% higher service acceptance ratio compared to the best-performing baseline.</description>

      <title>Can cloud-based VR streaming handle Wi-Fi OBSS contention?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper experimentally analyzes the negative impact of contention caused by neighboring Wi-Fi networks operating on overlapping channels on Virtual Reality (VR) streaming over Wi-Fi, focusing on scenarios of partial and full channel overlap within an 80 MHz channel. Our results show that (i) increasing the number of 80 MHz Overlapping Basic Service Sets (OBSSs) intensifies contention and degrades VR streaming performance; (ii) OBSS activity on the secondary-sided 40 MHz portion degrades performance more than activity on the primary-sided 40 MHz portion; (iii) for the same aggregate load, full channel overlap with two 40 MHz OBSS contenders is less detrimental than partial overlap with a single high-load 40 MHz contender, but more disruptive than full overlap with two 80 MHz contenders; and (iv) full channel overlap with two 40 MHz OBSS contenders has a smaller impact on VR streaming under symmetric traffic loads than under asymmetric loads. Moreover, our results demonstrate that our previously proposed Network-aware Step-wise adaptive bitrate algorithm for VR streaming (NeSt-VR) effectively mitigates performance degradation in OBSS environments, enabling VR streaming under heavier OBSS traffic conditions.</description>

      <title>HaLert: A Resilient Smart City Architecture for Post-Disaster Based on Wi-Fi HaLow Mesh and SDN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Events such as catastrophes and disasters are, in most cases, unpredictable. Consequently, reusing existing infrastructures to develop alternative communication strategies after disasters is essential to minimise the impact of these events on the population's ability to communicate and promptly receive alerts from authorities. In this context, the emergence of smart cities, characterised by dense and geographically distributed IoT networks, presents significant potential for such reuse. This work proposes HaLert, a resilient architecture for smart cities based on a Wi-Fi HaLow IEEE 802.11s mesh network, whose resources can be readily reallocated to support a emergency communication system to exchange messages (including text, location, image, audio, and video) between citizens, authorities, and between both parties. To facilitate remote monitoring and configuration of the network, the architecture incorporates the SDN (Software-Defined Networking) paradigm, supported by a LoRa controlled flooding mesh network. A prototype was developed based on this architecture and tested in a real urban scenario comprising both indoor and outdoor environments. The results demonstrated that, despite the significant impact of obstacles, lack of line-of-sight, and terrain slopes on the latency (average latency between 15 and 54.8 ms) and throughput (upload bitrates between 134 and 726 Kbps and download bitrates between 117 and 682 Kbps) of the Wi-Fi HaLow network, it remained stable and resilient, successfully providing all functionalities associated with the HaLert architecture. The tests conducted on the LoRa network revealed a high average message success rate of 94.96%.</description>

      <title>Collective Communication Profiling of Modern-day Machine Learning Workloads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine Learning jobs, carried out on large number of distributed high performance systems, involve periodic communication using operations like AllReduce, AllGather, and Broadcast. These operations may create high bandwidth and bursty traffic patterns, leading to network congestion and packet loss, thus impacting the performance of these jobs. Hence it is imperative to analyze these patterns, which can be helpful in provisioning network resources depending on the type of machine learning workloads. In this poster we carry out extensive analysis of the collective communication behavior seen in a wide variety of models (ex. DeepSeek, GPT, Llama, etc.) To achieve this we instrument Nvidia Collective Communication Library logging functionality for richer context about the collectives and workloads. We adjust configuration parameters that influence collective communication behavior, such as parallelism, number of nodes, and model type. This overview presents and discusses some of the results on the collective communication behavior for the open source DeepSeek V3 inferencing model, which includes operation type and count, transfer sizes per operation, and request size distribution. Our analysis shows that it makes sense to rethink current collective communication frameworks and network topologies so as to accommodate the effect of network anomalies on the mentioned workloads.</description>

      <title>CHOMET: Conditional Handovers via Meta-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Handovers (HOs) are the cornerstone of modern cellular networks for enabling seamless connectivity to a vast and diverse number of mobile users. However, as mobile networks become more complex with more diverse users and smaller cells, traditional HOs face significant challenges, such as prolonged delays and increased failures. To mitigate these issues, 3GPP introduced conditional handovers (CHOs), a new type of HO that enables the preparation (i.e., resource allocation) of multiple cells for a single user to increase the chance of HO success and decrease the delays in the procedure. Despite its advantages, CHO introduces new challenges that must be addressed, including efficient resource allocation and managing signaling/communication overhead from frequent cell preparations and releases. This paper presents a novel framework aligned with the O-RAN paradigm that leverages meta-learning for CHO optimization, providing robust dynamic regret guarantees and demonstrating at least 180% superior performance than other 3GPP benchmarks in volatile signal conditions.</description>

      <title>Negotiating Strict Latency Limits for Dynamic Real-Time Services in Vehicular Time-Sensitive Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future vehicles are expected to dynamically deploy in-vehicle applications within a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA). Critical services operate under hard real-time constraints, which Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) complements on the in-vehicle Ethernet layer. TSN ensures deterministic communication between critical services and its Credit-Based Shaper (CBS) supports dynamic resource reservations. However, the dynamic nature of service deployment challenges network resource configuration, since any new reservation may change the latency of already validated flows. In addition, standard methods of worst-case latency analysis for CBS have been found incorrect, and current TSN stream reservation procedures lack mechanisms to signal application layer Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements or verify deadlines. In this paper, we propose a QoS negotiation scheme within the automotive SOA that interacts with the TSN network controller to reserve resources while ensuring latency bounds. We comparatively evaluate reservation schemes using worst-case analysis and simulations of a realistic In-Vehicle Network (IVN) for demonstrating their impact on QoS guarantees, resource utilization, and setup times. We find that only a reservation scheme utilizing per-queue delay budgets and network calculus provides valid configurations and guarantees acceptable latency bounds throughout the IVN. The proposed service negotiation mechanism efficiently establishes 450 vehicular network reservations in just 11 ms.</description>

      <title>Direct-to-Cell: A First Look into Starlink's Direct Satellite-to-Device Radio Access Network through Crowdsourced Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00283v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite mega-constellations have recently emerged as a viable access solution for broadband services in underserved areas. In 2024, Direct Satellite-to-Device (DS2D) communications, which enable unmodified smartphones to connect directly to spaceborne base stations, entered large-scale beta testing, with Starlink globally leading deployments. This paper presents the first measurement study of commercial DS2D services. Using crowdsourced mobile network data collected in the U.S. between October 2024 and April 2025, our research derives evidence-based insights into the capabilities, limitations, and prospective evolution of DS2D technologies providing Supplemental Coverage from Space (SCS) services to expand existing mobile network connectivity. We observe a strong correlation between the number of satellites deployed and the expanding extension of observed measurements, concentrated in accessible but poorly covered areas by terrestrial networks, such as national parks and large low-density counties. The data reveal stable physical-layer value measurement throughout the observation period, with a lower median RSRP (24-dB difference) and a higher RSRQ (3 dB difference) compared to terrestrial networks, reflecting the SMS-only usage of the DS2D network during this period. Based on SINR measurements, we estimate the expected performance of the announced DS2D mobile data service to be around 4 Mbps per beam in outdoor conditions. We also discuss strategies to expand this capacity up to 12 Mbps in the future, depending on key regulatory decisions regarding satellite licenses, spectrum availability, and allowable radiated power levels.</description>

      <title>Semantic Edge Computing and Semantic Communications in 6G Networks: A Unifying Survey and Research Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18199v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semantic Edge Computing (SEC) and Semantic Communications (SemComs) have been proposed as viable approaches to achieve real-time edge-enabled intelligence in sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. On one hand, SemCom leverages the strength of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to encode and communicate the semantic information only, while making it robust to channel distortions by compensating for wireless effects. Ultimately, this leads to an improvement in the communication efficiency. On the other hand, SEC has leveraged distributed DNNs to divide the computation of a DNN across different devices based on their computational and networking constraints. Although significant progress has been made in both fields, the literature lacks a systematic view to connect both fields. In this work, we fulfill the current gap by unifying the SEC and SemCom fields. We summarize the research problems in these two fields and provide a comprehensive review of the state of the art with a focus on their technical strengths and challenges.</description>

      <title>Future Resource Bank for ISAC: Achieving Fast and Stable Win-Win Matching for Both Individuals and Coalitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08118v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Future wireless networks must support emerging applications where environmental awareness is as critical as data transmission. Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) enables this vision by allowing base stations (BSs) to allocate bandwidth and power to mobile users (MUs) for communications and cooperative sensing. However, this resource allocation is highly challenging due to: (i) dynamic resource demands from MUs and resource supply from BSs, and (ii) the selfishness of MUs and BSs. To address these challenges, existing solutions rely on either real-time (online) resource trading, which incurs high overhead and failures, or static long-term (offline) resource contracts, which lack flexibility. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Future Resource Bank for ISAC, a hybrid trading framework that integrates offline and online resource allocation through a level-wise client model, where MUs and their coalitions negotiate with BSs. We introduce two mechanisms: (i) Role-Friendly Win-Win Matching (offRFW$^2$M), leveraging overbooking to establish risk-aware, stable contracts, and (ii) Effective Backup Win-Win Matching (onEBW$^2$M), which dynamically reallocates unmet demand and surplus supply. We theoretically prove stability, individual rationality, and weak Pareto optimality of these mechanisms. Through simulations, we show that our framework improves social welfare, latency, and energy efficiency compared to existing methods.</description>
