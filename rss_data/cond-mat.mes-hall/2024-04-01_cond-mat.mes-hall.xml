      <title>Cavity electrodynamics of van der Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures host many-body quantum phenomena that can be tuned in situ using electrostatic gates. These gates are often microstructured graphite flakes that naturally form plasmonic cavities, confining light in discrete standing waves of current density due to their finite size. Their resonances typically lie in the GHz - THz range, corresponding to the same $\mu$eV - meV energy scale characteristic of many quantum effects in the materials they electrically control. This raises the possibility that built-in cavity modes could be relevant for shaping the low-energy physics of vdW heterostructures. However, capturing this light-matter interaction remains elusive as devices are significantly smaller than the diffraction limit at these wavelengths, hindering far-field spectroscopic tools. Here, we report on the sub-wavelength cavity electrodynamics of graphene embedded in a vdW heterostructure plasmonic microcavity. Using on-chip THz spectroscopy, we observed spectral weight transfer and an avoided crossing between the graphite cavity and graphene plasmon modes as the graphene carrier density was tuned, revealing their ultrastrong coupling. Our findings show that intrinsic cavity modes of metallic gates can sense and manipulate the low-energy electrodynamics of vdW heterostructures. This opens a pathway for deeper understanding of emergent phases in these materials and new functionality through cavity control.</description>

      <title>Corner modes in Non-Hermitian long-range model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider non-Hermitian (NH) analog of a second-order topological insulator, protected by chiral symmetry, in the presence of second-nearest neighbor hopping elements to theoretically investigate the interplay between long-range and topological order away from Hermiticity. In addition to the four zero-energy corner modes present in the first nearest neighbor hopping model, we uncover that the second nearest neighbor hopping introduces another topological phase with sixteen zero-energy corner modes. Importantly, the NH effects are manifested in altering the Hermitian phase boundaries for both the models. While comparing the complex energy spectrum under open boundary conditions, and bi-orthogonalized quadrupolar winding number (QWN) in real space, we resolve the apparent anomaly in the bulk boundary correspondence of the NH system as compared to the Hermitian counterpart by incorporating the effect of non-Bloch form of momentum into the mass term. The above invariant is also capable of capturing the phase boundaries between the two different topological phases where the degeneracy of the corner modes is evident, as exclusively observed for the second nearest neighbor model.</description>

      <title>Visualizing orbital angular momentum induced single wavefront dislocation in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase singularities are phase-indeterminate points where wave amplitudes are zero, which manifest as phase vertices or wavefront dislocations. In the realm of optical and electron beams, the phase singularity has been extensively explored, demonstrating a profound connection to orbital angular momentum. Direct local imaging of the impact of orbital angular momentum on phase singularities at the nanoscale, however, remains a challenge and has yet to be achieved. Here, we study the role of orbital angular momentum in phase singularities in graphene, particularly at the atomic level, through scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. Our experiments demonstrate that the scatterings between different orbital angular momentum states, which are induced by local rotational symmetry-breaking potentials, can generate additional phase singularity, and result in robust single wavefront dislocation in real space. Our results pave the way for exploring the effects of orbital degree of freedom on quantum phases in quasiparticle interference processes.</description>

      <title>Rabi flop-assisted electron tunneling through the quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When the external electromagnetic field (EF) with the frequency $\omega $ acts on the discrete levels in the quantum dot (QD), it induces the mixed quantum state characterized by Rabi flops (RF). The RF process involves the oscillations in the level population $\delta n_{\alpha \beta }\left( t\right) $ accompanied by the cyclical absorption and re-emission of photons. The RF time dynamics depend on the Rabi frequency $\omega _{\mathrm{R}}$ and detuning $\Delta =\omega - \omega_Q $, where $\omega_Q =\left( \varepsilon _{\beta }- \varepsilon _{\beta }\right) /\hbar$, $\varepsilon _{\alpha} $ and $\varepsilon _{\beta} $ are the level energies. By using the Floquet formalism to solve the time-dependent wave equations for the voltage-biased QD exposed to EF, we examine how RF is expressed in the electric current. We find that the Rabi flop-assisted tunneling (RFAT) is pronounced in the I-V curves as steps and flat plateaus, whose position and spacing reflect the intrinsic features of the mixed quantum state and directly depend on $\omega _{\mathrm{R}}$ and $\Delta $. Thus, measuring RFAT allows an immediate observation of RF right in the I-V curves, thus improving the versatility and accuracy of many applications in the broad frequency range.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity from On-Chip Metallization on 2D Topological Chalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is a versatile class of quantum materials of interest to various fields including, e.g., nanoelectronics, optical devices, and topological and correlated quantum matter. Tailoring the electronic properties of TMDs is essential to their applications in many directions. Here, we report that a highly controllable and uniform on-chip 2D metallization process converts a class of atomically thin TMDs into robust superconductors, a property belonging to none of the starting materials. As examples, we demonstrate the introduction of superconductivity into a class of 2D air-sensitive topological TMDs, including monolayers of Td-WTe2, 1T'-MoTe2 and 2H-MoTe2, as well as their natural and twisted bilayers, metalized with an ultrathin layer of Palladium. This class of TMDs are known to exhibit intriguing topological phases ranging from topological insulator, Weyl semimetal to fractional Chern insulator. The unique, high-quality two-dimensional metallization process is based on our recent findings of the long-distance, non-Fickian in-plane mass transport and chemistry in 2D that occur at relatively low temperatures and in devices fully encapsulated with inert insulating layers. Highly compatible with existing nanofabrication techniques for van der Waals (vdW) stacks, our results offer a route to designing and engineering superconductivity and topological phases in a class of correlated 2D materials.</description>

      <title>High temperature spin selectivity in a quantum dot qubit using reservoir spin accumulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Employing spins in quantum dots for fault-tolerant quantum computing in large-scale qubit arrays with on-chip control electronics requires high-fidelity qubit operation at elevated temperature. This poses a challenge for single spin initialization and readout. Existing schemes rely on Zeeman splitting or Pauli spin blockade with typical energy scales of 0.1 or 1 meV for electron-based qubits, so that sufficient fidelity is obtained only at temperatures around or below 0.1 or 1 K, respectively. Here we describe a method to achieve high temperature spin selectivity in a quantum dot using a reservoir with a spin accumulation, which deterministically sets the spin of a single electron on the dot. Since spin accumulation as large as 10 meV is achievable in silicon, spin selection with electrically adjustable error rates below $10^{-4}$ is possible even in a liquid He bath at 4 K. Via the reservoir spin accumulation, induced and controlled by a nearby ferromagnet, classical information (magnetization direction) is mapped onto a spin qubit. These features provide the prospect of spin qubit operation at elevated temperatures and connect the worlds of quantum computing and spintronics.</description>

      <title>Theory of the inverse Faraday effect in dissipative Rashba electron systems: Floquet engineering perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically study the inverse Faraday effect (IFE), i.e., photo-induced magnetization, in two-dimensional Rashba spin-orbit coupled electron systems irradiated by a circularly polarized light. Quantum master (GKSL) equation enables us to accurately compute the laser driven dynamics, taking inevitable dissipation effects into account. To find the universal features of laser-driven magnetization and its dynamics, we investigate (i) the nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) driven by a continuous wave (CW) and (ii) ultrafast spin dynamics driven by short laser pulses. In the NESS (i), the laser-induced magnetization and its dependence of several parameters (laser frequency, laser field strength, temperature, dissipation strength, etc.) are shown to be in good agreement with the predictions from Floquet theory for dissipative systems in the high-frequency regime. In the case (ii), we focus on ferromagnetic metal states by introducing an effective magnetic field to the Rashba model as the mean field of electron-electron interaction. We find that a precession of the magnetic moment occurs due to the pulse-driven instantaneous magnetic field and the initial phase of the precession is controlled by changing the sign of light polarization. This is well consistent with the spin dynamics observed in experiments of laser-pulse-driven IFE. We discuss how the pulse-driven dynamics are captured by the Floquet theory. Our results provides a microscopic method to compute ultrafast dynamics in many electron systems irradiated by intense light.</description>

      <title>Tunable Thermoelectric Superconducting Heat Pipe and Diode</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient heat management at cryogenic temperatures is crucial for superconducting quantum technologies. In this study, we demonstrate the heat diode performance of a gap asymmetric superconducting tunnel junction. Our results show that the mechanism of bipolar thermoelectricity, which occurs when the hot side has the larger gap, boosts heat rectification. This improvement is consistent for a broad range of thermal biases and for different values of the superconducting gaps. Additionally, we demonstrate that bipolar thermoelectricity can act as a heat pipe, reducing heat losses towards cold terminals and increasing overall efficiency up to $65\%$. Finally, we show that by adjusting the electrical load, it is possible to tune the heat pipe and diode performances.</description>

      <title>Quadratic optical response of CrSBr controlled by spin-selective interlayer coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical properties of the layered magnet CrSBr are dominated by intralayer excitons: the antiferromagnetic order between the layers makes layer-to-layer charge hopping, and therefore interlayer excitons, spin-forbidden. An external magnetic field, however, continuously drives the magnetic order towards layer-to-layer ferromagnetic, which opens spin-allowed charge-transfer channels between the layers. Here we elaborate how their admixture changes the composition and nature of the excitons, leading to an extension over many layers, and causes a quadratic red-shift with respect to the external magnetic field. We address these effects by ab-initio $GW$-BSE calculations as a function of magnetic field and cast the data into a minimal four-band model to elucidate the interplay between the various interaction and coupling mechanisms. Our findings should be generally valid for antiferromagnetic layered magnets with and without external magnetic fields, and moreover for any couple of layers with different spin directions. Our insights help to systematically address excitons and predict their optical signatures in such systems.</description>

      <title>Field-free switching of perpendicular magnetic elements by using two orthogonal sub nanosecond spin orbit torque pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a field-free switching mechanism that utilizes two spatially orthogonal spin-orbit torque (SOT) currents. Initially applied simultaneously, one of the currents is subsequently switched off. The superposition of these two currents results in an in-plane magnetization, which is not orthogonal to the remaining SOT current after the second one is deactivated. This symmetry-breaking procedure leads to reproducible and rapid switching, with field pulse durations as short as 0.25 nanoseconds.</description>

      <title>Theory of Electron Spin Resonance in Scanning Tunneling Microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy in scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) has enabled probing the electronic structure of single magnetic atoms and molecules on surfaces with unprecedented energy resolution, as well as demonstrating coherent manipulation of single spins. Despite this remarkable success, the field could still be greatly advanced by a more quantitative understanding of the ESR-STM physical mechanisms. Here, we present a theory of ESR-STM which quantitatively models not only the ESR signal itself, but also the full background tunneling current, from which the ESR signal is derived. Our theory is based on a combination of Green's function techniques to describe the electron tunneling and a quantum master equation for the dynamics of the spin system along with microwave radiation interacting with both the tunneling current and the spin system. We show that this theory is able to quantitatively reproduce the experimental results for a spin-1/2 system (TiH molecules on MgO) across many orders of magnitude in tunneling current, providing access to the relaxation and decoherence rates that govern the spin dynamics due to intrinsic mechanisms and to the applied bias voltage. More importantly, our work establishes that: (i) sizable ESR signals, which are a measure of microwave-induced changes in the junction magnetoresistance, require surprisingly high tip spin polarizations, (ii) the coupling of the magnetization dynamics to the microwave field gives rise to the asymmetric ESR spectra often observed in this spectroscopy. Additionally, our theory provides very specific predictions for the dependence of the relaxation and decoherence times on the bias voltage and the tip-sample distance. Finally, with the help of electromagnetic simulations, we find that the transitions in our ESR-STM experiments can be driven by the ac magnetic field at the junction.</description>

      <title>Gate-tunable quantum acoustoelectric transport in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transport probes the motion of quasiparticles in response to external excitations. Apart from the well-known electric and thermoelectric transport, acoustoelectric transport induced by traveling acoustic waves has been rarely explored. Here, by adopting a hybrid nanodevices integrated with piezoelectric substrates, we establish a simple design of acoustoelectric transport with gate tunability. We fabricate dual-gated acoustoelectric devices based on BN-encapsuled graphene on LiNbO3. Longitudinal and transverse acoustoelectric voltages are generated by launching pulsed surface acoustic wave. The gate dependence of zero-field longitudinal acoustoelectric signal presents strikingly similar profiles as that of Hall resistivity, providing a valid approach for extracting carrier density without magnetic field. In magnetic fields, acoustoelectric quantum oscillations appear due to Landau quantization, which are more robust and pronounced than Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations. Our work demonstrates a feasible acoustoelectric setup with gate tunability, which can be extended to the broad scope of various Van der Waals materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The adsorption and self-assembly of vanadyl phthalocyanine molecules on Ag(100) has been investigated using a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy and density functional theory. At sub-monolayer coverage, we observe two distinct adsorption configurations of isolated molecules, corresponding to the central O atom pointing toward (O-down) or away (O-up) from the substrate. Upon adsorption in the O-up orientation, the otherwise achiral molecules take on a windmill-like chiral appearance due to their interaction with the substrate. At monolayer coverage, we observe a self-assembled square lattice with a mixture of O-up and O-down molecules. At higher coverage we find a strong preference for bilayer formation with O-up and O-down molecules in alternating layers, suggesting stabilization by dipolar interactions. Close inspection of the multi-layer surface reveals grain boundaries separating domains of opposite organizational chirality, and long-range ordering.</description>

      <title>On the Hartree-Fock Ground State Manifold in Magic Angle Twisted Graphene Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments have shown that magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) can exhibit correlated insulator behavior at half-filling. Seminal theoretical results towards understanding this phase in MATBG has shown that Hartree-Fock ground states (with a positive charge gap) can be exact many-body ground states of an idealized flat band interacting (FBI) Hamiltonian. We prove that in the absence of spin and valley degrees of freedom, the only Hartree-Fock ground states of the FBI Hamiltonian for MATBG are two ferromagnetic Slater determinants. Incorporating spin and valley degrees of freedom, we provide a complete characterization of the Hartree-Fock ground state manifold, which is generated by a ${\rm U}(4) \times {\rm U}(4)$ hidden symmetry group acting on five elements. We also introduce new tools for ruling out translation symmetry breaking in the Hartree-Fock ground state manifold, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Scanning quantum vortex microscopy reveals thickness-dependent pinning nano-network in superconducting Nb-films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The presence of quantum vortices determines the electromagnetic response of superconducting materials and devices. Controlling the vortex motion, their pinning on intrinsic and artificial defects is therefore essential for superconducting electronics. Here we take advantage of the attractive force between a magnetic cantilever of the Magnetic Force Microscope and a single quantum vortex to spatially map the pinning force inside 50-240 nm thick magnetron-sputtered Nb-films, commonly used in advanced superconducting electronics. The revealed pinning nano-network is related to the thickness-dependent granular structure of the films as well as to the characteristic microscopic scales of superconductivity.

      <title>Hydroelectric energy conversion of waste flows through hydro-electronic drag</title>

Abstract: Hydraulic energy is a key component of the global energy mix, yet there exists no practical way of harvesting it at small scales, from flows at low Reynolds number. This has triggered the search for alternative hydroelectric conversion methodologies, leading to unconventional proposals based on droplet triboelectricity, water evaporation, osmotic energy or flow-induced ionic Coulomb drag. Yet, these approaches systematically rely on ions as intermediate charge carriers, limiting the achievable power density. Here, we predict that the kinetic energy of small-scale "waste" flows can be directly and efficiently converted into electricity thanks to the hydro-electronic drag effect, by which an ion-free liquid induces an electronic current in the solid wall along which it flows. This effect originates in the fluctuation-induced coupling between fluid motion and electron transport. We develop a non-equilibrium thermodynamic formalism to assess the efficiency of such hydroelectric energy conversion, dubbed hydronic energy. We find that hydronic energy conversion is analogous to thermoelectricity, with the efficiency being controlled by a dimensionless figure of merit. However, in contrast to its thermoelectric analogue, this figure of merit combines independently tunable parameters of the solid and the liquid, and can thus significantly exceed unity. Our findings suggest new strategies for blue energy harvesting without electrochemistry, and for waste flow mitigation in membrane-based filtration processes.</description>

      <title>Electric field enhancement of the superconducting spin-valve effect via strain-transfer across a ferromagnetic/ferroelectric interface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a ferromagnet/superconductor/ferromagnet (F/S/F) superconducting spin-valve (SSV), a change of the magnetization alignment of the two F layers modulates the critical temperature (Tc) of the S layer. The Tc-switching (the SSV effect) is based on the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism. Fast and large resistive switching associated with the Tc-switching is suitable for nonvolatile cryogenic memory applications. However, external magnetic field-based operation of SSVs is hindering their miniaturization, and therefore, electric field control of the SSV effect is desired. Here, we report epitaxial growth of a La0.67Ca0.33MnO3/YBa2Cu3O7/La0.67Ca0.33MnO3 SSV on a piezo-electric [Pb(Mg0.33Nb0.67)O3]0.7-[PbTiO3]0.3 (001) substrate and demonstrate electric field control of the SSV effect. Electric field-induced strain-transfer from the piezo-electric substrate increases the magnetization and Tc of the SSV, and leads to an enhancement of the magnitude of Tc-switching. The results are promising for the development of magnetic-field-free superconducting spintronic devices, in which the S/F interaction is not only sensitive to the magnetization alignment but also to an applied electric field.</description>

      <title>Topological fluids with boundaries and fractional quantum Hall edge dynamics: A fluid dynamics derivation of the chiral boson action</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.06516v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the bulk and boundary dynamics of Laughlin states, which are modeled using composite boson theory within a fluid dynamics framework. In this work, we adopt an alternative starting point based on a hydrodynamic action with topological terms, which fleshes out the fluid aspects of the Laughlin state manifestly. For a particular choice of the velocity field, the fluid equation for this action is akin to first-order hydrodynamic equations, supplemented with an additional constitutive equation known as the Hall constraint. When a hard wall boundary is present, one of the topological terms in the fluid action triggers anomaly inflow, indicating the presence of gauge anomaly at the edge. The first-order hydrodynamic equations require a second boundary condition which, in the absence of dissipation, can be either a no-slip or a no-stress condition. We find that the no-slip condition, where the fluid adheres to the wall is incompatible with the chiral edge dynamics. On the other hand, the no-stress condition, which allows the fluid to move along the wall without friction, is consistent with the expected chiral edge dynamics of the Laughlin state. Furthermore, our work derives this modified no-stress boundary condition within a variational principle. This is accomplished by incorporating a chiral boson action within the boundary action that is non-linearly coupled to the edge density, thus systematically extending the edge chiral Luttinger liquid theory.</description>

Abstract: A striking feature of non-Hermitian systems is the presence of two different types of topology. One generalizes Hermitian topological phases, and the other is intrinsic to non-Hermitian systems, which are called line-gap topology and point-gap topology, respectively. Whereas the bulk-boundary correspondence is a fundamental principle in the former topology, its role in the latter has not been clear yet. This Letter establishes the bulk-boundary correspondence in the point-gap topology in non-Hermitian systems. After revealing the requirement for point-gap topology in the open boundary conditions, we clarify that the bulk point-gap topology in open boundary conditions can be different from that in periodic boundary conditions. On the basis of real space topological invariants and the $K$-theory, we give a complete classification of the open boundary point-gap topology with symmetry and show that the nontrivial open boundary topology results in robust and exotic surface states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.11743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nanostructuring on length scales corresponding to phonon mean free paths provides control over heat flow in semiconductors and makes it possible to engineer their thermal properties. However, the influence of boundaries limits the validity of bulk models, while first principles calculations are too computationally expensive to model real devices. Here we use extreme ultraviolet beams to study phonon transport dynamics in a 3D nanostructured silicon metalattice with deep nanoscale feature size, and observe dramatically reduced thermal conductivity relative to bulk. To explain this behavior, we develop a predictive theory wherein thermal conduction separates into a geometric permeability component and an intrinsic viscous contribution, arising from a new and universal effect of nanoscale confinement on phonon flow. Using experiments and atomistic simulations, we show that our theory applies to a general set of highly-confined silicon nanosystems, from metalattices, nanomeshes, porous nanowires to nanowire networks, of great interest for next-generation energy-efficient devices.</description>

Abstract: Using a pure electric current to control kagome noncollinear antiferromagnets is promising in information storage and processing, but a full description is still lacking, in particular, on intrinsic (i.e., no external magnetic fields or external spin currents) spin-orbit torques. In this work, we self-consistently describe the relations among the electronic structure, magnetic structure, spin accumulations, and intrinsic spin-orbit torques, in the magnetic dynamics of a noncollinear antiferromagnet driven by a pure electric current. Our calculation can yield a critical current density comparable with those in the experiments, when considering the boost from the out-of-plane magnetic dynamics induced by the current-driven spin accumulation on individual magnetic moments. We stress the parity symmetry breaking in deterministic switching among magnetic structures. This work will be helpful for future applications of noncollinear antiferromagnets.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the Hubbard model is crucial for investigating various quantum many-body states and its fermionic and bosonic versions have been largely realized separately. Recently, transition metal dichalcogenides heterobilayers have emerged as a promising platform for simulating the rich physics of the Hubbard model. In this work, we explore the interplay between fermionic and bosonic populations, using a $\rm{WS}_2$/$\rm{WSe}_2$ heterobilayer device that hosts this hybrid particle density. We independently tune the fermionic and bosonic populations by electronic doping and optical injection of electron-hole pairs, respectively. This enables us to form strongly interacting excitons that are manifested in a large energy gap in the photoluminescence spectrum. The incompressibility of excitons is further corroborated by measuring exciton diffusion, which remains constant upon increasing pumping intensity, as opposed to the expected behavior of a weakly interacting gas of bosons, suggesting the formation of a bosonic Mott insulator. We explain our observations using a two-band model including phase space filling. Our system provides a controllable approach to the exploration of quantum many-body effects in the generalized Bose-Fermi-Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>Distinct quasiparticle interference patterns for surface impurity scattering on various Weyl semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.01422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the response of the Fermi arc in the context of quasi-particle interference (QPI) with regard to a localized surface impurity on various three-dimensional Weyl semimetals (WSMs). Our study also reveals the variation of the local density of states (LDOS), obtained by Fourier transforming the QPI profile, on the two-dimensional surface. We use the $T$-matrix formalism to numerically (analytically and numerically) capture the details of the momentum space scattering in QPI (real space decay in LDOS), considering relevant tight-binding lattice and/or low-energy continuum models modeling a range of different WSMs. In particular, we consider multi-WSM (mWSM), hosting multiple Fermi arcs between two opposite chirality Weyl nodes (WNs), where we find a universal $1/r$-decay ($r$ measuring the radial distance from the impurity core) of the impurity-induced LDOS, irrespective of the topological charge. Interestingly, the inter-Fermi arc scattering is only present for triple WSMs, where we find an additional $1/r^3$-decay as compared to double and single WSMs. The untilted single (double) [triple] WSM shows a straight-line (leaf-like) [oval-shaped] QPI profile. The above QPI profiles are canted for hybrid WSMs where type-I and type-II Weyl nodes coexist, however, hybrid single WSM demonstrates strong non-uniformity, unlike the hybrid double and triple WSMs. We also show that the chirality and the positions of the Weyl nodes imprint marked signatures in the QPI profile. This allows us to distinguish between different WSMs, including the time-reversal-broken WSMs from the time-reversal-invariant WSM, even though both of the WSMs can host two pairs of Weyl nodes. Our study can thus shed light on experimentally obtainable complex QPI profiles and help differentiate different WSMs and their surface band structures.</description>

      <title>Fragility of surface states in non-Wigner Dyson topological insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological insulators and superconductors support extended surface states protected against the otherwise localizing effects of static disorder. Specifically, in the Wigner-Dyson insulators belonging to the symmetry classes A, AI, and AII, a band of extended surface states is continuously connected to a likewise extended set of bulk states forming a ``bridge'' between different surfaces via the mechanism of spectral flow. In this work we show that this mechanism is absent in the majority of non-Wigner-Dyson topological superconductors and chiral topological insulators. In these systems, there is precisely one point with granted extended states, the center of the band, $E=0$. Away from it, states are spatially localized, or can be made so by the addition of spatially local potentials. Considering the three-dimensional insulator in class AIII and winding number $\nu=1$ as a paradigmatic case study, we discuss the physical principles behind this phenomenon, and its methodological and applied consequences. In particular, we show that low-energy Dirac approximations in the description of surface states can be treacherous in that they tend to conceal the localizability phenomenon. We also identify markers defined in terms of Berry curvature as measures for the degree of state localization in lattice models, and back our analytical predictions by extensive numerical simulations. A main conclusion of this work is that the surface phenomenology of non-Wigner-Dyson topological insulators is a lot richer than that of their Wigner-Dyson siblings, extreme limits being spectrum-wide quantum critical delocalization of all states vs. full localization except at the $E=0$ critical point. As part of our study we identify possible experimental signatures distinguishing between these different alternatives in transport or tunnel spectroscopy.</description>

Abstract: A coupled oscillator network may be able to perform an energy-efficient associative memory operation. However, its realization has been difficult because inhomogeneities unavoidably arise among the oscillators during fabrication and lead to an unreliable operation. This issue could be resolved if the oscillator network were able to be formed from a single oscillator. Here, we performed numerical simulations and theoretical analyses on an associative memory operation that uses a virtual oscillator network based on a spin-torque oscillator. The virtual network combines the concept of coupled oscillators with that of feedforward neural networks. Numerical experiments demonstrate successful associations of $60$-pixel patterns with various memorized patterns. Moreover, the origin of the associative memory is shown to be forced synchronization driven by feedforward input, where phase differences among oscillators are fixed and correspond to the colors of the pixels in the pattern.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Edge magnetoplasmons arise on a boundary of conducting layer in perpendicular magnetic field due to an interplay of electron cyclotron motion and Coulomb repulsion. Lateral electric field, which confines electrons inside the sample, drives their spiraling motion in magnetic field along the edge with the average drift velocity contributing to the total magnetoplasmon velocity. We revisit this classical picture by developing fully quantum theory of drift velocity starting from analysis of magnetic edge channels and their electrodynamic response. We derive the quantum-mechanical expression for the drift velocity, which arises in our theory as a characteristic of such response and can be calculated as harmonic mean of group velocities of edge channels crossing the Fermi level. Using the Wiener-Hopf method to solve analytically the edge mode electrodynamic problem, we demonstrate that the edge channel response effectively enhances the bulk Hall response of the conducting layer and thus increases the edge magnetoplasmon velocity. In the long-wavelength limit of our model, the drift velocity is simply added to the total magnetoplasmon velocity, in agreement with the classical picture.</description>

Abstract: BiTeI is a polar semiconductor with strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) that produces large Rashba spin splitting. Due to its potential utility in spintronics and magnetoelectrics, it is essential to understand how defects impact the spin transport in this material. Using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, we image ring-like charging states of single-atom defects on the iodine surface of BiTeI. We observe nanoscale variations in the Rashba energy around each defect, which we correlate with the local electric field extracted from the bias dependence of each ring radius. Our data demonstrate the local impact of atomic defects on the Rashba effect, which is both a challenge and an opportunity for the development of future nanoscale spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Anomalous terahertz photoconductivity caused by the superballistic flow of hydrodynamic electrons in graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light incident upon materials can induce changes in their electrical conductivity, a phenomenon referred to as photoresistance. In semiconductors, the photoresistance is negative, as light-induced promotion of electrons across the band gap enhances the number of charge carriers participating in transport. In superconductors, the photoresistance is positive because of the destruction of the superconducting state, whereas in normal metals it is vanishing. Here we report a qualitative deviation from the standard behavior in metallic graphene. We show that Dirac electrons exposed to continuous wave (CW) terahertz (THz) radiation can be thermally decoupled from the lattice by 50~K which activates hydrodynamic electron transport. In this regime, the resistance of graphene constrictions experiences a decrease caused by the THz-driven superballistic flow of correlated electrons. We analyze the dependencies of the negative photoresistance on the carrier density, and the radiation power and show that our superballistic devices operate as sensitive phonon-cooled bolometers and can thus offer a picosecond-scale response time. Beyond their fundamental implications, our findings underscore the practicality of electron hydrodynamics in designing ultra-fast THz sensors and electron thermometers.</description>

Abstract: A novel class of antiferromagnets, dubbed altermagnets, exhibit a non-relativistically spin-split band structure reminiscent of $d$-wave superconductors, despite the absence of net magnetization. This unique characteristic enables utilization in cryogenic stray-field-free memory devices, offering the possibility of achieving high storage densities. In this Letter, we determine how a proximate altermagnet influences the critical temperature $T_c$ of a conventional $s$-wave singlet superconductor. Considering both a bilayer and trilayer, we show that such hybrid structures may serve as stray-field free memory devices where the critical temperature is controlled by rotating the N\'eel vector of one altermagnet, providing infinite magnetoresistance. Furthermore, our study reveals that altermagnetism can coexist with superconductivity up to a critical strength of the altermagnetic order as well as robustness of the altermagnetic influence on the conduction electrons against non-magnetic impurities, ensuring the persistence of the proximity effect under realistic experimental conditions.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the thermoelastic response of a nanostructure is crucial for the choice of materials and interfaces in electronic devices with improved and tailored transport properties, at the length scales of the present technology. Here we show how the deposition of a $MoS_2$ monolayer can strongly modify the nanoscale thermoelastic dynamics of silicon substrates close to their interface. We achieve this result by creating a transient grating with extreme ultraviolet light, using ultrashort free-electron laser pulses, whose $\approx$84 nm period is comparable to the size of elements typically used in nanodevices, such as electric contacts and nanowires. The thermoelastic response, featured by coherent acoustic waves and an incoherent relaxation, is tangibly modified by the presence of monolayer $MoS_2$. Namely, we observed a major reduction of the amplitude of the surface mode, which is almost suppressed, while the longitudinal mode is basically unperturbed, aside from a faster decay of the acoustic modulations. We interpret this behavior as a selective modification of the surface elasticity and we discuss the conditions to observe such effect, which might be of immediate relevance for the design of Si-based nanoscale devices.</description>
