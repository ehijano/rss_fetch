      <title>On the rank varieties of some simple modules for symmetric groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the previous work, Lim and the author determined the rank variety of the simple $\mathbb{F}\mathfrak{S}_{kp}$-module $D(p-1)=D^{(kp-p+1,1^{p-1})}$ with respect to some maximal elementary abelian $p$-subgroup $E_k$ and the complexity when $k\not\equiv 1\pmod p$ and $p$ is odd. Their method relied on the dimension of the module, which is dependent on $k$. In this paper, we extend this result to the case for any $k\geq 2$, and determine the rank variety of $D(p-1)$ and its complexity, providing a proof independent of $k$.</description>

      <title>Decomposing zero-dimensional persistent homology over rooted tree quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a functor from any category into the category of topological spaces, one obtains a linear representation of the category by post-composing the given functor with a homology functor with field coefficients. This construction is fundamental in persistence theory, where it is known as persistent homology, and where the category is typically a poset. Persistence theory is particularly successful when the poset is a finite linearly ordered set, owing to the fact that in this case its category of representations is of finite type. We show that when the poset is a rooted tree poset (a poset with a maximum and whose Hasse diagram is a tree) the additive closure of the category of representations obtainable as zero-dimensional persistent homology is of finite type, and give a quadratic-time algorithm for decomposition into indecomposables. In doing this, we give an algebraic characterization of the additive closure in terms of Ringel's tree modules, and show that its indecomposable objects are the reduced representations of Kinser.</description>

      <title>Periodicity shadows II. Computational aspects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article provides the second part of the research initiated in arXiv:2411.17381, where we introduced and investigated so called periodicity shadows, which are special skew-symmetric matrices related to symmetric algebras with periodic simple modules. In arXiv:2411.17381 we focused on theoretical aspects, whereas here we present complementary cosiderations concerning computational issues. Namely, we discuss an algorithm, which computes all tame periodicity shadows of given size (see Section 2), and then present lists of all tame periodicity shadows of small sizes, that is at most 6.</description>

      <title>Hecke algebras and local Langlands correspondence for non-singular depth-zero representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let G be a connected reductive group over a non-archimedean local field. We say that an irreducible depth-zero (complex) G-representation is non-singular if its cuspidal support is non-singular. We establish a Local Langlands Correspondence for all such representations. We obtain it as a specialization from a categorical version: an equivalence between the category of finite-length non-singular depth-zero G-representations and the category of finite-length right modules of a direct sum of twisted affine Hecke algebras constructed from Langlands parameters. We also show that our LLC and our equivalence of categories have several nice properties, for example compatibility with parabolic induction.</description>

      <title>Representation theory over semifields and matroidal representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study and classify representations of a torsion group $G$ over an idempotent semifield with special attention on the case over the Boolean semifield $\mathbb{B}$. We also study tropical subrepresentations of the Boolean regular representation $\mathbb{B}[G]$ of a finite group $G$. These are equivalent to the matroids on ground set $G$ for which left-multiplication by each element of $G$ is a matroid automorphism. We completely classify the tropical subrepresentations of $\mathbb{B}[G]$ for rank 3. When $G$ is an abelian group, our approach can be seen as a generalization of Golomb rulers. In doing so, we also introduce an interesting class of matroids obtained from equivalence relations on finite sets.</description>

      <title>Tropical representations and valuated matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore several facets of tropical subrepresentations of a linear representation of a group over the tropical semifield $\mathbb{T}$. A key role in the study of tropical subrepresentations is played by two types of modules over a semiring: weakly free and quasi-free modules. We also investigate subgroups of $\text{GL}_n(K)$ for $K=\mathbb{T}$, $ \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$, and automorphisms of weakly free modules and tropical prevarieties defined by tropical linear equations. As an application of our results, we provide an intrinsic description of tropical subrepresentation via certain quasi-free modules, and prove that a tropical subrepresentation is equivalent to a valuated matroidal representation.</description>

      <title>Wonderful Compactification of a Cartan Subalgebra of a Semisimple Lie Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak h$ be a Cartan subalgebra of a complex semisimple Lie algebra $\mathfrak g.$ We define a compactification $\bar{\mathfrak h}$ of $\mathfrak h$, which is analogous to the closure $\bar H$ of the corresponding maximal torus $H$ in the adjoint group of $\mathfrak g$ in its wonderful compactification, which was introduced and studied by De Concini and Procesi \cite{DCP}. We determine the irreducible components of the boundary $\bar{\mathfrak h} - \mathfrak h$ of $\mathfrak h$ in terms of certain maximal root subsystems described by Borel-de Siebenthal theory. We prove that $\bar{\mathfrak h} - \mathfrak h$ is equidimensional, and we prove that $\bar{\mathfrak h}$ is a normal variety. As a consequence, we find an affine paving of $\bar{\mathfrak h}$, and when $\mathfrak g$ is classical, we determine the number of strata in each dimension in terms of Stirling numbers and their variants, thereby computing the Betti numbers of $\bar{\mathfrak h}.$ In the general case, we relate the order relation on strata given by closures of strata to the poset of hyperplane arrangements studied by Orlik and Solomon, and determine the cup product in the cohomology of $\bar{\mathfrak h}.$ Our work has similarities to results of Braden et al \cite{BHMPW} on matroid Schubert varieties, but the connection to root systems facilitates greater precision in some of our results.</description>

      <title>A string-like realization of hyperbolic Kac-Moody algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new approach to studying hyperbolic Kac-Moody algebras, focussing on the rank-3 algebra $\mathfrak{F}$ first investigated by Feingold and Frenkel. Our approach is based on the concrete realization of this Lie algebra in terms of a Hilbert space of transverse and longitudinal physical string states, which are expressed in a basis using DDF operators. When decomposed under its affine subalgebra $A_1^{(1)}$, the algebra $\mathfrak{F}$ decomposes into an infinite sum of affine representation spaces of $A_1^{(1)}$ for all levels $\ell\in\mathbb{Z}$. For $|\ell| &gt;1$ there appear in addition coset Virasoro representations for all minimal models of central charge $c&lt;1$, but the different level-$\ell$ sectors of $\mathfrak{F}$ do not form proper representations of these because they are incompletely realized in $\mathfrak{F}$. To get around this problem we propose to nevertheless exploit the coset Virasoro algebra for each level by identifying for each level a (for $|\ell|\geq 3$ infinite) set of `Virasoro ground states' that are not necessarily elements of $\mathfrak{F}$ (in which case we refer to them as `virtual'), but from which the level-$\ell$ sectors of $\mathfrak{F}$ can be fully generated by the joint action of affine and coset Virasoro raising operators. We conjecture (and present partial evidence) that the Virasoro ground states for $|\ell|\geq 3$ in turn can be generated from a finite set of `maximal ground states' by the additional action of the `spectator' coset Virasoro raising operators present for all levels $|\ell| &gt; 2$. Our results hint at an intriguing but so far elusive secret behind Einstein's theory of gravity, with possibly important implications for quantum cosmology.</description>

      <title>Polynomial integrable systems from cluster structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general framework for constructing polynomial integrable systems with respect to linearizations of Poisson varieties that admit log-canonical coordinate systems. Our construction is in particular applicable to Poisson varieties with compatible cluster or generalized cluster structures. As examples, we consider an arbitrary standard complex semi-simple Poisson Lie group $G$ with the Berenstein-Fomin-Zelevinsky cluster structure, nilpotent Lie subgroups of $G$ associated to elements of the Weyl group of $G$, identified with Schubert cells in the flag variety of $G$ and equipped with the standard cluster structure (defined by Geiss-Leclerc-Schr\"oer in the simply-laced case), and the dual Poisson Lie group of ${\rm GL}(n, \mathbb C)$ with the Gekhtman-Shapiro-Vainshtein generalized cluster structure. In each of the three cases, we show that every extended cluster in the respective cluster structure gives rise to a polynomial integrable system on the respective Lie algebra with respect to the linearization of the Poisson structure at the identity element. For some of the integrable systems thus obtained, we further show that all their Hamiltonian flows are complete.</description>

      <title>Hopf braces and semi-abelian categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hopf braces have been introduced as a Hopf-theoretic generalization of skew braces. Under the assumption of cocommutativity, these algebraic structures are equivalent to matched pairs of actions on Hopf algebras, that can be used to produce solutions of the quantum Yang-Baxter equation. We prove that the category of cocommutative Hopf braces is semi-abelian and strongly protomodular. In particular, this implies that the main homological lemmas known for groups, Lie algebras and other classical algebraic structures also hold for cocommutative Hopf braces. Abelian objects are commutative and cocommutative Hopf algebras, that form an abelian Birkhoff subcategory of the category of cocommutative Hopf braces. Moreover, we show that the full subcategories of "primitive Hopf braces" and of "skew braces" form an hereditary torsion theory in the category of cocommutative Hopf braces, and that "skew braces" are also a Birkhoff subcategory and a localization of the latter category. Finally, we describe central extensions and commutators for cocommutative Hopf braces.</description>

      <title>Geometry of fibers of the multiplication map of deep linear neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the geometry of the algebraic set of tuples of composable matrices which multiply to a fixed matrix, using tools from the theory of quiver representations. In particular, we determine its codimension $C$ and the number $\theta$ of its top-dimensional irreducible components. Our solution is presented in three forms: a Poincar\'e series in equivariant cohomology, a quadratic integer program, and an explicit formula. In the course of the proof, we establish a surprising property: $C$ and $\theta$ are invariant under arbitrary permutations of the dimension vector. We also show that the real log-canonical threshold of the function taking a tuple to the square Frobenius norm of its product is $C/2$. These results are motivated by the study of deep linear neural networks in machine learning and Bayesian statistics (singular learning theory) and show that deep linear networks are in a certain sense ``mildly singular".</description>

      <title>Block decompositions for $p$-adic classical groups and their inner forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an inner form $\mathrm{G}$ of a general linear group or classical group over a non-archimedean local field of odd residue characteristic, we decompose the category of smooth representations on $\mathbb{Z}[\mu_{p^{\infty}},1/p]$-modules by endo-parameter. We prove that parabolic induction preserves these decompositions, and hence that it preserves endo-parameters. Moreover, we show that the decomposition by endo-parameter is the $\overline{\mathbb{Z}}[1/p]$-block decomposition; and, for $\mathrm{R}$ an integral domain, introduce a graph whose connected components parameterize the $\mathrm{R}$-blocks, in particular including the cases $\mathrm{R}=\overline{\mathbb{Z}}_{\ell}$ and $\mathrm{R}=\overline{\mathbb{F}}_\ell$ for $\ell\neq p$. From our description, we deduce that the $\overline{\mathbb{Z}_\ell}$-blocks and $\overline{\mathbb{F}_\ell}$-blocks of $\mathrm{G}$ are in natural bijection, as had long been expected. Our methods also apply to the trivial endo-parameter (i.e., the depth zero subcategory) of any connected reductive $p$-adic group, providing an alternative approach to results of Dat and Lanard in depth zero. Finally, under a technical assumption (known for inner forms of general linear groups) we reduce the $\mathrm{R}$-block decomposition of $\mathrm{G}$ to depth zero.</description>

Abstract: The $ (k, a) $-generalized Fourier transform $ \mathscr{F}_{k, a} $ introduced by Ben Sa\"id--Kobayashi--{\O}rsted is a deformation family of the classical Fourier transform with a Dunkl parameter $ k $ and a parameter $ a &gt; 0 $ that interpolates minimal representations of two different simple Lie groups. In the present paper, we focus on the case $ a &lt; 0 $. As a main result, we find a unitary transform that intertwines the known case $ a &gt; 0 $ and the new case $ a &lt; 0 $.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that, when $n$ goes to infinity, Kostant's problem has negative answer for almost all simple highest weight modules in the principal block of the BGG category $\mathcal{O}$ for the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}_n(\mathbb{C})$.</description>

      <title>On the local behavior of weighted orbital integrals and the affine Springer fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.15091v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper deals with two problems that seem to be of different nature: the local behavior of the weighted orbital integrals and the dependence of the affine Springer fibers on the root valuation datum of their defining elements. The intersection happens when we try to count the number of points on the fundamental domains of the affine Springer fibers: the number of points can be expressed in terms of certain weighted orbital integrals and vice versa.
  For the first problem, we prove the homogeneity of the Arthur-Shalika germ expansion of the weighted orbital integrals, and establish its parabolic descent. This is then applied to our conjecture about the dependence of the Poincar\'e polynomials of the fundamental domains on the root valuation datum. We show that the generating series of the number of points on the fundamental domains with respect to the root valuation datum of the defining elements is a rational fraction, and we bound its denominator with datum associated to the nilpotent orbits.</description>

      <title>Exceptional hereditary curves and real curve orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we elaborate the theory of exceptional hereditary curves over arbitrary fields. In particular, we study the category of equivariant coherent sheaves on a regular projective curve whose quotient curve has genus zero and prove existence of a tilting object in this case. We also give a link between wallpaper groups and real hereditary curves, providing details to an old observation made by Helmut Lenzing.</description>
