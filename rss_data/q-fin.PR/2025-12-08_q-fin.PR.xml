      <title>Differential ML with a Difference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential ML (Huge and Savine 2020) is a technique for training neural networks to provide fast approximations to complex simulation-based models for derivatives pricing and risk management. It uses price sensitivities calculated through pathwise adjoint differentiation to reduce pricing and hedging errors. However, for options with discontinuous payoffs, such as digital or barrier options, the pathwise sensitivities are biased, and incorporating them into the loss function can magnify errors. We consider alternative methods for estimating sensitivities and find that they can substantially reduce test errors in prices and in their sensitivities. Using differential labels calculated through the likelihood ratio method expands the scope of Differential ML to discontinuous payoffs. A hybrid method incorporates gamma estimates as well as delta estimates, providing further regularization.</description>

      <title>Convolution-FFT for option pricing in the Heston model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a convolution-FFT method for pricing European options under the Heston model that leverages a continuously differentiable representation of the joint characteristic function. Unlike existing Fourier-based methods that rely on branch-cut adjustments or empirically tuned damping parameters, our approach yields a stable integrand even under large frequency oscillations. Crucially, we derive fully analytical error bounds that quantify both truncation error and discretization error in terms of model parameters and grid settings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to provide such explicit, closed-form error estimates for an FFT-based convolution method specialized to the Heston model. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical rates and illustrate robust, high-accuracy option pricing at modest computational cost.</description>

      <title>Retail Investor Horizon and Earnings Announcements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper moves beyond aggregate measures of retail intensity to explore investment horizon as a distinguishing feature of earnings-related return patterns. Using self-reported holding periods from StockTwits (2010-2021), we observe that separating retail activity into "long-horizon" and "short-horizon" cohorts reveals divergent price anomalies. Long-horizon composition is associated with underreaction, characterized by larger initial reactions and pronounced Post-Earnings Announcement Drift (PEAD), suggesting a slow but persistent convergence toward fundamental value. In contrast, short-horizon activity parallels sentiment-driven overreaction, where elevated pre-event sentiment precedes weaker subsequent performance and price reversals. A zero-cost strategy exploiting this heterogeneity, going long on long-horizon stocks and short on short-horizon stocks, yields risk-adjusted alphas of 0.43% per month. These findings suggest that accounting for investment horizon helps disentangles the fundamental signal in retail flow from speculative noise.</description>
