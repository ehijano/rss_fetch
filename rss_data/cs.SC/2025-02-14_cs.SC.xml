      <title>Efficient OWL2QL Meta-reasoning Using ASP-based Hybrid Knowledge Bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metamodeling refers to scenarios in ontologies in which classes and roles can be members of classes or occur in roles. This is a desirable modelling feature in several applications, but allowing it without restrictions is problematic for several reasons, mainly because it causes undecidability. Therefore, practical languages either forbid metamodeling explicitly or treat occurrences of classes as instances to be semantically different from other occurrences, thereby not allowing metamodeling semantically. Several extensions have been proposed to provide metamodeling to some extent. Building on earlier work that reduces metamodeling query answering to Datalog query answering, recently reductions to query answering over hybrid knowledge bases were proposed with the aim of using the Datalog transformation only where necessary. Preliminary work showed that the approach works, but the hoped-for performance improvements were not observed yet. In this work we expand on this body of work by improving the theoretical basis of the reductions and by using alternative tools that show competitive performance.</description>

      <title>Modular Stochastic Rewritable Petri Nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Petri Nets (PN) are widely used for modeling concurrent and distributed systems, but face challenges in modeling adaptive systems. To address this, we have formalized "rewritable" PT nets (RwPT) using Maude, a declarative language with sound rewriting logic semantics. Recently, we introduced a modular approach that utilizes algebraic operators to construct large RwPT models. This technique employs composite node labeling to outline symmetries in hierarchical organization, preserved through net rewrites. Once stochastic parameters are added to the formalism, we present an automated process to derive a lumped CTMC from the quotient graph generated by an RwPT.</description>
