      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The construction of the Extended Hilbert Space (EHS) is presented in the form of a direct sum of the spaces of vectors of finite and infinite norms as the main space in the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics of a multielectron atom. On the example of constructing the analytical structure of the probability amplitude 1s - 3p of photoexcitation of a neon atom, the implementation of the EHS - construct for solving the equations of the self-consistent Hartree-Fock field is given.</description>

      <title>Radio-Frequency Pseudo-Null Induced by Light in an Ion Trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a linear radio-frequency (rf) ion trap, the rf null is the point of zero electric field in the dynamic trapping potential where the ion motion is approximately harmonic. When displaced from the rf null, the ion is superimposed by fast oscillations known as micromotion, which can be probed through motion-sensitive light-atom interactions. In this work, we report on the emergence of the rf pseudo-null, a locus of points where the ion responds to light as if it were at the true rf null, despite being displaced from it. The phenomenon is fully explained by accounting for the general two-dimensional structure of micromotion and is experimentally verified under various potential configurations, with observations in great agreement with numerical simulations. The rf pseudo-null manifests as a line in a two-dimensional parameter space, determined by the geometry of the incident light and its overlap with the motional structure of the ion. The true rf null occurs uniquely at the concurrent point of the pseudo-null lines induced by different light sources.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Phase Control of an Optical Lattice with up to 50 dB Noise Suppression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An optical lattice is a periodic light crystal constructed from the standing-wave interference patterns of laser beams. It can be used to store and manipulate quantum degenerate atoms and is an ideal platform for the quantum simulation of many-body physics. A principal feature is that optical lattices are flexible and possess a variety of multidimensional geometries with modifiable band-structure. An even richer landscape emerges when control functions can be applied to the lattice by modulating the position or amplitude with Floquet driving. However, the desire for realizing high-modulation bandwidths while preserving extreme lattice stability has been difficult to achieve. In this paper, we demonstrate an effective solution that consists of overlapping two counterpropagating lattice beams and controlling the phase and intensity of each with independent acousto-optic modulators. Our phase controller mixes sampled light from both lattice beams with a common optical reference. This dual heterodyne locking method allows exquisite determination of the lattice position, while also removing parasitic phase noise accrued as the beams travel along separate paths. We report up to 50dB suppression in lattice phase noise in the 0.1Hz - 1Hz band along with significant suppression spanning more than four decades of frequency. When integrated, the absolute phase diffusion of the lattice position is only 10\r{A} over 10 s. This method permits precise, high-bandwidth modulation (above 50kHz) of the optical lattice intensity and phase. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach by executing intricate time-varying phase profiles for atom interferometry.</description>

      <title>Theory of quantum optics and optical coherence in high harmonic generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical coherence encodes information about the correlations of the electromagnetic field. In combination with quantum optical approaches, it allows for the study of the correlations between photons. Since the pioneering papers of Glauber, studies of optical coherence have facilitated many fundamental insights into non-classical signatures of light emission processes, with wide applicability in modern quantum technologies. However, when it comes to the photon up-conversion process of high-order harmonic generation the description has focused on semi-classical methods for decades. In this work, we overcome this limitation and establish a quantum optical theory of field correlations for the process of high harmonic generation (HHG). In effect, we introduce the notion of optical coherence at the intersection of quantum optics and strong laser-driven processes, and obtain the harmonic field correlation functions. In particular, we focus on the first and second order field correlation, which allow to understand the origin of the classical properties of the HHG spectrum, and its departure into the quantum regime. Further, we develop the theory for two-time intensity correlation functions of the harmonic field, and demonstrate the onset of anti-bunching signatures in HHG. We study the correlation functions in the regime of a single, few and many emitters in atomic HHG, showing the transition from quantum to classical signatures in the correlations. Since the theory is generic, it can be extended to multi-time correlation functions of any order, and allows to consider the interaction of light with arbitrary material systems.</description>

      <title>The Unitarity-Limit Expansion for Two Nucleons with Perturbative Pions: Digest and Ideas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the Unitarity Limit, the NN S-wave binding energies are zero, the scattering lengths infinite, Physics is universal, i.e. insensitive to details of the interactions, and observables display richer symmetries, namely invariance under both scaling and Wigner's combined SU(4) transformation of spin and isospin. This presentation is a digest of the first quantitative exploration of corrections to this picture when pions are included [1] (see there for a more comprehensive list of references). Since the pion mass and decay constant introduce dimensionful scales in the NN system, they explicitly break the symmetries of the Unitarity fixed point. In $\chi$EFT, these symmetries must therefore be classified as emergent. This text focuses on the $\chi$EFT variant with Perturbative ("KSW") Pions at next-to-next-to leading order (N2LO). This leads to the Hypothesis that both scale invariance and Wigner-SU(4) symmetry in the Unitarity Expansion show persistence, i.e. the footprint of both combined dominates even for $k\gtrsim m_\pi$ and is more relevant than chiral symmetry, so that the tensor/Wigner-SU(4) symmetry-breaking part of OPE is suppressed and does not enter before N3LO. Included are also ideas about underlying mechanisms and LO results of $\chi$EFT with Nonperturbative Pions in the expansion about Unitarity.</description>

      <title>Chirality-induced quantum nonreciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chirality, nonreciprocity, and quantum correlations are at the center of a wide range of intriguing effects and applications across natural sciences and emerging quantum technologies. However, the direct link combining these three essential concepts has remained unknown till now. Here, we establish a chiral non-Hermitian platform with flying atoms and demonstrate chirality-induced nonreciprocal bipartite quantum correlations between two channels: Quantum correlation emerges when two spatially separated light beams of the same polarization propagate in opposite directions in the atomic cloud, and it becomes zero when they travel in the same direction. Thus, just by flipping the propagation direction of one of the beams while keeping its polarization the same as the other beam, we can create or annihilate quantum correlations between two channels. We also show that this nonreciprocal quantum correlation can be extended to multi-color sidebands with Floquet engineering. Our findings may pave the road for realizing one-way quantum effects, such as nonreciprocal squeezing or entanglement, with a variety of chiral devices, for the emerging applications of e.g., directional quantum network or nonreciprocal quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Laser power stabilization using conservation law in acoustic optical modulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An active method of laser power stabilization is realized utilizing an acoustic optical modulator (AOM). Under Bragg diffraction conditions, the total output power of AOM equals the combined power of the 0th and 1st order beams, which are expressed as the sum of the sampling beam power and a temperature-sensitive term. Based on this conservation law, we designed a digital PID control system that dynamically adjusts the 1st order beam power to maintain a stable output of the 0th order application beam. The method allows high availability and deep engagement of the application beam. Experimental result demonstrates that the relative power noise of controlled application beam is reduced by a factor of 200, reaching $4 \times 10^{-6} $ Hz$^{-1/2}$ at 0.0001 Hz compared with the uncontrolled total power. Allan deviation shows that the application beam reaches a relative power instability of 3.28$\times 10^{-6}$ at 500 s averaging time. This active digital control method of laser power in long term can be used for applications requiring ultra-stable laser sources, such as the atomic clocks, interferometers and gyroscopes.</description>

      <title>Realizing exceptional points by Floquet dissipative couplings in thermal atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exceptional degeneracies and generically complex spectra of non-Hermitian systems are at the heart of numerous phenomena absent in the Hermitian realm. Recently, it was suggested that Floquet dissipative coupling in the space-time domain may provide a novel mechanism to drive intriguing spectral topology with no static analogues, though its experimental investigation in quantum systems remains elusive. We demonstrate such Floquet dissipative coupling in an ensemble of thermal atoms interacting with two spatially separated optical beams, and observe an anomalous anti-parity-time symmetry phase transition at an exception point far from the phase-transition threshold of the static counterpart. Our protocol sets the stage for Floquet engineering of non-Hermitian topological spectra, and for engineering new quantum phases that cannot exist in static systems.</description>

      <title>Pulsed Dual-axis Alkali-metal-noble-gas Comagnetometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Alkali-metal-noble-gas comagnetometers are precision probes well-suited for tests of fundamental physics and inertial rotation sensing, combining high sensitivity of the spin-exchange-relaxation free (SERF) magnetometers with inherent suppression of magnetic field noise. Past versions of the device utilizing continuous-wave optical pumping are sensitive to a single axis perpendicular to the plane spanned by the orthogonal pump and probe laser beams. These devices are susceptible to light shifts in the alkali atoms, and to power and beam pointing fluctuations of both the probe and pump lasers, the latter of which is a dominant source of $1/f$ noise. In this work, we model and implement an approach to alkali-metal-noble-gas comagnetometers using pulsed optical pumping. After each pump laser pulse, an off-resonance probe beam measures the precession of noble-gas-spins-coupled alkali spins via optical rotation in the dark, thus eliminating effects from pump laser light shift and power fluctuations. Performing non-linear fitting on the sinusoidal transient signal with a proper phase enables separate and simultaneous measurement of signals along two orthogonal axes in the plane perpendicular to the pump beam. Effects from beam pointing fluctuations of the probe beam in the pump-probe plane is fundamentally eliminated, and signal response to pump beam pointing fluctuations is suppressed by compensation from noble-gas nuclear spins.</description>

      <title>Anomalous suppression of spin-exchange relaxation in alignment signals in cesium in ultra-weak magnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The results of a study of the dynamics of atomic moments alignment in cesium under optical pumping by linearly polarized resonant light in ultra-weak magnetic field are presented. It is shown that there are alignment components whose relaxation does not depend on spin-exchange broadening. The effect of suppression of spin-exchange relaxation in zero magnetic fields is detected, which is similar in its manifestations to the SERF (Spin-Exchange Relaxation Free) effect observed in orientation signals. This observation is interesting from the standpoint of general theory, since the law of conservation of angular momentum responsible for maintaining orientation in the SERF mode should not guarantee the preservation of alignment under the same conditions. A comparison with theoretically calculated parameters of SERF resonances in orientation is given. A qualitative explanation of the observed effect is presented.</description>

      <title>Microwave Phase Mapping and Angle-of-Arrival Detection Using Rydberg Atom-Based Electrometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a method for simultaneously measuring the phase fronts of three or more RF fields using thermal Rydberg atoms. We demonstrate this method using an all-dielectric atomic electrometer acting in a heterodyne configuration to detect three single tone continuous-wave microwave signals propagating in free space. We show that this method can be used to measure the angle of arrival of each source. This method requires no calibration of the incident fields and makes no assumption about the form of the incident phase fronts. Because the sensor is minimally perturbing, it provides a direct probe of signal phase even in complicated environments, such as the near field of an antenna source or scattering surface. The measurements presented here are performed using a single scanned sensor, but this technique can trivially be extended to an array of sensors which would enable phase sensitive imaging and related applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum adiabatic optimization with Rydberg arrays: localization phenomena and encoding strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum adiabatic optimization seeks to solve combinatorial problems using quantum dynamics, requiring the Hamiltonian of the system to align with the problem of interest. However, these Hamiltonians are often incompatible with the native constraints of quantum hardware, necessitating encoding strategies to map the original problem into a hardware-conformant form. While the classical overhead associated with such mappings is easily quantifiable and typically polynomial in problem size, it is much harder to quantify their overhead on the quantum algorithm, e.g., the transformation of the adiabatic timescale. In this work, we address this challenge on the concrete example of the encoding scheme proposed in [Nguyen et al., PRX Quantum 4, 010316 (2023)], which is designed to map optimization problems on arbitrarily connected graphs into Rydberg atom arrays. We consider the fundamental building blocks underlying this encoding scheme and determine the scaling of the minimum gap with system size along adiabatic protocols. Even when the original problem is trivially solvable, we find that the encoded problem can exhibit an exponentially closing minimum gap. We show that this originates from a quantum coherent effect, which gives rise to an unfavorable localization of the ground-state wavefunction. On the QuEra Aquila neutral atom machine, we observe such localization and its effect on the success probability of finding the correct solution to the encoded optimization problem. Finally, we propose quantum-aware modifications of the encoding scheme that avoid this quantum bottleneck and lead to an exponential improvement in the adiabatic performance. This highlights the crucial importance of accounting for quantum effects when designing strategies to encode classical problems onto quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>On the Nature of Subharmonics of the Electron Emission from Ultracold Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00475v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the most interesting phenomena in the ultracold plasmas are multiple subharmonics of the electron emission observed after its irradiation by the monochromatic radiowaves. Unfortunately, the early interpretation of this phenomenon as the so-called Tonks-Dattner resonances (i.e., actually the standing Langmuir waves) encountered a number of serious obstacles, such as a lack of the adequate boundary conditions, an incorrect dependence on the electron temperature, and an insensitivity to the shape of the cloud. Here, we suggest an alternative interpretation based on the quasi-classical multiphoton ionization of the 'secondary' Rydberg atoms formed in the expanding and cooling plasma clouds. As follows from our numerical simulations, the efficiency of such ionization exhibits a series of well-expressed peaks. Moreover, this process is evidently irrelevant to the boundary conditions and global shape of the cloud. Therefore, this should be a viable alternative to the earlier idea of Tonks--Dattner resonances.</description>
