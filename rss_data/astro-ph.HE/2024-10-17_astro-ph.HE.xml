      <title>Impact of chaotic magnetic field on mass-radius relation of rotating neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations reveal that magnetic fields on neutron stars (NSs) are in the range of $10^{8-15}$ G. Apart from being celestial bodies, NSs are normally rotating. In this work, we study the impact of a chaotic magnetic field on the mass-radius relation of the rotating NSs. We employ an equation of state of NSs with the nuclei in the crust and hyperons in the core. We use Hartle-Thorne formalism as an approximation of the rotating NSs. For the magnetic field ansatz, we use the one coupled to the energy density. We find that the magnetic field decreases the mass of NS. In contrast, the increment of the magnetic field increases the deformation of rotating NSs.</description>

      <title>HOLESOM: Constraining the Properties of Slowly-Accreting Massive Black Holes with Self-Organizing Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accreting massive black holes (MBHs, with M$_\bullet &gt; 10^3$ M$_{\odot}$) are known for their panchromatic emission, spanning from radio to gamma rays. While MBHs accreting at significant fractions of their Eddington rate are readily detectable, those accreting at much lower rates in radiatively inefficient modes often go unnoticed, blending in with other astrophysical sources. This challenge is particularly relevant for gas-starved MBHs in external galaxies and those possibly wandering in the Milky Way. We present HOLESOM, a machine learning-powered tool based on the Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) algorithm, specifically designed to identify slowly-accreting MBHs using sparse photometric data. Trained on a comprehensive set of $\sim$ 20, 000 spectral energy distributions (SEDs), HOLESOM can (i) determine if the photometry of a source is consistent with slowly-accreting MBHs and (ii) estimate its black hole mass and Eddington ratio, including uncertainties. We validate HOLESOM through extensive tests on synthetic data and real-world cases, including Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying slowly-accreting MBHs. Additionally, we derive analytical relations between radio and X-ray luminosities to further constrain physical parameters. The primary strength of HOLESOM lies in its ability to accurately identify MBH candidates, which can then be targeted for follow-up photometric and spectroscopic observations. Fast and scalable, HOLESOM offers a robust framework for automatically scanning large multi-wavelength datasets, making it a valuable tool for unveiling hidden MBH populations in the local Universe.</description>

      <title>Data-driven core collapse supernova multilateration with first neutrino events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Galactic core-collapse supernova (CCSN) is likely to be observed in neutrino detectors around the world minutes to hours before the electromagnetic radiation arrives. The SNEWS2.0 network of neutrino and dark matter detectors aims to use the relative arrival times of the neutrinos at the different experiments to point back to the supernova. One of the simplest methods to calculate the CCSN direction is to use the first neutrino events detected through the inverse beta decay (IBD) process, $\overline{\nu}_e p\rightarrow e^+n$. We will consider neutrino detectors sensitive to IBD interactions with low backgrounds. The difference in signal arrival times between a large and a small detector will be biased, however, with the first event at the smaller detector, on average, arriving later than that at the larger detector. This bias can be mitigated by using these first events in a data-driven approach without recourse to simulations or models. In this article, we demonstrate this method and its uncertainty estimate using pairs of detectors of different sizes and with different supernova distances. Finally, we use this method to calculate probability skymaps using four detectors (Super-Kamiokande, JUNO, LVD, and SNO+) and show that the calculated probabilities yield appropriate confidence intervals. The resulting skymaps should be useful for the multi-messenger community to follow up on the SNEWS2.0 Galactic CCSN neutrino alert.</description>

      <title>Revealing EMRI/IMRI candidates with quasiperiodic ultrafast outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first detection of the quasiperiodic ultrafast outflow in the ASASSN-20qc system was reported by Pasham et al. (2024). The outflow is revealed in the soft X-ray spectra as an absorption feature, which is periodically enhanced every $ \sim 8.3$ days. The periodic nature of the ultrafast outflow is best explained by an orbiting massive perturber, most likely an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH), that is inclined with respect to the accretion flow around the primary supermassive black hole (SMBH). In this way, the orbiting body pushes the disc gas into the outflow funnel, where it is accelerated by the ordered magnetic field (Sukov\'a et al. 2021). Quasiperiodic ultrafast outflows (QPOuts) are thus a novel phenomenon that can help reveal new extreme-/intemediate-mass ratio inspiral (EMRI/IMRI) candidates that otherwise do not exhibit significant periodic patterns in the continuum flux density.</description>

      <title>The DAWES review: Gravitational-wave burst astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over a hundred gravitational-wave signals have now been detected from the mergers of black holes and neutron stars, but other sources of gravitational waves have not yet been discovered. Some of the most violent explosive events in the Universe are predicted to emit bursts of gravitational waves, and may result in the next big multi-messenger discovery. Gravitational-wave burst signals often have an unknown waveform shape, and unknown gravitational-wave energy, due to unknown or very complicated progenitor astrophysics. Potential sources of gravitational-wave bursts include core-collapse supernovae, cosmic strings, fast radio bursts, eccentric binary systems, and gravitational-wave memory. In this review, we discuss the astrophysical properties of the main predicted sources of gravitational-wave bursts, and the known features of their gravitational-wave emission. We summarise their future detection prospects, and discuss the challenges of searching for gravitational-wave burst signals and interpreting the astrophysics of the source.</description>

      <title>Could the recent rebrightening of the GW170817A afterglow be caused by a counter jet?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GRB170817A (also GW170817) became the first binary neutron star (BNS) merger event detected via gravitational waves and electromagnetic signals. Over the next 4 years, various multiband observations have led to re-imagine the various short Gamma Ray Burts (sGRB) and interstellar medium interaction models. While these models successfully explain the observed afterglow until ~900 days, a re-brightening or excess flux was observed in the 1keV X-Ray band after ~1000 days. In this study, we re-evaluate the jet parameters using the new observations (until ~1234 days) with a boosted fireball jet model. We study the observable effects of the counter-jet for GRB170817A, using our new afterglow code, Firefly. Our results show that it is indeed possible for the observed excess to coincide with the emissions from the counter-jet (~800 days). We also computed an empirical scaling law between the jet and counter-jet peak emission timescales and the observer angle. The Firefly code can also track the simulated object through the observers' sky and numerically model the apparent motion. The calculated apparent motion (~2.6c) does not match the observed apparent motion (7.5c to 5.2c). Hence we conclude, the excess flux of GRB170817A may not be associated with the counter jet; however, it is not enough to reject this hypothesis from the traditional counter jet visibility time scales, which predicts &gt; 5000 days. The apparent motion, combined with the multi-band lightcurves, is needed to break degeneracy between geometrical parameters and the microphysical parameters of the afterglow.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Accretors and High Energy X-Ray view</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic accretors are cosmic objects that pull matter from their surroundings at speeds almost equal to the light's speed. Because of the tremendous gravitational force from the accretors and the angular momentum of infalling material, which often result in discs of gas and dust that are heated to extremely high temperatures. We encounter strong radiation throughout the electromagnetic spectrum, including intense X-rays. The X-ray view provides a unique window into the behavior of accretors. In this review, we discuss different accretors, particularly binaries, and their origin, involved mechanisms, and properties, including energy spectra and the variability of X-rays from the accretors. This X-ray perspective gives a unique insight into the evolution and connections of these systems with their environment. Future research in this area is necessary to fully understand the process underlying X-ray emission from relativistic accretors.</description>

      <title>Direct evidence for preburst stage of gamma-ray burst from GRB 221009A data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous research on Lorentz invariance violation in photons from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) suggested a scenario where multi-GeV photons could be emitted before lower-energy photons at the GRB source frame. This implies the existence of a new preburst phase in addition to the traditionally identified prompt and afterglow stages observed in earlier studies. In this study, we present direct evidence for this novel preburst phase in gamma-ray bursts based on recent observations of GRB 221009A. Our analysis leverages data from the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) and Large Area Telescope (LAT) detectors of the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (FGST), as well as data from the KM2A detector of the Large High Altitude Air-shower Observatory (LHAASO).</description>

      <title>The relation between black hole spin and molecular gas in massive galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular gas is the key probe for the complex interaction between the accretion of black holes and star formation of the host galaxy of active galactic nuclei (AGN). The molecular gas discovered around the AGN indicates that this gas is providing fuel for the AGN. According to the theoretical model of the relativistic jet, the spin of a black hole enhances the relativistic jet of AGN. The spin of the black hole is used as an indicator of AGN activity. Therefore, we study the relationship between the activity of AGN and molecular gas. We find a significant strong correlation between molecular gas fraction and CO luminosity and black hole spin for the early-type galaxies. However, there is no correlation between molecular gas fraction and CO luminosity and black hole spin for the late-type galaxies. These results indicate that the spin of black holes mainly regulates the accretion of molecular gas in massive early-type galaxies. The activity of AGN depends on the amount of gas.</description>

      <title>Probing the Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals Population Constraints with TianQin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), consisting of a massive black hole and a stellar compact object, are one of the most important sources for space-borne gravitational wave detectors like TianQin. Their population study can be used to constrain astrophysical models that interpret the EMRI formation mechanisms. In this paper, as a first step, we employ a parametrization method to describe the EMRI population model in the loss cone formation channel. This approach, however, can be extended to other models such as the accretion disc driven formation channel. We present the phenomenological characteristic of the MBH mass, spin, and redshift distributions. Then, we investigate the posterior distribution of the hyper-parameters that describe this population model. Our results show that TianQin could recover almost all the posterior of the hyper-parameters within $1\sigma$ confidence interval. With one hundred detectable EMRI events, the hyper-parameters $\alpha_1, \alpha_2, b$, which describe the MBH mass distribution, could be measured with an accuracy of $37\%$, $24\%$, and $3\%$, respectively. The hyper-parameters $\mu_z$, and $\sigma_z$, which describe the redshift distribution, have $\mu_z$ above the detectable range of TianQin, and $\sigma_z$ measured with an accuracy of $14.5\%$. With this estimation accuracy, the EMRI population characteristics can be effectively demonstrated, potentially serving as evidence for EMRI formation in the future studies. Furthermore, with an increasing number of detectable events, the parameter estimation for the hyper-parameters will improve and the confidence intervals will be narrowed.</description>

      <title>MeerKAT observations of pair-plasma induced birefringence in the double pulsar eclipses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PSR J0737$-$3039A/B is unique among double neutron star systems. Its near-perfect edge-on orbit causes the fast spinning pulsar A to be eclipsed by the magnetic field of the slow spinning pulsar B. Using high-sensitivity MeerKAT radio observations combined with updated constraints on the system geometry, we studied the impact of these eclipses on the incident polarization properties of pulsar A. Averaging light curves together after correcting for the rotation of pulsar B revealed enormous amounts of circular polarization and rapid changes in the linear polarization position angle, which occur at phases where emission from pulsar A is partially transmitted through the magnetosphere of pulsar B. These behaviours confirm that the eclipse mechanism is the result of synchrotron absorption in a relativistic pair-plasma confined to the closed-field region of pulsar B's truncated dipolar magnetic field. We demonstrate that changes in circular polarization handedness throughout the eclipses are directly tied to the average line of sight magnetic field direction of pulsar B, from which we unambiguously determine the complete magnetic and viewing geometry of the pulsar.</description>

      <title>Stripping of a neutron star in a close binary system in a pair with a black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the final evolutionary stages of a neutron star-black hole pair. According to the current paradigm, such systems eventually coalesce, which in some cases is accompanied by neutron-star tidal disruption. Using analytical methods, we show that the scenario of slow (of the order of several seconds) neutron-star stripping by the black hole is also possible, depending on the system parameters (the initial masses and intrinsic angular momenta of the components, the equation of state for the neutron star). Reaching the lower mass limit (about one tenth of the solar mass), the neutron star explodes to produce a comparatively powerful electromagnetic transient. Our population calculations show that the stripping mechanism is possible in 50-90% of the cases among all coalescing neutron star-black hole pairs, depending on the model assumptions about the evolution of close binary systems (the common-envelope efficiency parameter, the supernova explosion mechanism) and the initial metallicity of the stellar population. Because of the large mass of the ejected material, the kilonova emission in this scenario has good prospects of detection.</description>

      <title>Neutrino and pair creation in reconnection-powered coronae of accreting black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A ubiquitous feature of accreting black hole systems is their hard X-ray emission which is thought to be produced through Comptonization of soft photons by electrons and positrons in the vicinity of the black hole, in a region with optical depth of order unity. The origin and composition of this Comptonizing region, known as the corona, is a matter open for debate. In this paper we investigate the role of relativistic protons accelerated in black-hole magnetospheric current sheets for the pair enrichment and neutrino emission of AGN coronae. Our model has two free parameters, namely the proton plasma magnetization $\sigma_{\rm p}$, which controls the peak energy of the neutrino spectrum, and the Eddington ratio $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ (defined as the ratio between X-ray luminosity $L_{\rm X}$ and Eddington luminosity $L_{\rm Edd}$), which controls the amount of energy transferred to secondary particles. For sources with $\lambda_{\rm Edd} \gtrsim \lambda_{\rm Edd, crit}$ (where $\lambda_{\rm Edd, crit} \sim 10^{-1}$ for $\sigma_{\rm p}=10^5$ or $\sim 10^{-2}$ for $\sigma_{\rm p}=10^7$), proton-photon interactions and $ \gamma \gamma$ annihilation produce enough secondary pairs to achieve Thomson optical depths $\tau_{\rm T} \sim 0.1-10$. Additionally, we find that the neutrino luminosity scales as $L^2_{\rm X}/L_{\rm Edd}$ for $\lambda_{\rm Edd} \lesssim \lambda_{\rm Edd, crit}$, while it is proportional to $L_{\rm X}$ for higher $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ values. We apply our model to four Seyfert galaxies, including NGC 1068, and discuss our results in light of recent IceCube observations.</description>

Abstract: We present evidence for $\gamma$-ray emission from a stacked population of 39 high-latitude globular clusters (GCs) not detected in the Fermi Point Source Catalog, likely attributable to populations of millisecond pulsars within them. In this work, we use 13 years of data collected by the Large Area Telescope aboard the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope to search for a cumulative signal from undetected GCs and compared them to control fields (CFs), selected to match the celestial distribution of the target clusters so as to distinguish the $\gamma$-ray signal from background emission. The joint likelihood distribution of the GCs has a significant separation ($\sim4\sigma$) from that of the CFs. We also investigate correlations between detected cluster luminosities and other cluster properties such as distance, the number of millisecond pulsars associated with each cluster, and stellar encounter rate but find no significant relationships.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning Adapts to Changing PSD in Gravitational Wave Data</title>

Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves has opened unparalleled opportunities for observing the universe, particularly through the study of black hole inspirals. These events serve as unique laboratories to explore the laws of physics under conditions of extreme energies. However, significant noise in gravitational wave (GW) data from observatories such as Advanced LIGO and Virgo poses major challenges in signal identification. Traditional noise suppression methods often fall short in fully addressing the non-Gaussian effects in the data, including the fluctuations in noise power spectral density (PSD) over short time intervals. These challenges have led to the exploration of an AI approach that, while overcoming previous obstacles, introduced its own challenges, such as scalability, reliability issues, and the vanishing gradient problem. Our approach addresses these issues through a simplified architecture. To compensate for the potential limitations of a simpler model, we have developed a novel training methodology that enables it to accurately detect gravitational waves amidst highly complex noise. Employing this strategy, our model achieves over 99% accuracy in non-white noise scenarios and shows remarkable adaptability to changing noise PSD conditions. By leveraging the principles of transfer learning, our model quickly adapts to new noise profiles with just a few epochs of fine-tuning, facilitating real-time applications in dynamically changing noise environments.</description>

      <title>The $R$-process Alliance: Enrichment of $R$-process Elements in a Simulated Milky Way-like Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the formation of stars with varying amounts of heavy elements synthesized by the rapid neutron-capture process ($r$-process) based on our detailed cosmological zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy with an $N$-body/smoothed particle hydrodynamics code, ASURA. Most stars with no overabundance in $r$-process elements, as well as the strongly $r$-process enhanced $r$-II stars ([Eu/Fe] $&gt;+0.7$), are formed in dwarf galaxies accreted by the Milky Way within the 6 Gyr after the Big Bang. In contrast, over half of the moderately enhanced $r$-I stars ($+0.3 &lt;$ [Eu/Fe] $\leq +0.7$) are formed in the main in-situ disk after 6 Gyr. Our results suggest that the fraction of $r$-I and $r$-II stars formed in disrupted dwarf galaxies is larger the higher their [Eu/Fe] is. Accordingly, the most strongly enhanced $r$-III stars ([Eu/Fe] $&gt; +2.0$) are formed in accreted components. These results suggest that non-$r$-process-enhanced stars and $r$-II stars are mainly formed in low-mass dwarf galaxies that hosted either none or a single neutron star merger, while the $r$-I stars tend to form in the well-mixed in-situ disk. We compare our findings with high-resolution spectroscopic observations of $r$-process-enhanced metal-poor stars in the halo and dwarf galaxies, including those collected by the R-Process Alliance. We conclude that observed [Eu/Fe] and [Eu/Mg] ratios can be employed in chemical tagging of the Milky Way's accretion history.</description>

      <title>Superradiance of charged black holes embedded in dark matter halos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical environments are ubiquitous in the Universe; from accretion disks around black holes to galactic dark matter halos, distributions of astrophysical material veil the vast majority of Cosmos. Including environmental effects in strong-field gravity and astrophysics is, therefore, a rather tantalizing task in the quest for novel gravitational-wave phenomena. Here, we examine how environments affect the high-energy process of superradiance. In particular, we study the amplification of charged scalar waves under the expense of the electrostatic energy contained in a charged black hole that is embedded in an observationally-motivated, and qualitatively generic, dark matter halo. We find that the superradiant amplification of massless charged scalar fields scattering off environmentally-enriched charged black holes can be equally efficient to those occurring in vacuum charged black holes. This occurs due to the fact that the sole interplay between the scalar wave and the black hole is the electromagnetic interaction. The addition of mass on the charged scalar waves leads to a rapid suppression of superradiant amplification. This transpires to a great extent due to the `friction' that the mass introduces to the black hole potential. Nevertheless, for sufficiently large scalar masses, the amplification factors can be also subdominantly affected by the compactness of the halo. This occurs because the gravitational interaction between the dense halo and the wave's mass grows, thus further suppressing the superradiant amplification.</description>

      <title>Pair production with capture by energetic cosmic ray nuclei in a photon background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the ionization state of very energetic cosmic ray nuclei in photon fields, such as the cosmic microwave background (CMB) in extragalactic propagation and the environment surrounding the acceleration site in astrophysical sources. We focus on the process of pair production with electron capture (PPC), where the interaction of a single photon with a nucleus produces an $e^\pm$ pair (similar to Bethe-Heitler process) with the subsequent capture of electron by the nucleus. This process effectively reduces the nucleus charge by one unit and counteracts the photo-ionization process. We show that during cosmological propagation, where the ultra-high energy cosmic rays interact predominantly with the CMB, ionization dominates over PPC for all the cases of practical interest. However, within the source environment and at sufficiently high energies, ionization and PPC processes can reach an equilibrium, leading to a significant fraction of dressed heavy nuclei. This provides a further limitation to the acceleration of high-$Z$ nuclei to very high energies in environments with hot and dense photon fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Wide Field Monitor (WFM) is one of the three instruments on the Spectroscopic Time-Resolving Observatory for Broadband Energy X-rays (STROBE-X) mission, which was proposed in response to the NASA 2023 call for a probe class mission. The WFM is a coded-mask camera system that would be the most scientifically capable wide-angle monitor ever flown. The field of view covers one third of the sky, to 50 percent mask coding, and the energy sensitivity is 2 to 50 keV. The WFM is designed to identify new X-ray transients and to capture spectral and timing changes in known sources with data of unprecedented quality. Science applications cover diverse classes, in including X-ray bursts that coincide with gravitational wave detections, gamma ray bursts and their transition from prompt emission to afterglow, subluminous GRBs that may signal shock breakout in supernovae, state transitions in accreting compact objects and their jets, bright flares in fast X-ray transients, accretion onset in transitional pulsars, and coronal flares from many types of active stars.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a 25 parsec-long precessing jet emanating from the old nova GK Persei</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical nova eruptions result from thermonuclear-powered runaways in, and ejection of, the hydrogen-rich envelopes of white dwarf stars accreted from their close binary companions. Novae brighten to up to 1,000,000 solar luminosities, and recur thousands of times over their lifetimes spanning several billion years. Between eruptions, mass transfer from the donor star to the white dwarf proceeds via an accretion disk unless the white dwarf possesses a strong magnetic field which can partially or totally disrupt the disk. In that case, accretion is focussed by the white dwarf's magnetic field towards its magnetic poles. Optical spectroscopy and interferometric radio maps demonstrate the presence of bipolar jets, typically arcsec in angular size, and orders of magnitude smaller than one parsec in linear size, during the days to months after nova eruptions. These jets expel collimated matter from the white dwarfs in nova binary stars, but well-resolved images of them are lacking. Here we report the Condor telescope's detection of a hitherto unknown, highly resolved and braided jet, three degrees (at least 25 parsecs) in length. The jet originates at the white dwarf of the old nova GK Persei (nova Per 1901 CE). It precesses on a ~ 3600 yr timescale, and must be at least 7200 years old. Detected across four decades of wavelength, the jet's ultimate energy source is likely the strong accretion shocks near the white dwarf's magnetic poles.</description>

      <title>Nearby Supernova and Cloud Crossing Effects on the Orbits of Small Bodies in the Solar System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supernova blasts envelop many surrounding stellar systems, transferring kinetic energy to small bodies in the systems. Geologic evidence from $^{60}\rm Fe$ points to recent nearby supernova activity within the past several Myr. Here, we model the transfer of energy and resulting orbital changes from these supernova blasts to the Oort Cloud, the Kuiper belt, and Saturn's Phoebe ring. For the Oort Cloud, an impulse approximation shows that a 50 pc supernova can eject approximately half of all objects less than 1 cm while altering the trajectories of larger ones, depending on their orbital parameters. For stars closest to supernovae, objects up to $\sim$100 m can be ejected. Turning to the explored solar system, we find that supernovae closer than 50 pc may affect Saturn's Phoebe ring and can sweep away Kuiper belt dust. It is also possible that the passage of the solar system through a dense interstellar cloud could have a similar effect; a numerical trajectory simulation shows that the location of the dust grains and the direction of the wind (from a supernova or interstellar cloud) has a significant impact on whether or not the grains will become unbound from their orbit in the Kuiper belt. Overall, nearby supernovae sweep micron-sized dust from the solar system, though whether the grains are ultimately cast towards the Sun or altogether ejected depends on various factors. Evidence of supernova-modified dust grain trajectories may be observed by New Horizons, though further modeling efforts are required.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The properties, impact, and fate of hot stars cannot be understood without considering their winds. Revealed to be an almost ubiquitous phenomenon in the regime of massive stars, the winds of hot stars arise from a complex physical mechanism that still provides a major challenge for our understanding of massive stars. Different flavours of hot stars vary significantly in their winds with current evolution models still having problems to connect the zoo of observed phenomena. Moreover, the driving of hot star winds is inherently connected to the opacities arising from spectral line transitions, making the properties and strength of the winds strongly dependent on metallicity and changing them over cosmic time.
  In these proceedings, the current status in our understanding of hot star winds is briefly reviewed and recent progress in our perception of hot star winds and the consequences for the evolution of massive stars are presented. A particular emphasis is given on current efforts with hydrodynamically-consistent atmosphere models towards a better description of radiatively-driven mass loss of Wolf-Rayet stars with remaining hydrogen envelopes.</description>

      <title>Partial tidal disruption of White Dwarfs in off-equatorial planes around intermediate mass spinning black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the results of a suite of numerical simulations to study partial tidal disruption events (TDEs) of white dwarfs (WDs) in off-equatorial planes in intermediate mass spinning (Kerr) black hole backgrounds. We carry out this analysis for both parabolic and eccentric WD orbits and also take into account possible initial WD spins. Our objective here is to quantify the differences in variables like the mass of the self-bound core, the peak fallback rate of debris and gravitational wave signature in off-equatorial orbits compared to equatorial ones. The analysis is carried out using a hybrid numerical scheme, one which involves integrating the exact Kerr geodesics while adopting a Newtonian formalism for the stellar fluid dynamics, justified by our choice of simulation parameters. We find that the physics of TDEs in off-equatorial orbits present several interesting and novel features due to black hole spin, which in some cases enhances when coupled with the rotation of the WD. However, numerical values of observable quantities in TDEs involving off-equatorial orbits cannot possibly distinguish between such orbits from equatorial ones. We further comment on the genericness of our results and argue that these should extend to a general TDE scenario involving a spinning BH.</description>

      <title>HYPERION. Shedding light on the first luminous quasars: A correlation between UV disc winds and X-ray continuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the main open questions in the field of luminous ($L_{\rm bol}&gt;10^{47}\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}$) quasars (QSOs) at $z \gtrsim 6$ is the rapid formation ($&lt; 1\,$Gyr) of their supermassive black holes (SMBHs). For this work we analysed the relation between the X-ray properties and other properties describing the physics and growth of both the accretion disc and the SMBH in QSOs at the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). The sample consists of 21 $z&gt;6$ QSOs, which includes 16 sources from the rapidly grown QSOs from the HYPERION sample and five other luminous QSOs with available high-quality archival X-ray data. We discovered a strong and statistically significant ($&gt;3\sigma$) relation between the X-ray continuum photon index ($\Gamma$) and the $\rm C\,IV$ disc wind velocity ($v_{\rm C\,IV}$) in $z&gt;6$ luminous QSOs, whereby the higher the $v_{\rm C\,IV}$, the steeper the $\Gamma$. This relation suggests a link between the disc-corona configuration and the kinematics of disc winds. Furthermore, we find evidence at $&gt;2-3\sigma$ level that $\Gamma$ and $v_{\rm C\,IV}$ are correlated to the growth rate history of the SMBH. Although additional data are needed to confirm it, this result may suggest that, in luminous $z&gt;6$ QSOs, the SMBH predominantly grows via fast accretion rather than via initial high seed BH mass.</description>

      <title>Time-lag in hadronic channel: to explore delayed VHE-flare of 3C 279</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On 28 January 2018, the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) reported a significant very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray activity, occurring nearly 11 days after the high-energy (HE) gamma-ray flare observed by \textit{Fermi}-LAT from the blazar 3C 279. It has long been considered a candidate site for accelerating particles to ultra-high energies (UHE) and producing subsequent secondaries. Such an event can be crucial to explore the different phenomena of secondary production from the UHEs and viable to understand the energetics of the sources. Our study finds that the multi-wavelength flare, spanning UV, optical, X-rays, and HE gamma rays, originates from leptonic emissions, whereas the delayed VHE activity by proton synchrotron emission within the source, results from the extended duration of particle acceleration. To explain the prolonged electromagnetic emission, our model requires a magnetic field luminosity (L$'_B$) $6.1 \times 10^{43}$ erg/sec, a proton luminosity (L$'_{p}$) $1.2\times 10^{46}$ erg/sec in the jet frame.</description>

      <title>Upper Limit of Sound Speed in Nuclear Matter: A Harmonious Interplay of Transport Calculation and Perturbative Quantum Chromodynamic Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09563v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Very recently, it has been shown that there is an upper bound on the squared sound speed of nuclear matter from the transport, which reads $c_{\rm s}^2 \leq 0.781$. In this work, we demonstrate that this upper bound is corroborated by the reconstructed equation of state (EOS; modeled with a nonparametric method) for ultradense matter. The reconstruction integrates multimessenger observation for neutron stars, in particular, the latest radius measurements for PSR J0437-4715 ($11.36^{+0.95}_{-0.63}$ km), PSR J0030+0451 ($11.71^{+0.88}_{-0.83}$ km, in the ST+PDT model), and PSR J0740+6620 ($12.49^{+1.28}_{-0.88}$ km) by NICER have been adopted. The result shows in all cases, the $c_{\rm s}^2 \leq 0.781$ upper limit for EOS will naturally yield the properties of matter near the center of the massive neutron star consistent with the causality-driven constraint from pQCD, where, in practice, the density in implementing the pQCD likelihood ($n_{\rm L}$) is applied at $10n_s$ (where $n_s$ is the nuclear saturation density). We also note that there is a strong correlation for the maximum $c_s^2$ with $n_{\rm L}$, and $c_{\rm s}^2 \leq 0.781$ is somehow violated when $n_{\rm L} = n_{\rm c,TOV}$. The result indicates that a higher $n_{\rm L}$, even considering the uncertainties from statistics, is more natural. Moreover, the remarkable agreement between the outcomes derived from these two distinct and independent constraints (i.e., the transport calculation and pQCD boundary) lends strong support to their validity. In addition, the latest joint constraint for $R_{1.4}$, $R_{2.0}$, $R_{1.4}-R_{2.0}$, and $M_{\rm TOV}$ are $11.94_{-0.68}^{+0.77}$ km, $11.99_{-0.67}^{+0.88}$ km, $-0.1_{-0.27}^{+0.42}$ km, and $2.24_{-0.10}^{+0.13}M_\odot$ (at $90\%$ credible level), respectively.</description>

      <title>Whispering in the dark: Faint X-ray emission from black holes with OB star companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08596v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Recent astrometric and spectroscopic surveys of OB stars have revealed a few stellar-mass black holes (BHs) with orbital periods as low as 10 days. No X-ray counterpart has been detected, due to the absence of a radiatively efficient accretion disk around the BH. Yet, dissipative processes in the hot, dilute and strongly magnetized plasma around the BH (so-called BH corona) can still lead to non-thermal X-ray emission (e.g. synchrotron).
  Aims. We determine the X-ray luminosity distribution from BH+OB star binaries up to orbital periods of a few thousand days.
  Methods. We use detailed binary evolution models computed with MESA for initial primary masses of 10-90 $M_{\odot}$ and orbital periods from 1-3000 d. The X-ray luminosity is computed for a broad range of radiative efficiencies.
  Results. We show that particle acceleration through magnetic reconnection can heat the BH corona. A substantial fraction of the gravitational potential energy from the accreted plasma is converted into non-thermal X-ray emission. Our population synthesis analysis predicts at least 28 (up to 72) BH+OB star binaries in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) to produce X-ray luminosity above 10$^{31}$ erg$\,$s$^{-1}$, observable through focused Chandra observations. We identify a population of SB1 systems in the LMC and HD96670 in the Milky Way comprising O stars with unseen companions of masses above 2.3 $M_{\odot}$ that aligns well with our predictions. The predicted luminosities of the OB companions to these X-ray-emitting BHs are 10$^{4.5-5.5}$ $L_{\odot}$.
  Conclusions. These results make the case for long-time exposure in X-rays of the stellar-mass BH candidates identified around OB stars. It will constrain the underlying population of X-ray-faint BHs, the evolution from single to double degenerate binaries, and the progenitors of gravitational wave mergers. (Abridged)</description>

Abstract: The Schwarzschild radii of primordial black holes (PBHs) in the mass range of 6x10^{14}g to 4x10^{19}g match the sizes of nuclei to atoms. I discuss the resulting quantum-mechanical suppression in the accretion of matter by PBHs in dense astrophysical environments, such as planets or stars.</description>

      <title>From coasting to energy-conserving: new self-similar solutions to the interaction phase of strong explosions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Astrophysical explosions that contain dense and ram-pressure-dominated ejecta evolve through an interaction phase, during which a forward shock (FS), contact discontinuity (CD), and reverse shock (RS) form and expand with time. We describe new self-similar solutions that apply to this phase and are most accurate in the limit that the ejecta density is large compared to the ambient density. These solutions predict that the FS, CD, and RS expand at different rates in time and not as single temporal power-laws, are valid for explosions driven by steady winds and homologously expanding ejecta, and exist when the ambient density profile is a power-law with power-law index shallower than $\sim 3$ (specifically when the FS does not accelerate). We find excellent agreement between the predictions of these solutions and hydrodynamical simulations, both for the temporal behavior of the discontinuities and for the variation of the fluid quantities. The self-similar solutions are applicable to a wide range of astrophysical phenomena and -- although the details are described in future work -- can be generalized to incorporate relativistic speeds with arbitrary Lorentz factors. We suggest that these solutions accurately interpolate between the initial ``coasting'' phase of the explosion and the later, energy-conserving phase (or, if the ejecta is homologous and the density profile is sufficiently steep, the self-similar phase described in Chevalier 1982),</description>

      <title>Testing general relativity via direct measurement of black hole kicks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Asymmetric emission of gravitational waves during a compact binary coalescence results in the loss of linear momentum and a corresponding "kick" or recoil on the binary's center of mass. This leads to a direction-dependent Doppler shift of the ringdown gravitational waveform. We quantify the measurability of the kick imparted to the remnant black hole in a binary black hole merger. Future ground- and space-based gravitational-wave detectors will measure this effect to within $\sim 2\%$ to $\sim 30\%$ for a subset of their expected observed sources. Certain binary configurations in the LISA band may allow a sub-percent-level measurement of this effect. This direct measurement of black hole kicks can also facilitate a novel test of general relativity based on linear momentum balance. We formulate this kick consistency test via measurement of a null variable that quantifies the difference between the inferred kick (using numerical relativity) and that observed via the Doppler-shifted ringdown signal. This null variable can be constrained (at 90\% confidence) to $\sim 10\%$ to $30\%$ with Cosmic Explorer and to $\sim 3\%$ to $12\%$ with LISA.</description>

      <title>Unraveling alignment pattern in high-energy particles via transverse momentum disbalance analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06114v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hypothesis of the relation between the strong azimuthal correlations, known as the alignment, in the families of hadrons and photons observed in cosmic ray experiments and the selection procedure of the highest-energy particles together with the transverse momentum conservation are tested in the framework of the HYDJET++ model. Results show that the high degree of alignment can appear in nucleus-nucleus interactions at the reasonable values of transverse momentum disbalance of most energetic detected particles.</description>

      <title>LOFAR high-band antenna observations of the Perseus cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Perseus cluster is the brightest X-ray cluster in the sky and is known as a cool-core galaxy cluster. Being a very nearby cluster, it has been extensively studied. This has provided a comprehensive view of the physical processes that operate in the intracluster medium (ICM), including feedback from the AGN 3C84 and measurements of ICM turbulence. Additionally, the Perseus cluster contains a central radio mini-halo. This diffuse radio source traces cosmic ray electrons (re-)accelerated in-situ in the ICM.
  Here we report on LOFAR high-band antenna 120-168 MHz observations of the Perseus cluster that probe a range of four orders of magnitude in angular scales. In our 0.3 arcsec resolution image, we find that the northern extension of the 3C84 lobe consists of several narrow 1.5-3 kpc parallel strands of emission. In addition, we detect steep-spectrum filaments associated with a previous outburst of the central AGN radio emission filling two known X-ray ghost cavities. At 7 arcsec resolution, our images show a complex structured radio mini-halo, with several edges and filaments. At resolutions of 26 arcsec and 80 arcsec, we discover diffuse radio emission with a 1.1 Mpc extent. We classify this emission as a giant radio halo and its properties are distinct from the inner mini-halo. We also detect two diffuse sources at projected cluster centric radii of 0.7 and 1.0 Mpc. Finally, we observe a 0.9 Mpc long trail of radio emission from the cluster member galaxy IC310, connecting it with the giant radio halo. Together with other recent studies of relaxed clusters, our LOFAR observations indicate that cluster-wide radio emission could be (more) common in cool-core clusters. In the case of the Perseus cluster, a past off-axis merger event that preserved the cool core might have generated enough turbulence to produce an extended radio halo observable at low frequencies.</description>
