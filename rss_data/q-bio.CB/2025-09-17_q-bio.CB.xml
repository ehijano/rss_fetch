      <title>The Inhibition of B16-F10 Mouse Melanoma Cell Proliferation in Increased Concentration Levels of Theophylline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cancer is a complex sequence of disease conditions progressing gradually with generalized loss of growth control. It continues to be one of the biggest global health problems, and its etiology has given rise to a huge array of treatment outside of conventional chemotherapy. Melanoma is one of the deadliest forms of skin cancer originating from melanocytes. It is characterized by the overproduction of melanin by the increased in cell proliferation. Melanogenesis, the production of melanin is by melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) which stimulates cyclic AMP (cAMP) production to increase melanocyte production. Through the use of methylxanthines, theophylline proliferation rate can be decreased by increasing cell differentiation. One of the basic principles of cell biology is the selectivity of differentiation and proliferation, where cells usually grow or differentiate but not both. This study aimed to collect baseline data of untreated B16-F10 melanoma cells to determine morphology and doubling time of untreated cells. This data was further compared to results from varied concentration treatments of theophylline. It was hypothesized that increased levels in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) could induce differentiation of melanocytes to terminate proliferation. To test this hypothesis, we collected a series of images of B16- F10 derived from mouse melanoma cells and seeded cells into a 12-well plate to calculate cell concentration for a five-day period and doubling time for untreated cells. Theophylline levels were varied to stimulate the production of cAMP and determine its effect on melanocyte proliferation and differentiation. The observed results showed that intracellular stabilization of cAMP, via phosphodiesterase inhibition by methylxanthines like theophylline, increases cell differentiation on melanoma cells and suppresses their growth.</description>

      <title>Bioluminescence in turbulence: intermittent straining lights up dinoflagellates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dinoflagellates are marine phytoplankton that emit flashes of light in response to flow-induced deformation; they are responsible for illuminating breaking-waves, wakes of ships, and other intensely turbulent spots of the upper ocean. Here, we ask how bioluminescence is affected by the fluctuating nature of turbulence -- a question motivated by the dependence of emitted flashes on both the extent and rate of deformation. Introducing a light-emitting dumbbell as a minimal model, we study the Lagrangian dynamics of flashing in a homogeneous isotropic turbulent flow, and contrast it with that in an extensional flow and a Gaussian random flow. We show that turbulent fluctuations strongly enhance bioluminescence, while introducing a Poisson-like stochasticity in the flashing dynamics. Furthermore, the intermittent fluctuations of the velocity-gradient subjects the dinoflagellate to bursts of extreme straining and produces bright flashes -- more intense, though less frequent, than what would result from Gaussian fluctuations. Our results suggest that radiant displays of marine bioluminescence are strongly promoted by turbulence and its dissipation-scale intermittency.</description>

      <title>Controlling tissue size by active fracture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Groups of cells, including clusters of cancerous cells, multicellular organisms, and developing organs, may both grow and break apart. What physical factors control these fractures? In these processes, what sets the eventual size of clusters? We first develop a one-dimensional framework for understanding cell clusters that can fragment due to cell motility using an active particle model. We compute analytically how the break rate of cell-cell junctions depends on cell speed, cell persistence, and cell-cell junction properties. Next, we find the cluster size distributions, which differ depending on whether all cells can divide or only the cells on the edge of the cluster divide. Cluster size distributions depend solely on the ratio of the break rate to the growth rate - allowing us to predict how cluster size and variability depend on cell motility and cell-cell mechanics. Our results suggest that organisms can achieve better size control when cell division is restricted to the cluster boundaries or when fracture can be localized to the cluster center. Additionally, we derive a universal survival probability for an intact cluster $S(t)=\mathrm{e}^{-k_d t}$ at steady state if all cells can divide, which is independent of the rupture kinetics and depends solely on the cell division rate $k_d$. Finally, we further corroborate the one-dimensional analytics with two-dimensional simulations, finding quantitative agreement with some elements of the theory across a wide range of cell motility. Our results link the general physics problem of a collective active escape over a barrier to size control, providing a quantitative measure of how motility can regulate organ or organism size.</description>
