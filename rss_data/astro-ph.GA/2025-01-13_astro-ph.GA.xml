      <title>JWST NIRCam simulations and observations of AGN ionization cones in cosmic noon galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extended narrow line region (NLR) of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) provides a valuable laboratory for exploring the relationship between AGN and their host galaxies, often appearing as an ''ionization cone'' that can extend out to the very edge of the galaxy. We use new James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRCam imaging to study the morphologies and sizes of NLRs traced by [O III] at cosmic noon ($z\sim2-3$), measurements which were previously only well-studied at $z\sim0$ with IFU spectroscopy. To determine NIRCam's ability to probe the properties of the NLR in cosmic noon galaxies, we present simulated images of AGN at $z=2-3$ created with archival data cubes from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) of nine nearby ($z&lt;0.05$) AGN host galaxies with previously confirmed extended NLRs. Our simulated images show that NIRCam is able to resolve the morphologies of NLRs at $z=2-3$ with narrow- and medium-band observations. We then search for extended NLRs with NIRCam medium-band observations targeting the [O III] emission in twenty-seven previously identified AGN at $z=2.4-3.4$ in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey South (GOODS-S) field. We detect six galaxies in our observed sample with [O III] morphologies consistent with AGN ionization cones with characteristic NLR sizes of $1-2.5$ kpc. Thanks to our simulated data, we can predict the effects of cosmological surface brightness dimming and instrument noise on the NLR size measurements at high redshift, which has the biasing effect of lowering the NLR size-AGN Luminosity trend that is observed at low redshift by a factor of $\sim 2$.</description>

      <title>Census of Ly$\alpha$ Emission from $\sim 600$ Galaxies at $z=5-14$: Evolution of the Ly$\alpha$ Luminosity Function and a Late Sharp Cosmic Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the statistical properties of Ly$\alpha$ emission in 586 galaxies at $z=4.5-14.2$, observed by multiple JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy projects, including JADES, GLASS, CEERS, and GO/DDT programs. We obtain Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width (EW), Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction, and ionizing photon production efficiency measurements or upper limits for these galaxies, and confirm that the Ly$\alpha$ emitting galaxy fraction decreases towards higher redshifts. We derive Ly$\alpha$ luminosity functions from $z\sim 5$ to $z\sim 10-14$ with the observed Ly$\alpha$ EW distributions and galaxy UV luminosity functions, and find a $\sim3$ dex decrease in number density at $L_\mathrm{Ly\alpha}=10^{42}-10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ over the redshift range. We obtain the neutral hydrogen fractions of $x_\mathrm{HI}=0.17_{-0.16}^{+0.23}$, $0.63_{-0.28}^{+0.18}$, $0.79_{-0.21}^{+0.13}$, and $0.88_{-0.13}^{+0.11}$ at $z\sim6$, $7$, $8-9$, and $10-14$, respectively, via comparisons of the reionization models developed by semi-numerical simulations with 21cmFAST explaining the observations of Ly$\alpha$, UV continuum, and Planck electron optical depth. The high $x_\mathrm{HI}$ values over $z\sim 7-14$ suggest a late and sharp reionization, with the primary reionization process occurring at $z\sim 6-7$. Such a late and sharp reionization is not easily explained by either a clumpy inter-galactic medium or sources of reionization in a classical faint-galaxy or a bright-galaxy/AGN scenario, unless a very high escape fraction or AGN duty cycle is assumed at $z\sim 6-7$.</description>

      <title>Estimating variability power spectra of active galaxies from irregular time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common feature of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is their random variations in brightness across the whole emission spectrum, from radio to $\gamma$-rays. Studying the nature and origin of these fluctuations is critical to characterising the underlying variability process of the accretion flow that powers AGN. Random timing fluctuations are often studied with the power spectrum; this quantifies how the amplitude of variations is distributed over temporal frequencies. Red noise variability -- when the power spectrum increases smoothly towards low frequencies -- is ubiquitous in AGN. The commonly used Fourier analysis methods, have significant challenges when applied to arbitrarily sampled light curves of red noise variability. Several time-domain methods exist to infer the power spectral shape in the case of irregular sampling but they suffer from biases which can be difficult to mitigate, or are computationally expensive. In this paper, we demonstrate a method infer the shape of broad-band power spectra for irregular time series, using a Gaussian process regression method scalable to large datasets. The power spectrum is modelled as a power-law model with one or two bends with flexible slopes. The method is fully Bayesian and we demonstrate its utility using simulated light curves. Finally, Ark 564, a well-known variable Seyfert 1 galaxy, is used as a test case and we find consistent results with the literature using independent X-ray data from XMM-Newton and Swift. We provide publicly available, documented and tested implementations in Python and Julia.</description>

      <title>Potential-density pairs for galaxy discs with exponential or sech$^2$ vertical profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present axially symmetric analytical potential-density pairs with surface density similar to the Miyamoto-Nagai model, but with more realistic vertical structure. Our models closely approximate an exponential, a sech$^2$, or a cored exponential vertical density profile. The latter profile has a density core of adjustable width, which provides more flexibility when modelling galaxy discs.</description>

      <title>Comparing radial migration in dark matter and MOND regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple studies on radial migration in disc galaxies have proven the importance of the effect of resonances with non-axisymmetric components on the evolution of galactic discs. However, the dynamical effects of classic Newtonian dynamics with dark matter (DM) differ from MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) and might trigger different radial migration. A thorough analysis of radial migration considering these two gravitational regimes might shed some light on different predictions of DM and MOND theories. We aim to quantitatively and qualitatively compare the effects of resonances and stellar radial migration (churning) in a Milky Way-like (MW-like) galaxy in the DM and MOND regimes. We performed simulations of a MW-like galaxy to analyse the effect of non-axisymmetric structures (galactic bar and spiral arms) considering various parameters of the spiral structure. We conducted a two-dimensional numerical simulation consisting of the integration of $2 \cdot 10^6$ stars in a static rotating galactic potential for $6~\mbox{Gyr}$. We analysed the change in the star's position, the guiding radius, as well as the frequency phase space. We investigated DM and MOND approaches. The outcome of the simulation shows that the radial migration is much more pronounced in the MOND regime compared to the DM one. Compared to the DM approach, in the MOND regime, we observe up to five times as many stars with a maximum change in the guiding radius of more than $1.5~\mbox{kpc}$ during the time interval from $2-6~\mbox{Gyr}$.Analysis of the frequency phase space reveals that the most prominent resonances in all DM and MOND configurations are the co-rotation resonance with the spiral arms ($m=p=1$), outer Lindblad resonance with the galactic bar and spiral arms, and the co-rotation resonance ($m=2$, $p=1$) with the superposition of the galactic bar and spiral arms, $2 \Omega = \Omega_b + \Omega_{sp}$.</description>

      <title>The CIELO Project: The Chemo-dynamical properties of gaLaxies and the cosmic web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CIELO project introduces a novel set of chemo-dynamical zoom-in simulations designed to simultaneously resolve galaxies and their nearby environments. The initial conditions include a diverse range of cosmic structures, such as local groups, filaments, voids, and walls, allowing for a detailed exploration of galaxies within the broader context of the cosmic web. This study presents the initial conditions and characterizes the global properties of CIELO galaxies and their environments. It focuses on galaxies with stellar masses ranging from log [8,11] solar masses and examines key scaling relations, including the mass-size relation, the Tully-Fisher relation, and the mass-metallicity relation for both stars and star-forming gas. The DisPerSe algorithm was used to determine the positions of CIELO galaxies within the cosmic web, with a specific focus on the Pehuen haloes. The selection of local group volumes was guided by criteria based on the relative positions and velocities of the two primary galaxies. The Pehuen regions were chosen to map walls, filaments, and voids. Synthetic images in the SDSS i, r, and g bands were generated using the SKIRT radiative transfer code. Additionally, a dynamical decomposition was performed to classify galaxy morphologies into bulge, disc, and stellar halo components (abridged).</description>

      <title>ZF-UDS-7329: a Relic Galaxy in the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation time-scales of quiescent galaxies can be estimated in two different ways, by their star formation history and by their chemistry. Previously, both methods yielded conflicting results, especially when considering $\alpha$-enhanced objects. This is primarily due to the time resolution limitations of very old stellar populations that prevent us from accurately constraining their star formation histories. We analyse the JWST observations of the extremely massive galaxy ZF-UDS-7329 at z$\sim$3.2 and show that we can achieve the higher time resolution necessary to match the chemical formation time-scales using stellar population synthesis by studying galaxies at high redshift. We compare it to the well known relic galaxy NGC 1277, arguing that ZF-UDS-7329 is an early Universe example of the cores of present day massive elliptical galaxies or, if left untouched, a relic galaxy.</description>

      <title>The ultraviolet luminosity function of star-forming galaxies between redshifts of 0.4 and 0.6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine ultraviolet imaging of the 13H survey field, taken with the XMM-Newton Optical Monitor telescope (XMM-OM) and the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Ultraviolet and Optical Telescope (UVOT) in the UVM2 band, to measure rest-frame ultraviolet 1500A luminosity functions of star-forming galaxies with redshifts between 0.4 and 0.6. In total the UVM2 imaging covers a sky area of 641 square arcmin, and we detect 273 galaxies in the UVM2 image with 0.4&lt;z&lt;0.6. The luminosity function is fit by a Schechter function with best-fit values for the faint end slope alpha = -1.8 +0.4 -0.3 and characteristic absolute magnitude M* = -19.1 +0.3 -0.4. In common with XMM-OM based studies at higher redshifts, our best-fitting value for M* is fainter than previous measurements. We argue that the purging of active galactic nuclei from the sample, facilitated by the co-spatial X-ray survey carried out with XMM-Newton is important for the determination of M*. At the brightest absolute magnitudes (M1500&lt;-18.5) the average UV colour of our galaxies is consistent with that of minimal-extinction local analogues, but the average UV colour is redder for galaxies at fainter absolute magnitudes, suggesting that higher levels of dust attenuation enter the sample at absolute magnitudes somewhat fainter than M*.</description>

      <title>Variation of the low-mass end of the stellar initial mass function with redshift and metallicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the stellar mass functions obtained from 20 radiation hydrodynamical simulations of star cluster formation in 500 M$_\odot$ molecular clouds with metallicities of 3, 1, 1/10 and 1/100 of the solar value, with the clouds subjected to levels of the cosmic microwave background radiation that are appropriate for star formation at redshifts z=0, 3, 5, 7, and 10. The calculations include a thermochemical model of the diffuse interstellar medium and treat dust and gas temperatures separately. We find that the stellar mass distributions obtained become increasingly bottom light as the redshift and/or metallicity are increased. Mass functions that are similar to a typical Galactic initial mass function are obtained for present-day star formation (z=0) independent of metallicity, and also for the lowest-metallicity (1/100 solar) at all redshifts up to z=10, but for higher metallicities there is a larger deficit of brown dwarfs and low-mass stars as the metallicity and redshift are increased. These effects are a result of metal-rich gas being unable to cool to as lower temperatures at higher redshift due to the warmer cosmic microwave background radiation. Based on the numerical results we provide a parameterisation that may be used to vary the stellar initial mass function with redshift and metallicity; this could be used in simulations of galaxy formation. For example, a bottom-light mass function reduces the mass-to-light ratio compared to a typical Galactic stellar initial mass function, which may reduce the estimated masses of high-redshift galaxies.</description>

      <title>The GALAH survey: Improving chemical abundances using star clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large spectroscopic surveys aim to consistently compute stellar parameters of very diverse stars while minimizing systematic errors. We explore the use of stellar clusters as benchmarks to verify the precision of spectroscopic parameters in the fourth data release (DR4) of the GALAH survey. We examine 58 open and globular clusters and associations to validate measurements of temperature, gravity, chemical abundances, and stellar ages. We focus on identifying systematic errors and understanding trends between stellar parameters, particularly temperature and chemical abundances. We identify trends by stacking measurements of chemical abundances against effective temperature and modelling them with splines. We also refitted spectra in three clusters with the Spectroscopy Made Easy and Korg packages to reproduce the trends in DR4 and to search for their origin by varying temperature and gravity priors, linelists, and spectral continuum. Trends are consistent between clusters of different ages and metallicities, can reach amplitudes of ~0.5 dex and differ for dwarfs and giants. We use the derived trends to correct the DR4 abundances of 24 and 31 chemical elements for dwarfs and giants, respectively, and publish a detrended catalogue. While we couldn't pinpoint the trends' origins, we found that: i) photometric priors affect derived abundances, ii) temperature, metallicity, and continuum levels are degenerate in spectral fitting, and it is hard to break the degeneracy even by using independent measurements, iii) the extent of the linelist used in spectral synthesis is essential for cool stars, and iv) different spectral fitting codes produce significantly different iron abundances for stars of all temperatures. We conclude that clusters can be used to characterise the systematic errors of parameters produced in large surveys, but further research is needed to explain the origin of the trends.</description>

      <title>Using a minimally parametrised SHAM to constrain the link between dark matter and galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models of the galaxy-halo connection are needed to understand both galaxy clusters and large scale structure. To make said models, we need a robust method that assigns galaxies to halos and matches the observed and simulated stellar-halo mass relation. We employ an empirical Subhalo Abundance Matching (SHAM) model implemented in the halos module of SkyPy which assigns blue and red galaxies based on the Peng et al. (2010) (arXiv:1003.4747v2) model containing three parameters: $M_\mu$ (halo mass where half the galaxies assigned should be quenched), $\sigma$ (transition width from star forming to quenched) and $b$ (baseline quenched fraction at low mass). We test two sets of galaxy stellar mass functions for four populations of galaxies (central/satellite, blue/red) and run parameter estimation using Approximate Bayesian Computation over each model when compared to a set of applicable literature models. For the Weigel et al. (2016) (arXiv:1604.00008v1) galaxies we find best fit values of log $M_\mu = 11.94^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$, $\sigma = 0.49^{+0.04}_{-0.04}$ and $b = 0.31^{+0.01}_{-0.01}$. For the Birrer et al. (2014) (arXiv:1401.3162v2) galaxies we find best fit values of log $M_\mu = 11.93^{+0.01}_{-0.01}$, $\sigma = 0.53^{+0.04}_{-0.04}$ and $b = 0.51^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$. Overall, we demonstrate that these constraints produce a model that is consistent with literature models for the central galaxies. Future research will focus on the normalisation of the satellite galaxies in order to better constrain the $b$ parameter.</description>

      <title>Many body gravity and the bullet cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many body gravity (MBG) is an alternate theory of gravity, which has been able to explain the galaxy rotation curves, the radial acceleration relation (RAR) and the wide binary stars (WBS). The genesis of MBG is a novel theory, which models systems with thermal gradients, by recasting the variation in the temperature as a variation in the metric. Merging the above concept with Einstein's gravity, leads to the theory of thermal gravity in 5-D space-time-temperature. Thermal gravity when generalized for partially thermalized systems, results in the theory of many body gravity. The bullet cluster is supposed to be a smoking gun evidence for the presence of dark matter. However, this work demonstrates that the MBG theory can explain the weak gravitational lensing effect of the bullet cluster, without the need for yet undiscovered baryonic matter or dark matter.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a likely Type II SN at $z$=3.6 with JWST</title>

Abstract: Transient astronomy in the early, high-redshift (z&gt;3) Universe is an unexplored regime that offers the possibility of probing the first stars and the Epoch of Reionization. During Cycles 1 and 2 of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) program enabled one of the first searches for transients in deep images (~ $30$ AB mag) over a relatively wide area ($25$ arcmin$^2$). One transient, AT 2023adsv, was discovered with an F200W magnitude of $28.04$ AB mag, and subsequent JWST observations revealed that the transient is a likely supernova (SN) in a host with $z_{\rm spec}=3.613\pm0.001$, a host mass of log(M$_{*}$/M$_\odot$) = $8.41^{+0.12}_{-0.12}$, and an inferred metallicity at the position of the SN of Z$_{*}$ = $0.3\pm0.1$ Z$_\odot$. At this redshift, the first detections in F115W and F150W show that AT 2023adsv had bright rest-frame ultraviolet flux at the time of discovery. The multi-band light curve of AT 2023adsv is best matched by a template of an SN IIP, with a peak absolute magnitude of $-18.3$ AB mag in the rest-frame $B$-band. We model AT 2023adsv's light curve and find a good match to a $20M_\odot$ red supergiant progenitor star with an explosion energy of $2.0\times 10^{51}$ ergs, likely higher than normally observed in the local Universe, but consistent with SNe IIP drawn from local, lower metallicity environments. AT 2023adsv is the most distant photometrically classified SN IIP yet discovered with a spectroscopic redshift measurement, and may represent a global shift in SNe IIP properties as a function of redshift. This discovery, and the ones sure to follow, demonstrate the continued need for facilities like JWST to build a statistical sample of core-collapse SNe to understand the evolution of their properties, and to constrain the poorly understood relationship between progenitor metallicity and massive star evolution.</description>

      <title>A multi-frequency study of sub-parsec jets with the Event Horizon Telescope</title>

Abstract: The 2017 observing campaign of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) delivered the first very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) images at the observing frequency of 230 GHz, leading to a number of unique studies on black holes and relativistic jets from active galactic nuclei (AGN). In total, eighteen sources were observed: the main science targets, Sgr A* and M87 along with various calibrators. We investigated the morphology of the sixteen AGN in the EHT 2017 data set, focusing on the properties of the VLBI cores: size, flux density, and brightness temperature. We studied their dependence on the observing frequency in order to compare it with the Blandford-K\"onigl (BK) jet model. We modeled the source structure of seven AGN in the EHT 2017 data set using linearly polarized circular Gaussian components and collected results for the other nine AGN from dedicated EHT publications, complemented by lower frequency data in the 2-86 GHz range. Then, we studied the dependences of the VLBI core flux density, size, and brightness temperature on the frequency measured in the AGN host frame. We compared the observations with the BK jet model and estimated the magnetic field strength dependence on the distance from the central black hole. Our results indicate a deviation from the standard BK model, particularly in the decrease of the brightness temperature with the observing frequency. Either bulk acceleration of the jet material, energy transfer from the magnetic field to the particles, or both are required to explain the observations.</description>

      <title>The MeerKAT Fornax Survey IV. A close look at the cluster physics through the densest rotation measure grid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) mid precursor MeerKAT, we acquired broadband spectro-polarimetric data in the context of the MeerKAT Fornax Survey to study the Fornax cluster's magnetic fields in detail by building the densest rotation measure (RM) grid to date. Here, we present the survey, the analysis, and a discussion of the RM grid properties. We analyzed a circular region centered on the Fornax cluster center with a radius of $\sim1.4^\circ$; that is, $\rm\sim 0.73 R_{vir}$. The mosaics have a resolution of 13arcsec and cover the frequencies between 900\,MHz and 1.4\,GHz, reaching an average noise of 16$\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ in total intensity and 3$\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ in the Q and U Stokes images. With these data, we detected 508 polarized sources over an area of $\sim$6.35 deg$^2$ corresponding to a density of $\sim$80 polarized sources/deg$^2$. This is the densest RM grid ever built. Of the polarized sources, five are cluster sources. Excluding the cluster sources, we built the Euclidean-normalized differential source counts in polarization and we went a factor of ten deeper than previous surveys. We tentatively detect for the first time an increment in the differential source counts at low polarized flux densities; that is, $\sim$9\,$\mu$Jy at 1.4\,GHz. The average degree of polarization of about 3--4\% suggests that the sub$-\mu$Jansky population is not dominated by star-forming galaxies, typically showing a degree of polarization lower than 1\%. The majority of the polarized sources are Faraday simple; in other words, their polarization plane rotates linearly with the wavelength squared. The RM shows the typical decrement going from the center to the outskirts of the Fornax cluster. However, interesting features are observed both in the RM grid and in the RM radial profiles across different directions. A combination of the ...</description>

      <title>Dark Energy Survey Year 6 Results: Synthetic-source Injection Across the Full Survey Using Balrog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic source injection (SSI), the insertion of sources into pixel-level on-sky images, is a powerful method for characterizing object detection and measurement in wide-field, astronomical imaging surveys. Within the Dark Energy Survey (DES), SSI plays a critical role in characterizing all necessary algorithms used in converting images to catalogs, and in deriving quantities needed for the cosmology analysis, such as object detection rates, galaxy redshift estimation, galaxy magnification, star-galaxy classification, and photometric performance. We present here a source injection catalog of $146$ million injections spanning the entire 5000 deg$^2$ DES footprint, generated using the Balrog SSI pipeline. Through this sample, we demonstrate that the DES Year 6 (Y6) image processing pipeline provides accurate estimates of the object properties, for both galaxies and stars, at the percent-level, and we highlight specific regimes where the accuracy is reduced. We then show the consistency between SSI and data catalogs, for all galaxy samples developed within the weak lensing and galaxy clustering analyses of DES Y6. The consistency between the two catalogs also extends to their correlations with survey observing properties (seeing, airmass, depth, extinction, etc.). Finally, we highlight a number of applications of this catalog to the DES Y6 cosmology analysis. This dataset is the largest SSI catalog produced at this fidelity and will serve as a key testing ground for exploring the utility of SSI catalogs in upcoming surveys such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time.</description>

      <title>The elderly among the oldest: new evidence for extremely metal-poor RR Lyrae stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We performed a detailed spectroscopic analysis of three extremely metal-poor RR Lyrae stars, exploring uncharted territories at these low metallicities for this class of stars. Using high-resolution spectra acquired with HARPS-N at TNG, UVES at VLT, and PEPSI at LBT, and employing Non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (NLTE) spectral synthesis calculations, we provide abundance measurements for Fe, Al, Mg, Ca, Ti, Mn, and Sr. Our findings indicate that the stars have metallicities of [Fe/H] = -3.40 \pm 0.05, -3.28 \pm 0.02, and -2.77 \pm 0.05 for HD 331986, DO Hya, and BPS CS 30317-056, respectively. Additionally, we derived their kinematic and dynamical properties to gain insights into their origins. Interestingly, the kinematics of one star (HD 331986) is consistent with the Galactic disc, while the others exhibit Galactic halo kinematics, albeit with distinct chemical signatures. We compared the [Al/Fe] and [Mg/Mn] ratios of the current targets with recent literature estimates to determine whether these stars were either accreted or formed in situ, finding that the adopted chemical diagnostics are ineffective at low metallicities ([Fe/H] $\lesssim -$1.5). Finally, the established horizontal branch evolutionary models, indicating that these stars arrive at hotter temperatures on the Zero-Age Horizontal Branch (ZAHB) and then transition into RR Lyrae stars as they evolve, fully support the existence of such low-metallicity RR Lyrae stars. As a consequence, we can anticipate detecting more of them when larger samples of spectra become available from upcoming extensive observational campaigns.</description>

      <title>SECRET: Stochasticity Emulator for Cosmic Ray Electrons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spectrum of cosmic-ray electrons depends sensitively on the history and spatial distribution of nearby sources. Given our limited observational handle on cosmic-ray sources, any model remains necessarily probabilistic. Previously, predictions were performed in a Monte Carlo fashion, summing the contributions from individual, simulated sources to generate samples from the statistical ensemble of possible electron spectra. Such simulations need to be re-run if the cosmic-ray transport parameters (e.g. diffusion coefficient, maximum energy) are changed, rendering any parameter study computationally expensive. In addition, a proper statistical analysis of observations and comparison with such probabilistic models requires the joint probability distribution of the full spectrum instead of only samples. Note that parametrising this joint distribution is rendered difficult by the non-Gaussian statistics of the cosmic-ray fluxes. Here, we employ machine learning to compute the joint probability distribution of cosmic-ray electron fluxes. Specifically, we employ masked autoregressive density estimation (MADE) for a representation of the high-dimensional joint probability distribution. In a first step, we train the network on a Monte Carlo simulation for a fixed set of transport parameters, thus significantly accelerating the generation of samples. In a second step, we extend this setup to SECRET (Stochasticity Emulator for Cosmic Ray Electrons), allowing to reliably interpolate over the space of transport parameters. We make the MADE and SECRET codes available at https://git.rwth-aachen.de/pmertsch/secret .</description>

      <title>Thermal emission from bow shocks III: Variable diffuse X-ray emission from stellar-wind bow shocks driven by dynamical instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray emission from wind-driven bow shocks is both difficult to measure and predict, but may give important insights into the energy budget of the hot phase of the ISM by quantifying mixing at the interface between hot and warm gas phases. We investigate the effect of magnetic fields and numerical resolution on predicted X-ray emission and other observable properties of bow shocks, to study convergence properties and assess robustness of predicted observables from simulations. A suite of 2D and 3D HD and MHD simulations of bow shocks were run and analysed to generate synthetic emission maps and lightcurves in X-ray and infrared emission. Resolving the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability at the wind-ISM contact discontinuity is crucial for obtaining converged results and for predicting X-ray emission and the properties of the hot shocked wind. When sufficient spatial resolution is used, we measure time variation of X-ray emission of at least an order of magnitude on a timescale comparable to the advection timescale of the wake downstream from the bow shock. Good correspondence is found between 2D and 3D simulations with comparable resolution, and 3D simulations can achieve the required resolution with reasonable computing resources. Development of the KH instability is inhibited for shear flows parallel to the ISM magnetic field, compared with what is seen in the perpendicular direction, resulting in synthetic IR emission maps of bow shocks that are smooth when seen from one perspective but show strong distortions from another. Measuring the X-ray morphology and luminosity in bow shocks may be useful for constraining mixing and energy-transfer rates between hot and warm gas phases of the ISM. Dynamical instabilities at the wind-ISM interface are a crucial ingredient in determining the properties of the hot-gas phase in stellar bow-shocks, in particular to capture its time dependence.</description>

      <title>Ultraluminous X-ray sources in Globular Clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the formation, populations, and evolutionary paths of UltraLuminous X-ray Sources (ULXs) within Globular Clusters (GCs). ULXs, characterised by their extreme X-ray luminosities, present a challenge to our understanding of accretion physics and compact object formation. While previous studies have largely focused on field populations, this research examines the unique environment of GCs, where dynamical interactions play a significant role. Using the MOCCA Monte Carlo code, we explore how dynamics influences ULX populations within these dense stellar clusters.
  Our findings reveal that dynamical processes, such as binary hardening and exchanges, can both facilitate and impede ULX formation in GCs. The study explores the impact of parameters including the initial binary fraction, tidal filling, and multiple stellar populations on the evolution of ULXs. We find that non-tidally filling clusters exhibit significantly larger ULX populations compared to tidally filling ones.
  The results indicate that the apparent scarcity of ULXs in GCs may be related to the older stellar populations of GCs relative to the field. Furthermore, the study identifies a population of "escaper" ULXs, which originate in GCs but are ejected and emit X-rays outside the cluster. These escapers may significantly contribute to the observed field ULX population.</description>

      <title>Periodic Variability of the Central Stars of Planetary Nebulae Surveyed through the Zwicky Transient Facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A consensus has been reached in recent years that binarity plays an important role in the formation and evolution of a significant fraction of planetary nebulae (PNe). Utilizing the archived photometric data from the Zwicky Transient Facility survey, we conducted a comprehensive data mining in search for brightness variations in a large sample of Galactic PNe. This effort leads to identification of 39 PNe, whose central stars exhibit periodic variation in light curves. Among these objects, 20 are known binary central stars of PNe, while the remaining 19 are new discoveries. Additionally, we identified 14 PNe with central stars displaying anomalous variation in light curves, as well as eight variables based on the high-cadence photometric data. Among the new discoveries of periodicity, we found compelling evidence of binary systems at the centres of two archetypal quadrupolar PNe. We also report on very peculiar brightness variation observed in the central core of the compact PN NGC6833. Several PNe in our sample deserve follow-up observations, both high-dispersion spectroscopy and high-precision photometry, to reveal the true nature of their central binarity or even multiplicity.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Impact of Moderate External UV Irradiation on Disk Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chemistry within a protoplanetary disk is greatly affected by external radiation from the local stellar environment. Previous work has focused on extreme radiation fields, representative of the center of something like the Orion Nebula Cluster. However, even in such environments, many disks exist at the edges of a cluster where the lower stellar density leads to radiation fields weaker by orders of magnitude compared to the center. We present new chemical models of a T-Tauri disk in the presence of a moderately increased interstellar radiation field (ISRF). Such an environment has a background UV strength of 10 to 100 times higher than the galactic average ISRF. Moderate radiation fields are among the most prevalent disk-harboring environments and have interesting implications for the chemistry of the outer disk radii. We find that the external UV radiation creates an outer ionization front that impacts the cold disk chemistry to varying degrees, depending on outer disk structure. Certain molecules like C$^+$, N$_2$H$^+$, C, and CS are more strongly impacted by the ISRF in their abundance, column density, and observable emission. Other abundant species like HCO$^+$ and CO are less affected by the external UV flux in the outer disk under such moderate UV conditions. Further, we demonstrate that the chemistry occurring in the inner tens of au is relatively unchanged, which suggests that even in moderately externally irradiated disks, the inner disk chemistry may be more similar to isolated disks like those in, e.g., the Taurus and Lupus star-forming regions.</description>

      <title>The Radiowave Hunt for Young Stellar Object Emission and Demographics (RADIOHEAD): A Radio Luminosity${-}$Spectral Type Dependence in Taurus${-}$Auriga YSOs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We measure the radio continuum fluxes at the locations of all Gaia${-}$confirmed members of Taurus${-}$Auriga using Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array Sky Survey data (VLASS; 2${-}$4 GHz, $\sigma_{\rm{VLASS}}{\sim}110{-}140 \mu$Jy, $2.5''$ resolution) spanning 3 VLASS epochs (2019, 2021, and 2023). We present 35 detections coincident with young Taurus${-}$Auriga stars (29 in individual VLASS images, 6 via stacking). We find a strong dependence on spectral type, wherein the fractional detection rate of radio emission coincident with early-type young stellar objects (YSOs) is systematically higher than late-type YSOs, ranging from 25% $\pm$ 13% for B${-}$F YSOs, 21% $\pm$ 11% for G YSOs, 18.4% $\pm$ 6.3% for K0${-}$K4 YSOs, 15.5% $\pm$ 5.4% for K5${-}$K9 YSOs, 7.0% $\pm$ 2.7% for M0${-}$M2 YSOs, 2.3% $\pm$ 0.9% for M3${-}$M6 YSOs, and 1.9% $\pm$ 1.9% for YSOs with SpTs later than M7. We present cumulative density distributions of radio luminosity densities that demonstrate a significant luminosity enhancement for early- versus late-type YSOs. We find 25% of the detected sources to be significantly variable. We discuss possible interpretations of this dependence, which may reflect stellar magnetic activity, binary interactions, or stellar flaring. We find that mid-infrared YSO class is a strong indicator of radio detectability consistent with higher frequency Taurus-Auriga VLA surveys, with class III stars detected at a rate of 8.8% $\pm$ 1.6%, class IIs at 2.0% $\pm$ 1.2%, and combined class 0s, Is and Fs at 8.0% $\pm$ 5.4%.</description>

      <title>Large dark matter content and steep metallicity profile predicted for Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies formed in high-spin halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the stellar properties of a sample of simulated ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) with stellar mass $\rm{M_\star=10^{7.5} - 10^{9} ~ M_{\odot}}$, selected from the TNG50 simulation, where UDGs form mainly in high-spin dwarf-mass halos. We divide our sample into star-forming and quenched UDGs, finding good agreement with the stellar assembly history measured in observations. Star-forming UDGs and quenched UDGs with $\rm{M_\star \geq 10^8 ~ M_\odot}$ in our sample are particularly inefficient at forming stars, having $2$ - $10$ times less stellar mass than non-UDGs for the same virial mass halo. These results are consistent with recent mass inferences in UDG samples and suggest that the most inefficient UDGs arise from a late assembly of the dark matter mass followed by a stellar growth that is comparatively slower (for star-forming UDGs) or that was interrupted due to environmental removal of the gas (for quenched UDGs). Regardless of efficiency, UDGs are $60\%$ poorer in [Fe/H] than the population of non-UDGs at a fixed stellar mass, with the most extreme objects having metal content consistent with the simulated mass-metallicity relation at $z \sim 2$. Quenched UDGs stop their star formation in shorter timescales than non-UDGs of similar mass and are, as a consequence, alpha-enhanced with respect to non-UDGs. We identify metallicity profiles in UDGs as a potential avenue to distinguish between different formation paths for these galaxies, where gentle formation as a result of high-spin halos would present well-defined declining metallicity radial profiles while powerful-outflows or tidal stripping formation models would lead to flatter or constant metallicity as a function of radius due to the inherent mixing of stellar orbits.</description>

      <title>Signatures of high-redshift galactic outflows in the thermal Sunyaev Zel'dovich effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anisotropies of the Sunyaev Zel'dovich (SZ) effect serve as a powerful probe of the thermal history of the universe. At high redshift, hot galactic outflows driven by supernovae (SNe) can inject a significant amount of thermal energy into the intergalactic medium, causing a strong $y$-type distortion of the CMB spectrum through inverse Compton scattering. The resulting anisotropies of the $y$-type distortion are sensitive to key physical properties of high-$z$ galaxies pertaining to the launch of energetic SNe-driven outflows, such as the efficiency and the spatio-temporal clustering of star formation. We develop a simple analytic framework to calculate anisotropies of $y$-type distortion associated with SNe-powered outflows of galaxies at $z&gt;6$. We show that galactic outflows are likely the dominant source of thermal energy injection, compared to contributions from reionized bubbles and gravitational heating. We further show that next-generation CMB experiments such as LiteBIRD are likely to detect the contribution to $y$ anisotropies from high-$z$ galactic outflows through the cross-correlation with surveys of Lyman-break galaxies by e.g. the Roman Space Telescope. Our analysis and forecasts demonstrate that thermal SZ anisotropies can be a promising probe of SN feedback and outflows in early star-forming galaxies.</description>

      <title>The fallibility of equipartition magnetic field strengths from synchrotron emission using synthetically observed galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the role that magnetic fields play on the stage of galaxy formation requires accurate methods for inferring the properties of extragalactic magnetic fields. Radio synchrotron emission has been the most promising avenue to infer magnetic field strengths across galaxies, with the application of a central assumption: that galactic cosmic rays are in energy equipartition with the magnetic field. In this work, we leverage flexible synthetic observations of a high-resolution magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy to review whether true equipartition is capable of reproducing radio observations of galaxies, and investigate its impact on the inference of magnetic field strengths when varying the properties and density distribution of the cosmic rays. We find that imposing equipartition (regardless of scale length) results in cosmic ray electron densities that are unable to generate either the amplitude or the shape of the radio intensity profiles typically observed in spiral galaxies. Instead, observationally motivated smooth distributions of cosmic ray electrons across the galaxy provide a remarkable match to observations. We further demonstrate that assuming equipartition with those mock observations can lead to significant overestimation of the magnetic field strength. This misestimation varies with cosmic ray electron densities, cosmic ray spectrum power-law index, and galactic environment, aggravated in inter-arm regions and attenuated in star-forming regions. Our results promote caution when assuming equipartition in observations, and suggest that additional theoretical and numerical work is required to leverage the upcoming generation of radio observations poised to revolutionize our understanding of astrophysical magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Moving-mesh non-ideal magnetohydrodynamical simulations of the collapse of cloud cores to protostars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic fields have been shown both observationally and through theoretical work to be an important factor in the formation of protostars and their accretion disks. Accurate modelling of the evolution of the magnetic field in low-ionization molecular cloud cores requires the inclusion of non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) processes, specifically Ohmic and ambipolar diffusion and the Hall effect. These have a profound influence on the efficiency of magnetic removal of angular momentum from protostellar disks and simulations that include them can avoid the `magnetic-braking catastrophe' in which disks are not able to form. However, the impact of the Hall effect, in particular, is complex and remains poorly studied. In this work, we perform a large suite of simulations of the collapse of cloud cores to protostars with several non-ideal MHD chemistry models and initial core geometries using the moving-mesh code {\small AREPO}. We find that the efficiency of angular momentum removal is significantly reduced with respect to ideal MHD, in line with previous results. The Hall effect has a varied influence on the evolution of the disk which depends on the initial orientation of the magnetic field. This extends to the outflows seen in a subset of the models, where this effect can act to enhance or suppress them and open up new outflow channels. We conclude, in agreement with a subset of the previous literature, that the Hall effect is the dominant non-ideal MHD process in some collapse scenarios and thus should be included in simulations of protostellar disk formation.</description>

      <title>The circumgalactic medium traced by Mg II absorption with DESI: dependence on galaxy stellar mass, star formation rate and azimuthal angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the circumgalactic medium (CGM) distribution of galaxies is the key to revealing the dynamical exchange of materials between galaxies and their surroundings. In this work, we use DESI EDR dataset to investigate the cool CGM of galaxies ($0.3&lt;z&lt;1.7$) with stacking the spectra of background QSOs to obtain Mg II absorption of foreground galaxies. The equivalent width of Mg II absorption strongly correlates to stellar mass with EW(Mg II) $\propto M_{*}^{0.5}$ for star-forming galaxies with $\log M_{*}/M_{\odot} &lt; 10$, but is independent with mass for galaxies above this mass. At given stellar mass, EW(Mg II) is larger for galaxies of higher star formation rate with impact parameter less than $50$ kpc, while showing little dependence on galaxy size. By studying the dependence on azimuthal angle, we find EW(Mg II) is strongest at the direction near the minor axis for star-forming galaxies with $\log M_{*}/M_{\odot} &lt; 10.0$, while no dependence on azimuthal angle is seen for luminous red galaxies. This indicates that the outflow associated with star formation enhances the Mg II absorption. However, for galaxies with $\log M_{*}/M_{\odot} &gt; 10.0$, the EW(Mg II) at the minor axis is largely suppressed with respect to low mass galaxies. This suggests that the competing processes, such as stellar feedback and gravity, play a key role in shaping the distribution of outflowing gas.</description>

      <title>Dark matter fraction derived from the M31 rotation curve</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02737v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mass estimates of a spiral galaxy derived from its rotation curve must account for the galaxy's past accretion history. There are several lines of evidence indicating that M31 experienced a major merger 2 to 3 Gyr ago. Here, we have generated a dynamical model of M31 as a merger remnant that reproduces most of its properties, from the central bar to the outskirts. The model accounts for the past major merger, and reproduces the details of M31's rotation curve, including its 14 kpc bump and the observed increase of velocity beyond 25 kpc. Furthermore, we find non-equilibrium and oscillatory motions in the gas of the merger-remnant outskirts caused by material in a tidal tail returning to the merger remnant. A total dynamical M31 mass of 4.5 $\times 10^{11} M_{\odot}$ within 137 kpc has been obtained after scaling it to the observed HI rotation curve. Within this radial distance, 68% of the total dynamical mass is dark.</description>

      <title>High-resolution imaging of the radio source associated with Project Hephaistos Dyson Sphere Candidate G</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present high-resolution e-MERLIN and EVN (e-VLBI) observations of a radio source associated with Dyson Sphere candidate G, identified as part of Project Hephaistos. The radio source, VLASS J233532.86-000424.9, is resolved into 3 compact components and shows the typical characteristics of a radio-loud AGN. In particular, the EVN observations show that it has a brightness temperature in excess of $10^{8}$~K. No radio emission is detected at the position of the M-dwarf star. This result confirms our earlier hypothesis, that at least some of the Dyson Sphere candidates of project Hephaistos are contaminated by obscured, background AGN, lying close to the line of sight of otherwise normal galactic stars. High-resolution radio observations of other Dyson Sphere candidates can be useful in distinguishing truly promising candidates from those contaminated by background sources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We constrain the redshift dependence of (rest frame) host galaxy dispersion measures of localized Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) by assuming it to vary as a simple power law ($\propto (1+z)^{\alpha}$). We simultaneously fit $\alpha$ as well as the host dispersion measure to the data of FRBs with known redshifts. We find that \color{black} $\alpha$ between 0 to 1 is preferred depending upon our modelling choices. Current data can constrain $|\alpha|\lesssim 2$ at a 68 percent confidence interval \color{black}. Such constraints have implications for our understanding of galaxy formation and can be used to inform galaxy and large scale simulations.</description>
