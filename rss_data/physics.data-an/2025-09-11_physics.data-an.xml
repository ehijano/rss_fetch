      <title>An Interval Type-2 Version of Bayes Theorem Derived from Interval Probability Range Estimates Provided by Subject Matter Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian inference is widely used in many different fields to test hypotheses against observations. In most such applications, an assumption is made of precise input values to produce a precise output value. However, this is unrealistic for real-world applications. Often the best available information from subject matter experts (SMEs) in a given field is interval range estimates of the input probabilities involved in Bayes Theorem. This paper provides two key contributions to extend Bayes Theorem to an interval type-2 (IT2) version. First, we develop an IT2 version of Bayes Theorem that uses a novel and conservative method to avoid potential inconsistencies in the input IT2 MFs that otherwise might produce invalid output results. We then describe a novel and flexible algorithm for encoding SME-provided intervals into IT2 fuzzy membership functions (MFs), which we can use to specify the input probabilities in Bayes Theorem. Our algorithm generalizes and extends previous work on this problem that primarily addressed the encoding of intervals into word MFs for Computing with Words applications.</description>

      <title>In situ estimation of the acoustic surface impedance using simulation-based inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08873</link>

Abstract: Accurate acoustic simulations of enclosed spaces require precise boundary conditions, typically expressed through surface impedances for wave-based methods. Conventional measurement techniques often rely on simplifying assumptions about the sound field and mounting conditions, limiting their validity for real-world scenarios. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces a Bayesian framework for the in situ estimation of frequency-dependent acoustic surface impedances from sparse interior sound pressure measurements. The approach employs simulation-based inference, which leverages the expressiveness of modern neural network architectures to directly map simulated data to posterior distributions of model parameters, bypassing conventional sampling-based Bayesian approaches and offering advantages for high-dimensional inference problems. Impedance behavior is modeled using a damped oscillator model extended with a fractional calculus term. The framework is verified on a finite element model of a cuboid room and further tested with impedance tube measurements used as reference, achieving robust and accurate estimation of all six individual impedances. Application to a numerical car cabin model further demonstrates reliable uncertainty quantification and high predictive accuracy even for complex-shaped geometries. Posterior predictive checks and coverage diagnostics confirm well-calibrated inference, highlighting the method's potential for generalizable, efficient, and physically consistent characterization of acoustic boundary conditions in real-world interior environments.</description>

      <title>Identification of phase correlations in Financial Stock Market Turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The basis of arbitrage methods depends on the circulation of information within the framework of the financial market. Following the work of Modigliani and Miller, it has become a vital part of discussions related to the study of financial networks and predictions. The emergence of the efficient market hypothesis by Fama, Fisher, Jensen and Roll in the early 1970s opened up the door for discussion of information affecting the price in the market and thereby creating asymmetries and price distortion. Whenever the micro and macroeconomic factors change, there is a high probability of information asymmetry in the market, and this asymmetry of information creates turbulence in the market. The analysis and interpretation of turbulence caused by the differences in information is crucial in understanding the nature of the stock market using price patterns and fluctuations. Even so, the traditional approaches are not capable of analyzing the cyclical price fluctuations outside the realm of wave structures of securities prices, and a proper and effective technique to assess the nature of the Financial market. Consequently, the analysis of the price fluctuations by applying the theories and computational techniques of mathematical physics ensures that such cycles are disintegrated, and the outcome of decomposed cycles is elucidated to understand the impression of the information on the genesis and discovery of price and to assess the nature of stock market turbulence. In this regard, the paper will provide a framework of Spectrum analysis that decomposes the pricing patterns and is capable of determining the pricing behavior, eventually assisting in examining the nature of turbulence in the National Stock Exchange of India.</description>
