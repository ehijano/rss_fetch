      <title>Spin-gapped metals: A novel class of materials - the case of semi-Heusler compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gapped metals, a recently discovered new class of materials, possess a band gap slightly above or below the Fermi level. These materials are intrinsic p- or n-type semiconductors eliminating the need for extrinsic doping. Inspired by this concept, we propose the so-called "spin-gapped metals" exhibiting intrinsic p- or n-type behavior for each spin channel independently. Their properties would be similar to the dilute magnetic semiconductors eliminating the requirement for transition metal doping. Here, we demonstrate this novel concept in semi-Heusler compounds using first principles electronic band structure calculations. We comprehensively analyze their electronic and magnetic properties, paving the way for novel technological applications of Heusler compounds.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric Transport in Weyl Semimetal BaMnSb2: a First-Principles Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological materials are often associated with exceptional thermoelectric properties. Orthorhombic BaMnSb2 is a topological semimetal consisting of alternating layers of Ba, Sb, and MnSb. A recent experiment demonstrates that BaMnSb2 has a low thermal conductivity and modest thermopower, promising as a thermoelectric material. Through first-principles calculations with Coulomb repulsion and spin-orbit coupling included, we studied the electronic structure, phononic structure, and thermoelectric transport properties of BaMnSb2 in depth. We find that BaMnSb2 exhibits a low lattice thermal conductivity, owing to the scattering of the acoustic phonons with low-frequency optical modes. Using the linearized Boltzmann transport theory with a constant relaxation time approximation, the thermopower is further calculated and an intriguing goniopolar transport behavior, which is associated with both n-type and p-type conduction along separate transport directions simultaneously, is observed. We propose that the figure of merit can be enhanced via doping in which electrical conductivity is decreased while the thermopower remains undiminished. BaMnSb2 is a potential platform for elucidating complex band structure effects and topological phenomena, paving the way to explore rich physics in low-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>On the equilibrium limit of liquid stability in pressurized aqueous systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase stability, and the limits thereof, are a central concern of materials thermodynamics. However, the temperature limits of equilibrium liquid stability in chemical systems have only been widely characterized under constant (typically atmospheric) pressure conditions, whereunder the limit is represented by the eutectic. At higher pressures, this limit will shift in both temperature and chemical composition, opening a wide thermodynamic parameter space over which the absolute limit, i.e., the limit under arbitrary values of the thermodynamic forces at play (here pressure and concentration), might exist. In this work, we use isochoric freezing to measure this absolute limit for the first time in several binary aqueous brines, and, nodding to the etymology of "eutectic", we name this limit the "cenotectic" (from Greek " ", "universal-melt"). We observe that when no solute-bearing high-pressure phases exist, the cenotectic occurs consistently 22 +/- 2K below the 1 bar eutectic and at approximately 213 +/- 3 MPa, suggesting domination by the liquidus behaviors of the icy phases present. In charting the T-P evolution of each eutectic configuration, we also encounter several unreported high-pressure hydrates of NaHCO2, MgCl2, and NaCl, and we find that these high-pressure phases can produce complex multi-phase configurations involving the liquid that may remain metastable to significantly lower temperatures. We discuss the implications of these findings for ocean worlds of our solar system and cold ocean exoplanets; estimate thermodynamic limits on ice crust thickness and final ocean depth ("endgame") using the cenotectic pressure; and finally provide a generalized thermodynamic perspective on (and definition for) this fundamental thermodynamic invariant point.</description>

      <title>Determining the bulk and surface electronic structure of $\alpha$-Sn/InSb(001) with spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surface and bulk states in topological materials have shown promise in many applications. Grey or $\alpha$-Sn, the inversion symmetric analogue to HgTe, can exhibit a variety of these phases. However there is disagreement in both calculation and experiment over the exact shape of the bulk bands and the number and origin of the surface states. Using spin- and angle-resolved photoemission we investigate the bulk and surface electronic structure of $\alpha$-Sn thin films on InSb(001) grown by molecular beam epitaxy. We find that there is no significant warping in the shapes of the bulk bands. We also observe the presence of only two surface states near the valence band maximum in both thin (13 bilayer) and thick (400 bilayer) films. In 50 bilayer films, these two surface states coexist with quantum well states. Surprisingly, both of these surface states are spin-polarized with orthogonal spin-momentum locking and opposite helicities. One of these states is the spin-polarized topological surface state and the other a spin resonance. Finally, the presence of another orthogonal spin-momentum locked topological surface state from a secondary band inversion is verified. Our work clarifies the electronic structure of $\alpha$-Sn(001) such that better control of the electronic properties can be achieved. In addition, the presence of two spin-polarized surface states near the valence band maximum has important ramifications for the use of $\alpha$-Sn in spintronics.</description>

      <title>Coexisting Magnetism, Ferroelectric, and Ferrovalley Multiferroic in Stacking-Dependent Two-Dimensional Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two-dimensional (2D) multiferroic materials have widespread of application prospects in facilitating the integration and miniaturization of nanodevices. However, it is rarely coupling between the magnetic, ferroelectric, and ferrovalley in one 2D material. Here, we propose a mechanism for manipulating magnetism, ferroelectric, and valley polarization by interlayer sliding in 2D bilayer material. Monolayer GdI2 exhibits a ferromagnetic semiconductor with the valley polarization up to 155.5 meV. More interestingly, the magnetism and valley polarization of bilayer GdI2 can be strongly coupled by sliding ferroelectricity, appearing these tunable and reversible. In addition, we uncover the microscopic mechanism of magnetic phase transition by spin Hamiltonian and electron hopping between layers. Our findings offer a new direction for investigating 2D multiferroic in the implication for next-generation electronic, valleytronic, and spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Exploring Structural and Electrochemical Properties of Li$_3$TiCl$_6$: A Machine Learning Molecular Dynamics Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed large-scale molecular dynamics simulations based on a machine-learning force field (MLFF) to investigate the Li-ion transport mechanism in cation-disordered Li$_3$TiCl$_6$ cathode at six different temperatures, ranging from 25$^\mathrm{o}$C to 100$^\mathrm{o}$C. In this work, deep neural network method and data generated by $ab-initio$ molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were deployed to build a high-fidelity MLFF. Radial distribution functions, Li-ion mean square displacements (MSD), diffusion coefficients, ionic conductivity, activation energy, and crystallographic direction-dependent migration barriers were calculated and compared with corresponding AIMD and experimental data to benchmark the accuracy of the MLFF. From MSD analysis, we captured both the self and distinct parts of Li-ion dynamics. The latter reveals that the Li-ions are involved in anti-correlation motion that was rarely reported for solid-state materials. Similarly, the self and distinct parts of Li-ion dynamics were used to determine Haven's ratio to describe the Li-ion transport mechanism in Li$_3$TiCl$_6$. Obtained trajectory from molecular dynamics infers that the Li-ion transportation is mainly through interstitial hopping which was confirmed by intra- and inter-layer Li-ion displacement with respect to simulation time. Ionic conductivity (1.06 mS/cm) and activation energy (0.29eV) calculated by our simulation are highly comparable with that of experimental values. Overall, the combination of machine-learning methods and AIMD simulations explains the intricate electrochemical properties of the Li$_3$TiCl$_6$ cathode with remarkably reduced computational time. Thus, our work strongly suggests that the deep neural network-based MLFF could be a promising method for large-scale complex materials.</description>

      <title>Gapped nodal planes drive a large topological Nernst effect in a chiral lattice antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electronic structure of compensated antiferromagnets (CAF) has drawn attention for its ability to create large responses, reminiscent of ferromagnets and suitable for data storage and readout, despite (nearly) net-zero spontaneous magnetization. Many of the striking experimental signatures predicted for CAF, such as giant thermoelectric Nernst effects, are enhanced when two or more electronic bands are nearly degenerate in vicinity of the Fermi energy. Here, we use thermoelectric and electric transport experiments to study the electronic structure of the layered, chiral metal CoNb3S6 in its all-in-all-out CAF ground state and report near-degeneracies of electron bands at the upper and lower boundaries of the first Brillouin zone. Considering non-symmorphic spin-space group symmetries in the non-relativistic approximation for the ordered phase, these near-degeneracies are approximately protected by a lattice translation combined with spin rotation, and are vestiges of nodal planes enforced by a screw axis symmetry in the paramagnetic state. Hot spots of emergent, or fictitious, magnetic fields are formed at the slightly gapped nodal plane, generating the spontaneous Hall and Nernst effects in this CAF. Taking into account more than six hundred Wannier orbitals, our model quantitatively reproduces the observed spontaneous Nernst effect, emphasizes the role of proximate symmetries in the emergent responses of CAF, and demonstrates the promise of ab-initio search for functional responses in a wide class of materials with reconstructed unit cells due to spin or charge correlations order.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-breaking-dependent electronic structures and strain regulation in ReSeS monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic devices for information storages and processes can be further optimized by introducing the degree of freedom of anisotropy, which is strongly dependent of their structural symmetry. Herein, a ReSeS monolayer with asymmetrical double-faces are proposed to disclose the anisotropic electronic structure. Meanwhile infrared fingerprint based on the lattice vibration is also adopted to demonstrate the symmetry-breaking-dependent structural transformation. First-principles calculations demonstrate that the geometry deformation will induce the reconstruction of electronic structure. Ulteriorly, both the dynamic properties of carrier and spectroscopic response can be regulated by external strain and displays anisotropic behaviors. Our idea provides threads for designing new regulable optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Mirror real Chern insulator in two and three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A real Chern insulator (RCI) featuring a real Chern number and a second-order boundary mode appears in a two-dimensional (2D) system with the space-time inversion symmetry (PT ). Here, we propose a kind of RCI: mirror real Chern insulator (MRCI) which emerges from the system having additional horizontal mirror symmetry Mz. The MRCI generally is characterized by two independent real Chern numbers, respectively defined in the two mirror subsystems of the system. Hence, the MRCI may host the second-order boundary modes different from the conventional RCI. We show that for spinless systems, the definition of the MRCI is straightforward, as PT keeps each mirror subsystem invariant. For the spinful systems with both PT and Mz, the real Chern number for the total system remain well defined, as MzPT = C2zT , and (C2zT )2= 1. However, since C2zT exchanges the two mirror subsystems, the definition of the MRCI in spinful systems requires the help of projective symmetry algebra. We also discuss the MRCIs in 3D systems, where the MRCI is defined on certain mirror-invariant 2D planes. Compared with its 2D counterpart, the 3D MRCI can exhibit more abundant physics when the systems have additional nonsymmorphic operators. Several concrete MRCI models including 2D and 3D, spinless and spinful models are constructed to further demonstrate our ideas.</description>

      <title>Unified understanding to the rich electronic-structure evolutions of 2D black phosphorus under pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electronic structure evolutions of few-layer black phosphorus (BP) under pressure shows a wealth of phenomena, such as the nonmonotonic change of direct gap at the {\Gamma} point, the layer-number dependence, and the distinct responses to normal and hydrostatic pressures. A full and unified understanding to these rich phenomena remains lacking. Here, we provide a unified understanding from the competition between interlayer quasi-bonding (QB) interactions and intralayer chemical bonding interactions. The former decreases while the latter increases the band gap under pressure and the origin can be correlated to different combinations of inter- and intra-layer antibonding or bonding interactions at the band edges. More interestingly, the interlayer QB interactions are a coexistence of two categories of interactions, namely, the coexistence of interactions between bands of the same occupancy (occupied-occupied and empty-empty interactions) and of different occupancies (occupied-empty interaction); and, the overall effect is a four-level interaction, which explains the anomalous interlayer-antibonding feature of the conduction band edge of bilayer BP. Our current study lay the foundation for the electronic structure tuning of two-dimensional (2D) BP, and, our analysis method for multi-energy-level interactions can be applied to other 2D semiconductor homo- and hetero-structures that have occupied-empty interlayer interactions.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Committee Machine Potential for Oxygen-containing Organic Compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the pivotal role of oxygen-containing organic compounds in serving as an energy source for living organisms and contributing to protein formation is crucial in the field of biochemistry. This study addresses the challenge of comprehending protein-protein interactions (PPI) and developing predicitive models for proteins and organic compounds, with a specific focus on quantifying their binding affinity. Here, we introduce the active Bayesian Committee Machine (BCM) potential, specifically designed to predict oxygen-containing organic compounds within eight groups of CHO. The BCM potential adopts a committee-based approach to tackle scalability issues associated with kernel regressors, particularly when dealing with large datasets. Its adaptable structure allows for efficient and cost-effective expansion, maintaing both transferability and scalability. Through systematic benchmarking, we position the sparse BCM potential as a promising contender in the pursuit of a universal machine learning potential.</description>

      <title>Zero-field magnetic skyrmions in exchange-biased ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the stabilization of ferromagnetic skyrmions in zero external magnetic fields, in exchange-biased systems composed of ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic (FM-AFM) bilayers. By performing atomistic spin dynamics simulations, we study cases of compensated, uncompensated, and partly uncompensated FM-AFM interfaces, and investigate the impact of important parameters such as temperature, inter-plane exchange interaction, Dzyaloshinskii-Moria interaction, and magnetic anisotropy on the skyrmions appearance and stability. The model with an uncompensated FM-AFM interface leads to the stabilization of individual skyrmions and skyrmion lattices in the FM layer, caused by the effective field from the AFM instead of an external magnetic field. Similarly, in the case of a fully compensated FM-AFM interface, we show that FM skyrmions can be stabilized. We also demonstrate that accounting for interface roughness leads to stabilization of skyrmions both in compensated and uncompensated interfaces. Moreover, in bilayers with a rough interface, skyrmions in the FM layer are observed for a wide range of exchange interaction values through the FM-AFM interface, and the chirality of the skyrmions depends critically on the exchange interaction.</description>

      <title>Electric polarization evolution equation for antiferromagnetic multiferroics with the polarization proportional to the scalar product of the spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin current model of electric polarization of multiferroics is justified via the quantum hydrodynamic method and the mean-field part of the spin-orbit interaction. The spin current model is applied to derive the electric polarization proportional to the scalar product of the spins of the near by ions, which appears to be caused by the Dzylaoshinskii-Moriya interaction. Symmetric tensor spin structure of the polarization is discussed as well. We start our derivations for the ferromagnetic multiferroic materials and present the further generalization for the antiferromagnetic multiferroic materials. We rederive the operator of the electric dipole moment, which provides the macroscopic polarization obtained via the spin current model. Finally, we use the quantum average of the found electric dipole moment operator in order to derive the polarization evolution equation for the antiferromagnetic multiferroic materials. Possibility of spiral spin structures is analyzed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simple and computationally efficient algorithm enables implementing negative temperature values in a spin dynamics simulation. The algorithm uses a Langevin spin dynamics thermostat with a negative damping parameter, enabling the thermalization of an arbitrary interacting spin system to the Gibbs energy distribution with a given negative temperature value. Canonical spin dynamics simulations at a negative temperature are as robust as conventional positive spin temperature simulations, providing a tool for quantitative dynamic studies of the physics of highly excited magnetic states. Two simulation case studies describing spin systems with antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic ground states are explored. The phase transitions occurring in the negative temperature range do not necessarily exhibit similarities with their positive temperature counterparts. The transition temperatures and the character of spin alignment vary depending on the spatial range and strength of spin-spin interactions.</description>

      <title>Influence of Spatial Coherence on Phonon Transmission across Aperiodically Arranged Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we employ the atomistic wave-packet method to directly simulate coherent phonon transport and scattering dynamics in an aperiodic superlattice structure with aperiodically arranged interfaces. Our investigation reveals that interference dynamics, contingent upon the relative magnitudes of phonon wavelength, spatial coherence length, and average interface spacing, profoundly influence transmission spectra and mode-conversion behavior. Particularly, longer-wavelength phonons possessing larger coherence lengths exhibit more pronounced destructive interference and mode-conversion, leading to generally lower transmission.

      <title>Phonon-pair-driven Ferroelectricity Causes Costless Domain-walls and Bulk-boundary Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectric domain walls, recognized as distinct from the bulk in terms of symmetry, structure, and electronic properties, host exotic phenomena including conductive walls, ferroelectric vortices, novel topologies, and negative capacitance. Contrary to conventional understanding, our study reveals that the structure of domain walls in HfO2 closely resembles its bulk. First, our first-principles simulations unveil that the robust ferroelectricity is supported by bosonic pairing of all the anionic phonons in bulk HfO2. Strikingly, the paired phonons strongly bond with each other and successfully reach the center of the domain wall without losing their integrity and produce bulk-like domain walls. We then confirmed preservation of the bulk phonon displacements and consequently full revival of the bulk structure at domain walls via aberration-corrected STEM. The newly found duality between the bulk and the domain wall sheds light on previously enigmatic properties such as zero-energy domain walls, perfect Ising-type polar ordering, and exceptionally robust ferroelectricity at the sub-nm scales. The phonon-pairing discovered here is robust against physical boundaries such as domain walls and enables zero momentum and zero-energy cost local ferroelectric switching. This phenomenon demonstrated in Si-compatible ferroelectrics provides a novel technological platform where data storage on domain walls is as feasible as that within the domains, thereby expanding the potential for high-density data storage and advanced ferroelectric applications.</description>

Abstract: Machine learning in atomistic materials science has grown to become a powerful tool, with most approaches focusing on atomic arrangements, typically decomposed into local atomic environments. This approach, while well-suited for machine-learned interatomic potentials, is conceptually at odds with learning complex intrinsic properties of materials, often driven by spectral properties commonly represented in reciprocal space (e.g., band gaps or mobilities) which cannot be readily atomically partitioned. For such applications, methods which represent the electronic rather than the atomic structure could be more promising. In this work, we present a general framework focused on electronic-structure descriptors which take advantage of the natural symmetries and inherent interpretability of physical models. Using this framework, we formulate two such representations and apply them respectively to measuring the similarity of carbon nanotubes and barium titanate polymorphs, and to the discovery of novel transparent conducting materials (TCMs) in the Materials Cloud 3D database (MC3D). A random forest classifier trained on 1% of the materials in the MC3D is able to correctly label 76% of entries in database which meet common screening criteria for promising TCMs.</description>

      <title>Location and migration of interstitial Li ions in CsPbI$_3$ crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Halide perovskites are highly promising light-harvesting materials with strong ionic character, enabling in principle the combination of a solar cell and a Li-ion battery in one integrated photo-battery device. Here, we investigate Li ions inside crystals of CsPbI$_3$, as a prototype compound, by means of density-functional-theory calculations. Our findings demonstrate that the interstitial location and migration of Li ions depend strongly on the dynamic nature of the crystal structure of the perovskite compound. We consider two limiting cases for Li in CsPbI$_{3}$,(i) the cubic-symmetry structure as a model for the limit of fast ion motion and (ii) a distorted cubic structure as a model for the limit of slow ion motion. For both limiting cases we obtain moderate energy barriers for migrating Li ions, which highlight the potential of halide perovskites like CsPbI$_3$ for applications in photo-battery devices.</description>

      <title>Grain Boundary Segregation Models for High-Entropy Alloys: Theoretical Formulation and Derived Analytical Expressions to Elucidate High-Entropy Grain Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grain boundary (GB) segregation models are derived for multi-principal element and high-entropy alloys (MPEAs and HEAs). Differing from classical models where one component is taken as solvent and others are considered solutes, these models are referenced to the bulk composition to enable improved treatments of MPEAs and HEAs with no principal components. An ideal solution model is first formulated and solved to obtain analytical expressions that predict GB segregation and GB energy in MPEAs and HEAs. A regular solution model is further derived. The GB composition calculated using the simple analytical expression derived in this study and data from the Materials Project agree well with a prior sphosipcated atomistic simulation for NbMoTaW. The simplicity of the derived analytical expressions makes them useful for not only conveniently predicting GB segregation trends in HEAs, but also analyzing nascent interfacial phenomena in composionally complex GBs. As an application example, the derived models are used to further formulate a set of useful equations to elucidate an emergent concept of high-entropy grain boundaries (HEGBs).</description>

      <title>A Predictive Model for Catalytic Methane Pyrolysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Methane pyrolysis provides a scalable alternative to conventional hydrogen production methods, avoiding greenhouse gas emissions. However, high operating temperatures limit economic feasibility on an industrial scale. A major scientific goal is, therefore, to find a catalyst material that lowers operating temperatures, making methane pyrolysis economically viable. In this work, we derive a model that provides a qualitative comparison of possible catalyst materials. The model is based on calculations of adsorption energies using density functional theory. Thirty different elements were considered. Adsorption energies of intermediate molecules in the methane pyrolysis reaction correlate linearly with the adsorption energy of carbon. Moreover, the adsorption energy increases in magnitude with decreasing group number in the $d$-block of the periodic table. For a temperature range between 600 and 1200 K and a normalized partial pressure range for $\mathrm{H_2}$ between $10^{-1}$ and $10^{-5}$, a total of nineteen different materials were found to be optimal catalysts at least once. This indicates that catalyst selection and reactor operating conditions should be well-matched. The present work establishes the foundation for future large-scale studies of surfaces, alloy compositions, and material classes using machine learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>Nature of point defects in monolayer MoS2 and the MoS2/(111)Au heterojunction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deposition of MoS2 on (111)-Au alters the electronic properties of MoS2. In this study, we investigate the free-standing MoS2 monolayer and the MoS2~\(111)-Au heterostructure, with and without strain, as well as defects of interest in memristive and neuromorphic applications. We focus on so-called atomristor devices based on monolayer materials that achieve resistive switching characteristics with the adsorption and desorption of metal adatoms. Our study confirms that the formation of midgap states is the primary mechanism behind the resistive switching. Our results show that strain lowers the adsorption~\desorption energies of Au+defect structures of interest, leading to more favorable switching energies, but simultaneously reduces the switching ratio between states of differing conductivities. The presence of the (111)-Au substrate additionally introduces non-uniform amounts of strain throughout and charge transfer to the MoS2 monolayer. We propose that the induced strain can contribute to the experimentally observed n- to p-type transition and Ohmic to Schottky transition in the MoS2 monolayer. The charge transfer leads to a permanent polarization at the interface, which can be tuned by strain. Our study has important implications on the role of the electrode as being a source of the observed variability in memristive devices and as serving as an additional degree of freedom for tuning the switching characteristics of the memristor device.</description>

      <title>Atomic-scale effect of 2D {\pi}-conjugated metal-organic frameworks as electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction reaction towards highly selective products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction technology is key to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and the energy crisis. However, controlling the selectivity of CO2RR products at low overpotential remains a challenge. In this paper, we predicted five high-performance CO2RR electrocatalysts with different product-specific selectivities at the theoretical level based on the advantages of the compositional structure and the tunable pore size of 2D {\pi}-conjugated MOFs. In addition, through the reaction mechanism and electronic structure analysis, we found that the synergistic interaction between metal atoms and organic linkers of 2D MOFs can effectively regulate the electronic structure of the active center. Their pore size as well as the diversity of carbon materials can regulate the spin magnetic moments of the metal atoms, thus affecting the improvement of their catalytic performance. Meanwhile, the oxygen or carbon affinity of the catalyst surface determines the differences in the formation of key intermediates, which ultimately determines the reaction path and product selectivity. These insights we present will be useful for the development and design of highly active CO2RR electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Hybrid data-driven and physics-informed regularized learning of cyclic plasticity with Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An extendable, efficient and explainable Machine Learning approach is proposed to represent cyclic plasticity and replace conventional material models based on the Radial Return Mapping algorithm. High accuracy and stability by means of a limited amount of training data is achieved by implementing physics-informed regularizations and the back stress information. The off-loading of the Neural Network is applied to the maximal extent. The proposed model architecture is simpler and more efficient compared to existing solutions from the literature, while representing a complete three-dimensional material model. The validation of the approach is carried out by means of surrogate data obtained with the Armstrong-Frederick kinematic hardening model. The Mean Squared Error is assumed as the loss function which stipulates several restrictions: deviatoric character of internal variables, compliance with the flow rule, the differentiation of elastic and plastic steps and the associativity of the flow rule. The latter, however, has a minor impact on the accuracy, which implies the generalizability of the model for a broad spectrum of evolution laws for internal variables. Numerical tests simulating several load cases are shown in detail and validated for accuracy and stability.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic investigations on trivalent ruthenium ions in ruthenium perovskite oxide thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $d^5$ electron configurations under the crystal field, spin-orbit coupling, and Coulomb interaction give rise to a plethora of profound ground states. Ruthenium perovskite oxides exhibit a number of unconventional properties yet the Ru$^{4+}$ state ($4d^4$) is usually stable in these materials. In this regard, Ru$^{3+}$ ions in perovskite materials are expected to be a mesmerising playground of $4d^5$ electron configurations. Here, we report measurements of x-ray photoemission spectroscopy on recently synthesized perovskite ruthenium oxide thin films, LaRuO$_3$ and NdRuO$_3$, whose valence state of the ruthenium ions is trivalent. We discuss correlation and spin-orbit effects from the valence-band spectra, in particular an additional peak structure around 3-5 eV, reminiscent of the so-called 3 eV peak observed in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. Moreover, we find that the core-level spectra of these materials are quantitatively different from those in other ruthenates which possess Ru$^{4+}$ ions, e.g., SrRuO$_3$. We therefore argue that the core level spectra of LaRuO$_3$ and NdRuO$_3$ are peculiar to the Ru$^{3+}$ states.</description>

      <title>Gesture recognition with Brownian reservoir computing using geometrically confined skyrmion dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical reservoir computing (RC) is a beyond von-Neumann computing paradigm that harnesses the dynamical properties of a complex physical system (reservoir) to process information efficiently in tasks such as pattern recognition. This hardware-centered approach drastically reduces training efforts and holds potential for significantly reduced energy consumption operation. Magnetic skyrmions, topological, particle-like spin textures, are considered highly promising candidates for reservoir computing systems due to their non-linear interactions and established mechanisms for low power manipulation combined with thermally excited dynamics. So far spin-based reservoir computing has been used for static detection or has been based on intrinsic magnetization dynamics timescales, that require cumbersome rescaling of typically slower real-world data. Here we harness the power of time-multiplexed skyrmion RC by adjusting the intrinsic timescales of the reservoir to the timescales of real-world temporal patterns: we recognize hand gestures recorded with range-doppler radar on a millisecond timescale and feed the data as a time-dependent voltage excitation directly into our device. We observe the temporal evolution of the skyrmion trajectory using read-out at just one position of the reservoir, which allows for scaling onto the nanometer scale. We find that our hardware solution exhibits competitive performance compared with a state-of-the-art energy-intensive software-based neural network. The key advantage of our hardware approach lies in its capacity to seamlessly integrate data from sensors without the need for temporal conversion, thanks to the time-dependent input and tunable intrinsic timescales of the skyrmion dynamics in the reservoir. This feature enables real-time feeding of the reservoir, opening a multitude of applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a phenomenological magneto-structural model based on competing free-energy terms that couple either polar or chiral distortions in cubic quadruple perovskites, depending on the global direction of magnetic moments. The model naturally explains why some compounds in this material system host magnetically-induced ferroelectricity at low temperature, while others such as CaMn$_3$(Cr$_3$Mn)O$_{12}$, which we characterise experimentally, do not. Importantly, our results suggest a new approach towards developing an applied multiferroic functionality, and can be generalised to other multi-sublattice systems where the magnetic interaction between sublattices is prohibited by spatial inversion.</description>

      <title>Enhancing thermoelectric performance of 2D Janus ISbTe by strain engineering: A first principle study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in the 2D materials laid emphasis on finding the materials with robust properties for variety of applications including the energy harvesting. The recent discovery of Janus monolayers with broken symmetry has opened up new options for engineering the properties of 2D layered materials. Present study focuses on enhancing thermoelectric properties of 2H-ISbTe 2D Janus monolayer. All the calculations have been performed using fully relaxed unit cell and employing the pseudo potential based quantum espresso code. Calculated structural parameters are in good agreement with previous literature reports. The lattice dynamics calculations predicts this monolayer can withstand a strain of up to 4% beyond which imaginary frequencies appear in the phonon dispersion curves. Computed electronic structure reveals that the monolayer is an indirect wide bandgap material and the bandgap decreases with tensile strain. Furthermore, the computed thermoelectric properties show that the studied monolayer has high Seebeck coefficient of ~ 300 {\mu}V/K and low thermal conductivity which yields reasonably high ZT of ~ 1.31 for a strain of 2% at 300 K with p-type doping. Therefore, our study signifies the fact that tensile strain and p-type doping of 2D Janus monolayer ISbTe can enhance ZT from 0.87 to 1.31 at room temperature which makes it a promising candidate for thermoelectric applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phosphorene and its components are highly reactive to oxygen when exposed to ambient conditions due to the presence of lone pairs of electrons on phosphorus atoms. Functionalization serves as a solution to prevent the chemical degradation of these materials. In this study, we investigate the impact of a rather strong covalent or non-covalent functionalization of phosphorene (monolayer Black Phosphorus (BP)), few-layer BP, and bulk BP. We use an effective tight-binding Hamiltonian that corresponds to one orbital per site, for which covalent functionalization is simulated by atomic vacancies, and non-covalent functionalization is simulated by Anderson disorder. We show that these two types of functionalisation act differently on the electronic structure and quantum diffusion, in particular on gap and mobility gap for a high degree of functionalisation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic (AFM) skyrmions have emerged as a highly promising avenue in the realm of spintronics, particularly for the development of advanced racetrack memory devices. A distinguishing feature of AFM skyrmions is their zero topological charge and hence anticipated zero skyrmion Hall effect (SkHE). Here, we unveil that the latter is surprisingly finite under the influence of spin-transfer torque, depending on the direction of the injected current impinging on intrinsic AFM skyrmions emerging in CrPdFe trilayer on Ir(111) surface. Hinging on first-principles combined with atomistic spin dynamics simulations, we identify the origin of the SkHE and uncover that FM skyrmions in the underlying Fe layer act as effective traps for AFM skyrmions, confining them and reducing their velocity. These findings hold significant promise for spintronic applications, the design of multi-purpose skyrmion-tracks, advancing our understanding of AFM-FM skyrmion interactions and hybrid soliton dynamics in heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Probing switchable valley-related Hall effects in 2D magnetic MXenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for two-dimensional materials with exotic valley-dependent properties has attracted rapid attention as they are fundamentally intriguing and practically appealing for nanoscale device applications. Here, using first-principles calculations, we report the identification of promising intrinsic valley-related switchable Hall effects in Cr2CSF. With a high out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy, Cr2CSF is a ferrovalley semiconductor with spontaneously polarized valleys having a valley polarization of 27.1 meV in the conduction band. This facilitates the observation of an intrinsic anomalous valley Hall (AVH) effect that is manipulated under an in-plane electric field. The underlying physics of spontaneous valley polarization is also discussed based on the SOC Hamiltonian model. Furthermore, on application of unidirectional compressive strain, Cr2CSF is further transitioned from the AVH phase to a long-sought quasi-half valley metal state. Here, only the electrons are valley polarized such that holes and electrons carriers are separated under the in-plane electric field. Our work enriches materials with the valley-related Hall effects and provides a platform for interplay among valleytronics and spintronics.</description>

Radio-frequency (RF) induction enables heating capabilities up to 2000{\deg}C, with controlled heating ramp rates achievable up to 200{\deg}C/s. Details of critical design aspects and temperature characteristics of the GrapE system are discussed. The GrapE system, being automated, has enabled the growth of high-quality EG monolayers and turbostratic EG on SiC using diverse methodologies such as close confinement sublimation (CCS), open configuration, polymer-assisted CCS, and rapid thermal annealing. This showcases the versatility of the GrapE system in EG growth. Comprehensive characterizations involving atomic force microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and low-energy electron diffraction techniques were employed to validate the quality of the produced EG.</description>

      <title>A First-Principles Tool to Discover New Pyrometallurgical Refining Options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the opportunities of first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations for the development of new metallurgical refining processes. As such, a methodology based on DFT calculations is developed to discover new pyrometallurgical refining processes that use the addition of a third element to remove an impurity from a molten host material. As a case study, this methodology is applied to the refining of lead. The proposed method predicts the existing refining routes as well as alternative processes. The most interesting candidate for the removal of arsenic from lead is experimentally verified, which confirms the suitability of the remover element. The method is therefore considered as a useful approach to speed up the discovery of new pyrometallurgical refining processes, as it provides an ordered set of interesting candidate remover elements</description>

      <title>Does mixed grain boundary follow the principles of superposition?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the major challenges towards understanding and further utilizing the properties and functional behaviors of grain boundaries (GB) is the complexity of general GBs with mixed tilt and twist character. Here, we demonstrated that the structures and stress fields of mostly mixed GBs could be considered as the superposition of their tilt and twist GB components by computationally examining 26.8 million large-scale structures of 4964 unique silicon mixed GB characters. The results indicate that low angle mixed GB is formed by the dislocation interactions between its decomposed tilt and twist components, while various complex sub-structures with dislocation stress but without conventional dislocation core structures are discovered on twin and structural unit GBs. A universal Read-Shockley model that physically captures the energy trends of the mixed GB is proposed, and its superiority, universality and transferability are proven in a variety of GB structures across different lattices. We confirm the validity of this work by comparing the results with experimental observations and first-principles calculations. Earlier works should now be reassessed in the light of these findings.</description>

      <title>Half-Metallic Ferromagnetic Weyl Fermions Related to Dynamic Correlations in the Zinc-blende Compound VAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The realization of 100\% polarized topological Weyl fermions in half-metallic ferromagnets is of particular importance for fundamental research and spintronic applications. Here, we theoretically investigate the electronic and topological properties of the zinc-blende compound VAs, which was deemed as a half-metallic ferromagnet related to dynamic correlations. Based on the combination of density functional theory and dynamical mean field theory, we uncover that the half-metallic ferromagnet VAs exhibit attractive Weyl semimetallic behaviors with twelve pairs of Weyl points, which are very close to the Fermi level. Meanwhile, we also investigate the magnetization-dependent topological properties; the results show that the change of magnetization directions only slightly affects the positions of Weyl points, which is attributed to the weak spin-orbital coupling effects. The topological surface states of VAs projected on semi-infinite (001) and (111) surfaces are investigated. The Fermi arcs of all Weyl points are clearly visible on the projected Fermi surfaces. Our findings suggest that VAs is a fully spin-polarized Weyl semimetal with many-body correlated effects for spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Interplay between alloying and tramp element effects on temper embrittlement in bcc iron: DFT and thermodynamic insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The details of the temper embrittlement mechanism in steels caused by impurities are unknown. Especially from an atomistic point of view, there are still open questions regarding their interactions with alloying elements such as Ni, Cr, and Mo. Therefore, we used density functional theory to investigate the segregation and co-segregation behavior and the resulting influence on the cohesion of three representative tilt grain boundaries in iron. The results are implemented in a multi-site and multi-component kinetic and thermodynamic model for grain boundary segregation, to gain insights into the temporal and final grain boundary coverage. Our results show that the segregation tendency of As, Sb, and Sn is stronger than that of the alloying elements and significantly mitigates the grain boundary cohesion. Depending on the GB type, interactions between Sb and Sn vary from negligible to strongly attractive, which increases the likelihood of co-segregation. The cohesion-weakening effect is further amplified when elements such as Sb, Sn, and As co-segregate, compared to their individual segregation. In contrast, the co-segregation of Ni and Cr does not significantly increase the enrichment of impurities at grain boundaries, and their impact on cohesion is found to be negligible. The ability of Mo to mitigate reversible temper embrittlement is primarily attributed to its cohesion-enhancing effect and its capability to repel tramp elements from GBs, rather than scavenging them within the bulk, as suggested by previous literature.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy of strain and crystal deformations of partially relaxed InGaN layers grown on misoriented (0001)-GaN substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strain relaxation of thick InGaN layers was studied in order to develop technology of InGaN templates for deposition of InGaN Quantum Wells (QWs) and InGaN layers of high-In-content. In this paper, we show that InGaN layers grown on misoriented (0001)-GaN substrates relax by preferential activation of certain glide planes for misfit dislocation formation. Substrate misorientation changes resolved shear stresses, affecting the distribution of misfit dislocations within each dislocation set. We demonstrate that this mechanism leads to an anisotropic strain as well as a tilt of the InGaN layer with respect to the GaN substrate. It appears that these phenomena are more pronounced in structures grown on substrates misoriented toward &lt;11-20&gt; direction than corresponding structures with &lt;-1100&gt; misorientation. These features would influence the properties of the overgrown InGaN QWs and should be taken into consideration during designing structures grown on relaxed InGaN templates. We reveal that the lattice of partially relaxed InGaN has a triclinic deformation, thus requiring advanced XRD analysis. The presentation of just a single asymmetric reciprocal space map commonly practiced in the literature can lead to misleading information regarding the relaxation state of partially relaxed wurtzite structures.</description>

      <title>nimCSO: A Nim package for Compositional Space Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: nimCSO is a high-performance tool implementing several methods for selecting components (data dimensions) in compositional datasets, which optimize the data availability and density for applications such as machine learning. Making said choice is a combinatorically hard problem for complex compositions existing in highly dimensional spaces due to the interdependency of components being present. Such spaces are encountered, for instance, in materials science, where datasets on Compositionally Complex Materials (CCMs) often span 20-45 chemical elements, 5-10 processing types, and several temperature regimes, for up to 60 total data dimensions.
  At its core, nimCSO leverages the metaprogramming ability of the Nim language (nim-lang.org) to optimize itself at the compile time, both in terms of speed and memory handling, to the specific problem statement and dataset at hand based on a human-readable configuration file. As demonstrated in this paper, nimCSO reaches the physical limits of the hardware (L1 cache latency) and can outperform an efficient native Python implementation over 400 times in terms of speed and 50 times in terms of memory usage (not counting interpreter), while also outperforming NumPy implementation 35 and 17 times, respectively, when checking a candidate solution.
  It is designed to be both (1) a user-ready tool, implementing two efficient brute-force approaches (for handling up to 25 dimensions), a custom search algorithm (for up to 40 dimensions), and a genetic algorithm (for any dimensionality), and (2) a scaffold for building even more elaborate methods in the future, including heuristics going beyond data availability. All configuration is done with a simple human-readable YAML config file and plain text data files, making it easy to modify the search method and its parameters with no knowledge of programming and only basic command line skills.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fabrication of tissue engineering scaffolds with tailored physicochemical and biological characteristics is a relevant task in biomedical engineering. The present work was focused at the evaluation of the effect of fabrication approach (single-channel or multi-channel electrospinning) on the properties of the fabricated poly(lactic acid)(PLA)/poly(epsilon-caprolactone)(PCL) scaffolds with various polymer mass ratios (1/0, 2/1, 1/1, 1/2, and 0/1). The scaffolds with same morphology (regardless of electrospinning variant) were fabricated and characterized using SEM, water contact angle measurement, FTIR, XRD, tensile testing and in vitro experiment with multipotent mesenchymal stem cells. It was demonstrated, that multi-channel electrospinning prevents intermolecular interactions between the polymer components of the scaffold, preserving their crystal structure, what affects the mechanical characteristics of the scaffold (particularly, leads to 2-fold difference in elongation). Better adhesion of multipotent mesenchymal stem cells on the surface of the scaffolds fabricated using multichannel electrospinning was demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Quantitatively Connecting Experimental Time-Temperature-Superposition-Breakdown of Polymers near the Glass Transition to Dynamic Heterogeneity via the Heterogeneous Rouse Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polymers near the glass transition temperature Tg often exhibit a breakdown of time-temperature-superposition (TTS), with chain relaxation times and viscosity exhibiting a weaker temperature dependence than segmental relaxation times. The origin of this onset of thermorheological complexity has remained unsettled and a matter of debate. Here we extend the Heterogeneous Rouse Model (HRM), which generalizes the Rouse model to account for dynamic heterogeneity, to make predictions for the relaxation modulus G(t) and complex modulus G*($\omega$) of unentangled polymers near Tg. The HRM predicts that G(t) and G*($\omega$) exhibit enhanced effective scaling exponents in the Rouse regime in the presence of dynamic heterogeneity, with a more rapid decay from the glassy plateau emerging as the system becomes more dynamically heterogeneous on cooling. This behavior is predicted to emerge from a strand-length dependence of the moment of the segmental mobility distribution probed by chain dynamics. We show that the HRM predictions are in good accord with experimental complex modulus data for polystyrene, poly(methyl methacrylate), and poly(2-vinyl pyridine). The HRM also predicts the onset of distinct temperature dependences among chain scale quantities such as terminal relaxation time and viscosity in our experimental systems, apparently resolving one of the most significant standing objections to a heterogeneity-based origin of TTS-breakdown. The HRM thus provides a generalized theory of the chain-scale linear rheological response of unentangled polymers near Tg, accounting for the origin of TTS-breakdown at a molecular mechanistic level. It also points towards a new strategy of inferring the dynamic heterogeneity of glass-forming polymeric systems based on the temperature-evolution of modified scaling in the Rouse regime.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the physics of the spin-orbit coupling at the surface of a model topological insulator: from theory to experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-orbit interaction affects the band structure of topological insulators beyond the opening of an inverted gap in the bulk bands, and the understanding of its effects on the surface states is of primary importance to access the underlying physics of these exotic states. Here, we propose an $\textit{ab initio}$ approach benchmarked by pump-probe angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy data to model the effect of spin-orbit coupling on the surface states of a topological insulator. The critical novelty of our approach lies in the possibility of accounting for a partial transfer of the spin-orbit coupling to the surface states, mediated by the hybridization with the surface resonance states. In topological insulators, the fraction of transferred spin-orbit coupling influences the strength of the hexagonal warping of the surface states, which we use as a telltale of the capability of our model to reproduce the experimental dispersion. The comparison between calculations and measurements, of both the unoccupied and part of the occupied Dirac cone, indicates that the fraction of spin-orbit coupling transferred to the surface states by hybridization with the resonance states is between 70% and 85% of its full atomic value. This offers a valuable insight to improve the modeling of surface state properties in topological insulators for both scientific purposes and technological applications.</description>

Abstract: We use a unique combination of electrochemical techniques to elucidate the dependency of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and absorption on pH and overpotential for iron and nickel. Impedance spectroscopy shows the dominance of the Volmer-Heyrovsky reaction pathway, challenging the common consideration of Volmer-Tafel dominance. Polarization slopes agree with the Volmer or Heyrovsky rate-determining step, with limitations at high overpotential. The evolution of steady-state permeation current density with overpotential is rationalised through newly-developed theory. Surface activity and absorption trends are captured. Combined with modelling, this work provides a path for quantifying hydrogen uptake and establishing an equivalent fugacity for aqueous electrolytes.</description>

      <title>Organic solvent boosts charge storage and charging dynamics of conductive MOF supercapacitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conductive metal-organic frameworks (c-MOFs) and ionic liquids (ILs) have emerged as auspicious combinations for high-performance supercapacitors. However, the nanoconfinement from c-MOFs and high viscosity of ILs slow down the charging process. This hindrance can, however, be resolved by adding solvent. Here, we performed constant-potential molecular simulations to scrutinize the solvent impact on charge storage and charging dynamics of MOF-IL-based supercapacitors. We find conditions for &gt;100% enhancement in capacity and ~6 times increase in charging speed. These improvements were confirmed by synthesizing near-ideal c-MOFs and developing multiscale models linking molecular simulations to electrochemical measurements. Fundamentally, our findings elucidate that the solvent acts as an ionophobic agent to induce a substantial enhancement in charge storage, and as an ion traffic police to eliminate convoluted counterion and co-ion motion paths and create two distinct ion transport highways to accelerate charging dynamics. This work paves the way for the optimal design of MOF supercapacitors.</description>

      <title>The generalised Mooney space for modelling the response of rubber-like materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soft materials such as rubbers, silicones, gels and biological tissues have a nonlinear response to large deformations, a phenomenon which in principle can be captured by hyperelastic models. The suitability of a candidate hyperelastic strain energy function is then determined by comparing its predicted response to the data gleaned from tests and adjusting the material parameters to get a good fit, an exercise which can be deceptive because of nonlinearity. Here we propose to generalise the approach of Rivlin and Saunders [Phil Trans A 243 (1951) 251-288] who, instead of reporting the data as stress against stretch, manipulated these measures to create the 'Mooney plot', where the Mooney-Rivlin model is expected to produce a linear fit. We show that extending this idea to other models and modes of deformation (tension, shear, torsion, etc.) is advantageous, not only (a) for the fitting procedure, but also to (b) delineate trends in the deformation which are not obvious from the raw data (and may be interpreted in terms of micro-, meso-, and macro-structures) and (c) obtain a bounded condition number \k{appa} over the whole range of deformation; a robustness which is lacking in other plots and spaces.</description>

      <title>A peridynamic investigation of particle oxidation, size and material during cold-spray</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cold spray technology, distinguished by its unique ability to deposit particles in a solid state, offers unparalleled potential for applications such as coating, repair, and additive manufacturing. In this research, we employed a peridynamic modeling approach to systematically analyze the effects of key powder features on deposit properties. Notably, our model incorporates the explicit modeling of nanometer-sized oxide layers, providing a more accurate representation of real-world conditions. We assessed the influence of parameters such as particle size, oxidation conditions, and material type on crucial deposition indicators like critical velocity and compression ratio. Our results demonstrated excellent agreement with reported experimental data, affirming the effectiveness of the proposed numerical framework. Specifically, our findings highlighted that, for a given impact velocity, smaller particles, thicker oxide layers, and harder materials contribute to limited oxide removal and a decreased likelihood of successful adhesion. Additionally, we present a predictive framework that establishes a correlation between particle size and critical velocity, providing valuable insights for optimizing cold spray deposition parameters. This innovative approach not only enhances our understanding of the intricate interplay between powder features and deposit properties but also paves the way for a more efficient and cost-effective optimization process in cold spray applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum Stabilization and Flat Hydrogen-based Bands of Nitrogen-doped Lutetium Hydride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A plausible candidate for near-ambient superconductivity in the Lu-H-N system, Fm$\overline{3}$m Lu$_8$H$_{23}$N, is found to be harmonically unstable up to 20 GPa, but is anharmonically stabilized at near-ambient pressures when including quantum corrections. The presence of flat bands near E$_F$ is understood to come from quantum interference caused by the nitrogen, creating a nearly flat hydrogen band at E$_F$ with huge effective mass, meaning non-adiabatic corrections are expected to be anomalously large. The superconducting T$_c$ of Fm$\overline{3}$m Lu$_8$H$_{23}$N is estimated to be high by comparison to related compounds and flat band models. The resiliency to defects and pressure dependence of the flat bands is examined. The results here imply this structure is metastable yet flexible enough to synthesize and has electronic properties that can explain the reported near-ambient superconductivity in Lu-H-N.</description>

      <title>Noncentrosymmetric Nowotny Chimney Ladder Ferromagnet Cr4Ge7 with a High Curie Temperature of ~ 207 K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noncentrosymmetric magnets usually host intriguing magnetic interactions inherent the crystal structure with broken inversion symmetry, which can give rise to rich magnetic behaviors. We report herein the high-pressure synthesis, crystal structure, magnetizations and magnetic structure of a so-called Nowotny chimney ladder compound Cr4Ge7. Our analysis on the powder neutron diffraction data revises the crystal structure as a noncentrosymmetric space group (P-4c2, No.116). It exhibits two magnetic orders within the temperature range of 2 - 400 K. The first order at ~ 207 K associated with a small magnetic moment of ~ 0.75 miuB is assigned to a commensurate ferromagnetic structure with a propagation vector k = (0, 0, 0). The weak itinerant ferromagnet nature should be caused by the complex Cr spin orders from different Wyckoff positions. The second order at ~ 18 K is assumed to arise from a competition between the Dzyaloshinskii-Moria and Heisenberg interactions. The results provide an excellent platform for study on intricate interactions between various magnetic exchanges as well as for the exploration of high temperature exotic magnetic properties which host potential applications in next-generation spintronics.</description>

      <title>\textit{Ab initio} calculations of photocurrent in solids based on Wannier function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general \textit{ab initio} method based on Wannier function for simulating the photocurrent in solids. The method is widely applicable to charge/spin DC and AC photocurrent at any perturbation levels in both semiconductors and metals for both linearly and circularly polarized light. This is because the method is theoretically complete (within relaxation time approximation), that is to say, it includes all intra-band, inter-band and their cross terms. Specifically for the second-order DC photocurrent, it includes all of the following contributions - shift current, (magnetic) injection current, Berry curvature dipole, gyration current and Fermi surface ones, instead of only a part of them as in most previous \textit{ab initio} methods. It is also free from the degeneracy issue, i.e., applicable to arbitrary band structures with arbitrary numbers of degenerate bands. We apply the method to various semiconductors and metals, including GaAs, graphene-hBN heterostructure, monolayer WS$_{2}$, a 2D ferroelectric material - monolayer GeS, bilayer anti-ferromagnetic MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ and topological Weyl semimetal RhSi to simulate their charge and/or spin, DC and/or AC photocurrent. Our theoretical results are in good agreement with previous theoretical works. Our method provides a universal computational tool for reliable and accurate predictions of abundant weak-field photocurrent phenomena in disparate materials.</description>

      <title>Defect-Induced Strain-Tunable Photoluminescence in AgScP$_2$S$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metal thiophosphates (MTPs) are a large family of 2D materials that exhibit large structural and chemical diversity. They also show promise for applications in energy harvesting and photodetection. Strain and defect engineering have previously been demonstrated as useful mechanisms to tune several properties of MTPs such as resistivity, magnetic state, and electronic band gap. However, the effect of these stimuli on engineering tunable light emission in MTPs remains unexplored. Here, we show experimentally that structural defects in metal thiophosphate AgScP$_2$S$_6$ are prominent in exhibiting photoluminescence, which is likely driven by the defect-state-to-conduction-band transitions and can be further tuned by temperature-induced strain gradients.</description>

      <title>Magnonic $\varphi$ Josephson Junctions and Synchronized Precession</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been a growing interest in non-Hermitian physics. One of its main goals is to engineer dissipation and to explore ensuing functionality. In magnonics, the effect of dissipation due to local damping on magnon transport has been explored. However, the effects of non-local damping on the magnonic analog of the Josephson effect remain missing, despite that non-local damping is inevitable and has been playing a central role in magnonics. Here, we uncover theoretically that a surprisingly rich dynamics can emerge in magnetic junctions due to intrinsic non-local damping, using analytical and numerical methods. In particular, under microwave pumping, we show that coherent spin precession in the right and left insulating ferromagnet (FM) of the junction becomes synchronized by non-local damping and thereby a magnonic analog of the $\varphi$ Josephson junction emerges, where $\varphi$ stands here for the relative precession phase of right and left FM in the stationary limit. Remarkably, $\varphi$ decreases monotonically from $ \pi$ to $\pi/2$ as the magnon-magnon interaction, arising from spin anisotropies, increases. Moreover, we also find a magnonic diode effect giving rise to rectification of magnon currents. Our predictions are readily testable with current device and measurement technologies at room temperatures.</description>

      <title>Crystal Structure and Magnetism of Actinide Oxides: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In actinide systems, the 5f electrons experience a uniquely delicate balance of effects and interactions having similar energy scales, which are often difficult to properly disentangle. This interplay of factors such as the dual nature of 5f-states, strong electronic correlations, and strong spin-orbit coupling results in electronically unusual and intriguing behavior such as multi-k antiferromagnetic ordering, multipolar ordering, mott-physics, mixed valence configurations, and more. Despite the inherent allure of their exotic properties, the exploratory science of even the more basic, binary systems like the actinide oxides has been limited due to their toxicity, radioactivity, and reactivity. In this article, we provide an overview of the available synthesis techniques for selected binary actinide oxides, including the actinide dioxides, sesquioxides, and a selection of higher oxides. For these oxides, we also review and evaluate the current state of knowledge of their crystal structures and magnetic properties. In many aspects, substantial knowledge gaps exist in the current body of research on actinide oxides related to understanding their electronic ground states. Bridging these gaps is vital for improving not only a fundamental understanding of these systems but also of future nuclear technologies. To this end, we note the experimental techniques and necessary future investigations which may aid in better elucidating the nature of these fascinating systems.</description>

      <title>Self-limiting stacks of curvature-frustrated colloidal plates: Roles of intra-particle versus inter-particle deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In geometrically frustrated assemblies local inter-subunit misfits propagate to intra-assembly strain gradients, giving rise to anomalous self-limiting assembly thermodynamics. Here, we use theory and coarse-grained simulation to study a recently developed class of ``curvamer'' particles, flexible shell-like particles that exhibit self-limiting assembly due to the build up of curvature deformation in cohesive stacks. To address a generic, yet poorly understood aspect of frustrated assembly, we introduce a model of curvamer assembly that incorporates both {\it intra-particle} shape deformation as well as compliance of {\it inter-particle} cohesive gaps, an effect we can attribute to a {\it finite range of attraction} between particles. We show that the ratio of intra-particle (bending elasticity) to inter-particle stiffness not only controls the regimes of self-limitation but also the nature of frustration propagation through curvamer stacks. We find a transition from uniformly-bound, curvature-focusing stacks at small size to gap-opened, uniformly curved stacks at large size is controlled by a dimensionless measure of inter- versus intra-curvamer stiffness. The finite range of inter-particle attraction determines range of cohesion in stacks are self-limiting, a prediction which is in strong agreement with numerical studies of our coarse-grained colloidal model. These predictions provide critical guidance for experimental realizations of frustrated particle systems designed to exhibit self-limitation at especially large multi-particle scales.</description>

      <title>Designing Quaternary Hydrides with Potential High T$_c$ Superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose three parent structures for designing quaternary hydrides of increasing complexity to optimize parameters correlated with high T$_c$ superconductivity. The first is a simple Pm$\overline{3}$m cell inspired by the FCC RH$_3$ structures (R = trivalent rare earths), which we show has moderately promising potential for high T$_c$ compounds. The second is an Fm$\overline{3}$m heterostructure inspired by our work on Lu$_8$H$_{23}$N that consistently produces metallic hydrogen sublattices, whose quantum interference with Lewis bases is designed to high DOS$_H$(E$_F$). Several examples are put forward that first-principles calculations confirm have hydrogen-dominant metal character, as well as strong network connectivity as measured with the Electron Localization Function (ELF). The third quaternary model structure allows for a more precise description of doping as well as symmetry breaking of octahedral hydrogen which improves the hydrogen network connectivity. These model structures/formulae predict compounds with high predicted T$_c$ and have enough flexibility to optimize for both T$_c$ and stability at low pressures.</description>

      <title>Molecular intercalation in the van der Waals antiferromagnets FePS3 and NiPS3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have performed electrochemical treatment of the van der Waals antiferromagnetic materials FePS$_3$ and NiPS$_3$ with the ionic liquid EMIM-BF$_4$, achieving significant molecular intercalation. Mass analysis of the intercalated compounds, EMIM$_x$-FePS$_3$ and EMIM$_x$-NiPS$_3$, indicated respective intercalation levels, $x$, of approximately 27\% and 37\%, and X-ray diffraction measurements demonstrated a massive (over 50\%) enhancement of the $c$-axis lattice parameters. To investigate the consequences of these changes for the magnetic properties, we performed magnetic susceptibility and $^{31}$P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies of both systems. For EMIM$_x$-FePS$_3$, intercalation reduces the magnetic ordering temperature from $T_N = 120$~K to 78~K, and we find a spin gap in the antiferromagnetic phase that drops from 45~K to 30~K. For EMIM$_x$-NiPS$_3$, the ordering temperature is almost unaffected (changing from 148~K to 145~K), but a change towards nearly isotropic spin fluctuations suggests an alteration of the magnetic Hamiltonian. Such relatively modest changes, given that the huge extension of the $c$ axes is expected to cause a very strong suppression any interlayer interactions, point unequivocally to the conclusion that the magnetic properties of both parent compounds are determined solely by two-dimensional (2D), intralayer physics. The changes in transition temperatures and low-temperature spin dynamics in both compounds therefore indicate that intercalation also results in a significant modulation of the intralayer magnetic interactions, which we propose is due to charge doping and localization on the P sites. Our study offers chemical intercalation with ionic liquids as an effective method to control not only the interlayer but also the intralayer interactions in quasi-2D magnetic materials.</description>

This approach improves generalization performance and has the advantage of simultaneously determining the best feature combinations for each of several groups. We can deepen the interpretation and understanding of the model from the similarities and differences in the features selected in each group.</description>

      <title>Vortex formation in pure-Sn islands in field-cooled Sn-Pb solders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Formation of vortices is a typical phenomenon in type-II superconductors under a magnetic field (H). In contrast, type-I superconductors do not host the vortices because of their Meissner state, and the vortices have rarely observed in the intermediate states of type-I superconductors and Pb at extremely low temperature (T) under H. Here, we show the thermodynamic evidences of vortex formation in pure-Sn islands in the field-cooled Sn-Pb solders, where Sn and Pb are well phase-separated. Noticeably, the vortex states appear even after demagnetization (H = 0 Oe). We analyze specific heat data of the Sn10-Pb90, Sn20-Pb80, Sn70-Pb30, and Sn90-Pb10 solder samples after field cooling at H greater than the critical filed, and the measurements are performed at various H. Although the Pb regions exhibit conventional H-T phase diagrams for all the samples, the Sn regions of the most samples exhibit the robustness of superconductivity to H, which is similar to the anomalous H-T trend recently observed in Sn45-Pb55. We show that the specific heat jump at the superconducting transition of the Sn regions is clearly enhanced with decreasing the Sn amount, and the increase in the jump magnitude correlates with the amount of the magnetic fields trapped after field cooling but not with the Sn amount. Furthermore, the jump magnitude is several times larger than the value expected from a conventional superconducting transition (electron entropy change). The large specific heat jump and the enhancement of the jump magnitude by the increase in trapped magnetic field indicate that the Sn regions exhibit bulk vortex states with an obvious entropy change (emergence of new degree of freedom) when the solders are initially field-cooled.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hedgehog and antihedgehog spin textures in magnets behave as emergent monopoles and antimonopoles, which give rise to astonishing transport and electromagnetic phenomena. Using the Kondo-lattice model in three dimensions, we theoretically study collective spin-wave excitation modes of magnetic hedgehog lattices which have recently been discovered in itinerant magnets such as MnSi$_{1-x}$Ge$_{x}$ and SrFeO$_3$. It is revealed that the spin-wave modes, which appear in the sub-terahertz regime, have dominant amplitudes localized at Dirac strings connecting hedgehog-antihedgehog pairs and are characterized by their translational oscillations. It is found that their spectral features sensitively depend on the number and configuration of the Dirac strings and, thus, can be exploited for identifying the topological phase transitions associated with the monopole-antimonopole pair annihilations.</description>

      <title>Twisted hyperbolic van der Waals crystals for full Stokes mid-infrared polarization detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Investigating the polarization properties of light in the mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectrum is crucial for molecular sensing, biomedical diagnostics, and IR imaging system technologies. Traditional methods, limited by bulky size and intricate fabrication, utilize large rotating optics for full Stokes polarization detection, impeding miniaturization and accuracy. Van der Waals materials (vdW) based devices can address these challenges due to their lithography-free fabrication, ease of integration with chip-scale platforms and room-temperature operation. This study introduces a chip-integrated polarimeter device leveraging the in-plane biaxial hyperbolic vdW crystal properties for mid-infrared light manipulation. The spatial division measurement scheme incorporates six meticulously designed linear and circular polarization filters, achieving high extinction ratios exceeding 30 dB and transmittance surpassing 50%, with fabrication tolerance of film thickness up to 100 nm. The proposed device represents a significant advancement in polarimetric detection, providing a compact, cost-effective solution and opens new avenues for on-chip mid-IR polarimetric detection in next-generation ultra-compact optical systems.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen is not necessary for superconductivity in topotactically reduced nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key open question in the study of layered superconducting nickelate films is the role that hydrogen incorporation into the lattice plays in the appearance of the superconducting state. Due to the challenges of stabilizing highly crystalline square planar nickelate films, films are prepared by the deposition of a more stable parent compound which is then transformed into the target phase via a topotactic reaction with a strongly reducing agent such as CaH$_2$. Recent studies, both experimental and theoretical, have introduced the possibility that the incorporation of hydrogen from the reducing agent into the nickelate lattice may be critical for the superconductivity. In this work, we use secondary ion mass spectrometry to examine superconducting La$_{1-x}$X$_x$NiO$_2$ / SrTiO$_3$ (X = Ca and Sr) and Nd$_6$Ni$_5$O$_{12}$ / NdGaO$_3$ films, along with non-superconducting NdNiO$_2$ / SrTiO$_3$ and (Nd,Sr)NiO$_2$ / SrTiO$_3$. We find no evidence for extensive hydrogen incorporation across a broad range of samples, including both superconducting and non-superconducting films. Theoretical calculations indicate that hydrogen incorporation is broadly energetically unfavorable in these systems, supporting our conclusion that hydrogen incorporation is not generally required to achieve a superconducting state in layered square-planar nickelates.</description>

Abstract: The phase diagram of VO2 strained or doped with several trivalent ions consists of four phases; in order of increasing temperatures, three (M1, T and M2) are insulating while the fourth (R), above ~340 K, is metallic. These phases and the three phase transitions have been thoroughly investigated for about half a century by a wide variety of techniques, including electronic transport. While an upwards jump of the resistance of up to a factor of 2 was observed at the T-M2 transition and a drop of several orders of magnitude was observed at the M2-R one, resistive switching at the M1-T transition remained elusive over all these years. Here we report on the investigation of Ga- and Al-doped VO2 single crystals, following the rather surprising appearance of a small and steep drop of a factor of ~ 0.12 in the resistance of Ga-doped VO2 single crystals detected by pulsed and DC I-V measurements carried out at room temperature, below the T-M2 phase transition. Similar results were obtained also from measurements on Al-doped VO2 single crystals. Raman spectra of Ga-, and Al-doped crystals resolved their structures as function of temperature. The accumulated results of the measurements on Ga-, and Al-doped single crystals provide evidence for identifying the resistive switching at T(RS)&lt;T(T-M2) with the M1-T transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heterostructures composed of 2-dimensional (2D) materials are spatially dope in-operando to modify devices for custom functionalities, such as lateral p-n-p junctions. After optically photodoping an hBN/Graphene/hBN heterostructure, detailed magnetotransport measurements including quantum Hall transport show several clear electronic regimes. In the p+-p-p+ and n-n+-n configurations, we see clear quantization of the longitudinal resistance. Using the Landauer-Buttiker model we elucidate the nature of the electrostatic profile at the interface between the doped regions. In the p-n-p configuration, due to the heavily graded junction profile that completely separates the p- and n-Landau level edge states from interacting, an "insulating" state is observed that is not common and has not been measured in previous quantum Hall transport measurements of graphene pnJ devices in high magnetic fields. This insulating state is promising as the basis for a high-performance graphene switching device with a good ON/OFF ratio. In principle, these doping and measurement techniques can be applied to any other 2D heterostructure encapsulated within an hBN sandwich to understand the quality of the electrostatic interface between doped regions.</description>

      <title>Double magnetic transitions, complex field induce phases, and large magnetocaloric effect in the frustrated garnet compound Mn$_{3}$Cr$_{2}$Ge$_{3}$O$_{12}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A detailed study of the structural and magnetic properties of a garnet compound Mn$_{3}$Cr$_{2}$Ge$_{3}$O$_{12}$ is carried out using x-ray diffraction, magnetization, heat capacity, and neutron diffraction measurements. This compound manifests two successive magnetic transitions at $T_{\rm N1} \simeq 4.5$ K and $T_{\rm N2} \simeq 2.7$ K. Neutron powder diffraction experiments reveal that these two transitions correspond to the orderings of Cr$^{3+}$ and Mn$^{2+}$ sub-lattices, respectively. The ordering at $T_{\rm N1}$ is found to be collinear antiferromagnetic type while the one at $T_{\rm N2}$ is of non-collinear antiferromagnetic type. There appears to be several interactions, both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic, between two sub-lattices yielding a three-dimensional frustrated pyrochlore geometry. The $H-T$ phase diagram is quite complex and displays multiple phases under magnetic field which can be attributed to the frustrated nature of the spin-lattice. Moreover, it shows a large magnetocaloric effect at low temperatures with a maximum value of isothermal entropy change $\Delta S_{\rm m} \simeq -23$ J/kg-K and adiabatic temperature change $\Delta T_{\rm ad} \simeq 9$ K for a field change of 7~T. Further, a large value of relative cooling power ($RCP \simeq 360$ J/kg) reflects the usefulness of the compound in magnetic refrigeration purpose.</description>

      <title>Strain-induced valley transport in CrBr$_3$/WSe$_2$/CrBr$_3$ van der Waals heterostructure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two dimensional magnetic materials are at the forefront of the next generation of spintronic devices. The possibility to interface them with other van der Waals materials such as transition metal dichalcogenides has opened new possibilities for the observation of new and exiting physical phenomena. Here, we present a proof-of-concept valleytronic device based on CrBr$_3$-encapsulated WSe$_2$ showing an unprecedented valley splitting of $\sim 100$ meV under compressive strain of the WSe$_2$, able to be tuned by the relative magnetization of the encapsulating layers. Multiscale transport simulations performed on this device show a spin-valley current with a polarization higher than 80$\%$ than is maintained in a range of $\sim$ 0.3 V gate voltage in a field-effect transistor configuration. The impact of the stacking configuration on the valley splitting is also evaluated.</description>

      <title>Graphene conductivity: Kubo model versus QFT-based model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compare three available models of graphene conductivity: a non-local Kubo model, a local model derived by Fialkovsky, and finally a non-local Quantum Field Theory based (QFT-b) model. The first two models are extensively used in the nanophotonic community. All these models are not ab-initio since they contain phenomenological parameters (like chemical potential and/or mass gap parameters), and are supposed to provide coherent results since they are derived from the same starting Hamiltonian. While we confirm that the local model is a proper limit of the non-local Kubo model, we find some inconsistencies in the QFT-b model as derived and used in literature. In particular, differently from the Kubo model, the QFT-b model does not satisfy the required Gauge invariance, and as a consequence it shows a plasma-like behavior for the interband transversal conductivity at low frequencies instead of the expected behavior (an almost constant conductivity as a function of frequency $\omega$ with a gap for frequencies $\hbar\omega &lt; \sqrt{(\hbar v_{F}q)^{2} + 4m^{2}}$). The inconsistencies of QFT-b model predictions are due to a non-correct regularization-scheme which allows for the gauge invariance violation. We show how to correctly regularize the QFT-b model in order to satisfy the gauge invariance and, once also losses are correctly included, we show that the Kubo and QFT-b model exactly coincide. Our finding can be of relevant interest for both theory predictions and experimental tests in both the nanophotonic and Casimir effect communities.</description>

Abstract: The interaction between dislocations and precipitates plays an important role in the mechanical behavior of alloys. To provide more insight into the physics of this interaction, this research analyzes short-range interactions of an edge dislocation with an array of equally-spaced identical precipitates. We use a modified dislocation dynamics approach accounting for penetrable and impenetrable precipitates. This research quantifies the effects of precipitate resistance on the geometry of the dislocation-precipitation interaction and the local distribution of plastic strain near a precipitate. The results show that a precipitate with a higher resistance causes an increase in the maximum value of dislocation curvature during the bypass. In addition, a higher level of precipitate resistance leads to a lower level of plastic deformation. Moreover, we observed a high plastic strain gradient at the interface of non-shearable precipitates.</description>

      <title>High-Entropy Enhanced Negative Thermal Expansion Perfomance in Antiperovkites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.19613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The negative thermal expansion (NTE) materials, which can act as thermal-expansion compensators to counteract the positive thermal expansion, have great applications merit in precision engineering. However, the exploration of NTE behavior with a wide temperature range has reached its upper ceiling through traditional doping strategies due to composition limitations. The unique sluggish characteristic in phase transition and extended optimization space in recent high entropy systems has great potential to broaden the temperature range in electronic transitions-induced NTE materials. Mn-based anti-perovskites offer an ideal platform for the exploration of high entropy NTE material due to their abundant element selection and controllable NTE performance. In this paper, the high entropy strategy is first introduced to broaden the NTE temperature range by relaxing the abrupt phase transition in Mn-based anti-perovskite nitride. We propose an empirical screening method to synthesize the high-entropy anti-perovskite (HEAP). it is found that magnetic phase separation from anti-ferromagnetic CII to paramagnetic CI surviving in an ultra-wide temperature range of 5K&lt;=T&lt;=350K (Delta_T=345K), revealing a unique sluggish characteristic. Consequently, a remarkable NTE behavior (up to Delta_T=235K, 5K&lt;=T&lt;=240K) with a coefficient of thermal expansion of -4.7x10-6/K, has been obtained in HEAP. It is worth noting that the temperature range is two/three times wider than that of low-entropy systems. The sluggish characteristic has been further experimentally proved to come from disturbed phase transition dynamics due to distortion in atomic spacing and chemical environmental fluctuation observed by the spherical aberration-corrected electron microscope. Our demonstration provides a unique paradigm for broadening the temperature range of NTE materials induced by phase transition through entropy engineering.</description>

      <title>Dose and compositional dependence of irradiation-induced property change in FeCr</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ferritic/martensitic steels will be used as structural components in next generation nuclear reactors. Their successful operation relies on an understanding of irradiation-induced defect behaviour in the material. In this study, Fe and FeCr alloys (3-12%Cr) were irradiated with 20 MeV Fe-ions at 313 K to doses ranging between 0.00008 dpa to 6.0 dpa. This dose range covers six orders of magnitude, spanning low, transition and high dose regimes. Lattice strain and hardness in the irradiated material were characterised with micro-beam Laue X-ray diffraction and nanoindentation, respectively.
  Irradiation hardening was observed even at very low doses (0.00008 dpa) and showed a monotonic increase with dose up to 6.0 dpa. Lattice strain measurements of samples at 0.0008 dpa allow the calculation of equivalent Frenkel pair densities and corrections to the Norgett-Robinson-Torrens (NRT) model for Fe and FeCr alloys at low dose. NRT efficiency for FeCr is 0.2, which agrees with literature values for high irradiation energy. Lattice strain increases up to 0.8 dpa and then decreases when the damage dose is further increased. The strains measured in this study are lower and peak at a larger dose than predicted by atomistic simulations. This difference can be explained by taking temperature and impurities into account.</description>

      <title>On the relative abundances of Cavansite and Pentagonite</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cavansite is a visually stunning blue vanadosilicate mineral with limited occurrences worldwide, whereas Pentagonite is a closely related dimorph with similar physical and chemical properties, yet is extremely rare compared to Cavansite. The reasons behind Pentagonite's exceptional rarity remain largely unknown.
  In this study, (a) density functional theory (DFT) is utilized to investigate the electronic structures of Cavansite and Pentagonite at ground state and finite pressures; (b) a two-state Boltzmann probability model is then employed to construct a comprehensive phase diagram that reveals the abundance of each species across a wide range of pressure and temperature conditions; and (c) dehydration characteristics of these two minerals are explored.
  The present analysis reveals the key factors that contribute to the relative scarcity of Pentagonite, including differences in structural arrangement and electronic configurations between the two minerals. Specifically, it shows that (a) because of the peculiar arrangements of SiO4 polyhedra, Cavansite forms a compact structure (about 2.7% less in volume) resulting in lower energy; (b) at a temperature of about 650K only about 1% Pentagonite can form; (c) vanadium induces a highly localized state in both of these otherwise large-band-gap insulators resulting in an extremely weak magnetic phase that is unlikely to be observed at any reasonable finite temperature; and (d) water molecules are loosely bound inside the microporous crystals of Cavansite and Pentagonite, suggesting potential applications of these minerals in various technological fields.</description>

      <title>Giant piezoelectricity driven by Thouless pump in conjugated polymers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Piezoelectricity of organic polymers has attracted increasing interest because of several advantages they exhibit over traditional inorganic ceramics. While most organic piezoelectrics rely on the presence of intrinsic local dipoles, a highly nonlocal electronic polarization can be foreseen in conjugated polymers, characterised by delocalized and highly responsive ${\pi}$-electrons. These 1D systems represent a physical realization of a Thouless pump, a mechanism of adiabatic charge transport of topological nature which results, as shown in this work, in anomalously large dynamical effective charges, inversely proportional to the band gap energy. A structural (ferroelectric) phase transition further contributes to an enhancement of the piezoelectric response reminiscent of that observed in piezoelectric perovskites close to morphotropic phase boundaries. First-principles Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations performed in two representative conjugated polymers using hybrid functionals, show that state-of-the-art organic piezoelectric are outperformed by piezoelectric conjugated polymers, mostly thanks to strongly anomalous effective charges of carbon, larger than 5e - ordinary values being of the order of 1e - and reaching the giant value of 30e for band gaps of the order of 1 eV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stacking ferroelectricity (SFE) has been discovered in a wide range of van der Waals materials and holds promise for applications, including photovoltaics and high-density memory devices. We show that the microscopic origin of out-of-plane stacking ferroelectric polarization can be generally understood as a consequence of nontrivial Berry phase borne out of an effective Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model description with broken sublattice symmetry, thus elucidating the quantum-geometric origin of polarization in the extremely non-periodic bilayer limit. Our theory applies to known stacking ferroelectrics such as bilayer transition-metal dichalcogenides in 3R and T$_{\rm d}$ phases, as well as general AB-stacked honeycomb bilayers with staggered sublattice potential. Our explanatory and self-consistent framework based on the quantum-geometric perspective establishes quantitative understanding of out-of-plane SFE materials beyond symmetry principles.</description>

      <title>Tuning flat bands by interlayer interaction, spin-orbital coupling, and external fields in twisted homotrilayer MoS$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultraflat bands have already been detected in twisted bilayer graphene and twisted bilayer transition-metal dichalcogenides, which provide a platform to investigate strong correlations. In this paper, the electronic properties of twisted trilayer molybdenum disulfide (TTM) are investigated via an accurate tight-binding Hamiltonian. We find that the highest valence bands are derived from the $\Gamma$-point of the constituent monolayer, and they exhibit a graphenelike dispersion or become isolated flat bands that are dependent on the starting stacking arrangements. The lattice relaxation, local deformation, and external fields can significantly tune the electronic structures of TTM. After introducing the spin-orbital coupling effect, we find a spin-valley-layer locking effect at the minimum of the conduction band at the $K$- and $K^\prime$-point of the Brillouin zone, which may provide a platform to study optical properties and magnetoelectric effects.</description>

Abstract: The X-ray diffraction, Raman and infrared spectroscopies and magnetic measurements were used to explore the correlated changes of the structure, lattice dynamics and magnetic properties of the LuFeO3 nanoparticles, which appear in dependence on their sintering temperature. We revealed a gradual substitution of the hexagonal phase by the orthorhombic phase in the nanoparticles, which sintering temperature increases from 700 C to 1100 C. The origin and stability of the hexagonal phase in the LuFeO3 nanoparticles is of the special interest, because the nanoparticle in the phase can be a room-temperature multiferroic with a weak ferromagnetic and pronounced structural and ferroelectric long-range ordering, while the antiferromagnetic and nonpolar orthorhombic phase is more stable in the bulk LuFeO3. To define the ranges of the hexagonal phase stability, we determine the bulk and interface energy densities of different phases from the comparison of the Gibbs model with experimental results. Using the Gibbs model parameters, we predict the influence of size effects and temperature on the structural and polar properties of the LuFeO3 nanoparticles. Analysis of the obtained results shows that the combination of the X-ray diffraction, Raman and infrared spectroscopy, magnetic measurements and theoretical modelling of structural and polar properties allows to establish the interplay between the phase composition, lattice dynamics and multiferroic properties of the LuFeO3 nanoparticles prepared in different conditions.</description>

      <title>Ions-induced Epitaxial Growth of Perovskite Nanocomposites for Highly Efficient Light-Emitting Diodes with EQE Exceeding 30%</title>

Abstract: Metal halide perovskites, a class of cost-effective semiconductor materials, are of great interest for modern and upcoming display technologies that prioritize the light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with high efficiency and excellent color purity. The prevailing approach to achieving efficient luminescence from pervoskites is enhancing exciton binding effect and confining carriers by reducing their dimensionality or grain size. However, splitting pervoskite lattice into smaller ones generates abundant boundaries in solid films and results in more surface trap states, needing exact passivation to suppress trap-assisted nonradiative losses. Here, an ions-induced heteroepitaxial growth method is employed to assembe perovskite lattices with different structures into large-sized grains to produce lattice-anchored nanocomposites for efficient LEDs with high color purity. This approach enables the nanocomposite thin films, composed of three-dimensional (3D) CsPbBr3 and its variant of zero-dimensional (0D) Cs4PbBr6, to feature significant low trap-assisted nonradiative recombination, enhanced light out-coupling with a corrugated surface, and well-balanced charge carrier transport. Based on the resultant 3D/0D perovskite nanocomposites, we demonstrate the perovskite LEDs achieving an remarkable external quantum efficiency of 31.0% at the emission peak of 521 nm with a narrow full width at half-maximum of only 18 nm. This research introduces a novel approach to the development of well-assembled nanocomposites for perovskite LEDs, demonstrating high efficiency comparable to that of state-of-the-art organic LEDs.</description>

      <title>Role of magnetic ions in the thermal Hall effect of the paramagnetic insulator TmVO$_{4}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10643v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a growing number of materials, phonons have been found to generate a thermal Hall effect, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Inspired by previous studies that revealed the importance of Tb$^{3+}$ ions in generating the thermal Hall effect of Tb$_{2}$Ti$_{2}$O$_{7}$, we investigated the role of Tm$^{3+}$ ions in TmVO$_{4}$, a paramagnetic insulator with a different crystal structure. We observe a negative thermal Hall conductivity in TmVO$_{4}$ with a magnitude such that the Hall angle, $|\kappa_{xy}$/$\kappa_{xx}|$, is approximately 1 x 10$^{-3}$ at $H$ = 15 T and $T$ = 20 K, typical for a phonon-generated thermal Hall effect. In contrast to the negligible $\kappa_{xy}$ found in Y$_{2}$Ti$_{2}$O$_{7}$, we observe a negative $\kappa_{xy}$ in YVO$_{4}$ with a Hall angle of magnitude comparable to that of TmVO$_{4}$. This shows that the Tm$^{3+}$ ions are not essential for the thermal Hall effect in this family of materials. Interestingly, at an intermediate Y concentration of 30 % in Tm$_{1-x}$Y$_{x}$VO$_{4}$, $\kappa_{xy}$ was found to have a positive sign, pointing to the possible importance of impurities in the thermal Hall effect of phonons.</description>

We propose a machine learning based physical-constrained nonlocal (MPN) KEDF and implement it with the usage of the bulk-derived local pseudopotentials and plane wave basis sets in the ABACUS package. The MPN KEDF is designed to satisfy three exact physical constraints: the scaling law of electron kinetic energy, the free electron gas limit, and the non-negativity of Pauli energy density. The MPN KEDF is systematically tested for simple metals, including Li, Mg, Al, and 59 alloys. We conclude that incorporating nonlocal information for designing new KEDFs and obeying exact physical constraints are essential to improve the accuracy, transferability, and stability of ML-based KEDF. These results shed new light on the construction of ML-based functionals.</description>

      <title>Chiral magnetic phases in Moire bilayers of magnetic dipoles</title>

Abstract: In magnetic insulators, the sense of rotation of the magnetization is associated with novel phases of matter and exotic transport phenomena. Aimed to find new sources of chiral magnetism rooted in intrinsic fields and geometry, twisted square bilayers of magnetic dipoles with easy plane anisotropy are studied. For no twist, each lattice settles in the zig-zag magnetic state and orders antiferromagnetically to the other layer. The moire patterns that result from the mutual rotation of the two square lattices influence such zig-zag order, giving rise to several phases that depict non-collinear magnetic textures with chiral motifs that break both time and inversion symmetry. For certain moire angles, helical and toroidal magnetic orders arise. Changing the vertical distance between layers can further manipulate these novel phases. It is shown that the dipolar interlayer interaction induces an emergent twist-dependent chiral magnetic field orthogonal to the direction of the zig-zag chains, which is responsible for the internal torques conjugated to the toroidal orders.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast all-optical toggle writing of magnetic bits without relying on heat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While in accordance with Curie's principle, one would intuitively expect that symmetry of the cause has to be found in the symmetry of the effect, ultrafast excitation of matter is able to violate this principle. For instance, it is believed that heating alone, obviously not having the symmetry of a magnetic field, cannot result in a deterministic reversal of magnetization. However, if the heating is induced by a femtosecond laser pulse and thus ultrafast, it does facilitate toggle switching of magnetization between stable bit-states without any magnetic field at all. Here we show that the regime of ultrafast toggle switching can be also realized via a mechanism without relying on any heat. The obvious mismatch between symmetries of the cause and the response can thus be seen as a violation of Curie's principle. In particular, ultrafast laser excitation of iron-garnet with linearly polarized light modifies magnetic anisotropy and thus causes toggling magnetization between two stable bit states. In contrast to the laser-heat-induced magnetization reversal, this new regime of 'cold' toggle switching can be observed in ferrimagnets without the compensation point and in an exceptionally broad temperature range. The control of magnetic anisotropy required for the toggle switching is accompanied by lower dissipations, than in the mechanism of laser-induced-heating, but the dissipations and the switching-time are shown to be competing parameters.</description>

      <title>On the Role of Charge Transfer Excitations in Non-Fullerene Acceptors for Organic Photovoltaics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04459v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Through the development of new non-fullerene electron acceptor (NFA) materials, such as Y6 and its molecular derivatives, the power conversion efficiencies of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have now exceeded 19%. However, despite this rapid progress, our fundamental understanding of the unique optical and electronic properties of these Y-series NFAs is lacking, and this currently limits progress in material design. In this work, we provide a detailed computational-experimental characterisation of the archetypal NFA, Y6. To explain the significant broadening and red shift of the absorption spectrum observed when moving from the solution phase to the solid state, we first rule out more typical causes, such as J-aggregation. Instead, by considering the role of charge transfer (CT) excitations and their mixing with Frenkel exciton (FE) states, we can computationally reproduce the experimental absorption spectra of Y6 with excellent accuracy. Using transient absorption spectroscopy, we provide evidence for this dense manifold of FE-CT hybrid electronic excitations in Y6 through the prominent sub-picosecond relaxation events following supra band gap excitation. Furthermore, through sub band gap excitation, we also find states with polaronic character in Y6 that are in a dynamic equilibrium with the FE-CT hybrid states. Magnetic resonance spectroscopies reveal that these polaronic states are polaron pairs, most likely located on neighbouring Y6 molecules, not free charge carriers, as has been previously suggested. Thus, this new understanding of how the solid-state packing motif directly controls the optical and electronic properties of Y-series NFAs opens the door to intelligently design NFA materials to further increase OPV performance.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Design of High Pressure Hydride Superconductors using DFT and Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12694v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The observation of superconductivity in hydride-based materials under ultrahigh pressures (for example, H$_3$S and LaH$_{10}$) has fueled the interest in a more data-driven approach to discovering new high-pressure hydride superconductors. In this work, we performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations to predict the critical temperature ($T_c$) of over 900 hydride materials under a pressure range of (0 to 500) GPa, where we found 125 dynamically stable structures with a $T_c$ above MgB$_2$ (39 K). To accelerate screening, we trained a graph neural network (GNN) model to predict $T_c$ and demonstrated that a universal machine learned force-field can be used to relax hydride structures under arbitrary pressures, with significantly reduced cost. By combining DFT and GNNs, we can establish a more complete map of hydrides under pressure.</description>

      <title>Formation of a boron-oxide termination for the (100) diamond surface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A boron-oxide termination of the diamond (100) surface has been formed by depositing molecular boron oxide $\rm{B_2O_3}$ onto the hydrogen-terminated (100) diamond surface under ultrahigh vacuum conditions and annealing to $\rm{950^{\circ} C}$. The resulting termination was highly oriented and chemically homogeneous, although further optimisation is required to increase the surface coverage beyond the 0.4 ML achieved here. This work demonstrates the possibility of using molecular deposition under ultrahigh vacuum conditions for complex surface engineering of the diamond surface, and may be a first step in an alternative approach to fabricating boron doped delta layers in diamond.</description>

      <title>Exploring $\rm Mg^{2+}$ and $\rm Ca^{2+}$ Conductors Via Solid-State Metathesis Reactions</title>

Abstract: Magnesium and calcium batteries offer promising energy storage solutions characterised by cost-effectiveness, safety, and high energy density. However, the scarcity of viable electrode and electrolyte materials vastly hinders their advancement. This study utilises solid-state metathetical reactions involving predominantly chalcogen- and pnictogen-based honeycomb layered oxides with alkaline-earth halides/nitrates to synthesise $\rm Mg^{2+}$- and $\rm Ca^{2+}$-based materials previously achievable only under high-temperature/high-pressure conditions, as well as new metastable materials with unique crystal versatility. Particularly, we employ metathetical reactions involving $\rm Li_4MgTeO_6$, $\rm Na_2Mg_2TeO_6$, and $\rm Na_4MgTeO_6$ with $\rm MgCl_2$\,/\,$\rm Mg(NO_3)_2$ or $\rm Ca(NO_3)_2$ at temperatures not exceeding 500 $^\circ$C to produce $\rm Mg_3TeO_6$ polymorphs, ilmenite-type $\rm CaMg_2TeO_6$\,/\,$\rm Mg_2CaTeO_6$, and double perovskite $\rm Ca_2MgTeO_6$. Thus, we demonstrate that these materials, conventionally requiring gigascale pressures and high temperatures (&gt;1000$^\circ$C) for their proper synthesis, are now readily accessible at ambient pressure and considerably lower temperatures. Meanwhile, despite sub-optimal pellet densities, the synthesised ilmenite-type $\rm Mg_3TeO_6$ and double perovskite ${\rm Ca}_2M{\rm TeO_6}$ ($M = \rm Mg, Ca, Zn$)} materials exhibit remarkable bulk ionic conductivity at room temperature, marking them as promising compositional spaces for exploring novel $\rm Mg^{2+}$ and $\rm Ca^{2+}$ conductors. Furthermore, this study extends the applicability of metathetical reactions to attain Mg- or Ca-based bismuthates, antimonates, ruthenates, tungstates, titanates, phosphates, and silicates, thus opening avenues to novel high-entropy multifunctional nanomaterial platforms with utility in energy storage and beyond.</description>

      <title>Quasi-one-dimensional spin transport in antiferromagnetic $Z^3$ nodal net metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In three dimensions, the quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) transport is commonly thought to only appear in the systems with Q1D chain structure. Here, based on first-principle calculations, we go beyond the common belief to show that the Q1D transport can also be realized in many 3D antiferromagnetic (AFM) metals with topological node structure but without Q1D chain structure, including the existing compounds $\beta$-Fe$_2$(PO$_4$)O and Co$_2$(PO$_4$)O, and LiTi$_2$O$_4$. All these materials have an AFM ground state and exhibit an ideal crossed $Z^3$ Weyl nodal line in each spin channel, formed by three straight and flat nodal lines traversing the whole Brillouin zone. These nodal lines eventually lead to an AFM $Z^3$ nodal net. Surprisingly, we find that the longitudinal conductivity $\sigma_{xx}$ in these topological nodal net metals is dozens of times larger than $\sigma_{yy}$ and $\sigma_{zz}$ in the up-spin channel, while $\sigma_{yy}$ dominates the transport in the down-spin channel. This means that each spin channel has a Q1D transport signature, and the principal moving direction for the two spin channels is orthogonal, leading to Q1D direction-dependent spin transport. This novel phenomenon can not be found in both conventional 3D bulk materials and Q1D chain materials, and may solely be induced by the $Z^3$ nodal net, as it gradually disappears when the Fermi level moves away from the nodal net. Our work not only enhances the comprehension of topological physics in antiferromagnets, but also opens a new direction for the exploration of topological spintronics.</description>

      <title>Charge Conservation Beyond Uniformity: Spatially Inhomogeneous Electromagnetic Response in Periodic Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear electromagnetic response functions have reemerged as a crucial tool for studying quantum materials. Most attention has been paid to responses to spatially uniform electric fields, relevant to optical experiments in conventional materials. However, magnetic and magnetoelectric phenomena are naturally connected by responses to spatially varying electric fields due to Maxwell's equations. Furthermore, in moir\'{e} materials, characteristic lattice scales are much longer, allowing spatial variation of optical electric fields to potentially have a measurable effect in experiments. To address these issues, we develop a formalism for computing linear and nonlinear responses to spatially inhomogeneous electromagnetic fields. Starting with the continuity equation, we derive an expression for the current operator that is manifestly conserved and model independent. Crucially, our formalism makes no assumptions on the form of the microscopic Hamiltonian and so is applicable to model Hamiltonians derived from tight-binding or ab initio calculations. We then develop a diagrammatic Kubo formalism for computing the wavevector dependence of linear and nonlinear conductivities, using Ward identities to fix the value of the diamagnetic current order-by-order in the vector potential. We apply our formula to compute the magnitude of the Kerr effect at oblique incidence for a model of a moir\'{e} Chern insulator and demonstrate the experimental relevance of spatially inhomogeneous fields in these systems. We further show how our formalism allows us to compute the magnetic multipole moments and magnetic susceptibility in insulators. We next use our formalism to compute the second-order transverse response to spatially varying transverse electric fields in our moir\'{e} Chern insulator model, with an eye towards the next generation of experiments in these systems.</description>

      <title>Efficient Full-frequency GW Calculations using a Lanczos Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20103v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The GW approximation is widely used for reliable and accurate modeling of single-particle excitations. It also serves as a starting point for many theoretical methods, such as its use in the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) and dynamical mean-field theory. However, full-frequency GW calculations for large systems with hundreds of atoms remain computationally challenging, even after years of efforts to reduce the prefactor and improve scaling. We propose a method that reformulates the correlation part of the GW self-energy as a resolvent of a Hermitian matrix, which can be efficiently and accurately computed using the standard Lanczos method. This method enables full-frequency GW calculations of material systems with a few hundred atoms on a single computing workstation. We further demonstrate the efficiency of the method by calculating the defect-state energies of silicon quantum dots with diameters up to 4 nm and nearly 2,000 silicon atoms using only 20 computational nodes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Te is a naturally p-doped semiconductor with a chiral structure, where an electrical current causes the conduction electrons to become spin polarized parallel to the transport direction. In this paper, we present a comprehensive theoretical study of this effect by employing density functional theory (DFT) combined with the non-equilibrium Green's functions (NEGF) technique for quantum transport. We suggest that the spin polarization can quantitatively be estimated in terms of two complementary quantities, namely the non-equilibrium magnetic moments and the spin current density. The calculated magnetic moments are directly compared with the values from previous theoretical studies obtaining overall consistent results. On the other hand, the inspection of the spin current density provides insights of the magnetotransport properties of the material. Specifically, we predict that the resistance along a Te wire changes when an external magnetic field is applied parallel or antiparallel to the charge current direction. The computed magnetoresistance is however quite small (~ 0.025%). Finally, we show that the description of the current-induced spin polarization in terms of the spin current establishes a straightforward connection with the phenomenon called chiral-induced spin selectivity, recently observed in several nano-junctions.</description>

      <title>Advances in high-pressure laser floating zone growth: the Laser Optical Kristallmacher II</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The optical floating zone crystal growth technique is a well-established method for obtaining large, high-purity single crystals. While the floating zone method has been constantly evolving for over six decades, the development of high-pressure (up to 1000 bar) growth systems has only recently been realized via the combination of laser-based heating sources with an all-metal chamber. While our inaugural high-pressure laser floating zone furnace design demonstrated the successful growth of new volatile and metastable phases, the furnace design faces several limitations with imaging quality, heating profile control, and chamber cooling power. Here, we present a second-generation design of the high-pressure laser floating zone furnace, "Laser Optical Kristallmacher II" (LOKII), and demonstrate that this redesign facilitates new advances in crystal growth by highlighting several exemplar materials: ${\alpha}$-Fe$_2$O$_3$, $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$, and La$_2$CuO$_{4+{\delta}}$. Notably, for La$_2$CuO$_{4+{\delta}}$, we demonstrate the feasibility and long-term stability of traveling solvent floating zone growth under a record pressure of 700 bar.</description>

      <title>Random Green's function method for large-scale electronic structure calculation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a linear-scaling random Green's function (rGF) method for large-scale electronic structure calculation. In this method, the rGF is defined on a set of random states to stochastically express the density matrix, and rGF is calculated with the linear-scaling computational cost. We show the rGF method is generally applicable to the nonorthogonal localized basis, and circumvent the large Chebyshev expansion for the density matrix. As a demonstration, we implement rGF with density-functional Tight-Binding method and apply it to self-consistently calculate water clusters up 9984 H2Os. We find the rGF method combining with a simple fragment correction can reach an error of ~1meV per H2O in total energy, compared to the deterministic calculations, due to the self-average. The development of rGF method advances the stochastic electronic structure theory to a new stage of the efficiency and applicability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have investigated by molecular dynamics method the influence of a finite number of particles used in computer simulations on fluctuations of thermodynamic properties. As a case study, we used the two-dimensional Lennard-Jones system. 2D Lennard-Jones system, besides being an archetypal one, is a subject of long debate, as to whether it has continuous (infinite-order) or discontinuous (first-order) melting transition. We have found that anomalies on the equation of state (the van-der-Waals or Myer-Wood loops) previously considered a hallmark of the first order phase transition, are at best at the level of noise, since they have the same magnitude as the amplitude of pressure fluctuations. So, they could be regarded as statistically unsignificant effect. Also, we estimated inherent statistical noise, present in computer simulations, and came to conclusion, that it is larger, than predicted by statistical physics, and the difference between them (called algorithmic fluctuations) is possibly due to the computer-related issues. It was demonstrated that these fluctuations in principle could be observed in real-life physical experiments which would lead to practical resolution of The Matrix hypothesis.</description>

Abstract: Multilayered metal-dielectric nanostructures display both strong plasmonic behavior and hyperbolic optical dispersion. The latter is responsible for the appearance of two separated radiative and non-radiative channels in the extinction spectrum of these structures. This unique property can open a wealth of opportunities towards the development of multifunctional systems that simultaneously can behave as optimal scatterers and absorbers at different wavelengths, an important feature to achieve multiscale control light-matter interactions in different spectral regions for different types of applications, such as optical computing or detection of thermal radiation. Nevertheless, the temperature dependence of the optical properties of these multilayered systems has never been investigated. In this work we study how radiative and non-radiative processes in hyperbolic meta-antennas can probe temperature changes of the surrounding medium. We show that, while radiative processes are essentially not affected by a change in the external temperature, the non-radiative ones are strongly affected by a temperature variation. By combining experiments and temperature dependent effective medium theory, we find that this behavior is connected to enhanced damping effects due to electron-phonon scattering. Contrary to standard plasmonic systems, a red-shift of the non-radiative mode occurs for small variations of the environment temperature. Our study shows that to probe temperature changes it is essential to exploit non-radiative processes in systems supporting plasmonic excitations, which can be used as very sensitive thermometers via linear absorption spectroscopy.</description>
