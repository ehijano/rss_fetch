      <title>The challenge of the data in the SRCnetwork</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At regime, SKAO is expected to provide the researchers with an annual amount of more than 700 hundred PB of data. The advanced analysis of all those data will take place within a network (SRCnet) of so-called SKA Regional Centres, which, under the "Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable" (FAIR) principles, will also take the responsibility for curating and archiving both the Observatory Data Products and user-generated Advanced Data Products, as well as for helping the researchers in the estimate of the needed computational effort at the proposal stage.
  This contribution describes the status and the perspectives of this international network, with particular emphasis on the INAF-led Italian node which is part of that.</description>

      <title>A Novel Optical Design for Wide-Field Imaging in X-ray Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the decades, astronomical X-ray telescopes have utilized the Wolter type-1 optical design, which provides stigmatic imaging in axial direction but suffers from coma and higher-order aberrations for off-axis sources. The Wolter-Schwarzschild design, with stigmatic imaging in the axial direction, while suffering from higher-order aberrations, is corrected for coma, thus performing better than the Wolter type-1. The Wolter type-1 and Wolter-Schwarzschild designs are optimized for on-axis but have reduced angular resolution when averaged over a wide field of view, with the averaging weighted by the area covered in the field of view. An optical design that maximizes angular resolution at the edge of the field of view rather than at the center is more suitable for wide-field X-ray telescopes required for deep-sky astronomical surveys or solar observations. A Hyperboloid-Hyperboloid optical design can compromise axial resolution to enhance field angle resolution, hence providing improved area-weighted average angular resolution over the Wolter-Schwarzschild design, but only for fields of view exceeding a specific size. Here, we introduce a new optical design that is free from coma aberration and capable of maximizing angular resolution at any desired field angle. This design consistently outperforms Wolter-1, Wolter-Schwarzschild, and Hyperboloid-Hyperboloid designs when averaged over any field of view size. The improvement in performance remains consistent across variations in other telescope parameters such as diameter, focal length, and mirror lengths. By utilizing this new optical design, we also present a design for a full-disk imaging solar X-ray telescope.</description>

      <title>Biases induced by retardance and diattenuation in the measurements of long-baseline interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I derive in this paper theoretical expressions for biases on fringe contrast and fringe visibility phase for optical interferometers whose polarizing properties can be described by beam rotation, retardance, and diattenuation. The nature of these biases is discussed for natural light, circular and linear polarization, and partially polarized light. Expansions are obtained for small degrees of polarization, small differential retardance, and small diattenuation. The biases on fringe contrasts are already known. It is shown in this paper that retardance and diattenuation are also sources of bias on the visibility phases and derived quantities. In some cases, the bias is zero. If the retardance is achromatic, differential phases are not affected. Closure phases are not affected to the second order for an interferometer with weak diattenuation and weak differential retardance and for moderately polarized sources whatever the type of light. Otherwise, a calibration procedure is required. It is shown that astrometric measurements are biased in the general case. The bias depends on both the polarization properties of the interferometer and on the (u,v) sampling. In the extreme case where the samples are aligned on a line crossing the origin of the spatial frequency plane, the bias is undetermined and can be arbitrarily large. In all other cases, it can be calibrated if the polarizing characteristics of the interferometer are known. In the case of low differential retardance and low degree of polarization, the bias lies on a straight line, crossing the astrometric reference point. If the degree of linear polarization varies during the observations, then the astrometric bias has a remarkable signature, which describes a section of the line. For slightly polarizing interferometers, a fixed offset is added without changing the shape of the bias.</description>

      <title>The Dark Ages Explorer (DEX): a filled-aperture ultra-long wavelength radio interferometer on the lunar far side</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The measurement of the spatial fluctuations of the neutral hydrogen 21 cm signal arising during the Dark Ages and Cosmic Dawn periods of our Universe (z from 200 to 10) holds the potential to resolve these still-unexplored earliest phases of the evolution of matter structures. As these cosmological signals are very weak, large distributed telescopes are required at locations free from terrestrial radio interference and ionospheric disturbances. This paper presents a description of the scientific aims, the instrumental concept, and technological developments of an experiment - dubbed the Dark-ages EXplorer (DEX) - which would allow us to (a) measure the Global Signal and (b) measure the angular density fluctuations and conduct line-of-sight tomography in the Dark Ages and Cosmic Dawn epochs. Additional scientific goals are also briefly described. The experiment consists of a low-frequency radio interferometer, which should ideally be located on the far side of the Moon. The paper presents findings from an ESA Concurrent Design Facility (CDF) study, which was conducted to assess the feasibility of such a system using present-day technologies with a high TRL (Technology Readiness Level). Although the study finds that the number of antennas needed to achieve the primary scientific goals is not yet feasible at the moment, it points to a path of technological development that can lead to a realistic and valuable experiment in the medium-term future (i.e., the next decade(s)), as well as development of multi-purpose use technology that can be applied on Earth, and towards other lunar operations.</description>

      <title>The AI Cosmologist I: An Agentic System for Automated Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the AI Cosmologist, an agentic system designed to automate cosmological/astronomical data analysis and machine learning research workflows. This implements a complete pipeline from idea generation to experimental evaluation and research dissemination, mimicking the scientific process typically performed by human researchers. The system employs specialized agents for planning, coding, execution, analysis, and synthesis that work together to develop novel approaches. Unlike traditional auto machine-learning systems, the AI Cosmologist generates diverse implementation strategies, writes complete code, handles execution errors, analyzes results, and synthesizes new approaches based on experimental outcomes. We demonstrate the AI Cosmologist capabilities across several machine learning tasks, showing how it can successfully explore solution spaces, iterate based on experimental results, and combine successful elements from different approaches. Our results indicate that agentic systems can automate portions of the research process, potentially accelerating scientific discovery. The code and experimental data used in this paper are available on GitHub at https://github.com/adammoss/aicosmologist. Example papers included in the appendix demonstrate the system's capability to autonomously produce complete scientific publications, starting from only the dataset and task description</description>

      <title>On the presence of a fifth force at the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aims: The presence of a Yukawa-like correction to Newtonian gravity is investigated at the Galactic Center, leading to a new upper limit for the intensity of such a correction. Methods: We perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis using the astrometric and spectroscopic data of star S$2$ collected at the Very Large Telescope by GRAVITY, NACO and SINFONI instruments, covering the period from $1992$ to $2022$. Results: The precision of the GRAVITY instrument allows us to derive the most stringent upper limit at the Galactic Center for the intensity of the Yukawa contribution ($\propto \, \alpha e^{- \lambda r}$) to be $|\alpha| &lt; 0.003$ for a scale length $\lambda = 3 \cdot 10^{13}\, \rm m\, (\sim 200 \, \rm AU)$. This improves by roughly one order of magnitude all estimates obtained in previous works.</description>

      <title>TDCOSMO XVII. New time delays in 22 lensed quasars from optical monitoring with the ESO-VST 2.6m and MPG 2.2m telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present new time delays, the main ingredient of time delay cosmography, for 22 lensed quasars resulting from high-cadence r-band monitoring on the 2.6 m ESO VLT Survey Telescope and Max-Planck-Gesellschaft 2.2 m telescope. Each lensed quasar was typically monitored for one to four seasons, often shared between the two telescopes to mitigate the interruptions forced by the COVID-19 pandemic. The sample of targets consists of 19 quadruply and 3 doubly imaged quasars, which received a total of 1 918 hours of on-sky time split into 21 581 wide-field frames, each 320 seconds long. In a given field, the 5-{\sigma} depth of the combined exposures typically reaches the 27th magnitude, while that of single visits is 24.5 mag - similar to the expected depth of the upcoming Vera-Rubin LSST. The fluxes of the different lensed images of the targets were reliably de-blended, providing not only light curves with photometric precision down to the photon noise limit, but also high-resolution models of the targets whose features and astrometry were systematically confirmed in Hubble Space Telescope imaging. This was made possible thanks to a new photometric pipeline, lightcurver, and the forward modelling method STARRED. Finally, the time delays between pairs of curves and their uncertainties were estimated, taking into account the degeneracy due to microlensing, and for the first time the full covariance matrices of the delay pairs are provided. Of note, this survey, with 13 square degrees, has applications beyond that of time delays, such as the study of the structure function of the multiple high-redshift quasars present in the footprint at a new high in terms of both depth and frequency. The reduced images will be available through the European Southern Observatory Science Portal.</description>

      <title>Comparative Statistics of Solar Flares and Flare Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The distribution of interval times between recurrent discrete events, such as Solar and stellar flares, reflects their underlying dynamics. Log-normal functions provide good fits to the interval time distributions of many recurrent astronomical events. The width of the fit is a dimensionless parameter that characterizes its underlying dynamics, in analogy to the critical exponents of renormalization group theory. If the distribution of event strengths is a power law, as it often is over a wide range, then the width of the log-normal is independent of the detector sensitivity in that range, making it a robust metric. Analyzing two catalogues of Solar flares over periods ranging from 46 days to 37 years, we find that the widths of log-normal fits to the intervals between flares are wider than those of shot noise, indicating memory in the underlying dynamics even over a time much shorter than the Solar cycle. In contrast, the statistics of flare stars are consistent with shot noise (no memory). We suggest that this is a consequence of the production of Solar flares in localized transient active regions with varying mean flare rate, but that the very energetic flares of flare stars result from global magnetic rearrangement that reinitializes their magnetohydrodynamic turbulence.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of the upgraded 3-inch Hamamatsu photomultiplier for the KM3NeT Neutrino Telescope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 3-inch Hamamatsu R14374-02 photomultiplier tube is an improved version of the R12199-02 model and its successor in the construction of the KM3NeT neutrino telescope. A total of 1000 photomultipliers were analysed to assess their dark count rate, transit time spread, and spurious pulses. A subset of 200 photomultipliers were further evaluated to determine their quantum efficiency which is an essential parameter for Monte Carlo simulations of the detector response. The measurements show that R14374-02 model has better quantum efficiency homogeneity over the photocatode and better time properties than the R12199-02.</description>

      <title>The impact of diffuse Galactic emission on direction-independent gain calibration in high-redshift 21 cm observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines the impact of diffuse Galactic emission on sky-based direction-independent (DI) gain calibration using realistic forward simulations of Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) observations of the high-redshift 21 cm signal of neutral hydrogen during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). We simulated LOFAR observations between 147 - 159 MHz using a sky model that includes a point source catalogue and diffuse Galactic emission. The simulated observations were DI-gain calibrated with the point source catalogue alone, utilising the LOFAR-EoR data analysis pipeline. A full power spectrum analysis was conducted to assess the systematic bias introduced by DI-gain calibration using complete and incomplete sky models, relative to thermal noise. Additionally, the cross-coherence between observation pairs was computed to determine whether DI-gain calibration errors are coherent or incoherent in specific regions of power spectrum space as a function of integration time. We find that DI-gain calibration with an incomplete sky model that omits diffuse Galactic emission introduces a systematic bias in the power spectrum for $k_{\parallel}$ bins &lt; 0.2 $h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. The power spectrum errors in these bins are coherent; therefore, the resulting bias can be mitigated during the foreground removal step. In contrast, errors for $k_{\parallel}$ &gt; 0.2 $h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ are largely incoherent and average down as noise. We conclude that missing diffuse Galactic emission in the sky model is not a significant contributor to the excess noise observed in the current LOFAR-EoR upper limit results on the 21 cm signal power spectrum.</description>
