      <title>On Geometric Evolution and Microlocal Regularity of the Navier-Stokes Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a geometric and microlocal framework for the Navier--Stokes equations by lifting the dynamics to the cosphere bundle of a Riemannian manifold. In this formulation, the velocity field and vorticity are represented as microlocal distributions whose evolution is governed by a transport--dissipation system generated by a canonical dynamical vector field described with differential forms. We introduce microlocal amplitudes, directional energy functionals, and monotone volume invariants on the compact phase space, which quantify directional concentration and alignment mechanisms associated with potential loss of regularity. The viscous term induces effective geometric diffusion on the cosphere bundle, yielding closed differential inequalities in a geometric setting. To capture the interaction between fluid deformation and geometry, we define an effective connection and curvature tensor encoding the influence of the symmetric velocity gradient. This structure gives rise to a Ricci-type geometric evolution at the microlocal level, controlled by a dissipative functional that excludes extreme directional concentration and persistent transverse stretching. Our results do not resolve the global regularity problem in full generality, but provide a coherent geometric mechanism that severely restricts blow-up scenarios compatible with viscous Navier--Stokes dynamics, reformulating the analytic regularity question as a problem of dissipative stability on a compact phase space.</description>

      <title>Constraint-Induced Effective Mass in Massless Field Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constrained propagation of massless fields is ubiquitous in physical systems, arising from boundaries, material structure, or other restrictions on admissible modes. This paper shows that such constraints generically induce mass-like terms in the effective dispersion relation, without modifying the underlying field equations or introducing new degrees of freedom. Working at an abstract level, constraints are represented as linear operators acting on the field's mode space. Restriction of the admissible mode manifold produces a spectral gap whose magnitude is set by the smallest non-zero eigenvalue of an associated positive semidefinite operator. This gap may be identified with an effective mass parameter, yielding a Proca-like dispersion relation in the long-wavelength limit. The resulting Mass Induction Principle identifies rank reduction of the accessible mode space as the structural mechanism responsible for effective mass generation in constrained massless fields. Familiar systems such as plasmas, superconductors, and periodic media realise this structure as special cases, without introducing new dynamics. The analysis is deliberately dispersion-level and non-phenomenological: it does not assert a field-theoretic mass term, does not address vacuum propagation, and does not make claims about bounds on intrinsic particle masses.</description>

      <title>Mechanical Impedance and the Physics of Faster-Than-the-Wind Travel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22081v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is a well-documented yet counterintuitive fact that wind-driven vehicles can travel directly downwind faster than the wind itself. This effect is not paradoxical once one recognizes that the vehicle is not pushed by the air alone but acts as a coupled mechanical system that taps the relative motion of two media -- the moving air and the (effectively) stationary ground or water -- and, through its drivetrain, can gear up this modest velocity difference into a larger vehicle speed. The ground provides the indispensable mechanical impedance, serving as a rigid foothold that allows the wheels to support reaction forces without doing work in the ideal limit. The drivetrain -- wheels, gears, and propeller -- then functions as a mechanical transformer: It trades increased vehicle speed against reduced thrust so that power is conserved in the ideal limit. Using the analogies of a gearbox, a lever, and a sliding-boat thought experiment, this work presents an explicitly Newtonian description showing how faster-than-the-wind travel arises from the geared-up relative motion of two media coupled through a high-impedance foothold.</description>
