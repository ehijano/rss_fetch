      <title>Fast control of the transverse structure of a light beam using acousto-optic modulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast, reprogrammable control over the transverse structure of light beams plays an essential role in applications such as structured illumination microscopy, optical trapping, and quantum information processing. Existing technologies, such as liquid crystal on silicon spatial light modulators (LCoS-SLMs) and digital micromirror devices (DMDs), suffer from limited refresh rates, low damage thresholds, and high insertion loss. Acousto-optic modulators (AOMs) can resolve the above issues, as they typically handle higher laser power and offer lower insertion loss. By effectively mapping the temporal radio-frequency (RF) waveforms onto the spatial diffraction patterns of the optical field, individual AOMs have been shown to generate one-dimensional (1D) spatial modes at a pixel refresh rate of nearly 20 MHz. We extend this concept to enable fast modulation in a two-dimensional (2D) space using a double-AOM scheme. We demonstrate the generation of 2D Hermite-Gaussian (HG_nm) modes with an average fidelity of 81%, while the highest-order mode generated, HG_53, retains a fidelity of 56%.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Faraday magneto-optic effects in a helically wound optical fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We thoroughly investigate the Faraday magneto-optical effects in a helically wound nonlinear optical fiber. We find the emergence of an additional rotation angle proportional to the optical intensity, arised from the nonlinear corrections to both the Verdet constant and the fiber torsion. By analyzing an oscillator model describing the electron motions in the fiber medium, we can obtain the third-order susceptibility in the presence of the magnetic field. According to the Maxwell's equations and the minimal coupling principle in the metric expression of the curved space, we derive the propagation equations of light in a helically wound optical fiber. Finally, we have obtained the analytic expressions of Faraday rotation angle for both linearly and elliptically polarized lights, which explicitly indicates an important nonlinear correction on the Faraday rotation angles. Possible experimental observations and some implications of our theoretical findings are discussed.</description>

      <title>Computationally Efficient Nanophotonic Design through Data-Driven Eigenmode Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Growing diversity and complexity of on-chip photonic applications requires rapid design of components with state-of-the-art operation metrics. Here, we demonstrate a highly flexible and efficient method for designing several classes of compact and low-loss integrated optical devices. By leveraging a data-driven approach, we represent devices in the form of cascaded eigenmode scattering matrices, through a data-driven eigenmode expansion method. We perform electromagnetic computations using parallel data processing techniques, demonstrating simulation of individual device responses in tens of milliseconds with physical accuracies matching 3D-FDTD. We then couple these simulations with nonlinear optimization algorithms to design silicon-based waveguide tapers, power splitters, and waveguide crossings with state-of-the-art performance and near-lossless operation. These three sets of devices highlight the broad computational efficiency of the design methodology shown, and the applicability of the demonstrated data-driven eigenmode expansion approach to a wide set of photonic design problems.</description>

      <title>Floquet valley Hall edge solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce traveling Floquet valley Hall edge solitons in a genuinely continuous system consisting of a waveguide array with a dynamically varying domain wall between two honeycomb structures exhibiting broken inversion symmetry. Inversion symmetry in our system is broken due to periodic and out-of-phase longitudinal modulation of the refractive index applied to the constituent sublattices of the honeycomb structure. By combining two honeycomb arrays with different initial phases of refractive index modulation we create a dynamically changing domain wall that supports localized linear Floquet edge states despite the fact that on average two sublattices in each honeycomb structure forming the domain wall have the same refractive index. In the presence of focusing nonlinearity, bright or dark Floquet edge solitons may bifurcate from such linear Floquet edge states. We numerically identified a family of these solitons and compared them with the results obtained from the analytical approach, which involved averaging over one longitudinal period in the evolution coordinate. These solitons exhibit localization in both spatial directions - along the interface due to nonlinear self-action and across the interface as the edge states - that allows them to travel along the domain wall over long distances without noticeable shape variations.</description>

      <title>Quantized Inverse Design for Photonic Integrated Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inverse design of photonic integrated circuits (PICs) presents distinctive computational challenges, including their large memory requirements. Advancements in the two-photon polymerization (2PP) fabrication process introduce additional complexity, necessitating the development of more flexible optimization algorithms to enable the creation of multi-material 3D structures with unique properties. This paper presents an efficient reverse-mode automatic differentiation framework for finite-difference timedomain (FDTD) simulations that is able to handle several constraints arising from novel fabrication methods. Our method is based on straight-through gradient estimation that enables non-differentiable shape parametrizations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by creating increasingly complex structures to solve the coupling problem in integrated photonic circuits. The results highlight the potential of our method for future PIC design and practical applications.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of the photon pair generation rate by spontaneous four-wave mixing in bent waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhancing nonlinear optical effects is critical to improving the performance of many functional devices for nonlinear and quantum optical applications. Here we study the possibility of bending a waveguide to enhance the photon pair generation rate in a spontaneous four-wave mixing process. Whereas intuition might suggest that bending makes the process less efficient, because the waveguides are more lossy when bent, we show that the increase in the effective nonlinearity outperforms the disadvantage for moderate bending radii. That can be explained by a better localization of the guided eigenmodes, leading to a reduced mode area. By studying selected waveguide devices with a fixed length, we demonstrate an optimal improvement between 5 % and 270 % in the photon pair generation rate for an optimal bending radius. These findings have implications for the future design of integrated photonic devices for quantum optical applications, especially in cases where the chip estate tends to be a limiting factor.</description>

      <title>Super-luminal Synthetic Motion with a Space-Time Optical Metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction of light with superluminally moving matter entails unconventional phenomena, from Fresnel drag to Hawking radiation and to light amplification. While relativity makes these effects inaccessible using objects in motion, synthetic motion - enabled via space-time modulated internal degrees of freedom - is free from these constraints. Here we observe synthetic velocity of a reflectivity modulation travelling on an Indium-Tin-Oxide (ITO) interface, generated by ultrafast laser illumination at multiple positions and times. The interaction of the moving reflectivity modulation with a probe light beam acts as a non-separable spatio-temporal transformation that diffracts the light, changing its frequency and momentum content. The recorded frequency-momentum diffraction pattern is defined by the velocity of the diffracted probe wave relative to the modulation. Our experiments open a path towards mimicking relativistic mechanics and developing programmable spatio-temporal transformations of light.</description>

      <title>Engineering Efficient Light Sources for Silicon Photonics: III-V Nano-heterostructures Monolithically Grown on Silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The demand for advanced photonics technology is increasing rapidly, fueled by the necessity for high-performance and cost-effective optical information processing systems extending into the quantum domain. Silicon, benefiting from its mature fabrication processes, stands as an ideal platform. However, its inherent indirect bandgap leads to inefficient light emission. To overcome this drawback, the integration of III-V materials has proven essential. These materials are recognized for their efficient light emission and superior bandgap engineering capabilities, making them indispensable in photonics and beyond. Here, we present the monolithic integration of small-volume III-V nano-heterostructures with silicon via selective area epitaxy in the pyramidal openings etched in (100)-oriented silicon substrate. The precise positioning of the nano-heterostructures is achieved using electron beam lithography. Our atomic resolution imaging and chemical analysis confirm the epitaxial nature of InP growth, revealing well-defined heterointerfaces. Each structure incorporates an InAsP quantum dot-like active medium. Optical characterization and eight-band kp calculations demonstrate energy level quantization in three spatial dimensions. The heterostructures can be engineered to cover the entire telecom wavelength range. Consequently, these InAsP/InP nano-heterostructures could serve as a gain medium for silicon-based hybrid nano-lases and nanoLED as well as quantum light sources in the telecom wavelength range.</description>

      <title>Optical Diffusion Models for Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models generate new samples by progressively decreasing the noise from the initially provided random distribution. This inference procedure generally utilizes a trained neural network numerous times to obtain the final output, creating significant latency and energy consumption on digital electronic hardware such as GPUs. In this study, we demonstrate that the propagation of a light beam through a semi-transparent medium can be programmed to implement a denoising diffusion model on image samples. This framework projects noisy image patterns through passive diffractive optical layers, which collectively only transmit the predicted noise term in the image. The optical transparent layers, which are trained with an online training approach, backpropagating the error to the analytical model of the system, are passive and kept the same across different steps of denoising. Hence this method enables high-speed image generation with minimal power consumption, benefiting from the bandwidth and energy efficiency of optical information processing.</description>

      <title>Non-Reciprocal Response in Silicon Photonic Resonators Integrated with 2D CuCrP2S6 at Short-Wave Infrared</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving non-reciprocal optical behavior in integrated photonics with high efficiency has long been a challenge. Here, we demonstrate a non-reciprocal magneto-optic response by integrating multilayer 2D CuCrP2S6 (CCPS) onto silicon micro ring resonators (MRRs).Under an applied magnetic field, the CCPS intralayer ferromagnetic ordering, characterized by easy-plane magneto-crystalline anisotropy, induces asymmetrical modal responses in the clockwise (CW)and counterclockwise (CCW) light propagation directions. The proposed configuration achieves a low insertion loss of 0.15 dB and a high isolation ratio of 28 dB at 1550 nm. Notably, it exhibits a significant resonance wavelength splitting of 0.4 nm between the counter propagation directions, supporting a 50 GHz optical bandwidth. Operating directly in the transverse electric (TE) mode, it aligns with the main polarization used in silicon photonics circuit, eliminating the need for additional polarization management. The device is ultra-compact, with 2D flake interaction length ranging from 22 um to 55 um and a thickness between 39 nm and 62 nm. Its operation range covers the entire C-band with a bandwidth of up to 100 nm. These attributes make our hybrid CCPS/Si device ideal for advanced non-reciprocal optical applications in the short-wave infrared (SWIR)spectrum, crucial for enhancing the resilience of optical systems against back-reflections.</description>

      <title>Superradiance from Nitrogen Vacancy Centers Coupled to An Ultranarrow Optical Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have been successfully coupled to various optical structures to enhance their radiation by the Purcell effect. The participation of many NV centers in these studies may naturally lead to cooperative emission and superradiance, and our recent experimental study with a diamond membrane in a fiber-based ultra-narrow optical cavity demonstrated nonlinear radiation power and fast photon bunching which are signatures of such collective effects. In this theoretical article, we go beyond the simple model used in the previous study to address more phenomena, such as the appearance of bunching shoulders in the second-order correlation function, Rabi splitting in the steady-state spectrum, and population dynamics on excited Dicke states, which for moderate pumping explains the observed collective effects. Overall, our results can guide further experiments with NV centers, and they are also relevant for other solid-state color centers, such as silicon-vacancy centers in diamond and silicon carbide, boron-vacancy centers and carbon-related centers in hexagonal boron-nitride.</description>

      <title>Quantum Beam Splitter as a Quantum Coherence Controller</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a quantum beam splitter (QBS) with tunable reflection and transmission coefficients. More importantly, our device based on a Hermitian parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetric system enables the generation and manipulation of asymmetric quantum coherence of the output photons. For the interference of two weak coherent-state inputs, our QBS can produce anti-bunched photons from one output port and bunched photons from the other, showcasing high parity asymmetry and strong coherence control capabilities. Beyond the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect, perfect photon blockade with vanishing $g^{(2)}(0)$ is achievable in two-photon interference. These striking effects of the QBS fundamentally arise from the parity-symmetry-breaking interaction and the quantum interference between the photon scattering channels. Our results could inspire novel applications and the development of innovative photonic devices for the manipulation of weak quantum light.</description>

      <title>The Lugiato-Lefever equation driven by a double tightly focused pump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a model of an optical cavity based on the one-dimensional Lugiato-Lefever (LL) equation, which includes the pump represented by a symmetric pair of tightly localized "hot spots" (HSs) with phase shift $\chi $ between them, and self-focusing or defocusing cubic nonlinearity. Families of bound states, pinned to the double HS, are found in the system's parameter space. They feature the effect of the symmetry breaking (SB) between peaks pinned to individual HSs, provided that the phase shift takes values $0&lt;\chi &lt;\pi $, and the LL equation includes the loss term. The SB, which is explained analytically, takes place in the full LL model and its linearized version alike. The same phenomenology is also explored in the framework of the LL equation with the double HS and quintic self-focusing. In that case, there are stable symmetric and asymmetric bound states, in spite of the presence of the background instability driven by the critical collapse.</description>

      <title>Progress and Perspectives on Weak-value Amplification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weak-value amplification (WVA) is a metrological protocol that effectively amplifies ultra-small physical effects, making it highly applicable in the fields of quantum sensing and metrology. However, the amplification effect is achieved through post-selection, which leads to a significant decrease in signal intensity. Consequently, there is a heated debate regarding the trade-off between the amplification effect and the success probability of post-selection, questioning whether WVA surpasses conventional measurement (CM) in terms of measurement precision. Extensive research indicates that the specific theoretical assumptions and experimental conditions play crucial roles in determining the respective advantages of WVA and CM. WVA provides new perspectives for recognizing the important role of post-selection in precision metrology. It demonstrates significant advantages in two aspects: (i) WVA based on the phase space interaction provides feasible strategies to practically achieve the Heisenberg-scaling precision using only classical resources. (ii) WVA exhibits robustness against certain types of technical noise and imperfections of detectors. Moreover, WVA allows for various modifications to extend the applicable scope and enhance the metrological performance in corresponding situations. Despite substantial progress in recent years, the inherent connection between the advantages of WVA and its unique features remains incompletely understood. In this paper, we systematically review the recent advances in the WVA scheme, with a particular focus on the ultimate precision of WVA under diverse conditions. Our objective is to provide a comprehensive perspective on the benefits of WVA in precision measurement and facilitate the realization of its full potential.</description>

Abstract: We build Floquet-driven capactive circuit networks to realize topological states of matter in the frequency domain. We find the Floquet circuit network equations of motion to reveal a potential barrier which effectively acts as a boundary in frequency space. By implementing a Su-Shrieffer-Heeger Floquet lattice model and measuring the associated circuit Laplacian and characteristic resonances, we demonstrate how topological edge modes can nucleate at such a frequency boundary.</description>

      <title>Coincidence detection for photon triplet sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photon triplet generation based on third-order spontaneous parametric down-conversion remains as an experimental challenge. The challenge stems from the trade-offs between source brightness and instrument noise. This work presents a probability theory of coincidence detection to address the detection limit in source characterization. We use Bayes' theorem to model instruments as a noisy communication channel and apply statistical inference to identify the minimum detectable coincidence rate. A triplet generation rate of 1-100 Hz is required for source characterization performed over 1-72 hours using superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors.</description>

      <title>Room temperature operation of germanium-silicon single-photon avalanche diode</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to detect single photons has led to the advancement of numerous research fields. Although various types of single-photon detector have been developed, because of two main factors - that is, (1) the need for operating at cryogenic temperature and (2) the incompatibility with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication processes - so far, to our knowledge, only Si-based single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) has gained mainstream success and has been used in consumer electronics. With the growing demand to shift the operation wavelength from near-infrared to short-wavelength infrared (SWIR) for better safety and performance, an alternative solution is required because Si has negligible optical absorption for wavelengths beyond 1 {\mu}m. Here we report a CMOS-compatible, high-performing germanium-silicon SPAD operated at room temperature, featuring a noise-equivalent power improvement over the previous Ge-based SPADs by 2-3.5 orders of magnitude. Key parameters such as dark count rate, single-photon detection probability at 1,310 nm, timing jitter, after-pulsing characteristic time and after-pulsing probability are, respectively, measured as 19 kHz {\mu}m^2, 12%, 188 ps, ~90 ns and &lt;1%, with a low breakdown voltage of 10.26 V and a small excess bias of 0.75 V. Three-dimensional point-cloud images are captured with direct time-of-flight technique as proof of concept. This work paves the way towards using single-photon-sensitive SWIR sensors, imagers and photonic integrated circuits in everyday life.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the framework of non-Hermitian photonics, we investigate the interplay between disorder and non-Hermiticity in a one-dimensional Hatano-Nelson lattice. While Anderson localization dictates the wave's evolution in conservative random systems, the introduction of non-Hermiticity tends to force the beam to unidirectionally propagate towards one edge of the potential due to the existence of skin modes. As we show, the antagonism between these effects results in qualitatively distinct phases of wave diffraction, including counter-intuitive characteristics regarding the relationship between the strength of disorder and the wavepacket's velocity.</description>

      <title>Induction of non-Fermi liquids by critical cavity photons at the onset of superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of a non-Fermi liquid (NFL) at a putative quantum critical point signalling the onset of superradiance, in a set-up involving cavity quantum electrodynamics. Although the finiteness of the cavity, being bounded by reflecting mirrors, endows the cavity photons with an effective mass, they become massless at the continuous phase transition point. We consider the matter part coming from the fermions hopping on a honeycomb lattice near half-filling, featuring doped Dirac cones at two sets of inequivalent valleys. This choice is dictated by the presence of a fermion-boson interaction vertex which can give rise to Landau damping of the critical bosons, eventually leading to an NFL phase for the fermions. To set up the quantum effective action, we identify the hot spots of the generically anisotropic (trigonally-warped) Fermi surfaces, which are the set of points having parallel/antiparallel tangent vectors. The cavity photons act as charge density wave (CDW) order parameters, connecting pairs of hot spots belonging to the Fermi surface of a single valley. With these ingredients, we have set upon identifying NFL phases, using the tools of dimensional regularization and renormalization-group-flow equations. Our final results indicate that stable NFL phases exist in the low-energy limit.</description>

Abstract: The most complicated and challenging system within a light-pulse atom interferometer (LPAI) is the laser system, which controls the frequencies and intensities of multiple laser beams over time to configure quantum gravity and inertial sensors. The main function of an LPAI laser system is to perform cold-atom generation, state-preparation, state-selective detection and to generate coherent two-photon process for the light-pulse sequence. Substantial miniaturization and ruggedization of the laser system can be achieved by bringing most key functions of the laser system onto photonic integrated circuit (PIC). We demonstrate a high-performance silicon photonic suppressed-carrier single-sideband (SC-SSB) modulator at 1560 nm, which can dynamically frequency shift within the LPAI. With independent RF-channel control, we study the imbalances in both the optical and RF phases/amplitudes to reach 30 dB carrier-suppression, unprecedented 47.8 dB sideband-suppression at peak conversion-efficiency: -6.846 dB (20.7 %). Using a silicon photonic SSB-modulator, we demonstrate cold-atom generation, state-selective detection, and atom interferometer fringes to estimate gravitational acceleration, $g \approx 9.77 \pm 0.01 \,\rm{m/s^2}$, in a Rubidium ($^{87}$Rb) atom system.</description>

      <title>Theory of Transverse Mode Instability in Fiber Amplifiers with Multimode Excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transverse Mode Instability (TMI) which results from dynamic nonlinear thermo-optical scattering is the primary limitation to power scaling in high-power fiber lasers and amplifiers. It has been proposed that TMI can be suppressed by exciting multiple modes in a highly multimode fiber. We derive a semi-analytic frequency-domain theory of the threshold for the onset of TMI under arbitrary multimode input excitation for general fiber geometries. We show that TMI results from exponential growth of noise in all the modes at downshifted frequencies due to the thermo-optical coupling. The noise growth rate in each mode is given by the sum of signal powers in various modes weighted by pairwise thermo-optical coupling coefficients. We calculate thermo-optical coupling coefficients for all $\sim$$10^4$ pairs of modes in a standard circular multimode fiber and show that modes with large transverse spatial frequency mismatch are weakly coupled resulting in a banded coupling matrix. This short-range behavior is due to the diffusive nature of the heat propagation which mediates the coupling and leads to a lower noise growth rate upon multimode excitation compared to single mode, resulting in significant TMI suppression. We find that the TMI threshold increases linearly with the number of modes that are excited, leading to more than an order of magnitude increase in the TMI threshold in a 82-mode fiber amplifier. Using our theory, we also calculate TMI threshold in fibers with non-circular geometries upon multimode excitation and show the linear scaling of TMI threshold to be a universal property of different fibers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) laser frequency stabilization is a powerful technique widely used for building narrow-linewidth lasers. This technique is however ineffective in suppressing high-frequency (&gt;100~kHz) laser phase noise detrimental for many applications. Here, we introduce an effective method which can greatly enhance its high-frequency performance. The idea is to recycle the residual PDH signal of a laser locked to a cavity, by feedforwarding it directly to the laser output field after a delay fiber. Using this straightforward method, we demonstrate a phase noise suppression capability about 4 orders of magnitude better than just using usual PDH feedback for phase noise around a few MHz. We further find that this method exhibits noise suppression performance equivalent to cavity filtering. The new method holds great promise for applications demanding highly stable lasers with diminished phase noise up to tens of MHz, e.g. precise and high-speed control of atomic and molecular quantum states.</description>

      <title>Digital Signal Processing Techniques for Noise Characterization of Lasers and Optical Frequency Combs: A Tutorial</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Performing noise characterizations of lasers and optical frequency combs on sampled data offers numerous advantages compared to analog measurement techniques. One of the main advantages is that the measurement setup is greatly simplified. Only a balanced detector followed by an analog-to-digital converter is needed, allowing all the complexity to be moved to the digital domain. Secondly, near-optimal phase estimators are efficiently implementable, providing accurate phase noise estimation in the presence of the measurement noise. Finally, joint processing of multiple comb lines is feasible, enabling computation of phase noise correlation matrix, which includes all information about the phase noise of the optical frequency comb. This tutorial introduces a framework based on digital signal processing for phase noise characterization of lasers and optical frequency combs. The framework is based on the extended Kalman filter (EKF) and automatic differentiation. The EKF is a near-optimal estimator of the optical phase in the presence of measurement noise, making it very suitable for phase noise measurements. Automatic differentiation is key to efficiently optimizing many parameters entering the EKF framework. More specifically, the combination of EKF and automatic differentiation enables the efficient optimization of phase noise measurement for optical frequency combs with arbitrarily complex noise dynamics that may include many free parameters. We show the framework's efficacy through simulations and experimental data, showcasing its application across various comb types and in dual-comb measurements, highlighting its accuracy and versatility. Finally, we discuss its capability for digital phase noise compensation, which is highly relevant to free-running dual-comb spectroscopy applications.</description>

      <title>Resource-efficient Direct Characterization of General Density Matrix</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.06903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sequential weak measurements allow the direct extraction of individual density-matrix elements instead of globally reconstructing the whole density matrix, opening a new avenue for the characterization of quantum systems. Nevertheless, the requirement of multiple coupling for each qudit of quantum systems and the lack of appropriate precision evaluation constraint its applicability extension, especially for multi-qudit quantum systems. Here, we propose a resource-efficient scheme (RES) to directly characterize the density matrix of general multi-qudit systems, which not only optimizes the measurements but also establishes a feasible estimation analysis. In this scheme, an efficient observable of quantum system is constructed such that a single meter state coupled to each qudit is sufficient to extract the corresponding density-matrix element. An appropriate model based on the statistical distribution of errors are used to evaluate the precision and feasibility of the scheme. We experimentally apply the RES to the direct characterization of general single-photon qutrit states and two-photon entangled states. The results show that the RES outperforms the sequential schemes in terms of efficiency and precision in both weak- and strong- coupling scenarios. This work sheds new light on the practical characterization of large-scale quantum systems and investigation of their non-classical properties.</description>

Abstract: A method is proposed to produce a classical optical state that is `intersystem nonseparable' and a close analog of the $\phi^+$ Bell state. A derivation of the CHSH-Bell inequality is sketched within the framework of classical polarization optics, using non-contextuality for factorizable states as an axiom rather than any hidden variable theory. It is shown that the classical state violates this inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emergent collective modes in lattices give birth to many intriguing physical phenomena in condensed matter physics. Among these collective modes, large-area modes typically feature small-level spacings, while a mode with stable frequency tends to be spatially tightly confined. Here, we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate a spectral-isolated photonic topological corner mode with a tunable mode area and stable frequency in a two-dimensional photonic crystal. This mode emerges from hybridizing the large-area homogeneous mode and in-gap topological corner modes. Remarkably, this large-area homogeneous mode possesses unique chirality and has a tunable mode area under the change of the mass term of the inner topological non-trivial lattice. We experimentally observe such topological large-area corner modes(TLCM) in a 2D photonic system and demonstrate the robustness by introducing disorders in the structure. Our findings have propelled the forefront of higher-order topology research, transitioning it from single-lattice systems to multi-lattice systems. They may support promising potential applications, particularly in vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02153v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The soliton-like superradiant regime of free-electron lasers (FEL) offers a promising path towards ultrashort pulses, beyond the natural limit dictated by the bandwidth of the high-gain FEL instability. In this work we present a three-dimensional theory of the superradiant regime, including the effects of beam emittance and energy spread. Our work takes advantage of recent developments in non-linear FEL theory to provide a fully analytical description of soliton-like superradiance. Our theory proves the existence of a diffraction-dominated steady-state regime in which the superradiant peak power grows indefinitely while leaving the pulse duration and on-axis intensity almost unchanged. These results are in excellent agreement with three-dimensional simulations and are supported by recent experimental results at the Linac Coherent Light Source. This work advances non-linear FEL theory and provides a theoretical framework for the next generation of attosecond x-ray FELs.</description>

      <title>High-harmonic generation in graphene under the application of a DC electric current: From perturbative to nonperturbative regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate high-harmonic generation (HHG) in honeycomb-lattice graphene models when subjected to a DC electric field. By integrating the quantum master equation with the Boltzmann equation, we develop a numerical method to compute laser-driven dynamics in many-electron lattice systems under DC electric current. The method enables us to treat both the weak-laser (perturbative) and intense-laser (nonperturbative) regimes in a unified way, accounting for the experimentally inevitable dissipation effects. From it, we obtain the HHG spectra and analyze their dependence on laser frequency, laser intensity, laser-field direction, and DC current strength. We show that the dynamical and static symmetries are partially broken by a DC current or staggered potential term, and such symmetry breakings drastically change the shape of the HHG spectra, especially in terms of the presence or absence of $(2n+1)$th-, $2n$th-, or $3n$th-order harmonics ($n\in \mathbb Z$). The laser intensity, frequency, and polarization are also shown to affect the shape of the HHG spectra. Our findings indicate that HHG spectra in conducting electron systems can be quantitatively or qualitatively controlled by tuning various external parameters, and DC electric current is used as such an efficient parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The presence of an absorber in one of the paths of an interferometer changes the output statistics of that interferometer in a fundamental manner. Since the individual quantum particles detected at any of the outputs of the interferometer have not been absorbed, any non-trivial effect of the absorber on the distribution of these particles over these paths is a counterfactual effect. Here, we quantify counterfactual effects by evaluating the information about the presence or absence of the absorber obtained from the output statistics, distinguishing between classical and quantum counterfactual effects. We identify the counterfactual gain which quantifies the advantage of quantum counterfactual protocols over classical counterfactual protocols, and show that this counterfactual gain can be separated into two terms: a semi-classical term related to the amplitude blocked by the absorber, and a Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability assigning a joint probability to the blocked path and the output port. A negative Kirkwood-Dirac term between a path and an output port indicates that inserting the absorber into that path will have a focussing effect, increasing the probability of particles arriving at that output port, resulting in a significant enhancement of the counterfactual gain. We show that the magnitude of quantum counterfactual effects cannot be explained by a simple removal of the absorbed particles, but originates instead from a well-defined back-action effect caused by the presence of the absorber in one path, on particles in other paths.</description>

      <title>Microwave Cavity Mode Optimisation by Background Anti-Resonance Tuning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To derive the best oscillator phase noise when implementing a high-Q resonator, the spectral line-shape must have high contrast and symmetry. Ideally, this line-shape is Lorentzian, however, in a high mode density spectral region, low-Q background spurious modes interact and distort the resonance. For a sapphire-loaded cavity resonator operating with whispering gallery modes we show that this high contrast and symmetry can be achieved by changing the dimensions of the surrounding cavity shield to tune the background low-Q structures into anti-resonance. This works because the high-Q resonances are primarily defined by the sapphire while the background modes are defined by the cavity shield. Alternatively, it was shown that a similar result can be achieved by exciting the high-Q resonator with a balanced microwave dipole probe in a Mach Zehnder interferometric configuration. The probe was constructed from two separate coaxial electric field probes symmetrically inserted into a cylindrical cavity resonator, from opposite sides with a small gap between them, so they can behave like an active wire dipole antenna. The power into the two separate probes may be matched with an external variable attenuator in one of the arms of the interferometer. Conversely, the phase between the two electric field probes may be changed with an external variable phase shifter, which changes the nature of the field components the probe couples to. The probe couples to the high-Q resonant modes as well as low-Q background modes, which can be made resonant or anti-resonant for the high-Q modes by changing this external phase. When the background modes are in anti-resonance the line shape of the high-Q mode can be made symmetric and with higher contrast. This technique was applied to both whispering gallery sapphire modes, as well as hollow cavity resonators, without changing the dimensions of the cavity.</description>

Abstract: Neuromorphic (brain-inspired) photonics leverages photonic chips to accelerate artificial intelligence, offering high-speed and energy efficient solutions in RF communication, tensor processing, and data classification. However, the limited physical size of integrated photonic hardware constrains network complexity and computational capacity. In light of recent advances in photonic quantum technology, it is natural to utilize quantum exponential speedup to scale photonic neural network capabilities. Here we show a combination of classical network layers with trainable continuous variable quantum circuits yields hybrid networks with improved trainability and accuracy. On a classification task, hybrid networks achieve the same performance when benchmarked against fully classical networks that are twice the size. When the bit precision of the optimized networks is reduced through added noise, the hybrid networks still achieve greater accuracy when evaluated at state of the art bit precision. These hybrid quantum classical networks demonstrate a unique route to improve computational capacity of integrated photonic neural networks without increasing the physical network size.</description>

      <title>Modeling of Hot-Carrier Degradation driven by silicon-hydrogen bond dissociation in SPADs</title>

Abstract: A novel approach for modeling Dark Count Rate (DCR) drift in Single-Photon Avalanche Diodes (SPADs) is proposed based on Hot-Carrier Degradation (HCD) inducing silicon-hydrogen bond dissociation at the Si/SiO2 interface. The energy and the quantity of hot-carriers are modeled by the interplay of carrier energy distribution and current density. The carrier energy distribution, achieved by a Full-Band Monte-Carlo simulation considering the band structure and the scattering mechanisms, establishes a crucial link to the degradation of the top SPAD interface, primarily influenced by hot electrons due to their broader energy spread. The current density is determined by analyzing the generation rates of carriers under dark and photo conditions, along with the multiplication rate, through a combination of experimental data and modeling techniques. Subsequently,these hot carriers are correlated with the distribution of bond dissociation energy, which is modeled by the disorder-induced local variations among the Si-H bond energy at the Si/SiO2 interface. The impact-ionization probability between hot carriers and Si-H bonds is then calculated by differentiating their energies, thereby determining the degradation kinetics. This enables the capture of the rise in dark current density with stress duration by the increasing number of defects, which in turn affects the modeling of degradation rate. For the first time, a direct correlation between the dark current and DCR, along with their drift over stress time, has been established, relying on the carrier generation rate originating from these defects together with the position-dependent breakdown probability Pt.This physic-based model allows to predict DCR for unprecedented long-term stress measurement time up to 10e6s, covering a whole set of characterization and stress conditions for SPAD devices.</description>
