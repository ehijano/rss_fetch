      <title>Production of Iodine Isotopes via Ultra-intense Laser Driven Photonuclear Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The investigation and production of proton-rich iodine isotopes predominantly rely on conventional accelerator-based methods, typically requiring prolonged irradiation periods to measure or achieve quantifiable yields for isotopic isolation. Bremsstrahlung radiation sources generated by high-power laser-plasma-accelerated electron beams with ultrahigh charge (tens of nanocoulombs) bombarding high-Z targets demonstrate extraordinary photon flux characteristics. An electron beam with a total charge of approximately 47.7 nC (E$_e$ $\gt$ 10.4 MeV) was generated in our experiment by focusing a ultra-intense laser pulse onto a deuterium gas jet. Laser-driven bremsstrahlung was employed to induce $^{127}I$$(\gamma,xn)$ ($x$ = 1,3,4,6-8), and the product yields and the corresponding flux-weighted average cross sections are reported. Our results demonstrate production of medical isotopes, with average yields of $^{124}$I and $^{123}$I at approximately $9.83\pm0.45\times10^{5}$/shot and $2.81\pm0.11\times10^{5}$/shot, respectively. This method, utilizing high-power lasers to generate bremsstrahlung radiation, shows significant potential for medical applications and opens new avenues for studying photonuclear processes in astrophysical contexts.</description>

      <title>Probing Spin-Lifetime Correlations in Entangled Hyperon-AntiHyperon Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement has now been demonstrated in several hadronic systems, revealing that non-classical spin correlations survive even through the strong-interaction hadronization process. To date, however, all studies have focused exclusively on angular observables, leaving the possibility untouched that quantum coherence might also influence the decay times of entangled partners. In this work we propose two data-driven tests - relative and absolute lifetime correlations - for Lambda-antiLambda pairs produced in high-energy collisions. By examining the opening-angle distribution in slices of Delta t and constructing a pair-wise lifetime correlator, we search for deviations from independent exponential decay that align with known spin correlations. Successful observation of lifetime correlations between entangled partners would demand a fundamental revision of quantum mechanics' framework for entanglement, extending the concept beyond its current theoretical boundaries.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional position reconstruction of orthogonal-strip planar high-purity germanium detectors using maximum likelihood estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orthogonal-strip planar high-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors can reconstruct three-dimensional (3D) positions of photon interactions through analysis of parameters extracted from multiple charge signals. The conventional method independently reconstructs positions in each dimension using amplitude-based parameters, leading to noise sensitivity and systematic biases. In this study, we propose a multi-parameter-joint reconstruction method based on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) which establishes a mapping between pulse shape parameters and corresponding 3D positions. To mitigate the effects of electronic noise, we employ integral-based parameters. The reconstruction performance was evaluated using pulse shape simulations. For 100 keV photons under 1 keV root-mean-square (RMS) electronic noise, the maximum Z reconstruction bias was reduced from 0.4 mm to 0.02 mm in the central region and from 2 mm to 0.15 mm near the electrodes. The maximum reconstruction bias in the X/Y directions was reduced from 0.4 mm to 0.016 mm. Furthermore, the use of integral-based parameters mitigated the rapid degradation of resolution under high-noise conditions. The achieved position resolution ranged from 0.07 mm to 0.16 mm in the Z directions and from 0.07 mm to 0.44 mm in the X/Y direction. This method offers a promising approach to 3D position reconstruction with HPGe detectors for applications such as medical imaging and gamma-ray astronomy.</description>

      <title>A new scheme for isomer pumping and depletion with high-power lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel scheme for the population and depletion of nuclear isomers. The scheme combines the $\gamma$-photons with energies $\gtrsim 10$ keV emitted during the interaction of a contemporary high-intensity laser pulse with a plasma and one or multiple photon beams supplied by intense lasers. Due to nonlinear effects, two- or multi-photon absorption dominates over the conventional multi-step one-photon process for an optimized gamma flash. Moreover, this nonlinear effect can be greatly enhanced with the help of externally supplied low-energy photons coming from another laser. These low-energy photons act such that the effective cross-section experienced by the $\gamma$-photons becomes tunable, growing with the intensity $I_0$ of the beam. Assuming $I_{0}\sim 10^{18}$ Wcm$^{-2}$ for the photon beam, an effective cross-section as large as $10^{-21}$ cm$^2$ to $10^{-28}$ cm$^2$ for the $\gamma-$photon can be achieved. Thus, within state-of-the-art 10 PW laser facilities, the yields from two-photon absorption can reach $10^6$ to $10^9$ isomers per shot for selected states that are separated from their ground state by E2 transitions. Similar yields for transitions with higher multipolarities can be accommodated by multi-photon absorption with additional photons provided.</description>

      <title>Commissioning of a radiofrequency quadrupole cooler-buncher for collinear laser spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10740v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A RadioFrequency Quadrupole (RFQ) cooler-buncher system has been developed and implemented in a collinear laser spectroscopy setup. This system is dedicated to convert a continuous ion beam into short bunches, while enhancing beam quality and reducing energy spread. The functionality of the RFQ cooler-buncher has been verified through offline tests with stable rubidium and indium beam, delivered from a surface ion source and a laser ablation ion source, respectively. With a transmission efficiency exceeding 60\%, bunched ion beams with a full width at half maximum of approximately 2~$\mu$s in the time-of-flight spectrum have been successfully achieved. The implementation of the RFQ cooler-buncher system also significantly improves the overall transmission efficiency of the collinear laser spectroscopy setup.</description>
