      <title>Parametrized higher semiadditivity and the universality of spans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the framework of ambidexterity developed by Hopkins and Lurie, we introduce a parametrized analogue of higher semiadditivity called $\mathcal Q$-semiadditivity, depending on a chosen class of morphisms $\mathcal Q$. Our first main result identifies the free $\mathcal Q$-semiadditive parametrized category on a single generator with a certain parametrized span category $\underline{\mathrm{Span}}(\mathcal Q)$, simultaneously generalizing a result of Harpaz in the non-parametrized setting and a result of Nardin in the equivariant setting. As a consequence, we deduce that the $\mathcal Q$-semiadditive completion of a parametrized category $\mathcal C$ consists of the $\mathcal Q$-commutative monoids in $\mathcal C$, defined as $\mathcal Q$-limit preserving parametrized functors from $\underline{\mathrm{Span}}(\mathcal Q)$ to $\mathcal C$.
  As our second main result, we provide an explicit `Mackey sheaf' description of the free presentable $\mathcal Q$-semiadditive category. Using this, we reprove the Mackey functor description of global spectra first obtained by the second-named author and generalize it to $G$-global spectra. Moreover, we obtain universal characterizations of the categories of $\mathbb Z$-valued $G$-Mackey profunctors and of quasi-finitely genuine $G$-spectra as studied by Kaledin and Krause-McCandless-Nikolaus, respectively.</description>

      <title>Presenting the topological stratified homotopy hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is concerned with three different homotopy theories of stratified spaces: The one defined by Douteau and Henriques, the one defined by Haine, and the one defined by Nand-Lal. One of the central questions concerning these theories has been how precisely they connect with geometric and topological examples of stratified spaces, such as piecewise linear pseudomanifolds, Whitney stratified spaces, or more recently Ayala, Francis and Tanaka's conically smooth stratified spaces. More precisely, so far, it has been an open question whether there exist (semi)model structures on stratified topological spaces that present these theories, in which such relevant examples of stratified spaces are bifibrant. Here, we prove an affirmative answer to this question. As a consequence, we obtain a model categorical interpretation of a stratified homotopy hypothesis. Specifically, we show that Lurie's stratified singular simplicial set functor induces a Quillen equivalence between the semimodel category of stratified topological spaces presenting Nand-Lal's homotopy theory of stratified spaces and the left Bousfield localization of the Joyal model structure that corresponds to such $\infty$-categories in which every endomorphism is an isomorphism. We then perform a detailed investigation of bifibrant objects in these model structures of stratified spaces, proving a series of detection criteria and illuminating the relationship to Quinn's homotopically stratified spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using Patchkoria--Pstr\k{a}gowski's version of Franke's algebraicity theorem, we prove that the category of $K_p(n)$-local spectra is exotically equivalent to the category of derived $I_n$-complete periodic comodules over the Adams Hopf algebroid $(E_*, E_*E)$ for large primes. This gives a finite prime result analogous to the asymptotic algebraicity for $\mathrm{Sp}_{K_p(n)}$ of Barthel--Schlank--Stapleton.</description>

      <title>A symplectic Hilbert-Smith conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove new cases of the Hilbert-Smith conjecture for actions by natural homeomorphisms in symplectic topology. Specifically, we prove that the group of $p$-adic integers $\mathbb Z_p$ does not admit non-trivial continuous actions by Hamiltonian homeomorphisms, the $C^0$ limits of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms, on symplectically aspherical symplectic manifolds. For a class of symplectic manifolds, including all standard symplectic tori, we deduce that a locally compact group acting faithfully by homeomorphisms in the $C^0$ closure of time-one maps of symplectic isotopies must be a Lie group. Our methods of proof differ from prior approaches to the question and involve barcodes and power operations in Floer cohomology. They also apply to other natural metrics in symplectic topology, notably Hofer's metric. An appendix by Leonid Polterovich uses this to deduce obstructions on Hamiltonian actions by semi-simple $p$-adic analytic groups.</description>

      <title>Spherical $p$-group complexes arising from finite groups of Lie type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the $p$-group complex of a finite group $G$ is homotopy equivalent to a wedge of spheres of dimension at most $n$ if $G$ contains a self-centralising normal subgroup $H$ which is isomorphic to a group of Lie type and Lie rank $n$ in characteristic $p$. If in addition every order-$p$ element of $G$ induces an inner or field automorphism on $H$, the $p$-group complex of $G$ is $G$-homotopy equivalent to a spherical complex obtained from the Tits building of $H$.
  We also prove that the reduced Euler characteristic of the $p$-group complex of a finite group $G$ is non-zero if $G$ has trivial $p$-core and $H$ is a self-centralising normal subgroup of $G$ which is a group of Lie type (in any characteristic), except possibly when $p=2$ and $H=A_n(4^a)$ ($n\geq 2$) or $E_6(4^a)$. In particular, we conclude that the Euler characteristic of the $p$-group complex of an almost simple group does not vanish for $p\geq 7$.</description>

      <title>Homological stability for the Cremona groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Cremona groups are the groups of all birational equivalences of projective spaces and, equivalently, the automorphism groups of the rational function fields. We construct highly connected spaces on which these groups act in a way that allows us to deduce that their abelianisations, and more generally, the homologies of these groups, stabilise as the dimension increases.</description>

      <title>Topological Data Analysis of Monopoles in $U(1)$ Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In $4$-dimensional pure compact $U(1)$ lattice gauge theory, we analyse topological aspects of the dynamics of monopoles across the deconfinement phase transition. We do this using tools from Topological Data Analysis (TDA). We demonstrate that observables constructed from the zeroth and first homology groups of monopole current networks may be used to quantitatively and robustly locate the critical inverse coupling $\beta_{c}$ through finite-size scaling. Our method provides a mathematically robust framework for the characterisation of topological invariants related to monopole currents, putting on firmer ground earlier investigations. Moreover, our approach can be generalised to the study of Abelian monopoles in non-Abelian gauge theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.08617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study notions of bigraded formality for the algebra of forms on a complex manifold, along with their relation to higher Aeppli-Bott-Chern-Massey products which extend the case of triple products studied by Angella-Tomassini. We show that these Aeppli-Bott-Chern-Massey products on complex manifolds pull back non-trivially to the blow-up along a complex submanifold, as long their degree is less than the real codimension of the submanifold.</description>

      <title>On sequential versions of distributional topological complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a (non-decreasing) sequence $\{d\mathsf{TC}_m(X)\}_{m\ge 2}$ of higher versions of distributional topological complexity ($d\mathsf{TC}$) of a space $X$ introduced by Dranishnikov and Jauhari. This sequence generalizes $d\mathsf{TC}(X)$ in the sense that $d\mathsf{TC}_2(X) = d\mathsf{TC}(X)$, and is a direct analog to the classical sequence $\{\mathsf{TC}_m(X)\}_{m\ge 2}$. We show that like $\mathsf{TC}_m$ and $d\mathsf{TC}$, the sequential versions $d\mathsf{TC}_m$ are also homotopy invariants. Also, $d\mathsf{TC}_m(X)$ relates with the distributional LS-category ($d\mathsf{cat}$) of products of $X$ in the same way as $\mathsf{TC}_m(X)$ relates with the classical LS-category ($\mathsf{cat}$) of products of $X$. We show that in general, $d\mathsf{TC}_m$ is a different concept than $\mathsf{TC}_m$ for each $m \ge 2$, but we also provide various examples of spaces $X$ for which the sequences $\{\mathsf{TC}_m(X)\}_{m\ge 2}$ and $\{d\mathsf{TC}_m(X)\}_{m\ge 2}$ coincide.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.08998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of the power quandle of a group, an algebraic structure that forgets the multiplication but keeps the conjugation and the power maps. Compared with plain quandles, power quandles are much better invariants of groups. We show that they determine the central quotient of any group and the center of any finite group. Any group can be canonically approximated by the associated group of its power quandle, which we show to be a central extension, with a universal property, and a computable kernel. This allows us to present any group as a quotient of a group with a power-conjugation presentation by an abelian subgroup that is determined by the power quandle and low-dimensional homological invariants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.00798v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a Clifford algebra bundle formed from the tangent bundle of the smooth loop space of a Riemannian manifold, which is a bundle of super von Neumann algebras on the loop space. We show that this bundle is in general non-trivial, more precisely that its triviality is obstructed by the transgressions of the second Stiefel-Whitney class and the first (fractional) Pontrjagin class of the manifold.</description>

      <title>Two-sided cartesian fibrations of synthetic $(\infty,1)$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.00938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.00938v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the framework of Riehl-Shulman's synthetic $(\infty,1)$-category theory, we present a theory of two-sided cartesian fibrations. Central results are several characterizations of the two-sidedness condition \`{a} la Chevalley, Gray, Street, and Riehl-Verity, a two-sided Yoneda Lemma, as well as the proof of several closure properties.
  Along the way, we also define and investigate a notion of fibered or sliced fibration which is used later to develop the two-sided case in a modular fashion. We also briefly discuss discrete two-sided cartesian fibrations in this setting, corresponding to $(\infty,1)$-distributors.
  The systematics of our definitions and results closely follows Riehl-Verity's $\infty$-cosmos theory, but formulated internally to Riehl-Shulman's simplicial extension of homotopy type theory. All the constructions and proofs in this framework are by design invariant under homotopy equivalence. Semantically, the synthetic $(\infty,1)$-categories correspond to internal $(\infty,1)$-categories implemented as Rezk objects in an arbitrary given $(\infty,1)$-topos.</description>

Abstract: An example of Cornalba and Shiffman from 1972 disproves in dimension two or higher a classical prediction that the count of zeros of holomorphic self-mappings of the complex linear space should be controlled by the maximum modulus function. We prove that such a bound holds for a modified coarse count inspired by the theory of persistence modules originating in topological data analysis.</description>

      <title>On the topology of the moduli of tropical unramified $p$-covers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the topology of the moduli space of tropical unramified $\mathbb{Z}/p$-covers of tropical curves of genus $g \geq 2$ where $p$ is a prime number. We use recent techniques by Chan--Galatius--Payne to identify a contractible subcomplex of the moduli space. We then use this contractibility result to show that this moduli space is simply connected for all $g$ and $p$. In the case of genus $2$ we fully determine the homotopy type of this moduli space for all primes $p$. This work is motivated by prospective applications to the top-weight cohomology of the space of prime cyclic \'etale covers of smooth algebraic curves.</description>
