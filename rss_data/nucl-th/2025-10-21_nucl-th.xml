      <title>Born series for s-wave scattering length and some exact results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In these notes the Born series for the $s$-wave scattering $a_0$ is calculated for a class of central potentials $V(r)$ up to sixth order in a dimensionless coupling strength $g$. Examples of exponentially decaying potentials as well truncated potentials involving a single length-scale $a$ are considered. In certain favorable cases the exact result for the $g$-dependent $s$-wave scattering length $a_0=A_0(g) a$ can be given in terms of special functions. The poles of $A_0(g)$ at increasing positive values of $g$ correspond to the thresholds, where $s$-wave bound-states occur successively.</description>

      <title>Elliptic flow of $D_s$ as evidence of the sequential hadronization mechanism in the hot QCD medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heavy flavor production serves as an ideal probe of the hadronization mechanism in the hot and dense QCD medium created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Heavy quarks acquire elliptic flow through strong coupling with the medium, making $v_2$ a sensitive observable for probing the hadronization time. In this Letter, we study the production and elliptic flow of $D_s$ and $D^0$ mesons in $Pb+Pb$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02$~TeV within a Langevin dynamics framework for heavy quarks in the QCD medium, combined with the sequential or simultaneous coalescence plus fragmentation at the hadronization hypersurface. We find that, within the sequential hadronization framework, the earlier-produced $D_s$ exhibits a smaller $v_2$ than the $D^0$ in the intermediate $ p_{\mathrm{T}}$ region. This reversed ordering behavior aligns with preliminary ALICE measurements and provides strong evidence for the heavy flavor sequential hadronization mechanism.</description>

      <title>Symmetry restoration in the axially deformed proton-neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation for nuclear beta decay: The effect of angular-momentum projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the effects of symmetry restoration on nuclear beta decay within the axially deformed proton-neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation (QRPA). We employ the proton-neutron finite-amplitude method (pnFAM) to compute transition amplitudes, and perform angular-momentum projection both after variation and after the QRPA to restore rotational symmetry. Exact projection reduces the calculated beta decay half-lives from those that use the needle approximation by up to 60%, and even more when taking the effects of projection on the ground-state energy into account.</description>

      <title>Microscopic triaxial quadrupole-octupole collective Hamiltonian for low-energy nuclear excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a microscopic triaxial quadrupole-octupole collective Hamiltonian (TQOCH) that unifies collective rotations, quadrupole-octupole vibrations, and their couplings to model low-lying nuclear states of both parities. The TQOCH's dynamics are governed by collective parameters derived from multidimensionally constrained covariant density functional theory. The model's validity is demonstrated through calculations of $^{152}$Sm, including its deformation energy surfaces, excitation spectra, and transition probabilities. As a predictive tool, the TQOCH probes complex nuclear phenomena like shape coexistence and phase transitions, directly connecting their microscopic origins to spectroscopic observables.</description>

      <title>Short-Range Correlations and Transverse Response Enhancement from Meson-Exchange Currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the role of short-range correlations (SRC) in the transverse nuclear response within the quasielastic peak region, focusing on the 1p1h channel. The calculation is performed in nuclear matter by solving the Bethe-Goldstone equation with the realistic Granada 2013 nucleon-nucleon potential, including both one-body and two-body meson-exchange currents (MEC) of seagull, pion-in-flight, and $\Delta$ types. We find that MEC produce a sizable enhancement of the transverse response in the 1p1h channel when acting on correlated nucleon pairs with high-momentum components generated by SRC. This contrasts with the uncorrelated case, where MEC, dominated by the $\Delta$ current, can even yield a negative effect. The results are consistent with previous findings based on the correlated basis function approach, supporting the interpretation that SRC play a central role in the transverse response enhancement from MEC.</description>

      <title>Probing the shape evolution and shell structures in neutron-rich N=50 nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structure of low-lying states of $N=50$ nuclei is investigated by the advanced Monte Carlo shell model (MCSM) in the $\pi{(fp)}$-$\nu{(sdg)}$ model space. We have employed the shell-model Hamiltonian based on the valence-space in-medium similarity renormalization group, with minimal phenomenological adjustments to the single-particle energies. The MCSM results with the modified Hamiltonian nicely predict the shape coexistence of $^{78}$Ni, consistent with recent experimental data. The evolution of intrinsic shapes from the spherical shape to prolate shapes in the ground state of $N=50$ nuclei is discussed using the "T-plot" and effective single-particle energies, which visualize the intrinsic quadrupole deformation of the MCSM wave function. The present result shows that the monopole part of the tensor force does not enhance the shape coexistence of $^{78}$Ni, unlike the case of $^{68}$Ni.</description>

Abstract: The isobaric caloric curve is considered in subcritical states region. The energy fluctuations along the caloric curve are determined for small nuclear systems which consist of limited number of nucleons. The temperature dependence of heat capacity at fixed pressure is obtained.

      <title>Nonlocality effect in $\alpha$ decay half-lives for even-even nuclei within a two potential approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we carefully look at the $\alpha$ -decay half-lives of 196 even-even nuclei using a two-potential approach that is made better by taking into account an alpha particle's effective mass that changes with coordinates. The result shows that the accuracy of this model has been improved after considering effective mass for the alpha particle. Furthermore, considering $\alpha$ decay energies derived from three mass models, namely the Weizsacker-Skyrme-4 (WS4) mass model, the relativistic continuum Hartree-Bogoliubov theory mass model, and the FRDM (2012), we extend this model to predict the $\alpha$ -decay half-lives of Z = 118 and 120 isotopes. Finally, we carefully study the predicted $\alpha$ decay energies and half-lives of Z = 118 and 120 isotopes and discuss the shell structure of superheavy nuclei. We found that the shell effect is obvious at N = 178 and at N = 184 in the WS4 mass model and FRDM(2012), while the shell effect is only obvious at N = 184 in the relativistic continuum Hartree-Bogoliubov theory mass model.</description>

      <title>Photon radiation induced by rescattering in strong-interacting medium with a magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The photon radiation induced by rescattering in a magnetized medium is investigated in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Within the high-energy limit, the photon emission rate and the associated electromagnetic energy loss are derived using the Gyulassy-Levai-Vitev formalism at first order in opacity, for a quark jet traversing a quark-gluon plasma under a background magnetic field. Quantitative analysis shows a slight suppression of the overall photon radiation over a broad range of jet energies as the jet propagates through the medium. This reduction in photon yield consequently leads to a moderate decrease in the electromagnetic energy loss of the jet. These results contribute to a better understanding of the electromagnetic properties of strongly interacting matter in high-energy nucleus-nucleus collisions and motivate an experimental comparison of photon yields from Quark-Gluon Plasma with similar properties but distinct magnetic field strengths.</description>

      <title>Simulating Binary Neutron Star Mergers with Finite-temperature Equations of State: The influences of the slope of the symmetry energy and artificial heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new set of numerical-relativity simulations of merging binary neutron stars, aiming to identify possible observable signatures of the slope of the symmetry energy $L_{\rm sym}$. To achieve this goal, we employ a set of equations of state based on a parameterization of the covariant density functional theory of nuclear matter that allows controlled variations of $L_{\rm sym}$ and the skewness $Q_{\rm sat}$, holding the latter fixed. For a set of our simulations, we identify a steep energy gradient in the equation of state at subsaturation densities, which acts as a source of heating with subsequent stiffening produced by thermal support. Accounting for related structural modifications in the tidal deformability reconciles our results with theoretical expectations. On the other hand, we show that gravitational waves are unlikely to distinguish the role of $L_{\rm sym}$. In contrast to this, we find that the ejecta composition is significantly altered in our simulations, which employ an M1 moment scheme, when $L_{\rm sym}$ is varied. Based on our extracted dynamical ejecta properties, we compute r-process yields and find that they are distinct for the different $L_{\rm sym}$, especially at lower mass numbers $A \lesssim 120$. This suggests that electromagnetic counterparts are more likely to exhibit signatures; however, a direct connection to $L_{\rm sym}$ remains a challenge, given the complex interplay between details of the ejecta properties and the kilonova signal.</description>

      <title>CE$\nu$NS Search with Cryogenic Sapphire Detectors at MINER: Results from the TRIGA reactor data and Future Sensitivity at HFIR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on a search for coherent elastic neutrino--nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) using cryogenic sapphire (Al$_2$O$_3$) detectors deployed at the Mitchell Institute Neutrino Experiment at Reactor (MINER), located near the 1~MW$_\text{th}$ TRIGA research reactor at Texas A\&amp;M University. The experiment operated with a primary detector mass of 72~g and achieved a baseline energy resolution of $\sim 40$~eV. Using exposures of 158~g-days (reactor-on) and 381~g-days (reactor-off), we performed a statistical background subtraction in the energy region of 0.25--3~keV. A GEANT4 simulation has been performed to understand the reactor-correlated background present in the data and it agrees with our observations. The resulting best-fit ratio of the observed CE$\nu$NS rate to the Standard Model prediction after rejecting the reactor induced background from the data with the help of simulation, is $\rho = 0.26\pm 1534.74~\mathrm{(stat)} \pm 0.05~\mathrm{(sys)}$ with a significance of $0.007 \pm 0.022~\mathrm{(stat)} \pm 0.001~\mathrm{(sys)}$. This low significance indicates a high background rate at low energies. To have enhanced sensitivity, the MINER collaboration plans to relocate the experiment to the 85~MW$_\text{th}$ High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). With improved shielding, increased detector mass, and higher antineutrino flux, the upgraded setup is projected to achieve a 3$\sigma$ CE$\nu$NS detection within 30~kg$\cdot$days of exposure.</description>

      <title>Rapidly rotating hot nuclear and hypernuclear compact stars: integral parameters and universal relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate hot, isentropic compact stars in the limiting cases of static and maximally rotating configurations, focusing on how variations in the symmetry energy of the equation of state derived from covariant density functional theory affect stellar properties. We consider both nucleonic and hyperonic matter with systematically varied symmetry energy slopes, fixed entropies per baryon $s / k_B=1$ and 3, and electron fractions $Y_e=0.1$ and $Y_e=0.4$, representative of conditions in binary neutron star mergers and proto-neutron stars. We compute and analyze mass--radius and moment--of--inertia--mass relations, as well as the dependence of the Keplerian (mass-shedding) frequency on mass, angular momentum, and the ratio of kinetic to gravitational energy. Furthermore, we show that several universal relations between global properties remain valid across both nucleonic and hyperonic equations of state with varying symmetry energy, both in the static and Keplerian limit, and for various combinations of the fixed entropy and electron fraction.</description>

      <title>Flux-Conservative BDNK Hydrodynamics and Shock Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new, first-order, flux-conservative formulation of relativistic viscous hydrodynamics in the BDNK framework, applicable to conformal and nonconformal fluids at zero chemical potential. Focusing on the conformal case in 1+1 dimensions, we numerically solve the equations of motion for two classes of consistent initial data and assess the robustness of the resulting solutions with respect to changing the hydrodynamic frame. Our flux-conservative formulation does not exhibit spurious oscillatory structures within the regime of validity of BDNK theory (the hydrodynamic-frame-robust regime), corresponding to sufficiently small Knudsen numbers. Using this flux-conservative approach, we numerically investigate the potential formation of shocks and their fate in BDNK in 1+1D using smooth initial data known to produce shocks in the relativistic Euler equations. For the type of initial data we consider, we show that the sharp features formed in Euler are prevented by the hyperbolic viscous BDNK equations. The prevention of shock formation we observe occurs in the frame-robust regime of BDNK. This, however, does not preclude the formation of shocks in BDNK for different smooth initial data. The reliability of our results is supported by systematic numerical convergence testing, which is used to assess shock indicators, simulation performance, and the robustness of solutions for different hydrodynamic frames.</description>

      <title>Heavy flavor transport in the QGP medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I review recent developments on heavy flavor transport in the QGP medium, along two directions. The first is the transport of individual open heavy quarks. Leveraging the tools of heavy quark effective theory, recent work revealed a novel connection between the evolution equation of the heavy quark phase space distribution, the conditions for kinetic equilibration to take place, and a non-perturbatively defined expectation value of a Wilson loop characterized by the heavy quark velocity. Using these developments, I discuss results from a first exploration of the ensuing stopping and equilibration dynamics of heavy quarks in a strongly coupled environment. The second direction is the transport of quarkonia, bound states of heavy quarks, where novel Generalized Gluon Distributions have been recently defined and calculated in the framework of potential non-relativistic QCD. I discuss their application to the dynamics of quarkonium in heavy-ion collisions, highlighting the need to account for non-Markovian effects in the interactions between the heavy quark pair and quark-gluon plasma -- which have thus far resisted a systematic characterization.</description>

      <title>Relaxation Time Approximation for a multi-species relativistic gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize a recent prescription for the relaxation time approximation for the relativistic Boltzmann equation for systems with multiple particle species at finite temperature. This is performed by adding counter-terms to the traditional Anderson-Witting ansatz for each particle species. Our approach allows for the use of momentum-dependent relaxation times and the obedience of local conservation laws regardless of the definition of the local equilibrium state. As an application, we derive the first order Chapman-Enskog corrections to the equilibrium distribution and display results for the hadron-resonance gas. We also demonstrate that our collision term ansatz obeys the second law of thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Probing $ \phi $N interaction through bound states of $ \phi\textrm{N-}\alpha $ system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The possible bound state of the $ \phi N \alpha $ system is explored within the framework of the three-body cluster model.
  The calculations are done by employing the state-of-the-art $ \phi $N interactions obtained from the analysis of the pure elastic scattering and the coupled-channel in the $\phi p$ correlation functions.
  The $ \phi\alpha $ potentials are constructed by two methods: the single-folding potential (SFP) method for the given spin-averaged $ \phi $N potentials in coordinate space, and the optical model potential (OMP) approximation within the multiple-scattering framework for the given scattering length of the $ \phi $N interaction.
  It is found that, when only the single-channel $ \phi N$ interactions are employed, the $ \phi N \alpha $ system could be bound with a binding energy in the interval [3-26] MeV.
  However, the coupled-channel $\phi p$ interaction, which is most consistent with experimental measurements, does not yield any bound state, even when the spin-averaged $\phi N$ potential is employed, and this potential is found to be more attractive than the corresponding coupled-channel counterpart.
  It is essential to consider the contributions from the dynamics of the vector-baryon coupled channels $\phi p$ interaction.
  This effect is capable of playing a decisive role in the existence of mesic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Mapped $spdf$ interacting boson model for quadrupole-octupole collective states in nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dipole bosons are introduced in the interacting boson model (IBM) by means of the self-consistent mean-field method. The constrained mean-field calculations employing a given nuclear energy density functional yield the potential energy surfaces in terms of the axially-symmetric quadrupole-octupole, dipole-quadrupole, and dipole-octupole deformations. By mapping these energy surfaces onto the expectation values of the IBM Hamiltonian in the coherent state of the interacting $s$, $p$, $d$, and $f$ bosons, strength parameters of the $spdf$-IBM Hamiltonian are determined. In an illustrative application to octupole-deformed actinides $^{218-230}$Ra and $^{220-232}$Th, it is shown that effects of including $p$ bosons in the IBM mapping are to lower significantly negative-parity yrast levels, and to improve descriptions of observed energy-level systematic in nearly spherical and transitional nuclei, and of the behaviors of the reduced electric dipole transitions and intrinsic dipole moments with neutron number.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Driven High-Precision Model for $\alpha$-Decay Energy and Half-Life Prediction of superheavy nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) framework optimized via Bayesian hyperparameter tuning, we investigated the {\alpha}-decay energy and half-life of superheavy nuclei. By incorporating key nuclear structural features-including mass number, proton-to-neutron ratio, magic number proximity, and angular momentum transfer-the optimized model captures essential physical mechanisms governing $\alpha$-decay. On the test set, the model achieves significantly lower mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) compared to empirical models such as Royer and Budaca, particularly in the low-energy region. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis confirms these mechanisms are dominated by decay energy, angular momentum barriers, and shell effects. This work establishes a physically consistent, data-driven tool for nuclear property prediction and offers valuable insights into $\alpha$-decay processes from a machine learning perspective.</description>

      <title>The quark gap equation in light-cone gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the quark self-energy correction in light-cone gauge motivated by distribution amplitudes whose definition implies a Wilson line. The latter serves to preserve the gauge invariance of the hadronic amplitudes and becomes trivial in light-cone gauge. Therefore, the calculation of the distribution amplitudes simplifies significantly provided that wave functions and propagators are obtained in that gauge. In here, we explore the corresponding Dyson-Schwinger equation in its leading truncation and with a dressed vertex derived from a Ward identity in light-cone gauge. The quark's mass and wave renormalization functions, as well as a third complex-valued amplitude, are found to depend on the relative orientation of the quark momentum and a light-like four-vector, which expresses a geometric gauge dependence of the propagator.</description>

      <title>Regularization Prescription for the Mixing Between Nonlocal Gluon and Quark Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00639v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that in the study of mixing between nonlocal gluon and quark bilinear operators there exists an ambiguity when relating coordinate space and momentum space results, which can be conveniently resolved through Mellin moments matching in both spaces. In this work, we show that this ambiguity is due to the lack of a proper regularization prescription of the singularity that arises when the separation between the gluon/quark fields approaches zero. We then demonstrate that dimensional regularization resolves this issue and yields consistent results in both coordinate and momentum space. This prescription is also compatible with lattice extractions of parton distributions from nonlocal operators.</description>

      <title>Chiral Cherenkov radiation in the presence of a time-dependent chiral chemical potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The photon production process $f\to f+\gamma$ in the presence of a time-dependent chiral chemical potential $\mu_5$ is studied. The validity of the adiabatic approximation is demonstrated in the ultra-relativistic limit. Analytical expressions for the photon spectrum are derived for two models of the chiral magnetic conductivity $b_0\propto \mu_5$: (i) $b_0(t)= A_1+B_1\tanh(t/\tau)$ and (ii) $b_0(t)= A_2(t/\tau)/(1+t^2/\tau^2)$. It is known that for constant $b_0$, photon emission may exhibit a resonance for one photon polarization depending on the sign of $b_0$. It is shown that in model (i), up to two resonances may occur, depending on the sign of the asymptotic values $b_0(\infty)$ and $b_0(-\infty)$. No resonances are observed in model (ii). Numerical calculations are performed using parameters relevant to quark-gluon plasma, and the universality of the results is discussed.</description>

      <title>Helicity amplitudes of $N(1520)$ and $N(1535)$ including pentaquark components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the helicity amplitudes of the $N(1520)$ and $N(1535)$ resonances in the electromagnetic transition process $\gamma^*p\to N^*$, where the $N(1520)$ and $N(1535)$ are assumed to include both the $L=1$ three-quark and $L=0$ spatial symmetric $q^4\bar q$ pentaquark components. The helicity transition amplitudes $A_{1/2}$, $A_{3/2}$ (for spin 3/2 states) and $S_{1/2}$ are computed within the constituent quark model. The inclusion of the $q^4 \bar q$ pentaquark components via the $\gamma^*\to q\bar q$ diagram significantly improves the theoretical description of the helicity amplitudes for both $N(1520)$ and $N(1535)$, yielding a closer agreement with experimental data compared to the pure three-quark picture. The work reveals that the $N(1520)$ and $N(1535)$ resonances may contain a considerable pentaquark components.</description>

      <title>Energy Correlators in Semi-Inclusive Electron-Positron Annihilation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01652v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate energy correlators in semi-inclusive electron-positron annihilation as precision probes of parton hadronization dynamics. Using soft-collinear effective theory (SCET), we analyze the correlation patterns between the examined hadron and the rest of QCD radiations in both large-angle and small-angle limits, which establishes a direct correspondence with Transverse-Momentum-Dependent Fragmentation Functions (TMD FFs) and Fragmentation Energy Correlators (FECs). The two complementary regimes encode the transition from perturbative parton branching to nonperturbative confinement, enabling a unified description of hadron formation across all kinematic regimes. Using renormalization group evolution, we obtain joint N3LL/NNLL quantitative predictions for energy correlations both in the sudakov and jet fragmentation region (JFR). Our results demonstrate that semi-inclusive ECs provide direct, theoretically controlled access to QCD dynamics underlying hadronization, opening new avenues for precision studies at future lepton colliders.</description>

      <title>Two-flavor chirally imbalanced quark matter beyond large $N_c$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a chirally imbalanced medium in the context of the two-flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model using both the large-$N_c$ (LN) and beyond large-$N_c$ (BLN) approximations. To incorporate BLN effects, we consider the optimized perturbation theory (OPT) to the first nontrivial order, which includes two-loop (exchange) contributions. This procedure allows us to explicitly explore how finite $N_c$ corrections affect the thermodynamics as well as the phase diagram of chirally imbalanced quark matter. We then compare the results obtained with a sharp three-dimensional cutoff -- generically referred to as the traditional regularization scheme -- and with an alternative procedure called the medium separation scheme (MSS). In the first case, we observe that the pseudocritical temperature decreases as the chiral chemical potential increases, an effect dubbed inverse chiral catalysis. On the other hand, when considering the MSS regularization, which properly isolates the medium contributions from the vacuum, we find the opposite result. We show that the results obtained with MSS are consistent with well-established LQCD data in both the LN and BLN approximations. Finally, we suggest that to cope with the high-density limit, the standard OPT interpolation prescription must be modified with the inclusion of an extra variational parameter.</description>

      <title>Nucleon Electric Dipole Moments in Paramagnetic Molecules through Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electric dipole moment (EDM) measurements using paramagnetic molecules have significantly advanced over the last decade. Traditionally, these experiments have been analyzed in terms of the electron EDM. However, paramagnetic molecules are also sensitive to hadronic sources of charge-parity (CP) violation, highlighting the need for a new framework to interpret the experimental results. In this Letter, we introduce an effective field theory framework to relate molecular EDMs to the EDMs of neutrons and protons. We identify the dominant contributions through power counting and pinpoint the necessary nuclear matrix elements. As a practical application, we employ the nuclear shell model to calculate these nuclear matrix elements for the polar molecule BaF. Finally, we estimate the limits on the nucleon EDMs set by current molecular EDM experiments.</description>
