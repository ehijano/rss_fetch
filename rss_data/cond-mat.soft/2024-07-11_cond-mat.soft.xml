      <title>Upsurge of spontaneous knotting in polar diblock active polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spontaneous formation of knots in long polymers at equilibrium is inevitable but becomes rare in sufficiently short chains. Here, we show that knotting and knot complexity increase by orders of magnitude in diblock polymers with a fraction $p$ of self-propelled monomers. Remarkably, this enhancement is not monotonic in $p$ with an optimal value independent of the monomer's activity. By monitoring the knot's size and position we elucidate the mechanisms of its formation, diffusion, and untying and ascribe the non-monotonic behaviour to the competition between the rate of knot formation and the knot's lifetime. These findings suggest a non-equilibrium mechanism to generate entangled filaments at the nano-scale.</description>

      <title>Analytic Solution for the Linear Rheology of Living Polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is often said that well-entangled and fast-breaking living polymers (such as wormlike micelles) exhibit a single relaxation time in their reptation dynamics, but the full story is somewhat more complicated. Understanding departures from single-Maxwell behavior is crucial for fitting and interpreting experimental data, but in some limiting cases numerical methods of solving living polymer models can struggle to produce reliable predictions/interpretations. In this work, we develop an analytic solution for the shuffling model of living polymers. The analytic solution is a converging infinite series, and it converges fastest in the fast-breaking limit where other methods can struggle.</description>

      <title>Hole Statistics of Equilibrium 2D and 3D Hard-Sphere Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The probability of finding a spherical "hole" of a given radius $r$ contains crucial structural information about many-body systems. Such hole statistics, including the void conditional nearest-neighbor probability functions $G_V(r)$, have been well studied for hard-sphere fluids in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$. However, little is known about these functions for hard-sphere crystals for values of $r$ beyond the hard-sphere diameter, as large holes are extremely rare in crystal phases. To overcome these computational challenges, we introduce a biased-sampling scheme that accurately determines hole statistics for equilibrium hard spheres on ranges of $r$ that far extend those that could be previously explored. We discover that $G_V(r)$ in crystal and hexatic states exhibits oscillations whose amplitudes increase rapidly with the packing fraction, which stands in contrast to $G_V(r)$ for fluid states that is monotonic in $r$. The oscillations in $G_V(r)$ for 2D crystals are strongly correlated with the local orientational order metric in the vicinity of the holes, and variations in $G_V(r)$ for 3D states indicate a transition between tetrahedral and octahedral holes, demonstrating the power of $G_V(r)$ as a probe of local coordination geometry. To further study the statistics of interparticle spacing in hard-sphere systems, we compute the local packing fraction distribution $f(\phi_l)$ of Delaunay cells, and find that for $d\leq 3$, the excess kurtosis of $f(\phi_l)$ switches sign at a certain transitional global packing fraction. Our investigation facilitates the study of structural and bulk properties of materials that involve the creation of rare large holes, such as the solubility of alloys.</description>

      <title>Buckling by disordered growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Buckling instabilities driven by tissue growth underpin key developmental events such as the folding of the brain. Tissue growth is disordered due to cell-to-cell variability, but the effects of this variability on buckling are unknown. Here, we analyse what is perhaps the simplest setup of this problem: the buckling of an elastic rod with fixed ends driven by spatially varying growth. Combining analytical calculations for simple growth fields and numerical sampling of random growth fields, we show that variability can increase as well as decrease the growth threshold for buckling, even when growth variability does not cause any residual stresses. For random growth, we find that the shift of the buckling threshold correlates with spatial moments of the growth field. Our results imply that biological systems can either trigger or avoid buckling by exploiting the spatial arrangement of growth variability.</description>

      <title>Stability Analysis of Cantilever-like Structures with Applications to Soft Robotic Arms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of variational structure for analyzing problems in the physical sciences is widespread. Cantilever-like problems, where one end is subjected to a fixed value and the other end is free, have been less studied, especially in terms of their stability despite their abundance. In this article, we develop the stability conditions for these problems by examining the second variation of the energy functional using the generalized Jacobi condition, which includes computing conjugate points. These conjugate points are determined by solving a set of initial value problems from the resulting linearized equilibrium equations. We apply these conditions to investigate the nonlinear stability of intrinsically curved elastic cantilevers subject to a tip load. Kirchhoff rod theory is employed to model the elastic rod deformations. The role of intrinsic curvature in inducing complex nonlinear phenomena, such as snap-back instability, is particularly emphasized. This snap-back instability is demonstrated using various examples, highlighting its dependence on various system parameters. The presented examples illustrate the potential applications in the design of flexible soft robotic arms and mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Competing aggregation and iso-density equilibrium lead to band pattern formation in density gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Centrifugation of erythrocytes (aka Red Blood Cells, RBCs) in a self-forming Percoll gradient is a protocol often used as a way to sort RBCs by age. However, a pattern formation of discrete bands is systematically observed along the continuous density gradient. Although early studies mentioned that aggregation between cells might modify their spatial distribution, it is debated whether a population with continuous density distribution can form discrete bands. Here, we develop a continuity equation, considering the aggregation of cells with a continuous density distribution, which describes the macroscopic evolution of the RBC volume concentration in a density gradient. The numerical solutions demonstrate that the competition between iso-density distribution and aggregation is sufficient to create band patterns. Our model reproduces the temporal evolution observed in the conventional experimental protocol, but also predicts several types of bifurcation-like behaviors for the steady-state patterns in constant gradients, when the volume fraction and aggregation energy of the cells are varied. We threrefore discovered that the competition between RBC aggregation and iso-density distribution is a novel physical mechanism leading to pattern formation.</description>

      <title>Friction through molecular adsorption at the sliding interface of hydrogels: Theory and experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the frictional properties of thin ($\approx \mu m$) poly(dimethylacrylamide) hydrogel films within contacts with spherical silica probes. In order to focus on the contribution to friction of interfacial dissipation, a dedicated rotational setup is designed which allows to suppress poroelastic flows while ensuring an uniform velocity field at the sliding interface. The physical-chemistry of the interface is varied from the grafting of various silanes on the silica probes. Remarkably, we identify a velocity range in which the average frictional stress systematically varies with the logarithm of the sliding velocity. This dependency is found to be sensitive to the physical-chemistry of the silica surfaces. Experimental observations are discussed in the light of a molecular model where friction arises from thermally activated adsorption of polymer chains at the sliding interface, their elastic stretching and subsequent desorption. From this theoretical description, our experimental data provide us with adhesion energies and characteristic times for molecular adsorption that are found consistent with the physico-chemistry of the chemically-modified silica surfaces.</description>

      <title>Using Activity to Compartmentalize Binary Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We computationally study suspensions of slow and fast active Brownian particles that have undergone motility induced phase separation and are at steady state. Such mixtures, of varying non-zero activity, remain largely unexplored even though they are relevant for a plethora of systems and applications ranging from cellular biophysics to drone swarms. Our mixtures are modulated by their activity ratios ($\mathrm{Pe}^\mathrm{R}$), which we find to encode information by giving rise to three regimes, each of which display their unique emergent behaviors. Specifically, we found non-monotonic behavior of macroscopic properties, e.g. density and pressure, as a function of activity ratio, microphase separation of fast and slow particle domains, increased fluctuations on the interface and severe avalanche events compared to monodisperse active systems. Our approach of simultaneously varying the two activities of the particle species allowed us to discover these behaviors and explain the microscopic physical mechanisms that drive them.</description>

      <title>Viscoelastic dip-coating beyond lubrication theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dip-coating geometry, where a solid plate is withdrawn from or plunged into a liquid pool, offers a prototypical example of wetting flows involving contact-line motion. Such flows are commonly studied using the lubrication approximation approach which is intrinsically limited to small interface slopes and thus small contact angles. Flows for arbitrary contact angles, however, can be studied using a generalized lubrication theory that builds upon viscous corner flow solutions. Here we derive this generalized lubrication theory for viscoelastic liquids that exhibit normal stress effects and are modelled using the second-order fluid model. We apply our theory to advancing and receding contact lines in dip-coating, highlighting the influence of viscoelastic normal stresses for contact line motion at arbitrary contact angle.</description>

      <title>Electrically tunable spin-orbit coupled photonic lattice in a liquid crystal microcavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We create a one-dimensional photonic crystal with strong polarization dependence and tunable by an applied electric field. We accomplish this in a planar microcavity by embedding a cholesteric liquid crystal (LC), which spontaneously forms a uniform lying helix (ULH). The applied voltage controls the orientation of the LC molecules and, consequently, the strength of a polarization-dependent periodic potential. It leads to opening or closing of photonic band gaps in the dispersion of the massive photons in the microcavity. In addition, when the ULH structure possesses a molecular tilt, it induces a spin-orbit coupling between the lattice bands of different parity. This interband spin-orbit coupling (ISOC) is analogous to optical activity and can be treated as a synthetic non-Abelian gauge potential. Finally, we show that doping the LC with dyes allows us to achieve lasing that inherits all the above-mentioned tunable properties of LC microcavity, including dual and circularly-polarized lasing.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Fluid Flow in Helical Pipes Inspired by Shark Intestines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlike human intestines, which are long, hollow tubes, the intestines of sharks and rays contain interior helical structures surrounding a cylindrical hole. One function of these structures may be to create asymmetric flow, favoring passage of fluid down the digestive tract, from anterior to posterior. Here, we design and 3D print biomimetic models of shark intestines, in both rigid and deformable materials. We use the rigid models to test which physical parameters of the interior helices (the pitch, the hole radius, the tilt angle, and the number of turns) yield the largest flow asymmetries. These asymmetries exceed those of traditional Tesla valves, structures specifically designed to create flow asymmetry without any moving parts. When we print the biomimetic models in elastomeric materials so that flow can couple to the structure's shape, flow asymmetry is significantly amplified; it is 7-fold larger in deformable structures than in rigid structures. Last, we 3D-print deformable versions of the intestine of a dogfish shark, based on a tomogram of a biological sample. This biomimic produces flow asymmetry comparable to traditional Tesla valves. The ability to influence the direction of a flow through a structure has applications in biological tissues and artificial devices across many scales, from large industrial pipelines to small microfluidic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When moist air meets a cold surface, it creates a breath figure characterized by numerous small droplets. The central question is how the vapor flux is distributed between the growth of previously condensed drops and the nucleation of new ones. Here, we investigate the nucleation, growth, and coalescence of droplets on soft crosslinked polymer networks. The number of droplets initially remains constant, until drops start to coarsen according to a universal law; both phenomena are explained via the formation of a saturated boundary layer. Although nucleation occurs at a scale where the polymer network resembles a melt, we quantitatively unveil an algebraic sensitivity of the number of droplets on the substrate elasticity. Our findings suggest that nucleation follows a surprisingly low-energy pathway, influenced by the degree of crosslinking. Consequently, breath figures offer a macroscopic approach to probe the molecular characteristics of the polymer interface.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Asymmetry in Density within the Shear Bands of Metallic Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plastic deformation in metallic glasses at room temperature leads to the development of shear bands due to shear localization. In many experiments, shear bands have shown local density variations along their path, with a distinct imbalance in magnitude between local densification and dilation. However, a comprehensive mechanistic understanding or theory to explain this asymmetry has been lacking until now. Here, we introduce a new model that consists of a sequential arrangement of alternating topological 'charges', generating a dipolar field. The resulting microscopic displacement field, when integrated into the deformation gradient tensor, provides an accurate analytical solution for the observed imbalances in the density variations. The implications of this method are discussed, highlighting the potential to elucidate a broader range of observations in shear bands.</description>

      <title>The positioning of stress fibers in contractile cells minimizes internal mechanical stress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mechanics of animal cells is strongly determined by stress fibers, which are contractile filament bundles that form dynamically in response to extracellular cues. Stress fibers allow the cell to adapt its mechanics to environmental conditions and to protect it from structural damage. While the physical description of single stress fibers is well-developed, much less is known about their spatial distribution on the level of whole cells. Here, we combine a finite element method for one-dimensional fibers embedded in an elastic bulk medium with dynamical rules for stress fiber formation based on genetic algorithms. We postulate that their main goal is to achieve minimal mechanical stress in the bulk material with as few fibers as possible. The fiber positions and configurations resulting from this optimization task alone are in good agreement with those found in experiments where cells in 3D-scaffolds were mechanically strained at one attachment point. For optimized configurations, we find that stress fibers typically run through the cell in a diagonal fashion, similar to reinforcement strategies used for composite material.</description>

      <title>A cyclical route linking fundamental mechanism and AI algorithm: An example from tuning Poisson's ratio in amorphous networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03404v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: "AI for science" is widely recognized as a future trend in the development of scientific research. Currently, although machine learning algorithms have played a crucial role in scientific research with numerous successful cases, relatively few instances exist where AI assists researchers in uncovering the underlying physical mechanisms behind a certain phenomenon and subsequently using that mechanism to improve machine learning algorithms' efficiency. This article uses the investigation into the relationship between extreme Poisson's ratio values and the structure of amorphous networks as a case study to illustrate how machine learning methods can assist in revealing underlying physical mechanisms. Upon recognizing that the Poisson's ratio relies on the low-frequency vibrational modes of dynamical matrix, we can then employ a convolutional neural network, trained on the dynamical matrix instead of traditional image recognition, to predict the Poisson's ratio of amorphous networks with a much higher efficiency. Through this example, we aim to showcase the role that artificial intelligence can play in revealing fundamental physical mechanisms, which subsequently improves the machine learning algorithms significantly.</description>

      <title>Thermotropic reentrant isotropy and antiferroelectricity in the ferroelectric nematic realm: Comparing RM734 and DIO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17400v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The current intense study of ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals was initiated by the observation of the same ferroelectric nematic phase in two independently discovered organic rod-shaped mesogenic compounds, RM734 and DIO. We recently reported that the compound RM734 also exhibits a monotropic, low-temperature, antiferroelectric phase having reentrant isotropic symmetry (the $I_A$ phase), the formation of which is facilitated to a remarkable degree by doping with small (below $1\%$) amounts of the ionic liquid ${\rm BMIM-PF}_6$. Here we report similar phenomenology in DIO, showing that this reentrant isotropic behavior is not only a property of RM734 but is rather a more general, material-independent feature of ferroelectric nematic mesogens. We find that the reentrant isotropic phases observed in RM734 and DIO are similar but not identical, adding two new phases to the ferroelectric nematic realm. The two $I_A$ phases exhibit similar, strongly peaked, diffuse x-ray scattering in the WAXS range $(1&lt;q&lt;2 \, \AA^{-1})$ indicative of a distinctive mode of short-ranged, side-by-side molecular packing. The scattering of the $I_A$ phases at small $q$ is quite different in the two materials, however, with RM734 exhibiting a strong, single, diffuse peak at $q \sim 0.08 \,\AA ^{-1}$ indicating mesoscale modulation with $\sim 80 \,\AA$ periodicity, and DIO a sharper diffuse peak at $q \sim 0.27 \,\AA ^{-1} \sim (2\pi/{\rm molecular length})$, with second and third harmonics, indicating that in the $I_A$ phase of DIO, short-ranged molecular positional correlation is smectic layer-like.</description>

      <title>Evidence of ferroelectric features in low-density supercooled water from ab initio deep neural-network simulations</title>

Abstract: Over the last decade, an increasing body of evidence has emerged, supporting the existence of a metastable liquid-liquid critical point in supercooled water, whereby two distinct liquid phases of different densities coexist. Analysing long molecular dynamics simulations performed using deep neural-network force fields trained to accurate quantum mechanical data, we demonstrate that the low-density liquid phase displays a strong propensity toward spontaneous polarization, as witnessed by large and long-lived collective dipole fluctuations. Our findings suggest that the dynamical stability of the low-density phase, and hence the transition from high-density to low-density liquid, is triggered by a collective process involving an accumulation of rotational angular jumps, which could ignite large dipole fluctuations. This dynamical transition involves subtle changes in the electronic polarizability of water molecules which affects their rotational mobility within the two phases. These findings hold the potential for catalyzing new activity in the search for dielectric-based probes of the putative second critical point.</description>

      <title>Sequence disorder-induced first order phase transition in confined polyelectrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a statistical mechanical model of a generic flexible polyelectrolyte, comprised of identically charged monomers with long range electrostatic interactions, and short-range interactions quantified by a disorder field along the polymer contour sequence, which is randomly quenched. The free energy and the monomer density profile of the system for no electrolyte screening are calculated in the case of a system composed of two infinite plates with an intervening oppositely charged polyelectrolyte chain. We show that the effect of the contour sequence disorder mediated by short-range interactions leads to an enhanced localization of the polyelectrolyte chain and a first order phase transition at a critical value of the inter-surface spacing. This phase transition results in an abrupt change of the pressure from negative to positive values, effectively eliminating polyelectrolyte mediated bridging attraction.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Prediction of Glass Dynamics by Incorporating the Direction of Deviation from Equilibrium Positions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Elucidating the intricate relationship between the structure and dynamics in the context of the glass transition has been a persistent challenge. Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a pivotal tool, offering novel pathways to predict dynamic behaviors from structural descriptors. Notably, recent research has highlighted that the distance between the initial particle positions between the equilibrium positions substantially enhances the prediction of glassy dynamics. However, these methodologies have been limited in their ability to capture the directional aspects of these deviations from the equilibrium positions, which are crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the complex particle interactions within the cage dynamics. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel structural parameter: the vectorial displacement of particles from their initial configuration to their equilibrium positions. Recognizing the inadequacy of current ML models in effectively handling such vectorial parameters, we have developed an Equivariance-Constrained Invariant Graph Neural Network (EIGNN). This innovative model not only bolsters the descriptive capacity of conventional rotation-invariant models but also streamlines the computational demands associated with rotation-equivariant graph neural networks. Our rigorous experimental validation on 3D glassy system from GlassBench dataset has yielded compelling evidence that the EIGNN model significantly enhance the correlation between structural representation and dynamic properties.</description>
