      <title>Observer-based neural networks for flow estimation and control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural network observers (NNOs) are proposed for real-time estimation of fluid flows, addressing a key challenge in flow control: obtaining real-time flow states from a limited set of sparse and noisy sensor data. For this task, we propose a generalization of the classical Luenberger observer. In the present framework, the estimation loop is composed of subsystems modeled as neural networks (NNs). By combining flow information from selected probes and an NN surrogate model (NNSM) of the flow system, we train NNOs capable of fusing information to provide the best estimation of the states, that can in turn be fed back to an NN controller (NNC). The NNO capabilities are demonstrated for three nonlinear dynamical systems. First, a variation of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) equation with control inputs is studied, where variables are sparsely probed. We show that the NNO is able to track states even when probes are contaminated with random noise or with sensors at insufficient sample rates to match the control time step. Then, a confined cylinder flow is investigated, where velocity signals along the cylinder wake are estimated by using a small set of wall pressure sensors. In both the KS and cylinder problems, we show that the estimated states can be used to enable closed-loop control, taking advantage of stabilizing NNCs. Finally, we present a legacy dataset of a turbulent boundary layer experiment, where convolutional NNs (CNNs) are employed to implement the models required for the estimation loop. We show that, by combining low-resolution noise-corrupted sensor data with an imperfect NNSM, it is possible to produce more accurate estimates, outperforming both the direct reconstructions via specialized super-resolution NNs and the direct model propagation from initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous evaporation and imbibition of a droplet on a flooded porous substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A mathematical model for the evolution of, and deposition from, a thin particle-laden droplet on an infinitely thick, isotropic, flooded, porous substrate with interconnected pores undergoing simultaneous evaporation and imbibition is formulated and analysed. In particular, analytical expressions for the evolution of the droplet, as well as for the flow within the droplet and the substrate, and for the transport and deposition onto the substrate of the particles are obtained for droplets evolving in four different modes. While the physical mechanisms driving evaporation and imbibition are rather different, perhaps rather unexpectedly, it is found that there are a number of qualitative and quantitative similarities as well as differences in the resulting behaviour of the droplet as it loses mass to its environment. For example, it is shown that a droplet undergoing pure imbibition in the constant contact radius mode never completely imbibes, but if it evaporates (either with or without imbibition also occurring) then it has a finite lifetime, and increasing the strength of evaporation and/or imbibition shortens its lifetime. It is also shown that in the regime in which diffusion of particles is faster than axial advection but slower than radial advection of particles, the final deposit of particles left behind on the substrate after the droplet has completely evaporated and/or imbibed is independent of both the nature and the strength of the physical mechanism(s) driving the mass loss from the droplet. Not only are these results of theoretical interest, but they are also relevant to a wide variety of practical applications, including ink-jet printing, DNA chip manufacturing, and disease diagnostics, that would benefit from an improved ability to predict and/or control the final deposit pattern from a droplet undergoing simultaneous evaporation and imbibition.</description>

      <title>Comparative Investigations on Active and Passive Tails of Undulating Swimmers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fish display remarkable swimming capabilities through the coordinated interaction of the body and caudal fin, yet the potential role of a passively pitching tail in enhancing hydrodynamic performance remains unresolved. In this work, we evaluate the performance of a carangiform swimmer equipped with either an actively pitching tail or a passively pitching tail. Fluid-structure interactions-based simulations are employed to asses how variations in joint stiffness, damping, and inertia influence thrust generation, power demand, and overall stability at two representative Reynolds numbers of 500 and 5000. The results reveal that actively pitching tails tend to generate greater thrust, while passively pitching tails deliver improved outcomes in terms of the power demand at the lower Reynolds number. Larger pitching amplitudes contribute positively only when associated with higher swimming frequency, when produced by reduced inertia for more flexible joints, they lead to unfavorable effects. At the higher Reynolds number, active tails consistently outperform passive ones, although a small subset of passive cases still achieve favorable performance. Across all cases, a recurring balance emerges, with thrust production and power expenditure varying inversely. These findings clarify the hydrodynamic consequences of passive versus active tail motion and establish design principles for bio-inspired underwater vehicles, where smaller swimmers may benefit from passive tail pitching, while larger swimmers are better served by active control</description>

      <title>A Hybrid CNN-Cheby-KAN Framework for Efficient Prediction of Two-Dimensional Airfoil Pressure Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate prediction of airfoil pressure distribution is essential for aerodynamic performance evaluation, yet traditional methods such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and wind tunnel testing have certain bottlenecks. This paper proposes a hybrid deep learning model combining a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Chebyshev-enhanced Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (Cheby-KAN) for efficient and accurate prediction of the two-dimensional airfoil flow field. The CNN learns 1549 types of airfoils and encodes airfoil geometries into a compact 16-dimensional feature vector, while the Cheby-KAN models complex nonlinear mappings from flight conditions and spatial coordinates to pressure values. Experiments on multiple airfoils--including RAE2822, NACA0012, e387, and mh38--under various Reynolds numbers and angles of attack demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a mean squared error (MSE) on the order of $10^{-6}$ and a coefficient of determination ($R^2$) exceeding 0.999. The model significantly outperforms traditional Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) in accuracy and generalizability, with acceptable computational overhead. These results indicate that the hybrid CNN-Cheby-KAN framework offers a promising data-driven approach for rapid aerodynamic prediction.</description>

      <title>Meshless data-driven decompositions with RBF-based inner products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven modal decompositions are useful tools for compressing data or identifying dominant structures. Popular ones like the dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) and the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) are defined with continuous inner products. These are usually approximated with samples of data uniform in space and time. However, not every dataset fulfills this requirement. Numerical simulations with smoothed particle hydrodynamics or experiments with Lagrangian particle tracking velocimetry produce scattered data varying in time and space, rendering sample-based inner products impossible. In this work, we extend a previous approach that computes the modal decompositions with meshfree radial basis functions (RBFs). We regress the data and use the continuous representation of the RBFs to compute the required inner products. We choose our basis to be constant in time, greatly reducing the computational cost since the inner product of the data reduces to the inner product of the basis functions. We use this approach in the most popular decompositions, namely the POD, DMD, multi-scale POD, and the two versions of the spectral POD. For all decompositions, the RBFs give a mesh-free representation of the spatial structures. Two test cases are considered: particle image velocimetry measurements of an impinging jet and large eddy simulations of the flow past a transitional airfoil. In both cases, the RBF-based approach outperforms classical binning and better recovers relevant structures across all data densities.</description>

      <title>On the role of back-propagating pressure suppression in enhancing the pressure-gain performance of quasi-2D rotating detonation engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The total pressure gain (PG) characteristics of the quasi-2D rotating detonation engine (RDE) are numerically investigated in this study, based on an abstract check valve model and the quasi-1D assumption. The influence of back-propagating pressure suppression on PG and its underlying mechanism are examined. An abstract check valve model is established to simulate various flow channel configurations, with backflow check strength $\alpha_b$ defined, where a larger $\alpha_b$ corresponds to a stronger backflow blocking effect. The quasi-1D assumption is applied along the axial direction to simplify the radial features of the annular RDE. The quasi-2D governing equations for RDE flow are derived. Simulations are conducted for varying expansion ratios $A_e$ and values of $\alpha_b$. The results indicate that increasing $\alpha_b$ effectively suppresses back-propagating pressure and slightly improves PG; however, it cannot fully eliminate the back-propagating pressure, as the check valve itself introduces flow disturbances. Increasing $A_e$ also suppresses back-propagating pressure but significantly reduces PG. Achieving positive PG requires reducing $A_e$ below a critical value. However, this reduction is limited by $\alpha_b$; further reduction in $A_e$ leads to forward propagation of back-propagating pressure to the engine inlet, resulting in inlet blocking. Therefore, a sufficiently large $\alpha_b$ is essential for the required reduction in $A_e$. The key aerodynamic challenge for achieving positive PG lies in optimizing flow channels to suppress back-propagating pressure efficiently. Finally, a general PG criterion is proposed by normalizing the quasi-2D RDE with stoichiometric hydrogen/air mixtures. This study provides theoretical guidance for enhancing PG in RDEs.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal statistics of the dissipation rate at the boundary of a turbulent flow using Diffusing-Wave Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use Diffusing Wave Spectroscopy (DWS) to perform the first direct space- and time-resolved measurement of the dissipation rate~$\epsilon$ at the boundary of a turbulent flow. We have shown in a previous publication that this technique provides maps of the dissipation rate of Newtonian fluids~\cite{Francisco}. Here, we apply the technique at the boundary of a turbulent flow generated in a square box by an impeller stirring the fluids. Although the measurement is made on a small region near the boundary, we show that the dissipation remains proportional to the injected power and follows the turbulent scaling $\epsilon \propto \mathrm{Re}^3$, with Re being the Reynolds number ranging from $1.5 \times 10^4$ to $6 \times 10^5$. With this flow, there is no need for logarithmic corrections to reproduce the dissipation near the flat boundary. In addition, our setup allows us to measure the spatio-temporal fluctuations of the dissipation near the boundary. These fluctuations are quite large (the relative fluctuations are about 50\%) and are well described by a log-normal distribution, as expected for the dissipation rate in the bulk of homogeneous and isotropic turbulence (HIT) but Power Density Spectra (PDS) do not correspond to those expected for HIT \cite{Li07,Graham16,K62}</description>

      <title>Disentangling Internal Tides from Balanced Motions with Deep Learning and Surface Field Synergy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental challenge in ocean dynamics is the disentanglement of balanced motions and internal waves. Extracting internal tidal (IT) imprints on surface data is a central part of this challenge. For IT extraction, traditional harmonic analysis fails in the presence of strong incoherence and poor temporal sampling, as is common in global satellite observations. The advent of new wide-swath satellites, which provide two-dimensional spatial coverage, allows IT extraction to be reformulated as an image translation problem. Building on recent work where we developed a deep learning approach to extract IT signatures from sea surface height (SSH) in an idealized turbulent simulation, we show here that a simpler and computationally cheaper algorithm can perform equally well if the learning rate is annealed during training. Using this new, convenient algorithm, we experiment with different combinations of input surface fields -- SSH, surface temperature, and surface velocity. All fields contribute synergistically to disentanglement, with surface velocity by far the most informative. These findings underscore the value of coordinated multi-platform observational campaigns and highlight the critical importance of surface velocity observations for separating balanced motions and internal waves. Additional insights into the behavior of deep learning algorithm emerge: both wave signature and scattering medium aids IT extraction, and to exploit large-scale information in the scattering medium, the algorithm must be highly non-local. Residual errors of our algorithm concentrate at small spatial scales near mode-2 tidal wavelengths, likely arising from artifacts introduced during data preparation (e.g., Doppler shifts) as well as imperfections in the deep learning architecture.</description>

      <title>Fast droplet impact onto slowly moving deep pools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a fast droplet impacts a pool, the resulting ejecta sheet dynamics determine the final impact outcome. At low Capillary numbers, the ejecta sheet remains separate from a deep static pool, whilst at higher viscosities it develops into a lamella. Here, we show that the common natural scenario of a slowly moving deep pool can change the upstream impact outcome, creating highly three-dimensional dynamics no longer characterised by a single descriptor. By considering how pool movement constrains the evolution of the ejecta sheet angle, we reach a length-scale invariant parameterisation for the upstream transition that holds for a wide range of fluids and impact conditions. Direct numerical simulations show similar dynamics for an equivalent oblique impact, indicating that the pool boundary layer does not play a decisive role for low pool-droplet speed ratios. Our results also provide insight into the physical mechanism that underpins pool impact outcomes more generally.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the dynamical response of the free surface of an ultra-soft solid driven by a localized moving pressure disturbance. Experiments reveal a steady V-shaped wake analogous to a surface Mach wedge. A simple geometric argument provides a qualitative explanation consistent with observations. A theoretical framework combining elastodynamic, capillary, and gravitational effects yields a generalized dispersion relation that smoothly interpolates between Kelvin's theory of liquid interface wakes and Rayleigh's theory of elastic surface waves. Together, our experiments and theory reveal the existence of a soft wake regime that bridges fluid and solid surface wave physics, offering new routes for probing the dynamics of soft surfaces.</description>

      <title>Modelling the Solar Cycle Nonlinearities into the Algebraic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and predicting solar-cycle variability requires accounting for nonlinear feedbacks that regulate the buildup of the Sun's polar magnetic field. We present a simplified but physically grounded algebraic approach that models the dipole contribution of active regions (ARs) while incorporating two key nonlinearities: tilt quenching (TQ) and latitude quenching (LQ). Using ensembles of synthetic cycles across the dynamo effectivity range $\lambda_R$, we quantify how these mechanisms suppress the axial dipole and impose self-limiting feedback.
  Our results show that (i) both TQ and LQ reduce the polar field, and together they generate a clear saturation (ceiling) of dipole growth with increasing cycle amplitude; (ii) the balance between LQ and TQ, expressed as $R(\lambda_R) = \mathrm{dev(LQ)}/\mathrm{dev(TQ)}$, transitions near $\lambda_R \approx 12^\circ$, with LQ dominating at low $\lambda_R$ and TQ at high $\lambda_R$; (iii) over $8^\circ \leq \lambda_R \leq 20^\circ$, the ratio follows a shallow offset power law with exponent $n \approx 0.36 \pm 0.04$, significantly flatter than the $n=2$ scaling assumed in many surface flux--transport (SFT) models; and (iv) symmetric, tilt-asymmetric, and morphology-asymmetric AR prescriptions yield nearly identical $R(\lambda_R)$ curves, indicating weak sensitivity to AR geometry for fixed transport.
  These findings demonstrate that nonlinear saturation of the solar cycle can be captured efficiently with algebraic formulations, providing a transparent complement to full SFT simulations. The method highlights that the LQ\--TQ balance is primarily controlled by transport ($\lambda_R$), not by active-region configuration, and statistically disfavors the SFT-based $1/\lambda_R^{2}$ dependence.</description>

      <title>Burgers dynamics for Poisson point process initial conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the statistical properties of one-dimensional Burgers dynamics evolving from stochastic initial conditions defined by a Poisson point process for the velocity potential, with a power-law intensity. Thanks to the geometrical interpretation of the solution in the inviscid limit, in terms of first-contact parabolas, we obtain explicit results for the multiplicity functions of shocks and voids, and for velocity and density one- and two-point correlation functions and power spectra. These initial conditions gives rise to self-similar dynamics with probability distributions that display power-law tails. In the limit where the exponent $\alpha$ of the Poisson process that defines the initial conditions goes to infinity, the power-law tails steepen to Gaussian falloffs and we recover the spatial distributions obtained in the classical study by Kida (1979) of Gaussian initial conditions with vanishing large-scale power.</description>

      <title>Neural Physics: Using AI Libraries to Develop Physics-Based Solvers for Incompressible Computational Fluid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical discretisations of partial differential equations (PDEs) can be written as discrete convolutions, which, themselves, are a key tool in AI libraries and used in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We therefore propose to implement numerical discretisations as convolutional layers of a neural network, where the weights or filters are determined analytically rather than by training. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these systems can be solved entirely by functions in AI libraries, either by using Jacobi iteration or multigrid methods, the latter realised through a U-Net architecture. Some advantages of the Neural Physics approach are that (1) the methods are platform agnostic; (2) the resulting solvers are fully differentiable, ideal for optimisation tasks; and (3) writing CFD solvers as (untrained) neural networks means that they can be seamlessly integrated with trained neural networks to form hybrid models. We demonstrate the proposed approach on a number of test cases of increasing complexity from advection-diffusion problems, the non-linear Burgers equation to the Navier-Stokes equations. We validate the approach by comparing our results with solutions obtained from traditionally written code and common benchmarks from the literature. We show that the proposed methodology can solve all these problems using repurposed AI libraries in an efficient way, without training, and presents a new avenue to explore in the development of methods to solve PDEs with implicit methods.</description>

Abstract: Dealing with boundary conditions in Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) poses significant difficulties, indeed being one of the SPHERIC Grand Challenges. In particular, wall boundary conditions have been pivotal in SPH model development since it evolved from astrophysics to more generic fluid dynamics simulations. Despite considerable attention from researchers and numerous publications dedicated to formulating and assessing wall boundary conditions, few of them have addressed the crucial aspect of energy conservation. This work introduces a novel boundary condition designed with energy conservation as a primary consideration, effectively extending the unconditional stability of SPH to problems involving wall boundary conditions. The result is formulated within the framework of the Boundary Integrals technique. The proposal is tested on a number of cases: normal impact against a wall, adiabatic oscillations of a piston, dam break, and the water landing of a spacecraft.</description>

      <title>Molecular Fluctuations Inhibit Intermittency in Compressible Turbulence</title>

Abstract: In the standard picture of fully-developed turbulence, highly intermittent hydrodynamic fields are nonlinearly coupled across scales, where local energy cascades from large scales into dissipative vortices and large density gradients. Microscopically, however, constituent fluid molecules are in constant thermal (Brownian) motion, but the role of molecular fluctuations on large-scale turbulence is largely unknown, and with rare exceptions, it has historically been considered irrelevant at scales larger than the molecular mean free path. Recent theoretical and computational investigations have shown that molecular fluctuations can impact energy cascade at Kolmogorov length scales. Here we show that molecular fluctuations not only modify energy spectrum at wavelengths larger than the Kolmogorov length in compressible turbulence, but they also significantly inhibit spatio-temporal intermittency across the entire dissipation range. Using large-scale direct numerical simulations of computational fluctuating hydrodynamics, we demonstrate that the extreme intermittency characteristic of turbulence models is replaced by nearly-Gaussian statistics in the dissipation range. These results demonstrate that the compressible Navier-Stokes equations should be augmented with molecular fluctuations to accurately predict turbulence statistics across the dissipation range. Our findings have significant consequences for turbulence modeling in applications such as astrophysics, reactive flows, and hypersonic aerodynamics, where dissipation-range turbulence is approximated by closure models.</description>

      <title>Uncovering flow and deformation regimes in the coupled fluid-solid vestibular system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we showcase how flow obstruction by a deformable object can lead to symmetry breaking in curved domains subject to angular acceleration. Our analysis is motivated by the deflection of the cupula, a soft tissue located in the inner ear that is used to perceive rotational motion as part of the vestibular system. The cupula is understood to block the rotation-induced flow in a toroidal region with the flow-induced deformation of the cupula used by the brain to infer motion. By asymptotically solving the governing equations for this flow, we characterise regimes for which the sensory system is sensitive to either angular velocity or angular acceleration. Moreover, we show the fluid flow is not symmetric in the latter case. Finally, we extend our analysis of symmetry breaking to understand the formation of vortical flow in cavernous regions within channels. We discuss the implications of our results for the sensing of rotation by mammals.</description>

      <title>Diffusive Braking of Penetrative Convection in Stably-Stratified Fluids</title>

Abstract: Mixing at the interface between a convection zone and an adjacent, stably-stratified layer plays a crucial role in shaping the structure and evolution of stars and planets. In this work, we present a suite of 2D and 3D Boussinesq simulations that explore how bottom-driven convection penetrates into a compositionally stratified region. Our results reveal two distinct regimes: a penetrative regime, where the convection zone steadily grows by entraining fluid from above, and a stalled regime, where growth halts and transitions to overshooting convection. We extend classical entrainment theory by incorporating thermal and compositional diffusion and by deriving a modified entrainment law that predicts interface speeds in the weak-diffusion limit. We show that convection stalls when the interface speed becomes comparable to the compositional diffusion speed and validate the transition between behaviors across a wide parameter space of Richardson and Lewis numbers. Such diffusively-controlled stalling is unlikely to occur in stellar and planetary interiors, where the Lewis number is typically large and compositional diffusion is extremely slow. In these environments, compositional diffusion will merely slow the growth of the convection zone and convective boundaries are expected to stall only in the presence of other curtailing mechanisms such as strong radiative diffusion or rapid rotation.</description>

      <title>Tunneling Newtonian Universe</title>

Abstract: We analyze quantum-mechanical counterpart of Newtonian cosmology and show that effects of zero-point motion eliminate classical density singularity. Quantum effects are particularly significant for closed Universes where without the cosmological constant the energy spectrum and space curvature are quantized. When small positive cosmological constant is included, these states become quasi-stationary and decay via tunneling. Corresponding metastable Universes evolve in three stages: long period of gestation followed by rapid tunneling expansion further followed by slower Hubble expansion. This closely resembles inflation scenario of modern cosmology.</description>

      <title>Variational closures for composite homogenised fluid flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10408v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Homogenisation theory has seen recent applications in deriving stochastic transport models for fluid dynamics. In this work, we first derive the stochastic Lagrange-to-Euler map that underpins stochastic transport noise in fluid dynamics as the homogenisation limit of a parameterised flow map decomposing into rapidly fluctuating and slow components. Specifically, we prove convergence of this parameterised flow map to a scale-separated limit under the assumptions of a weak invariance principle for the rapidly fluctuating component and path continuity for the slow component. In this limit, the rapidly fluctuating component converges to a stochastic flow of diffeomorphisms that transforms the full flow dynamics into an SDE-governed stochastic flow through composition, while the slow component requires closure.
  Our second contribution formulates two distinct variational closures for the slow component of the homogenised flow that exploit the composite structure of the stochastic flow. For the first closure, the critical points of a new variational principle satisfy a system of random-coefficient PDEs, which can be transformed into a system of stochastic PDEs via the coadjoint action of the stochastic flow map obtained from homogenising the fluctuating component. We show that these equations coincide with the stochastic Euler-Poincar\'e equations previously derived in Holm, Proc. Royal Soc. (2015). For the second closure, we modify the assumptions on the slow component and the associated variational principle to derive averaged models inspired by previous work on mean flow dynamics such as the Generalised Lagrangian Mean.</description>
