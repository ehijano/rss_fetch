      <title>Distributed Resilient Asymmetric Bipartite Consensus: A Data-Driven Event-Triggered Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of asymmetric bipartite consensus control is investigated within the context of nonlinear, discrete-time, networked multi-agent systems (MAS) subject to aperiodic denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. To address the challenges posed by these aperiodic DoS attacks, a data-driven event-triggered (DDET) mechanism has been developed. This mechanism is specifically designed to synchronize the states of the follower agents with the leader's state, even in the face of aperiodic communication disruptions and data losses. Given the constraints of unavailable agents' states and data packet loss during these attacks, the DDET control framework resiliently achieves leader-follower consensus. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated through two numerical examples, which showcase its ability to adeptly handle the complexities arising from aperiodic DoS attacks in nonlinear MAS settings.</description>

      <title>Solvability of Approximate Reach-Avoid Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: In a companion paper, we propose a parametric hybrid automaton model and an algorithm for the online synthesis of robustly correct and near-optimal controllers for cyber-physical system with reach-avoid guarantees. A key part of this synthesis problem is based on a weighted discretised game and solved via scope-adaptive discrete dynamic programming. Approach: This work examines proofs of key properties of the discussed algorithm. Evaluation: The main proof is by induction over the stages of a discrete Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman system of equations. Contribution: The results include a game solvability theorem and identify necessary and sufficient conditions for its applicability.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning Based Prediction of PID Controller Gains for Quadrotor UAVs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A reinforcement learning (RL) based methodology is proposed and implemented for online fine-tuning of PID controller gains, thus, improving quadrotor effective and accurate trajectory tracking. The RL agent is first trained offline on a quadrotor PID attitude controller and then validated through simulations and experimental flights. RL exploits a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm, which is an off-policy actor-critic method. Training and simulation studies are performed using Matlab/Simulink and the UAV Toolbox Support Package for PX4 Autopilots. Performance evaluation and comparison studies are performed between the hand-tuned and RL-based tuned approaches. The results show that the controller parameters based on RL are adjusted during flights, achieving the smallest attitude errors, thus significantly improving attitude tracking performance compared to the hand-tuned approach.</description>

      <title>A Fractional-Order Nonlinear Backstepping Controller Design for Current-Controlled Maglev System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic levitation system (Maglev) is a nonlinear system by which an object is suspended with no support other than magnetic fields. The main control perspective of the Maglev system is to levitate a steel ball in air by the electromagnetic force. However, the Maglev system has highly nonlinear dynamics which is inconvenient in the sense of sensitive control/regulation of its nonlinear dynamics. In this paper, the nonlinear backstepping controller based on the fractional-order derivative is proposed for the control of the nonlinear current-controlled Maglev system. After, the system dynamics and fractional-order backstepping controller design are given, the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system is proved by employing the Lyapunov theory. Some computer-based numerical experiments are carried out to show the effectiveness of the proposed controller for the control of Maglev system.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Incentive Selection for Hierarchical Convex Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss incentive design for hierarchical model predictive control (MPC) systems viewed as Stackelberg games. We consider a hierarchical MPC formulation where, given a lower-level convex MPC (LoMPC), the upper-level system solves a bilevel MPC (BiMPC) subject to the constraint that the lower-level system inputs are optimal for the LoMPC. Such hierarchical problems are challenging due to optimality constraints in the BiMPC formulation. We analyze an incentive Stackelberg game variation of the problem, where the BiMPC provides additional incentives for the LoMPC cost function, which grants the BiMPC influence over the LoMPC inputs. We show that for such problems, the BiMPC can be reformulated as a simpler optimization problem, and the optimal incentives can be iteratively computed without knowing the LoMPC cost function. We extend our formulation for the case of multiple LoMPCs and propose an algorithm that finds bounded suboptimal solutions for the BiMPC. We demonstrate our algorithm for a dynamic price control example, where an independent system operator (ISO) sets the electricity prices for electric vehicle (EV) charging with the goal of minimizing a social cost and satisfying electricity generation constraints. Notably, our method scales well to large EV population sizes.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Learning Framework for Solving Non-Markovian Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integer-order calculus often falls short in capturing the long-range dependencies and memory effects found in many real-world processes. Fractional calculus addresses these gaps via fractional-order integrals and derivatives, but fractional-order dynamical systems pose substantial challenges in system identification and optimal control due to the lack of standard control methodologies. In this paper, we theoretically derive the optimal control via \textit{linear quadratic regulator} (LQR) for \textit{fractional-order linear time-invariant }(FOLTI) systems and develop an end-to-end deep learning framework based on this theoretical foundation. Our approach establishes a rigorous mathematical model, derives analytical solutions, and incorporates deep learning to achieve data-driven optimal control of FOLTI systems. Our key contributions include: (i) proposing an innovative system identification method control strategy for FOLTI systems, (ii) developing the first end-to-end data-driven learning framework, \textbf{F}ractional-\textbf{O}rder \textbf{L}earning for \textbf{O}ptimal \textbf{C}ontrol (FOLOC), that learns control policies from observed trajectories, and (iii) deriving a theoretical analysis of sample complexity to quantify the number of samples required for accurate optimal control in complex real-world problems. Experimental results indicate that our method accurately approximates fractional-order system behaviors without relying on Gaussian noise assumptions, pointing to promising avenues for advanced optimal control.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Coverage Control in Non-Convex Annulus Region with Conformal Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficiently fulfilling coverage tasks in non-convex regions has long been a significant challenge for multi-agent systems (MASs). By leveraging conformal mapping, this paper introduces a novel sectorial coverage formulation to transform a non-convex annulus region into a topologically equivalent one. This approach enables the deployment of MASs in a non-star-shaped region while optimizing coverage performance and achieving load balance among sub-regions. It provides a unique perspective on the partitioned sub-regions to highlight the geodesic convex property of the non-star-shaped region. By utilizing the sectorial partition mechanism and the diffeomorphism property of conformal mapping, a decentralized control law is designed to drive MASs towards a desired configuration, which not only optimizes the global coverage cost but also ensures exponential convergence of equitable workload. Moreover, an iterative search algorithm is developed to identify the optimal approximation of multi-agent deployment in the non-star-shaped region. Theoretical analysis is conducted to confirm the asymptotic stability and global convergence with arbitrary small tolerance of the closed-loop system. Finally, numerical simulations demonstrate the practicality of the proposed coverage formulation with conformal mapping.</description>

      <title>Joint Beamforming Design for Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems with Hybrid-Colluding Eavesdroppers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the physical layer security (PLS) problem for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems in the presence of hybrid-colluding eavesdroppers, where an active eavesdropper (AE) and a passive eavesdropper (PE) collude to intercept the confidential information. To ensure the accuracy of sensing while preventing the eavesdropping, a base station transmits a signal consisting of information symbols and sensing waveform, in which the sensing waveform can be also used as artificial noise to interfere with eavesdroppers. Under this setup, we propose an alternating optimization-based two stage scheme (AO-TSS) for improving the sensing and communication performance. In the first stage, based on the assumptions that the perfect channel state information (CSI) of the AE and statistical CSI of the PE are known, the communication and sensing beamforming problem is formulated with the objective of minimizing the weighted sum of the beampattern matching mean squared error (MSE) and cross-correlation, subject to the secure transmission constraint. To tackle the non-convexity, we propose a semi-definite relaxation (SDR) algorithm and a reduced-complexity zero-forcing (ZF) algorithm. Then, the scenarios are further extended to more general cases with imperfect AE CSI and unknown PE CSI. To further improve the communication performance, the second-stage problem is developed to optimize the secrecy rate threshold under the radar performance constraint. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme in terms of sensing and secure communication.</description>

      <title>Convergent NMPC-based Reinforcement Learning Using Deep Expected Sarsa and Nonlinear Temporal Difference Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a learning-based nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) using an original reinforcement learning (RL) method to learn the optimal weights of the NMPC scheme. The controller is used as the current action-value function of a deep Expected Sarsa where the subsequent action-value function, usually obtained with a secondary NMPC, is approximated with a neural network (NN). With respect to existing methods, we add to the NN's input the current value of the NMPC's learned parameters so that the network is able to approximate the action-value function and stabilize the learning performance. Additionally, with the use of the NN, the real-time computational burden is approximately halved without affecting the closed-loop performance. Furthermore, we combine gradient temporal difference methods with parametrized NMPC as function approximator of the Expected Sarsa RL method to overcome the potential parameters divergence and instability issues when nonlinearities are present in the function approximation. The simulation result shows that the proposed approach converges to a locally optimal solution without instability problems.</description>

      <title>Output-Feedback Full-State Targeting Model Predictive Control for Station-Keeping on Near-Rectilinear Halo Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a model predictive control (MPC) policy for station-keeping (SK) on a Near-Rectilinear Halo Orbit (NRHO). The proposed policy achieves full-state tracking of a reference NRHO via a two-maneuver control horizon placed one revolution apart. Our method abides by the typical mission requirement that at most one maneuver is used for SK during each NRHO revolution. Simultaneously, the policy has sufficient controllability for full-state tracking, making it immune to phase deviation issues in the along-track direction of the reference NRHO, a common drawback of existing SK methods with a single maneuver per revolution. We report numerical simulations with a navigation filter to demonstrate the MPC's performance with output feedback. Our approach successfully maintains the spacecraft's motion in the vicinity of the reference in both space and phase, with tighter tracking than state-of-the-art SK methods and comparable delta-V performance.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Reasoning to Adapt Large Language Models for Domain-Specific Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents SOLOMON, a novel Neuro-inspired Large Language Model (LLM) Reasoning Network architecture that enhances the adaptability of foundation models for domain-specific applications. Through a case study in semiconductor layout design, we demonstrate how SOLOMON enables swift adaptation of general-purpose LLMs to specialized tasks by leveraging Prompt Engineering and In-Context Learning techniques. Our experiments reveal the challenges LLMs face in spatial reasoning and applying domain knowledge to practical problems. Results show that SOLOMON instances significantly outperform their baseline LLM counterparts and achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art reasoning model, o1-preview. We discuss future research directions for developing more adaptive AI systems that can continually learn, adapt, and evolve in response to new information and changing requirements.</description>

      <title>Online Location Planning for AI-Defined Vehicles: Optimizing Joint Tasks of Order Serving and Spatio-Temporal Heterogeneous Model Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) including foundation models (FMs), are increasingly transforming human society, with smart city driving the evolution of urban living.Meanwhile, vehicle crowdsensing (VCS) has emerged as a key enabler, leveraging vehicles' mobility and sensor-equipped capabilities. In particular, ride-hailing vehicles can effectively facilitate flexible data collection and contribute towards urban intelligence, despite resource limitations. Therefore, this work explores a promising scenario, where edge-assisted vehicles perform joint tasks of order serving and the emerging foundation model fine-tuning using various urban data. However, integrating the VCS AI task with the conventional order serving task is challenging, due to their inconsistent spatio-temporal characteristics: (i) The distributions of ride orders and data point-of-interests (PoIs) may not coincide in geography, both following a priori unknown patterns; (ii) they have distinct forms of temporal effects, i.e., prolonged waiting makes orders become instantly invalid while data with increased staleness gradually reduces its utility for model fine-tuning.To overcome these obstacles, we propose an online framework based on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with careful augmentation. A new quality-of-service (QoS) metric is designed to characterize and balance the utility of the two joint tasks, under the effects of varying data volumes and staleness. We also integrate graph neural networks (GNNs) with MARL to enhance state representations, capturing graph-structured, time-varying dependencies among vehicles and across locations. Extensive experiments on our testbed simulator, utilizing various real-world foundation model fine-tuning tasks and the New York City Taxi ride order dataset, demonstrate the advantage of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>The Mini Wheelbot: A Testbed for Learning-based Balancing, Flips, and Articulated Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Mini Wheelbot is a balancing, reaction wheel unicycle robot designed as a testbed for learning-based control. It is an unstable system with highly nonlinear yaw dynamics, non-holonomic driving, and discrete contact switches in a small, powerful, and rugged form factor. The Mini Wheelbot can use its wheels to stand up from any initial orientation - enabling automatic environment resets in repetitive experiments and even challenging half flips. We illustrate the effectiveness of the Mini Wheelbot as a testbed by implementing two popular learning-based control algorithms. First, we showcase Bayesian optimization for tuning the balancing controller. Second, we use imitation learning from an expert nonlinear MPC that uses gyroscopic effects to reorient the robot and can track higher-level velocity and orientation commands. The latter allows the robot to drive around based on user commands - for the first time in this class of robots. The Mini Wheelbot is not only compelling for testing learning-based control algorithms, but it is also just fun to work with, as demonstrated in the video of our experiments.</description>

      <title>Force interaction, modeling and soft tissue deformation during reciprocating insertion of multi-part probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bio-inspired engineering of ovipositing wasps, which employ a reciprocating motion for soft tissue insertion, offers potential advantages in reducing insertion force and minimizing tissue damage. However, the underlying mechanisms of tissue interaction and sparing are not fully understood. In this study, we aim to investigate a multi-part probe designed to mimic the reciprocating motion of ovipositors. A reciprocal insertion model was developed to study the interaction between the probe and soft tissue, and experimental testing was conducted using a force sensor and laser optical technique to gain insights into interacting forces and tissue deformation. The results reveal that during the cutting phase of reciprocal motion, the peak force and average displacement of the soft substrate were approximately 19% and 20% lower, respectively, compared to direct insertion at an overall probe velocity of 1 mm/s. This study presents a novel approach combining mechanical modeling and experimental analysis to explore the force mechanics of the reciprocating insertion method, providing a better understanding of the interaction between the probe and soft tissue.</description>

      <title>Adversarially-Robust TD Learning with Markovian Data: Finite-Time Rates and Fundamental Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most basic problems in reinforcement learning (RL) is policy evaluation: estimating the long-term return, i.e., value function, corresponding to a given fixed policy. The celebrated Temporal Difference (TD) learning algorithm addresses this problem, and recent work has investigated finite-time convergence guarantees for this algorithm and variants thereof. However, these guarantees hinge on the reward observations being always generated from a well-behaved (e.g., sub-Gaussian) true reward distribution. Motivated by harsh, real-world environments where such an idealistic assumption may no longer hold, we revisit the policy evaluation problem from the perspective of adversarial robustness. In particular, we consider a Huber-contaminated reward model where an adversary can arbitrarily corrupt each reward sample with a small probability $\epsilon$. Under this observation model, we first show that the adversary can cause the vanilla TD algorithm to converge to any arbitrary value function. We then develop a novel algorithm called Robust-TD and prove that its finite-time guarantees match that of vanilla TD with linear function approximation up to a small $O(\epsilon)$ term that captures the effect of corruption. We complement this result with a minimax lower bound, revealing that such an additive corruption-induced term is unavoidable. To our knowledge, these results are the first of their kind in the context of adversarial robustness of stochastic approximation schemes driven by Markov noise. The key new technical tool that enables our results is an analysis of the Median-of-Means estimator with corrupted, time-correlated data that might be of independent interest to the literature on robust statistics.</description>

      <title>Be Water, My Antennas: Riding on Radio Wave Fluctuation in Nature for Spatial Multiplexing using Programmable Meta-Fluid Antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interference and scattering, often deemed undesirable, are inevitable in wireless communications, especially when the current mobile networks and upcoming sixth generation (6G) have turned into ultra-dense networks. Current approaches relying on multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) combined with artificial-intelligence-aided (AI) signal processing have drawbacks of being power-hungry and requiring wide bandwidth that raise scalability concerns. In this article, we take a radical approach and utilize the channel fading phenomenon to our advantage. Specifically, we propose a novel meta-fluid antenna architecture, referred to as the `fluid' antenna system (FAS), that can freely surf on radio wave fluctuations, like `fluid' figuratively speaking, with fine resolution in space to opportunistically avoid interference, eliminating the need for expensive signal processing. Our experimental results demonstrate that under rich scattering conditions, the proposed meta-fluidic architecture is able to exploit the natural ups and downs of radio waves in space for spatial multiplexing. These breakthrough results show that scattering can be desirable not harmful and interference can be dodged not suppressed, fundamentally changing our perception of fading and our understanding on how interference should be managed in wireless communications networks.</description>

      <title>Online Robot Motion Planning Methodology Guided by Group Social Proxemics Feature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nowadays robot is supposed to demonstrate human-like perception, reasoning and behavior pattern in social or service application. However, most of the existing motion planning methods are incompatible with above requirement. A potential reason is that the existing navigation algorithms usually intend to treat people as another kind of obstacle, and hardly take the social principle or awareness into consideration. In this paper, we attempt to model the proxemics of group and blend it into the scenario perception and navigation of robot. For this purpose, a group clustering method considering both social relevance and spatial confidence is introduced. It can enable robot to identify individuals and divide them into groups. Next, we propose defining the individual proxemics within magnetic dipole model, and further established the group proxemics and scenario map through vector-field superposition. On the basis of the group clustering and proxemics modeling, we present the method to obtain the optimal observation positions (OOPs) of group. Once the OOPs grid and scenario map are established, a heuristic path is employed to generate path that guide robot cruising among the groups for interactive purpose. A series of experiments are conducted to validate the proposed methodology on the practical robot, the results have demonstrated that our methodology has achieved promising performance on group recognition accuracy and path-generation efficiency. This concludes that the group awareness evolved as an important module to make robot socially behave in the practical scenario.</description>

      <title>The Role of Integrity Monitoring in Connected and Automated Vehicles: Current State-of-Practice and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Connected and Automated Vehicle (CAV) research has gained traction in the last decade due to significant advancements in perception, navigation, communication, and control functions. Accurate and reliable position information is needed to meet the requirements of CAV applications, especially when safety is concerned. With the advent of various perception sensors (e.g. camera, LiDAR, etc.), the vehicular positioning system has improved both in accuracy and robustness. Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) based cooperative positioning can improve the accuracy of the position estimates, but the integrity risks involved in multi-sensor fusion in a cooperative environment have not yet been fully explored. This paper reviews existing research in the field of positioning Integrity Monitoring (IM) and identifies various research gaps. Particular attention has been placed on identifying research that highlights cooperative IM methods. This analysis helps pave the way for the development of new IM frameworks for cooperative positioning solutions in the future.</description>

      <title>A New Paradigm in Tuning Learned Indexes: A Reinforcement Learning Enhanced Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learned Index Structures (LIS) have significantly advanced data management by leveraging machine learning models to optimize data indexing. However, designing these structures often involves critical trade-offs, making it challenging for both designers and end-users to find an optimal balance tailored to specific workloads and scenarios. While some indexes offer adjustable parameters that demand intensive manual tuning, others rely on fixed configurations based on heuristic auto-tuners or expert knowledge, which may not consistently deliver optimal performance.
  This paper introduces LITune, a novel framework for end-to-end automatic tuning of Learned Index Structures. LITune employs an adaptive training pipeline equipped with a tailor-made Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach to ensure stable and efficient tuning. To accommodate long-term dynamics arising from online tuning, we further enhance LITune with an on-the-fly updating mechanism termed the O2 system. These innovations allow LITune to effectively capture state transitions in online tuning scenarios and dynamically adjust to changing data distributions and workloads, marking a significant improvement over other tuning methods. Our experimental results demonstrate that LITune achieves up to a 98% reduction in runtime and a 17-fold increase in throughput compared to default parameter settings given a selected Learned Index instance. These findings highlight LITune's effectiveness and its potential to facilitate broader adoption of LIS in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Wireless Resource Management and Synchronization in Digital Twin Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate an accurate synchronization between a physical network and its digital network twin (DNT), which serves as a virtual representation of the physical network. The considered network includes a set of base stations (BSs) that must allocate its limited spectrum resources to serve a set of users while also transmitting its partially observed physical network information to a cloud server to generate the DNT. Since the DNT can predict the physical network status based on its historical status, the BSs may not need to send their physical network information at each time slot, allowing them to conserve spectrum resources to serve the users. However, if the DNT does not receive the physical network information of the BSs over a large time period, the DNT's accuracy in representing the physical network may degrade. To this end, each BS must decide when to send the physical network information to the cloud server to update the DNT, while also determining the spectrum resource allocation policy for both DNT synchronization and serving the users. We formulate this resource allocation task as an optimization problem, aiming to maximize the total data rate of all users while minimizing the asynchronization between the physical network and the DNT. To address this problem, we propose a method based on the GRUs and the value decomposition network (VDN). Simulation results show that our GRU and VDN based algorithm improves the weighted sum of data rates and the similarity between the status of the DNT and the physical network by up to 28.96%, compared to a baseline method combining GRU with the independent Q learning.</description>

Abstract: Power-to-X (PtX) products constitute a promising solution component in the defossilisation of hard-to-abate sectors. Where direct electrification is not possible, they can find application as chemical feedstock, easy to transport energy carriers and storage. In this contribution, a modular system architecture for a highly automated operation of an offshore off-grid PtX production platform consisting of five layers (asset, control, communication, digital, application) is presented. The assumed advantage of such an off-grid platform is the good scalability worldwide as well as easy exploitation of renewable potentials in any location. Using the example of a power-to-methanol process, a simplified prototype is outlined.</description>

      <title>Prescribed-time Convergent Distributed Multiobjective Optimization with Dynamic Event-triggered Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses distributed constrained multiobjective resource allocation problems (DCMRAPs) within multi-agent networks, where each agent has multiple, potentially conflicting local objectives, constrained by both local and global constraints. By reformulating the DCMRAP as a single-objective weighted $L_p$ problem, a distributed solution is enabled, which eliminates the need for predetermined weighting factors or centralized decision-making in traditional methods. Leveraging prescribed-time control and dynamic event-triggered mechanisms (ETMs), novel distributed algorithms are proposed to achieve Pareto optimality within a prescribed settling time through sampled communication. Using generalized time-based generators (TBGs), these algorithms provide more flexibility in optimizing accuracy and control smoothness without the constraints of initial conditions. Novel dynamic ETMs are designed to work with generalized TBGs to promote communication efficiency, which adjusts to both local error metrics and network-based disagreements. The Zeno behavior is excluded. Validated by Lyapunov analysis and simulations, our method demonstrates superior control performance and efficiency compared to existing methods, advancing distributed optimization in complex environments.</description>

      <title>Nature-inspired dynamic control for pursuit-evasion of robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pursuit-evasion problem is widespread in nature, engineering, and societal applications. It is commonly observed in nature that predators often exhibit faster speeds than their prey but have less agile maneuverability. Over millions of years of evolution, animals have developed effective and efficient strategies for both pursuit and evasion. In this paper, we provide a dynamic framework for the pursuit-evasion problem of unicycle systems, drawing inspiration from nature. First, we address the scenario involving one pursuer and one evader by proposing an Alert-Turn control strategy, which consists of two efficient ingredients: a sudden turning maneuver and an alert condition for starting and maintaining the maneuver. We present and analyze the escape and capture results at two levels: a lower level of a single run and a higher level with respect to parameters' changes. In addition, we provide a theorem with sufficient conditions for capture. The Alert-Turn strategy is then extended to more complex scenarios involving multiple pursuers and evaders by integrating aggregation control laws and a target-changing mechanism. By adjusting a 'selfish parameter', the aggregation control commands produce various escape patterns of evaders: cooperative mode, selfish mode, as well as their combinations. The influence of the selfish parameter is quantified, and the effects of the number of pursuers and the target-changing mechanism are explored from a statistical perspective. Our findings align closely with observations in nature. Finally, the proposed control strategies are validated through numerical simulations that replicate some chasing behaviors of animals in nature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the use of autonomous unmanned vehicles to support power grid operations. With built-in batteries and the capability to carry additional battery energy storage, the rising number of autonomous vehicles can represent a substantial amount of capacity that is currently underutilized in the power grid. Unlike traditional electric vehicles that require drivers, the operations of autonomous vehicles can be performed without human intervention. To guide idle vehicles to autonomously support power grids, we propose a tractable optimization-based method to effectively integrate these "mobile batteries" into grid operations. During real-time operations, the vehicles are strategically routed to target locations to maintain power balance and reduce operating costs. Numerical studies have confirmed both the validity and the scalability of the proposed algorithm to efficiently integrate autonomous vehicles into routine power system operations.</description>

Abstract: This letter reports on Solidly-Mounted Bidimensional Mode Resonators (S2MRs) exploiting a highly-optimized Sezawa mode in 30% Scandium-doped Aluminum Nitride (ScAlN) on Silicon Carbide (SiC) and operating near 16 GHz. Experimental results demonstrate mechanical quality factors (Qm) as high as 380, Bode quality factors (QBode) approaching 500, electromechanical coupling coefficients (kt2) of 4.5%, an overall Figure of Merit (FOM = Qm kt2) exceeding 17, and power handling greater than 20 dBm for devices closely matched to 50 ohms. To the best of the authors' knowledge, S2MRs exhibit the highest Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) among solidly mounted resonators in the Ku band, paving the way for the integration of nanoacoustic devices on fast substrates with high-power electronics, tailored for military and harsh-environment applications.</description>

      <title>A Dynamic Similarity Index for Assessing Voltage Source Behaviour in Power Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to the fundamental transition to a power electronic dominated power system, the increasing diversity of dynamic elements underscores the need to assess their similarity to mature electrical engineering models. This article addresses the concept of the Dynamic Similarity Index (DSI) for its use in, power electronics-dominated networks. The DSI is a multipurpose tool developed to be used by different stakeholders (e.g., converter manufacturers and system operators). Such an index is calculated per frequency, which serves to anticipate potential differences in particular frequency ranges of interest between the model under study and the reference model. Within the scope of this study, the dynamic similarity of inverter-based generators to an ideal voltage source behind an impedance is assessed, due to the relevance of this fundamental circuit in the representation of generation units in power system studies. The article presents two potential applications based on this mathematical framework. First, for manufacturers to evaluate control performance compared to a reference model and second, it enables operators to diagnose buses with voltage vulnerability based on a user-defined reference Short-Circuit Ratio (SCR) value. The DSI results for these two case studies are validated using Matlab Simulink simulations.</description>

      <title>C codegen considered unnecessary: go directly to binary, do not pass C. Compilation of Julia code for deployment in model-based engineering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since time immemorial an old adage has always seemed to ring true: you cannot use a high-level productive programming language like Python or R for real-time control and embedded-systems programming, you must rewrite your program in C. We present a counterexample to this mantra by demonstrating how recent compiler developments in the Julia programming language allow users of Julia and the equation-based modeling language ModelingToolkit to compile and deploy binaries for real-time model-based estimation and control. Contrary to the approach taken by a majority of modeling and simulation tools, we do not generate C code, and instead demonstrate how we may use the native Julia code-generation pipeline through LLVM to compile architecture-specific binaries from high-level code. This approach avoids many of the restrictions typically placed on high-level languages to enable C-code generation. As case studies, we include a nonlinear state estimator derived from an equation-based model which is compiled into a program that performs state estimation for deployment onto a Raspberry Pi, as well as a PID controller library implemented in Julia and compiled into a shared library callable from a C program.</description>

      <title>Sequential Change Detection for Learning in Piecewise Stationary Bandit Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A finite-horizon variant of the quickest change detection problem is investigated, which is motivated by a change detection problem that arises in piecewise stationary bandits. The goal is to minimize the \emph{latency}, which is smallest threshold such that the probability that the detection delay exceeds the threshold is below a desired low level, while controlling the false alarm probability to a desired low level. When the pre- and post-change distributions are unknown, two tests are proposed as candidate solutions. These tests are shown to attain order optimality in terms of the horizon. Furthermore, the growth in their latencies with respect to the false alarm probability and late detection probability satisfies a property that is desirable in regret analysis for piecewise stationary bandits. Numerical results are provided to validate the theoretical performance results.</description>
