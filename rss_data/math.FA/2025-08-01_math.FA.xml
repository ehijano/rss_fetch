      <title>Generalized Multiple Operator Integrals and Perturbation Theory for Operators with Continuous Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Operators with continuous spectra naturally arise in spectral theory, quantum mechanics, automorphic forms, and noncommutative geometry. However, analyzing such operators, particularly in the non-selfadjoint setting, remains challenging due to spectral instability and the lack of an orthonormal basis. This work advances the theory of Multiple Operator Integrals (MOIs) by developing a unified framework for generalized MOIs (GMOIs) associated with general (non-normal, non-selfadjoint) operators possessing continuous spectra. Building on prior work in Generalized Double Operator Integrals (GDOIs) and finite dimensional GMOIs, we extend the theory to include: the formulation of GMOIs in the continuous spectrum setting, their algebraic structure, continuity properties, norm and Lipschitz estimates, and a perturbation formula that generalizes classical results. As a key application, we derive a Krein-type spectral shift formula for GDOIs in the continuous spectrum setting and further extend it to arbitrary-order approximations. These contributions provide a foundation for broader developments in spectral theory, operator algebras, noncommutative geometry, and noncommutative analysis.</description>

      <title>Optimal Dual Frame Pairs: A Synergy with Graph Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the optimization of dual frame pairs in the context of erasure problems in data transmission, using a graph theoretical approach. Frames are essential for mitigating errors and signal loss due to their redundancy properties. We address the use of spectral radius and operator norm for error measurements, presenting conditions for the optimality of dual pairs for one and two erasures. Our study shows that a tight frame generated by connected graphs and its canonical dual pair is optimal for one-erasure scenarios. Additionally, we compute the spectral radius of the error operator for one and two erasures in graph-generated frames, establishing necessary conditions for dual pair optimality.</description>

      <title>On the continuity of derivations over locally regular Banach algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of continuity of derivations over Banach algebras. More specifically, we consider a class of Banach algebras that contain a dense `$C^*$-like' subalgebra. We discuss applications to $L^p$-crossed products and symmetrized $L^p$-crossed products. As an example, our results imply that every derivation over the $L^p$-crossed product $F^p(G,X,\alpha)$ is continuous, provided that $G$ is infinite, finitely generated, has polynomial growth, and acts freely on the compact space $X$.</description>

      <title>Deformations of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces on Homogeneous Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the relationships between a subvariety of the open unit ball in the complex $d$-dimensional space $\mathbb{C}^{d}$, the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) obtained by restricting the Drury-Arveson space to the variety, and its multiplier algebra. Davidson, Ramsey, and Shalit showed that given two subvarieties, one is the image of the other under an automorphism of the ball if and only if the RKHSs corresponding to the varieties are isometrically isomorphic as RKHSs, and this holds if and only if their multiplier algebras are isometrically isomorphic as multiplier algebras. We observe that whenever two such RKHSs are close to being isometrically isomorphic, their multiplier algebras are close to being isometrically isomorphic as well. In this case, the underlying varieties are close to being automorphically equivalent. For homogeneous varieties satisfying some additional conditions, we show that if one variety is close to being the image of the other under a unitary, then the RKHSs are close to being isometrically isomorphic as RKHSs. This continues work by Ofek, Pandey and Shalit, who showed that for two finite subsets in the open unit ball $B_{d}$, one set is close to being the image of the other under an automorphism of $B_{d}$, if and only if the RKHSs defined on these sets, are close to being isometrically isomorphic, and that happens if and only if their multiplier algebras are close to being completely isometrically isomorphic.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hamming Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given the set of words of a given length for a given alphabet, the Hamming metric between two such words is the number of positions where the two words differ. A quantum version of the corresponding Kantorovich-Wasserstein metric on states was introduced in 2021 by De Palma, Marvian, Trevisan and Lloyd. For the quantum version the alphabet is replaced by a full matrix algebra, and the set of words is replaced by the tensor product of a corresponding number of copies of that full matrix algebra. While De Palma et al. work primarily at the level of states, they do obtain the corresponding seminorm (the quantum Hamming metric) on the algebra of observables that plays the role of assigning Lipschitz constants to functions. A suitable such seminorm on a unital C*-algebra is the current common method for defining a quantum metric on a C*-algebra.
  In this paper we will reverse the process, by first expressing the Hamming metric in terms of the C*-algebra of functions on the set of words, and then dropping the requirement that the algebra be commutative so as to obtain the quantum Hamming metric. From that we obtain the corresponding Kantorovich-Wasserstein metric on states. Along the way we show that many of the steps can be put in more general forms of some interest, notably for infinite-dimensional C*-algebras.</description>

      <title>Local presentability and monadicity of forgetful functors for operator algebraic categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent work of Lindenhovius and Zamdzhiev, it was established that the category of complete operator spaces, with completely contractive linear maps as morphisms, is locally countably presentable. In this work, we extend their conclusion to the non-complete setting and prove that the categories of operator systems, (Archimedean) order unit spaces, and unital operator algebras are all locally countably presentable as well. This is established through an analysis of forgetful functors and the identification of Eilenberg-Moore categories. We provide a complete understanding of adjunction and monadicity for forgetful functors between these categories, together with the categories of $C^*$-algebras, Banach spaces, and normed spaces. In addition, for various subcategories of function-theoretic objects, we investigate completeness and local presentability through Kadison's duality theorem.</description>

      <title>Exact values of Fourier dimensions of Gaussian multiplicative chaos on high dimensional torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the exact values of the Fourier dimensions for Gaussian Multiplicative Chaos measures on the $d$-dimensional torus $\mathbb{T}^d$ for all integers $d \ge 1$. This resolves a problem left open in previous works [LQT24,LQT25] for high dimensions $d\ge 3$. The proof relies on a new construction of log-correlated Gaussian fields admitting specific decompositions into smooth processes with high regularity. This construction enables a multi-resolution analysis to obtain sharp local estimates on the measure's Fourier decay. These local estimates are then integrated into a global bound using Pisier's martingale type inequality for vector-valued martingales.</description>

      <title>On the lattice property of the Koopman operator spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Koopman operator has become a celebrated tool in modern dynamical systems theory for analyzing and interpreting both models and datasets. The linearity of the Koopman operator means that important characteristics about it, and in turn its associated nonlinear system, are captured by its eigenpairs and more generally its spectrum. Many studies point out that the spectrum of the Koopman operator has a multiplicative lattice structure by which eigenvalues and eigenfunctions can be multiplied to produce new eigenpairs. However, these observations fail to resolve whether the new eigenfunction remains in the domain of the Koopman operator. In this work, we prove that the spectrum of the Koopman operator associated to discrete-time dynamical systems has a multiplicative lattice structure. We further demonstrate that the Koopman operator associated to discrete-time stochastic process does not necessarily have such a structure, demonstrating an important nuance that lies at the heart of Koopman operator theory.</description>

Abstract: We define the speed measure $\nu$ for mappings $\gamma:I\to X$ from an interval to a metric space that are locally of bounded variation. We characterize continuity and absolute continuity of $\gamma$ in terms of $\nu$ and identify the Radon-Nikod\'ym derivative of $\nu$ with respect to Lebesgue measure as the metric speed of $\gamma$. In doing so we prove an extension of the Banach-Zaretsky theorem.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Kirkwood-Dirac positivity on second countable LCA groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define the Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability representation of quantum mechanics associated with the Fourier transform over second countable locally compact abelian groups. We discuss its link with the Kohn-Nirenberg quantization of the phase space $G\times \widehat{G}$. We use it to argue that in this abstract setting the Wigner-Weyl quantization, when it exists, can still be interpreted as a symmetric ordering. Then, we identify all generalized (non-normalizable) pure states having a positive Kirkwood-Dirac distribution. They are, up to the natural action of the Weyl-Heisenberg group, Haar measures on closed subgroups. This generalizes a result known for finite abelian groups. We then show that the classical fragment of quantum mechanics associated with the Kirkwood-Dirac distribution is non-trivial if and only if the group has a compact connected component. Finally, we provide for connected compact abelian groups a complete geometric description of this classical fragment.</description>

      <title>On Rieffel's conjecture characterizing a deformed algebra as Heisenberg smooth operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.10990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathscr{A}$ be a unital C$^*$-algebra and $E_n$ be the Hilbert $\mathscr{A}$-module defined as the completion of the $\mathscr{A}$-valued Schwartz function space $\mathcal{S}^\mathscr{A}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ with respect to the norm $\|f\|_2 := \left\| \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} f(x)^*f(x) \, dx \right\|_\mathscr{A}^{1 / 2}$. Also, let $\text{Ad }\mathcal{U}$ be the canonical action of the $(2n + 1)$-dimensional Heisenberg group by conjugation on the algebra of adjointable operators on $E_n$ and let $J$ be a skew-symmetric linear transformation on $\mathbb{R}^n$. We characterize the smooth vectors under $\text{Ad }\mathcal{U}$ which commute with a certain algebra of right multiplication operators $R_h$, with $h \in \mathcal{S}^\mathscr{A}(\mathbb{R}^n)$, where the product is ``twisted'' with respect to $J$ according to a deformation quantization procedure introduced by M.A. Rieffel. More precisely, we establish that they coincide with an algebra of left multiplication operators and show that this solves, in particular, a conjecture posed by Rieffel.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate the existence of positive solutions for certain weakly coupled elliptic systems of sublinear growth under homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. Our findings generalize existing results related to sublinear systems involving two weakly coupled equations, such as the Lane-Emden systems. Moreover, our results apply to both bounded domains and thin unbounded domains, defined as unbounded regions contained between two parallel hyperplanes, and accommodate some discontinuous nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>Sharp Weighted Cohen--Dahmen--Daubechies--DeVore Inequality with Applications to (Weighted) Critical Sobolev Spaces, Gagliardo--Nirenberg Inequalities, and Muckenhoupt Weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we establish a quantitative weighted variant of a far-reaching inequality obtained by A. Cohen, W. Dahmen, I. Daubechies, and R. DeVore in 2003, whose dependence on the $A_p$-weight constant for any $p\in[1,\infty)$ is sharp. As applications, we obtain the almost characterization of the critical weighted Sobolev space in terms of wavelets, a sharp real interpolation between this weighted Sobolev space and weighted Besov spaces, and three new Gagliardo--Nirenberg type inequalities in the framework of ball Banach function spaces. Moreover, we apply this sharp weighted inequality to extend the famous Brezis--Seeger--Van Schaftingen--Yung formula in ball Banach function spaces, which gives an affirmative answer to the question in page 29 of [Calc. Var. Partial Differential Equations 62 (2023), Paper No. 234]. Notably, we further establish two new characterizations of Muckenhoupt weights related to the inequality of Cohen et al.\ and the formula of Brezis et al. The most novelty of this article exists in applying and further developing the good cube method introduced by Cohen et al.\ to trace the sharp dependences on weight constants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present bounds on the maximal gain of adaptive and randomized algorithms over non-adaptive, deterministic ones for approximating linear operators on convex sets. If the sets are additionally symmetric, then our results are optimal. For non-symmetric sets, we unify some notions of $n$-widths and s-numbers, and show their connection to minimal errors. We also discuss extensions to non-linear widths and approximation based on function values, and conclude with a list of open problems.</description>

Abstract: Let $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ be an $(\epsilon,\delta,D)$-domain, with $\epsilon\in(0,1]$, $\delta\in(0,\infty]$, and $D\subset \partial \Omega$ being a closed part of $\partial \Omega$, which is a general open connected set when $D=\partial \Omega$ and an $(\epsilon,\delta)$-domain when $D=\emptyset$. Let $s\in(0,1)$ and $p\in[1,\infty)$. If ${W}^{s,p}(\Omega)$, ${\mathcal W}^{s,p}(\Omega)$, and $\mathring{W}_D^{s,p}(\Omega)$ are the fractional Sobolev spaces on $\Omega$ that are defined respectively via the restriction of $W^{s,p}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ to $\Omega$, the intrinsic Gagliardo norm, and the completion of all $C^\infty(\Omega)$ functions with compact support away from $D$, in this article we prove their equivalences [that is, ${W}^{s,p}(\Omega)={\mathcal{W}}^{s,p}(\Omega) =\mathring{W}_D^{s,p}(\Omega)$] if $\Omega$ supports a $D$-adapted fractional Hardy inequality and, moreover, when $sp\ne 1$ such a fractional Hardy inequality is shown to be necessary to guarantee these equivalences under some mild geometric conditions on $\Omega$. Using the aforementioned equivalences, we show that the real interpolation space $(L^p(\Omega), \mathring{W}_D^{1,p}(\Omega))_{s,p}$ equals to some weighted fractional order Sobolev space $\mathcal{W}^{s,p}_{d_D^s}(\Omega)$ when $p\in (1,\infty)$. Applying this to the elliptic operator $\mathcal{L}_D$ in $\Omega$ with mixed boundary condition, we characterize both the domain of its fractional power and the parabolic maximal regularity of its Cauchy initial problem by means of $\mathcal{W}^{s,p}_{d_D^s}(\Omega)$.</description>
