      <title>Proportional scintillation in liquid xenon: demonstration in a single-phase liquid-only time projection chamber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The largest direct dark matter search experiments to date employ dual-phase time projection chambers (TPCs) with liquid noble gas targets. These detect both the primary photons generated by particle interactions in the liquid target, as well as proportional secondary scintillation light created by the ionization electrons in a strong electric field in the gas phase between the liquid-gas interface and the anode. In this work, we describe the detection of charge signals in a small-scale single-phase liquid-xenon-only TPC, that features the well-established TPC geometry with light readout above and below a cylindrical target. In the single-phase TPC, the proportional scintillation light (S2) is generated in liquid xenon in close proximity to 10 {\mu}m diameter anode wires. The detector was characterized and the proportional scintillation process was studied using the 32.1 keV and 9.4 keV signals from Kr-83m decays. A charge gain factor g2 of up to (1.9 $\pm$ 0.3) PE/electron was reached at an anode voltage 4.4 kV higher than the gate electrode, corresponding to (29 $\pm$ 6) photons emitted per ionization electron. The duration of S2 signals is dominated by electron diffusion and approaches the xenon de-excitation timescale for very short electron drift times. The electron drift velocity and the longitudinal diffusion constant were measured at a drift field of 470 V/cm. The results agree with the literature and demonstrate that a single-phase TPC can be operated successfully.</description>

      <title>Scanning Acoustic Microscopy for Quantifying Two-phase Transfer in Operando Alkaline Water Electrolyzer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Improved understandings of two-phase transport in electrochemical gas-evolving systems are increasingly demanded, while high-performance imaging techniques using simplified instrumentations are not readily available. This work presents volumetric scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM) imaging for quantifying the dynamics of gas bubbles and electrolyte in porous Nickel electrodes with different wettability and structures during alkaline water electrolysis (AWE). We realize high-resolution 3D imaging at 10's um level using high frequency spherically focused ultrasound. The high resolution allowed us to clearly visualize the spatial distributions of produced bubbles in the porous electrodes over time. Moreover, we are able to quantify the residual gas volume in an electrode and its coverage due to bubble evolution, which dominate its transport overpotential. Taking these advantages, we elucidate the impacts of electrodes' wettability and structures on their electrolysis performance, on a regular laboratory base. The obtained knowledge provides us important optimization guidelines of AWE designs and operating schemes.</description>

      <title>Absolute quantum gravimeters and gradiometers for field measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravity measurements provide valuable information on the mass distribution below the earth surface relevant to various areas of geosciences such as hydrology, geodesy, geophysics, volcanology, and natural resources management. During the past decades, the needs for sensitivity, robustness, compactness, and transportability of instruments measuring the gravitational acceleration have constantly increased. Today, applications typically call for 1 $\mu \mathrm{Gal} = 10 \mathrm{nm.s}^{-2}$ ~ $10^{-9}$ g resolution on time scales ranging from minutes to years. Absolute Quantum Gravimeters (AQGs) based on matter-wave interferometry with laser-cooled atoms address all these challenges at once, even in uncontrolled environments. Furthermore, to date, quantum gravimeters are the only technology capable of providing continuous absolute gravity data over long measurement durations (~1 day to months or more). In this paper we recall the AQG working principle and present the reproducible high performance at the {\mu}Gal level on all 16 units fabricated so far. We also describe recent progress on the Differential Quantum Gravimeter (DQG) which measures simultaneously the mean gravitational acceleration and its vertical gradient at the level of $10 \mathrm{nm.s}^{-2}$ and $1$ E (1 E[eotvos] = $10^{-9}$ s$^{-2}$) respectively.</description>
