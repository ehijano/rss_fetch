      <title>Recovering the shape of a quantum tree by scattering data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a scattering problem generated by the Sturm-Liouville equation on a tree which consists of an equilateral compact subtree and a half-infinite lead attached to its root. We assume that the potential on the lead is identically zero while the potentials on the finite edges are real. We show how to find the shape of the tree using the S-function of the scattering problem and the eigenvalues of the operators associated with the compact tree.</description>

      <title>A new geometric constant to compare p-angular and skew p-angular distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $p$-angular distance was first introduced by Maligranda in 2006, while the skew $p$-angular distance was first introduced by Rooin in 2018. In this paper, we shall introduce a new geometric constant named Maligranda-Rooin constant in Banach spaces to compare $p$-angular distance and skew $p$-angular distance. We denote the Maligranda-Rooin constant as $\mathcal{M} \mathcal{R}_p(\mathcal{X})$. First, the upper and lower bounds for the $\mathcal{M} \mathcal{R}_p(\mathcal{X})$ constant is given. Next, it's shown that, a normed linear space is an inner space if and only if $\mathcal{M} \mathcal{R}_p(\mathcal{X})=1$. Moreover, an equivalent form of this new constant is established. By means of the $\mathcal{M} \mathcal{R}_p(\mathcal{X})$ constant, we carry out the quantification of the characterization of uniform nonsquareness. Finally, we study the relationship between the $\mathcal{M} \mathcal{R}_p(\mathcal{X})$ constant, uniform convexity, uniform smooth and normal structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a generalization of Moreau-Yosida regularization that is adapted to the geometry of Banach spaces where the dual space is uniformly convex with modulus of convexity of power type. Important properties for regularized convex functions are given, in particular strong monotonicity of the subdifferential of their convex conjugate and H\"older-continuity of their gradient.</description>

      <title>On the $W$-entropy and Shannon entropy power on RCD$(K, N)$ and RCD$(K, n, N)$ spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the $W$-entropy formula and its monotonicity for the heat flow on RCD$(K, N)$ and RCD$(K, n, N)$ spaces $(X, d, \mu)$, where $K\in \mathbb{R}$, $n$ is the geometric dimension of $(X, d, \mu)$ and $N\geq n$. We also prove the $K$-concavity of the Shannon entropy power on RCD$(K, N)$ spaces. As an application, we derive the Shannon entropy isoperimetric inequality and the Stam logarithmic Sobolev inequality on RCD$(0, N)$ spaces with maximal volume growth condition. Finally, we prove the rigidity theorem for the Stam logarithmic Sobolev inequality with sharp constant on noncollapsing RCD$(0, N)$ spaces.</description>

      <title>Covariant decomposable maps on C*-algebras and quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize covariant positive decomposable maps between unital C*-algebras in terms of a dilation theorem, which generalizes a seminal result by H. Scutaru from Rep. Math. Phys. 16 (1):79-87, 1979. As a case study, we provide a certain characterization of the operator sum representation of maps on $\mathbb{M}_n (\mathbb{C})$, covariant with respect to the maximal commutative subgroup of $\mathrm{U}(n)$. A connection to quantum dynamics is established by specifying sufficient and necessary conditions for covariance of D-divisible (decomposably divisible) quantum evolution families, recently introduced in J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 56 (2023) 485202.</description>

      <title>Spans of quantum-inequality projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A hereditarily atomic von Neumann algebra $A$ is a $W^*$ product of matrix algebras, regarded as the underlying function algebra of a quantum set. Projections in $A\overline{\otimes}A^{\circ}$ are interpreted as quantum binary relations on $A$, with the supremum of all $p\otimes (1-p)$ representing quantum inequality. We prove that the symmetrized weak$^*$-closed linear span of all such quantum-inequality projections is precisely the symmetric summand of the joint kernel of multiplication and opposite multiplication, a result valid without the symmetrization qualification for plain matrix algebras. The proof exploits the symmetries of the spaces involved under the compact unitary group of $A$, and related results include a classification of those von Neumann algebras (hereditarily atomic or not) for which the unitary group operates jointly continuously with respect to the weak$^*$ topology.</description>

      <title>Axiomatic Foundations of Fractal Analysis and Fractal Number Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an axiomatic framework for fractal analysis and fractal number theory grounded in hierarchies of definability. Central to this approach is a sequence of formal systems F_n, each corresponding to a definability level S_n contained in R of constructively accessible mathematical objects. This structure refines classical analysis by replacing uncountable global constructs with countable, syntactically constrained approximations.
  The axioms formalize: - A hierarchy of definability levels S_n, indexed by syntactic and ordinal complexity; - Fractal topologies and the induced notions of continuity, compactness, and differentiability; - Layered integration and differentiation with explicit convergence and definability bounds; - Arithmetic and function spaces over the stratified continuum R_{S_n}, which is a subset of R.
  This framework synthesizes constructive mathematics, proof-theoretic stratification, and fractal geometric intuition into a unified, finitistically structured model. Key results include the definability-based classification of real numbers (e.g., algebraic, computable, Liouville), a stratified fundamental theorem of calculus with syntactic error bounds, and compatibility with base systems such as RCA_0 and ACA_0.
  The framework enables constructive approximation and syntactic regularization of classical analysis, with applications to proof assistants, computable mathematics, and foundational studies of the continuum.</description>

      <title>Shifts on trees versus classical shifts in chain recurrence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct continuous (and even invertible) linear operators acting on Banach (even Hilbert) spaces whose restrictions to their respective closed linear subspaces of chain recurrent vectors are not chain recurrent operators. This construction completely solves in the negative a problem posed by Nilson C. Bernardes Jr. and Alfred Peris on chain recurrence in Linear Dynamics. In particular: we show that the non-invertible case can be directly solved via relatively simple weighted backward shifts acting on certain unrooted directed trees; then we modify the non-invertible counterexample to address the invertible case, but falling outside the class of weighted shift operators; and we finally show that this behaviour cannot be achieved via classical (unilateral neither bilateral) weighted backward sifts (acting on $\mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{Z}$ respectively) by noticing that a classical shift is a chain recurrent operator whenever it admits a non-zero chain recurrent vector.</description>

Abstract: We characterize the restrictions of B\'ekoll\'e--Bonami weights of bounded hyperbolic oscillation, to subsets of the unit disc, thus proving an analogue of Wolff's restriction theorem for Muckenhoupt weights. Sundberg proved a discrete version of Wolff's original theorem, by characterizing the trace of $BMO$-functions onto interpolating sequences. We consider an analogous question in our setting, by studying the trace of Bloch functions. Through Makarov's probabilistic approach to the Bloch space, our question can be recast as a restriction problem for dyadic martingales with uniformly bounded increments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13150v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Wasserstein divergences are modified versions of quantum Wasserstein distances defined by channels, and they are conjectured to be genuine metrics on quantum state spaces by De Palma and Trevisan. We prove triangle inequality for quantum Wasserstein divergences for every quantum system described by a separable Hilbert space and any quadratic cost operator under the assumption that a particular state involved is pure, and all the states have finite energy. We also provide strong numerical evidence suggesting that the triangle inequality holds in general, for an arbitrary choice of states.</description>

      <title>Bias and Division in the Free World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sampling bias is a foundational concept in statistics; associated bias transforms, such as size bias, have come to play important roles in probability theory of late. The first author and G. Reinert introduced zero bias, a transform whose unique fixed point is the normal distribution; it has become a standard tool in Stein's method and Gaussian approximation. Very recently, connections between zero bias and the class of infinitely divisible distributions have been found.
  In this paper, we develop a free probabilistic analog of the zero bias transform, proving its existence and regularity. The free zero bias has the semicircle law (free probability's central limit distribution) as its unique fixed point. We offer a construction of the free zero bias that mirrors a classical one incorporating square bias with a mollifier, and in the process develop a surprisingly new class of distributional operations through their Cauchy transforms.
  We then explore connections between the free zero bias, and size bias, with the class of freely infinitely divisible distributions. We develop a new self-contained treatment of the subject, together with a new characterization of free infinite divisibility using bias transforms. We also develop a parallel treatment of positively freely infinitely divisible distributions, which can also be characterized by a new kind of Levy--Khintchine formula that has no known classical analogue, and we use this to both give several new descriptions of such distributions and furnish new examples using these bias methods.</description>

      <title>Spectral decomposition of field operators and causal measurement in quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct the spectral decomposition of field operators in bosonic quantum field theory as a limit of a strongly continuous family of positive-operator-valued measure decompositions. The latter arise from integrals over families of bounded positive operators. Crucially, these operators have the same locality properties as the underlying field operators. We use the decompositions to construct families of quantum operations implementing measurements of the field observables. Again, the quantum operations have the same locality properties as the field operators. What is more, we show that these quantum operations do not lead to superluminal signaling and are possible measurements on quantum fields in the sense of Sorkin.</description>

      <title>Sharp Matrix Empirical Bernstein Inequalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09516v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present two sharp, closed-form empirical Bernstein inequalities for symmetric random matrices with bounded eigenvalues. By sharp, we mean that both inequalities adapt to the unknown variance in a tight manner: the deviation captured by the first-order $1/\sqrt{n}$ term asymptotically matches the matrix Bernstein inequality exactly, including constants, the latter requiring knowledge of the variance. Our first inequality holds for the sample mean of independent matrices, and our second inequality holds for a mean estimator under martingale dependence at stopping times.</description>
