      <title>Approaching Unity Photon Collection from NV Centers via Ultra-Precise Positioning of Nanodiamonds in Hybrid Nanoantennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient readout of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond is crucial for various quantum information technologies. However, achieving high-fidelity, single-shot readout at room temperature remains challenging due to limited photon collection efficiency (CE) and background noise. In this work, we enhance the readout efficiency of NV centers by integrating them into hybrid metal-dielectric bullseye nanoantennas using ultra-precise deterministic positioning. This approach enables highly directional emission while minimizing optical losses, resulting in a measured CE of 82\% into a numerical aperture (NA) as low as 0.5, and approaching unity for NA$&gt;$0.8. This marks a substantial improvement over previous realizations using nanodiamonds, highlighting the advantage of combining hybrid nanoantennas with precise positioning. Our results mark a substantial advancement towards efficient single-shot readout of NV centers by significantly improving readout fidelity and efficiency in a simple on-chip configuration.</description>

      <title>The nonlinear limit of Babinet's Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Babinet's principle is a powerful tool for predicting the scattering behavior of planar structures where the solution for the complementary structure is already known. This makes it ubiquitous in the design of aperture antennas or metamaterials. Even for plasmonic nanostructures, a qualitative match of the behavior for complementary structures has been reported. Here, we discuss whether Babinet's principle can be extended to nonlinear scattering. We compare the third harmonic emission of plasmonic nanorods and complementary nanoslits by far field imaging and simulation. We find significantly different far field images, in agreement between experiment and simulation. We explain these differences by the higher spatial resolution at the third harmonic wavelength and by additional eddy currents in slits that are not present in rods. Within these limits, Babinet's principle can guide the design of inverted nonlinear plasmonic resonators, which promise to be more stable at high excitation power due to better thermal conductivity.</description>

      <title>Bidirectional quantitative scattering microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative phase microscopy (QPM) and interferometric scattering (iSCAT) microscopy are powerful label-free imaging techniques and are widely used for biomedical applications. Each method, however, possesses distinct limitations: QPM, which measures forward scattering (FS), excels at imaging microscale structures but struggles with rapidly moving nanoscale objects, while iSCAT, based on backward scattering (BS), is highly sensitive to nanoscale dynamics but lacks the ability to image microscale structures comprehensively. Here, we introduce bidirectional quantitative scattering microscopy (BiQSM), an innovative approach that integrates FS and BS detection using off-axis digital holography with bidirectional illumination and spatial-frequency multiplexing. BiQSM achieves spatiotemporal consistency and a dynamic range 14 times wider than QPM, enabling simultaneous imaging of nanoscale and microscale cellular components. We demonstrate BiQSM's ability to reveal spatiotemporal behaviors of intracellular structures, with FS-BS correlation analysis providing insights into proteins, lipids, and membranes. Time-lapse imaging of dying cells further highlights BiQSM's potential as a label-free tool for monitoring cellular vital states through structural and motion-related changes. By bridging the strengths of QPM and iSCAT, BiQSM advances quantitative cellular imaging and opens new avenues for studying dynamic biological processes.</description>

      <title>Parametric metasurfaces for amplified up-conversion of electromagnetic waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal metasurfaces, characterized by dynamic variations in both space and time, enable functionalities unattainable with passive metasurfaces. In this study, we propose a novel concept of parametric metasurfaces capable of performing frequency up-conversion and amplification of free-space electromagnetic waves. This functionality is realized through the modulation of variable capacitances embedded in specially designed dual split-ring resonators. We explore various combinations of the pump and incident wave frequencies and investigate different operational regimes of the proposed parametric system. Our theoretical analysis reveals high up-conversion efficiency, with amplification levels exceeding 20 dB through a cascaded process, surpassing the limits set by the Manley-Rowe relations. Moreover, precise control over the phase of the up-converted waves is achieved by tuning the pump phase, paving the way for advanced manipulation of electromagnetic waves. This approach is applicable in the microwave and subterahertz ranges, with potential scalability to higher frequencies through ultrafast modulation techniques.</description>

      <title>Self-aligned pillar arrays embedding site-controlled single quantum dots for enhanced non-classical light emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a foundational approach for fabricating arrays of self-aligned micro- and nanopillar structures incorporating individual site-controlled quantum dots (QDs) for enhanced light extraction. This method leverages the non-planar surface morphology of pyramidal QD samples to define dielectric masks self - aligned to the QD positions. The mask size, and consequently the lateral dimensions of the pillars, is precisely controlled through a chemical mechanical polishing step, obviating the need for any additional lithography step for creating the pillar. This fabrication technique offers several key advantages, including precise control over the pillar sites, and fully deterministic embedding of QD structures. The functionality of the structures was validated by integrating single In0.25Ga0.75As QDs - upon two-photon excitation of the biexciton state, the emission of single and polarization-entangled photon pairs was observed. Additionally, an extra fabrication step to deposit dome-like structures atop the pillars was demonstrated, effectively enhancing light extraction efficiency up to 12%.</description>

      <title>Terahertz radiation generation by laser-resonant excitation of terahertz surface magnetoplasmons on a graphene-n-InSb semiconductor interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method for the laser-excitation of terahertz surface magnetoplasmons via the linear mode conversion of terahertz radiation on a graphene sheet deposited on an n-type semiconductor in presence of an external magnetic field parallel to the semiconductor surface. An obliquely incident p-polarized laser beam interacting with the graphene n-InSb semiconductor surface, imparts linear oscillatory velocity to the free electrons. This oscillatory velocity couples with the modulated electron density to generate a linear current density, which resonantly excites terahertz surface magnetoplasmons. It is shown that the amplitude of terahertz surface magnetoplasmons wave can be tuned by adjusting the external magnetic field ($\text{B}_{0}$), the graphene's Fermi energy ($\text{E}_\text{F}$), the semiconductor's temperature (T), and the incident angle ($\theta$) of laser. This mechanism has the potential to enable the development of an actively tunable plasmonic device.</description>

      <title>Energy-time and time-bin entanglement: past, present and future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement is a key resource in many quantum information tasks. From a fundamental perspective entanglement is at the forefront of major philosophical discussions advancing our understanding of nature. An experimental scheme was proposed in 1989 by Franson that exploited the unpredictability in the generation time of a photon pair in order to produce a then new form of quantum entanglement, known as energy-time entanglement. A later modification gave rise to the very popular time-bin entanglement, an important cornerstone in many real-world quantum communication applications. Both forms of entanglement have radically pushed forward our understanding of quantum mechanics throughout the 1990s and 2000s. A decade later modifications to the original proposals were proposed and demonstrated, which opens the path for the highly sought-after device-independence capability for entanglement certification, with a goal of ultra-secure quantum communication. In this review we cover the beginnings of energy-time and time-bin entanglement, many key experiments that expanded our understanding of what was achievable in quantum information experiments all the way down to modern demonstrations based on new technological advances. We will then point out to the future discussing the important place that energy-time and time-bin entanglement will have in upcoming quantum networks and novel protocols based on nonlocality.</description>

      <title>Skyrmionic SU(6) structured light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Skyrmions are topological quasi-particles characterised by local spin textures, which are considered to be robust against structural deformation. N\'eel and Bloch states are famous examples of skyrmions, which exhibit radical and chiral spin profiles, respectively. Here, we show a skyrmion can be continuously transformed to an antiskyrmion or various other forms of skymions through underlying symmetry of special unitary group of degree six, SU(6), for photons with spin and orbital angular momentum. We employ a Lie group theory for coherent photons to describe the SU(6) transformation and establish a relationship between the generator of rotation and its expectation values on a hypersphere of $\mathbb{S}^{35}$. We propose a simple experimental setup to control the SU(6) states in combinations with wave-plates and vortex lenses to realise the generalised Euler's formula physically in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. We show skyrmionic states are described on higher-order Poincar'e spheres together with a recently proposed skyrmionic torus.</description>

      <title>Symmetry violation-driven hysteresis loops as measurands for noise-resilient sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sublinear resonant deviations from an exceptional point degeneracy (EPD) has been recently promoted as a sensing scheme. However, there is still an ongoing debate whether the sensitivity advantage is negated by an increase in fundamental noise - especially when active elements induce self-oscillations. In this case, nonlinearities are crucial in stabilizing amplifying modes and mitigating noise effects. A drawback is the formation of hysteresis loops that signal a transition to unstable modes. This can only be alleviated by precise cavity symmetry management. Here, utilizing two coupled nonlinear RLC tanks with balanced amplification and attenuation, we demonstrate that an explicit symmetry violation, induced by sweeping the resonant detuning of the RLC tanks, reveals a hysteresis loop near the EPD whose width scales sublinearly with the inter-tank coupling. Our proposal re-envisions this disadvantageous feature as a sensing protocol with diverging sensitivity, enhanced signal-to-noise ratio, and self-calibration without requiring delicate symmetry control. As such, it opens new avenues in metrology as well as for optical or RF switching and triggering.</description>

      <title>High Harmonic Generation with Orbital Angular Momentum Beams: Beyond-dipole Corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the high harmonic generation with vortex beams beyond the dipole approximation. To do so we employ the full minimal coupling approach to account for multipolar coupling without truncation and describe the full spatio-temporal properties of the electromagnetic field. This allows us to investigate the beyond-dipole deviations in electron trajectories and the emitted power, where the influence of the orbital angular momentum contains both magnetic and quadrupolar effects. In contrast to the system driven by plane-wave light, we show that the non-linear dipole dynamics induced by the vortex beams are not confined to the polarization or propagation directions, but also have a component in the orthogonal direction. We identify the effects of the resulting symmetry breaking via increased beyond dipole corrections which are particularly apparent in even harmonics.</description>

      <title>Laser Mpemba effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work explores the emergence of Mpemba-like effects within the quantum theory of lasers. By examining the temporal dynamics of photon number statistics in a single-mode laser above threshold, we reveal the curious and counterintuitive possibility that a laser system, starting with photon statistics far from equilibrium, may reach its stationary nearly-Poissonian distribution faster than a system initially closer to equilibrium. Drawing parallels to both classical and quantum Mpemba effects, we suggest that this behavior results from the unique relaxation dynamics of photon states, which is described by a non-integrable birth-death process. Our findings offer new insights into the foundational aspects of quantum laser light and contribute to the expanding body of research on non-equilibrium phenomena in quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Multi-photon enhanced resolution for Superconducting Nanowire Single-Photon Detector-based Time-of-Flight lidar systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs) emerged in the last decade as a disruptive technology that features performance characteristics, such as high sensitivity, dynamic range and temporal accuracy, which are ideally suited for light detection and ranging (lidar) applications. Here, we report a time-of-flight (TOF) lidar system based on waveguide-integrated SNSPDs that excels in temporal accuracy, which translates into high range resolution. For single-shot measurements, we find resolution in the millimeter regime, resulting from the jitter of the time-of-flight signal of 21$\,$ps for low photon numbers. We further decrease this signal jitter to 11$\,$ps by driving the SNSPD into a multiphoton detection regime, utilizing laser pulses of higher intensity, thus improving range resolution. For multi-shot measurements we find sub-millimeter range-accuracy of 0.75$\,$mm and reveal additional surface information of scanned objects by visualizing the number of reflected photons and their temporal spread with the acquired range data in a combined representation. Our realization of a lidar receiver exploits favorable timing accuracy of waveguide-integrated SNSPDs and extends their operation to the multiphoton regime, which benefits a wide range of remote sensing applications.</description>

Abstract: An efficient mechanism of laser pulse focusing with the help of shaped underdense plasma target immersed in inhomogeneous magnetic field has been demonstrated. These studies have been carried out with the help of 2-D Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulation employing the OSIRIS 4.0 platform. It is shown that the divergent magnetic field profile compresses the EM wave pulse in the transverse direction. A comparative investigation with plane and lens shaped plasma geometries has also been conducted to find an optimal configuration for focusing the laser at the desirable location. Furthermore, it is also demonstrated that when the electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) layer is placed at a suitable location where the laser is focused, a highly energetic electron beam gets generated.</description>

      <title>Fast Two-photon Microscopy by Neuroimaging with Oblong Random Acquisition (NORA)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in neural imaging have enabled neuroscience to study how the joint activity of large neural populations conspire to produce perception, behavior and cognition. Despite many advances in optical methods, there exists a fundamental tradeoff between imaging speed, field of view, and resolution that limits the scope of neural imaging, especially for the raster-scanning multi-photon imaging needed for imaging deeper into the brain. One approach to overcoming this trade-off is in computational imaging: the co-development of optics and algorithms where the optics are designed to encode the target images into fewer measurements that are faster to acquire, and the algorithms compensate by inverting the optical image coding process to recover a larger or higher resolution image. We present here one such approach for raster-scanning two-photon imaging: Neuroimaging with Oblong Random Acquisition (NORA). NORA quickly acquires each frame in a microscopic video by subsampling only a fraction of the fast scanning lines, ignoring large portions of each frame. NORA mitigates the information loss by extending the point-spread function in the slow-scan direction to integrate the fluorescence of neighboring lines into a single set of measurements. By imaging different, randomly selected, lines at each frame, NORA diversifies the information collected across frames and enables video-level reconstruction. Rather than reconstruct the video frame-by-frame using image-level recovery, NORA recovers full video sequences through a nuclear-norm minimization (i.e., matrix completion) on the pixels-by-time matrix. We simulated NORA imaging using the Neural Anatomy and Optical Microscopy (NAOMi) biophysical simulation suite. Using these simulations we demonstrate that NORA imaging can accurately recover 400 um X 400 um fields of view at subsampling rates up to 20X, despite realistic noise and motion conditions.</description>

Abstract: The study of optical systems with asymmetric responses has grown significantly due to their broad application potential in various fields. In particular, Janus metasurfaces are notable for their ability to control light asymmetrically at the pixel level within thin films. However, previous demonstrations were restricted to the partial control of asymmetric transmission for a limited set of input polarizations, focusing primarily on scalar functionalities. Here, we introduce optical metasurfaces consisting of bi-layer silicon nanostructures that can achieve a fully generalized form of asymmetric transmission for any possible input polarization. Their designs owe much to our theoretical model of asymmetric optical transmission in reciprocal systems that explicates the relationship between front- and back-side Jones matrices for general cases, revealing a fundamental correlation between the polarization-direction channels of opposing sides of incidence. To practically circumvent this constraint, we propose a method to partition transmission space, enabling the realization of four distinct vector functionalities within the target volume. As a proof of concept, we experimentally demonstrate polarization-direction-multiplexed Janus vector holograms generating four vector holograms. When integrated with computational vector polarizer arrays, this approach facilitates optical encryption with a high level of obscurity. We anticipate that our mathematical framework and novel material systems for generalized asymmetric transmission may pave the way for applications such as optical computations, sensing, and imaging.</description>

      <title>A scalar product for the radiation of resonant modes</title>

Abstract: We introduce the conformally-invariant scalar product, originally devised for radiation fields, to the study of the modes of optical resonators. This scalar product allows one to normalize and compare resonant modes using their corresponding radiation fields. Such fields are polychromatic fields free of divergences, which are determined from the complex frequencies and the modal fields on the surface of the resonator. The scalar product is expressed as surface integrals involving the modal fields, multiplied by closed-form factors incorporating the complex frequencies. In a practical application, we study the modes of disk-shaped whispering gallery resonators, and show that the proposed scalar product accurately predicts the geometry-dependent crossings and anti-crossings between modes.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Opto-Electrical Excitation of Spin-Transfer Torque Nano-Oscillators for Advanced Computing</title>

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing, inspired by the brain's parallel and energy-efficient processing, offers a transformative approach to artificial intelligence. In this study, we fabricated optimized spin-transfer torque nano-oscillators (STNOs) and investigated their dynamic behaviors using a hybrid excitation scheme combining AC laser illumination and DC bias currents. Laser-induced thermal gradients generate pulsed thermoelectric voltages ($V_{\text{AC}}$) via the Tunnel Magneto-Seebeck (TMS) effect, while the addition of bias currents enhances this response, producing both $V_{\text{AC}}$ and a DC component ($V_{\text{DC}}$). Magnetic field sweeps reveal distinct switching between parallel (P) and antiparallel (AP) magnetization states in both voltage components, supporting multistate memory applications. Millivolt-range thermovoltage signals in open-circuit conditions demonstrate CMOS compatibility, enabling simplified, scalable neuromorphic systems. Under biased conditions, enhanced thermovoltage outputs exhibit intriguing phenomena, including spikes correlated with Barkhausen jumps and double-switching behavior, offering insights into magnetization dynamics and vortex transitions. These features resemble neural spiking behavior, suggesting applications in spiking neural networks, reservoir computing, multistate logic, analog computing, and high-resolution sensing. By bridging spintronic phenomena with practical applications, this work provides a versatile platform for next-generation AI technologies and adaptive computing architectures.</description>

      <title>In situ characterization of laser-induced strong field ionization phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately characterizing the intensity and duration of strong-field femtosecond pulses within the interaction volume is crucial for attosecond science. However, this remains a major bottleneck, limiting accuracy of the strong-field, and in particular, high harmonic generation experiments. We present a novel scheme for the in situ measurement and control of spatially resolved strong-field femtosecond pulse intensity and duration within the interaction focal region. Our approach combines conjugate focal imaging with in situ ion measurements using gas densities pertinent to attosecond science experiments. Independent measurements in helium and argon, accompanied by a fitting to a strong field ionization dynamic model, yield accurate and consistent results across a wide range of gas densities and underscores the significance of double ionization, as well as barrier suppression ionization. Direct spatially resolved characterization of the driving laser is a critical step towards resolving the averaging problem in the interaction volume, paving the way for more accurate and reliable attosecond experiments.</description>

      <title>High-purity and stable single-photon emission in bilayer WSe$_2$ via phonon-assisted excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The excitation scheme is essential for single-photon sources, as it governs exciton preparation, decay dynamics, and the spectral diffusion of emitted photons. While phonon-assisted excitation has shown promise in other quantum emitter platforms, its proper implementation and systematic comparison with alternative excitation schemes have not yet been demonstrated in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) quantum emitters. Here, we investigate the impact of various optical excitation strategies on the single-photon emission properties of bilayer WSe$_2$ quantum emitters. Based on our theoretical predictions for the exciton preparation fidelity, we compare excitation via the longitudinal acoustic and breathing phonon modes to conventional above-band and near-resonance excitations. Under acoustic phonon-assisted excitation, we achieve narrow single-photon emission with a reduced spectral diffusion of 0.0129 nm, a 1.8-fold improvement over above-band excitation. Additionally, excitation through breathing-phonon mode yields a high purity of $ 0.947\pm 0.079\,$ and reduces the decay time by over an order of magnitude, reaching $(1.33 \pm 0.04)\,$ns. Our comprehensive study demonstrates the crucial role of phonon-assisted excitation in optimizing the performance of WSe$_2$-based quantum emitters, providing valuable insights for the development of single-photon sources for quantum photonics applications.</description>

      <title>Geometric contribution to adiabatic amplification in non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Concepts from non-Hermitian quantum mechanics have proven useful in understanding and manipulating a variety of classical systems, such as those encountered in optics, classical mechanics, and metamaterial design. Recently, the non-Hermitian analog of the Berry phase for adiabatic processes was experimentally measured. In non-Hermitian systems, the Berry phase can have an imaginary part, which contributes to the amplification or decay of the total wave intensity. When the imaginary part of the Berry curvature is zero, this geometric amplification factor is determined solely by the initial and final points of the adiabatic path in parameter space, and it does not depend on how these points are connected by the path. We list classes of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians where this path independence is guaranteed by suitable symmetries, and we find that, for some of these classes, the amplification factor can be written only in terms of the Petermann factors of the initial and final points. Our result can, in turn, be used to experimentally obtain the Petermann factor by observing how the norm of the wave function changes under adiabatic processes. We validate our theory using a couple of concrete examples of physical relevance.</description>

      <title>Solving Dicke superradiance analytically: A compendium of methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10463v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present several analytical approaches to the Dicke superradiance problem, which involves determining the time evolution of the density operator for an initially inverted ensemble of $N$ identical two-level systems undergoing collective spontaneous emission. This serves as one of the simplest cases of open quantum system dynamics that allows for a fully analytical solution. We explore multiple methods to tackle this problem, yielding a solution valid for any time and any number of spins. These approaches range from solving coupled rate equations and identifying exceptional points in non-Hermitian evolution to employing combinatorial and probabilistic techniques, as well as utilizing a quantum jump unraveling of the master equation. The analytical solution is expressed as a residue sum obtained from a contour integral in the complex plane, suggesting the possibility of fully analytical solutions for a broader class of open quantum system dynamics problems.</description>
