      <title>On the local well-posedness of randomly forced reaction-diffusion equations with $L^2$ initial data and a superlinear reaction term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a parabolic stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) on $[0\,,1]$ that is forced with multiplicative space-time white noise with a bounded and Lipschitz diffusion coefficient and a drift coefficient that is locally Lipschitz and satisfies an $L\log L$ growth condition. We prove that the SPDE is well posed when the initial data is in $L^2[0\,,1]$. This solves a strong form of an open problem.</description>

      <title>It\^o-Wentzell formulas for semimartingale conditional laws with applications to mean-field control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present paper is an extension of Fadle-Touzi (2024). Following the same methodology, merely based on Taylor expansions, we establish the It\^o and It\^o-Wentzell formulae for flows of conditional distributions of general semimartingales, thus allowing for discontinuous semimartingales with possibly discontinuous flows of conditional marginals. We apply these results to derive the dynamic programming equations corresponding to mean field control problems with Poisson type common noise and mean field stopping problems with common noise.</description>

      <title>Limit Theorems for Descents and Inversions of Shelf-Shuffles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove central limit theorems for the number of descents and the number of inversions after a shelf-shuffle. In particular, we bound the convergence rate for the number of inversions independently of the number of shelves. Along the way, we determine the mean and variance for the number of inversions after a shelf shuffle, which was also an open problem. We also suggest ways to extend our results to biased shelf-shuffles.</description>

      <title>On the exponential integrability of the derivative of intersection and self-intersection local time for fractional Brownian motion and a limit theorem related to the self-intersection local time for fractional Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give the correct condition for existence of the $k$-th derivative of the intersection local time for fractional Brownian motion, which was originally discussed in [Guo, J., Hu, Y., and Xiao, Y., Higher-order derivative of intersection local time for two independent fractional Brownian motions, Journal of Theoretical Probability 32, (2019), pp. 1190-1201]. We also show that the $k$-th derivative of the intersection and self-intersection local times of fractional Brownian motion are exponentially integrable for certain parameter values. In addition, we show convergence in distribution when the existence condition is violated for the $k$-th derivative of self-intersection local time of fractional Brownian motion under scaling.</description>

      <title>On irreducible central limit theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider sequences of homogeneous sums based on independent random variables and satisfying a central limit theorem (CLT). We address the following question: "In which cases is it not possible to reduce such an asymptotic result to the classical Lindeberg-Feller CLT through a restriction of the summation domain?". We provide several sufficient conditions for such irreducibility, expressed both in terms of (hyper)graphs Laplace eigenvalues, and of a certain notion of combinatorial dimension. Our analysis combines Cheeger-type inequalities with fourth moment theorems, showing that the irreducibility of a given CLT for homogeneous sums can be naturally encoded by the connectivity properties of the associated sequence of weighted hypergraphs. Several ad-hoc constructions are provided in the special case of quadratic forms.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish associativity, spatial ergodicity and a central limit theorem for certain nonnegative solutions to the stochastic heat equation $\partial_t u=\frac12\partial_x^2 u+ u^\gamma \xi$ with $\gamma\in (0, 1)$. When $\gamma=\frac12$, we derive a limit for the moment generating function of the spatial integral and provide a lower bound on the spatial growth of the solution.</description>

      <title>Synchronization of stochastic dissipative differential equation driven by fractional Brownian motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of dissipative stochastic differential equations driven by nonlinear multiplicative fractional Brownian noise with Hurst index $H \in \left(\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{2})\cup(\frac{1}{2}, 1\right) $. We establish the well-posedness of the associated coupled stochastic differential equations and prove synchronization in the sense of trajectories. Our approach relies on the Doss-Sussmann transformation, which enables us to extend existing results for additive and linear noise to the case of nonlinear multiplicative fractional Brownian noise. The findings provide new insights into the synchronization of dissipative systems under fractional noise perturbations.</description>

      <title>Taylor-like approximations of center manifolds for rough differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of rough differential equations (RDEs) has recently received a lot of interest. For example, the existence of local random center manifolds for RDEs has been established. In this work, we present an approximation for local random center manifolds for RDEs driven by geometric rough paths. To this aim, we combine tools from rough path and deterministic center manifold theory to derive Taylor-like approximations of local random center manifolds. The coefficients of this approximation are stationary solutions of RDEs driven by the same geometric rough path as the original equation. We illustrate our approach for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with linear and nonlinear multiplicative noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the Malliavin differentiability of McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (MV-SDEs) with common noise under the global Lipschitz assumption in the space variable and the measure variable. Our result gives also meaning to the Malliavin derivative of the conditional law with respect to the common noise. As an application, we derive an integration by parts formula on the Wiener space for the class of common noise MV-SDEs under consideration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random matrix theory has played a major role in several areas of pure and applied mathematics, as well as statistics, physics, and computer science. This lecture aims to describe the intrinsic freeness phenomenon and how it provides new easy-to-use sharp non-asymptotic bounds on the spectrum of general random matrices. We will also present a couple of illustrative applications in high dimensional statistical inference. This article accompanies a lecture that will be given by the author at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Philadelphia in the Summer of 2026.</description>

      <title>Spin glasses and the Parisi formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin glasses are models of statistical mechanics in which a large number of simple elements interact with one another in a disordered fashion. One of the fundamental results of the theory is the Parisi formula, which identifies the limit of the free energy of a large class of such models. Yet many interesting models remain out of reach of the classical theory, and direct generalizations of the Parisi formula yield invalid predictions. I will report here on some partial progress towards the resolution of this problem, which also brings a new perspective on classical results.</description>

      <title>Parameter Estimation in Recurrent Tumor Evolution with Finite Carrying Capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the population dynamics of tumor cells under therapeutic pressure. Although drug treatment initially induces a reduction in tumor burden, treatment failure frequently occurs over time due to the emergence of drug resistance, ultimately leading to cancer recurrence. To model this process, we employ a two-type branching process with state-dependent growth rates. The model assumes an initial tumor population composed predominantly of drug-sensitive cells, with a small subpopulation of resistant cells. Sensitive cells may acquire resistance through mutation, which is coupled to a change in cellular fitness. Furthermore, the growth rates of resistant cells are modulated by the overall tumor burden. Using stochastic differential equation techniques, we establish a functional law of large numbers for the scaled populations of sensitive cells, resistant cells, and the initial resistant clone. We then define the stochastic recurrence time as the first time the total tumor population regrows to its initial size following treatment. For this recurrence time, as well as for measures of clonal diversity and the size of the largest resistant clone at recurrence, we derive corresponding law of large number limits. These asymptotic results provide a theoretical foundation for constructing statistically consistent estimators for key biological parameters, including the cellular growth rates, the mutation rate, and the initial fraction of resistant cells.</description>

      <title>A viscosity solution approach to the large deviation principle for stochastic convective Brinkman-Forchheimer equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article develops the viscosity solution approach to the large deviation principle for the following two- and three-dimensional stochastic convective Brinkman-Forchheimer equations on the torus $\mathbb{T}^d,\ d\in\{2,3\}$ with small noise intensity:
  \begin{align*}
  \mathrm{d}\boldsymbol{u}_n+[-\mu\Delta\boldsymbol{u}_n+ (\boldsymbol{u}_n\cdot\nabla)\boldsymbol{u}_n +\alpha\boldsymbol{u}_n+\beta|\boldsymbol{u}_n|^{r-1}\boldsymbol{u}_n+\nabla p_n]\mathrm{d} t=\boldsymbol{f}\mathrm{d} t+\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\mathrm{Q}^{\frac12}\mathrm{d}\mathrm{W}, \ \nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u}_n=0,
  \end{align*} where $\mu,\alpha,\beta&gt;0$, $r\in[1,\infty)$, $\mathrm{Q}$ is a trace class operator and $\mathrm{W}$ is Hilbert-valued calendrical Wiener process. We build our analysis on the framework of Varadhan and Bryc, together with the techniques of [J. Feng et.al., Large Deviations for Stochastic Processes, American Mathematical Society (2006) vol. \textbf{131}]. By employing the techniques from the comparison principle, we identify the Laplace limit as the convergence of the viscosity solution of the associated second-order singularly perturbed Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. A key advantage of this method is that it establishes a Laplace principle without relying on additional sufficient conditions such as Bryc's theorem, which the literature commonly requires. For $r&gt;3$ and $r=3$ with $2\beta\mu\geq1$, we also derive the exponential moment bounds without imposing the classical orthogonality condition $((\boldsymbol{u}_n\cdot\nabla)\boldsymbol{u}_n,\mathrm{A}\boldsymbol{u}_n)=0$, where $\mathrm{A}=-\Delta$, in both two-and three-dimensions. We first establish the large deviation principle in the Skorohod space. Then, by using the $\mathrm{C}-$exponential tightness, we finally establish the large deviation principle in the continuous space.</description>

      <title>Revealing the temporal dynamics of antibiotic anomalies in the infant gut microbiome with neural jump ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting anomalies in irregularly sampled multi-variate time-series is challenging, especially in data-scarce settings. Here we introduce an anomaly detection framework for irregularly sampled time-series that leverages neural jump ordinary differential equations (NJODEs). The method infers conditional mean and variance trajectories in a fully path dependent way and computes anomaly scores. On synthetic data containing jump, drift, diffusion, and noise anomalies, the framework accurately identifies diverse deviations. Applied to infant gut microbiome trajectories, it delineates the magnitude and persistence of antibiotic-induced disruptions: revealing prolonged anomalies after second antibiotic courses, extended duration treatments, and exposures during the second year of life. We further demonstrate the predictive capabilities of the inferred anomaly scores in accurately predicting antibiotic events and outperforming diversity-based baselines. Our approach accommodates unevenly spaced longitudinal observations, adjusts for static and dynamic covariates, and provides a foundation for inferring microbial anomalies induced by perturbations, offering a translational opportunity to optimize intervention regimens by minimizing microbial disruptions.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Identification of Latent Concepts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are born with the ability to learn concepts by comparing diverse observations. This helps us to understand the new world in a compositional manner and facilitates extrapolation, as objects naturally consist of multiple concepts. In this work, we argue that the cognitive mechanism of comparison, fundamental to human learning, is also vital for machines to recover true concepts underlying the data. This offers correctness guarantees for the field of concept learning, which, despite its impressive empirical successes, still lacks general theoretical support. Specifically, we aim to develop a theoretical framework for the identifiability of concepts with multiple classes of observations. We show that with sufficient diversity across classes, hidden concepts can be identified without assuming specific concept types, functional relations, or parametric generative models. Interestingly, even when conditions are not globally satisfied, we can still provide alternative guarantees for as many concepts as possible based on local comparisons, thereby extending the applicability of our theory to more flexible scenarios. Moreover, the hidden structure between classes and concepts can also be identified nonparametrically. We validate our theoretical results in both synthetic and real-world settings.</description>

      <title>Information and the living tree of life: A theory of measurement grounded in biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend a formal framework that previously derived time from the multifractal structure of biological lineages (Hudnall \&amp; D'Souza, 2025). That work showed that time itself is multifractal -- not a universal background dimension, but an observer-dependent geometry. Here we develop the corresponding theory of measurement: showing that a multifractal conception of time not only permits measurement, but grounds it more rigorously in the structure of biology. The tree of life is modeled as the outcome of stochastic, convex branching, and we show how information-theoretic and fractal measures render its multifractal geometry into measurable, observer-relative time intervals. At the core is a dilation equation that expresses relative time elapse between entities as dimensionless ratios. Operational standards such as the SI second remain valid, but our framework makes explicit their lineage-dependence. This framework unifies measurement theory with biological form, preserves full compatibility with established science, and provides a biologically grounded theory of observation. It enables comparative analyses of duration and kinematics across lineages, with predictions that are directly open to experimental validation.</description>

Abstract: The update in the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF), called the Ensemble Kalman Update (EnKU), is widely used for Bayesian inference in inverse problems and data assimilation. At each filtering step, it approximates the solution to a likelihood-free Bayesian inversion from an ensemble of particles $(X_i,Y_i)\sim\pi$ sampled from a joint measure $\pi$ and an observation $y_\ast\in\mathbb{R}^m$. The posterior ${\pi}_{X|Y=y_\ast}$ is approximated by transporting $(X_i,Y_i)$ through an affine map $L^{\mathrm{EnKU}}_{y_\ast}(x,y)$ determined by the Kalman gain. While the EnKU is exact for Gaussian joints $\pi$ in the mean-field limit, exactness alone does not fix the update: infinitely many affine maps $L_{y_\ast}$ push a Gaussian $\pi$ to $\pi_{X|Y=y_\ast}$. This raises a question: which affine map should estimate the posterior? We provide a characterization of the EnKU among all such maps. First, we describe the set $\mathrm{E}^{\mathrm{EnKU}}$ of laws where the EnKU yields exact conditioning, showing it is larger than the Gaussian family. Next, we prove that, except for a small class of highly symmetric distributions in $\mathrm{E}^{\mathrm{EnKU}}$ (including Gaussians), the EnKU is the unique exact affine conditioning map. Finally, we ask for the largest possible set $\mathrm{F}$ where any measure-dependent affine transport could be exact; after characterizing $\mathrm{F}$, we show the EnKU's exactness set is almost maximal: $\mathrm{F}=\mathrm{E}^{\mathrm{EnKU}}\cup\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{nl-dec}}$, where $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{nl-dec}}$ is a small symmetry class. Thus, among affine transports, the EnKU is near-optimal for exact conditioning beyond Gaussians and is the unique affine update achieving exactness for any measure in $\mathrm{F}$ except a subclass of strongly symmetric laws.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove rapid mixing for almost all random walks generated by $m$ translations on an arbitrary nilmanifold under mild assumptions on the size of $m$. For several classical classes of nilmanifolds, we show $m=2$ suffices. This provides a partial answer to the question raised in \cite{D02} about the prevalence of rapid mixing for random walks on homogeneous spaces.</description>

      <title>The p-spectrum of Random Wavelet Series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of multifractal analysis is to characterize the variations in local regularity of functions or signals by computing the Hausdorff dimension of the sets of points that share the same regularity. While classical approaches rely on H\"older exponents and are limited to locally bounded functions, the notion of $p$-exponents extends multifractal analysis to functions locally in $L^p$, allowing a rigorous characterization of singularities in more general settings. In this work, we propose a wavelet-based methodology to estimate the $p$-spectrum from the distribution of wavelet coefficients across scales. First, we establish an upper bound for the $p$-spectrum in terms of this distribution, generalizing the classical H\"older case. The sharpness of this bound is demonstrated for \textit{Random Wavelet Series}, showing that it can be attained for a broad class of admissible distributions of wavelet coefficients. Finally, within the class of functions sharing a prescribed wavelet statistic, we prove that this upper bound is realized by a prevalent set of functions, highlighting both its theoretical optimality and its representativity of the typical multifractal behaviour in constrained function spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Keating-Snaith central limit theorem proves that $\Lambda_N(A)=\log\det(I-A)$, for randomly drawn $A\in \operatorname{U}(N)$, suitably normalised, tends to a complex Gaussian random variable in the large $N$ limit. The deviations of the real and imaginary parts of $\Lambda_N(A)$, on the scale of a positive $k$th multiple of the variance, are known to be Gaussian but with a multiplicative perturbation in the form of the $2k$th moment coefficient. Here we study the interpolating regime by allowing $k=k(N)$ for both $\operatorname{Re}(\Lambda_N(A))$ and $\operatorname{Im}(\Lambda_N(A))$. Additionally our methods apply to the logarithm of the derivative of the characteristic polynomial evaluated at an eigenvalue of $A$.</description>

      <title>Partition functions of two-dimensional Coulomb gases with circular root- and jump-type singularities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the random polynomial $p_n(\rho):=\prod_{j=1}^n (|z_j|-\rho)$, where the points $\{z_j\}_{j=1}^n$ are the eigenvalue moduli of random normal matrices with a radially symmetric potential. We establish precise large $n$ asymptotic expansions for the moment generating function \[ \mathbb{E}\!\left[e^{\tfrac{u}{\pi}\mathrm{Im}\log p_n(\rho)}\, e^{a\,\mathrm{Re}\log p_n(\rho)}\right], \qquad u\in\mathbb{R}, \; a&gt;-1, \] where $\rho&gt;0$ lies in the bulk of the spectral droplet. The asymptotic expansion is expressed in terms of parabolic cylinder functions, which confirms a conjecture of Byun and Charlier. This also provides the first free energy expansion of two-dimensional Coulomb gases with general circular root- and jump-type singularities. While the $a=0$ case has already been widely studied in the literature due to its relation to counting statistics, we also obtain new results for this special case.</description>

Abstract: Large deviation principles for hyperbolic systems are well studied and provide exponential rates for the deviations of Birkhoff averages from their limit. This short article presents a local large deviation principle for Smale spaces, in particular studying the rate functions of deviations with respect to conditional Gibbs measures supported on local unstable manifolds. The proof builds on a result due to Kifer and pressure growth estimates due to Parmenter and Pollicott.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Approximation in a Markovian Framework Revisited: Lipschitz Continuity of the Poisson Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.09464</link>
      <description>arXiv:1906.09464v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we revisit a fundamental technical issue within the theory of stochastic approximation (SA) in a Markovian framework, first proposed in the book by Djereveckii and Fradkov (1981), and further developed in much detail in the book by Benveniste, M{\'e}tivier, and Priouret (1990). This theory is instrumental in many application areas such as the statistical analysis of Hidden Markov Models arising in telecommunication, quantized linear stochastic systems, and more recently in active learning and reinforcement learning. The problem at hand is the verification of the existence, uniqueness and Lipschitz-continuity of the solution of a parameter-dependent Poisson equation, in an appropriate weighted sup-norm, associated with a collection of Markov chains on general state spaces. Verification of the above facts is vital in the analysis of SA processes presented in (Benveniste et al., 1990) via the ODE (ordinary differential equations) method, requiring substantial technical effort. The motivation and focus of the paper is to address this technical issue, by presenting a simple set of conditions, under which the above properties of the Poisson equation at hand can be conveniently established. The starting point of our work is an intricate result of Hairer and Mattingly (2011) proving that by tilting standard conditions of mainstream stability theory for Markov chains, the transition kernels prove to be contractions in the space of differences of probability measures in a suitable metric. To demonstrate the applicability of our results, the proposed conditions are verified for a class of queuing system with open-loop control.</description>

      <title>An Invariance Principle for a Random Walk Among Moving Traps via Thermodynamic Formalism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a random walk among a Poisson cloud of moving traps on ${\mathbb Z}^d$, where the walk is killed at a rate proportional to the number of traps occupying the same position. In dimension $d=1$, we have previously shown that under the annealed law of the random walk conditioned on survival up to time $t$, the walk is sub-diffusive. Here we show that in $d\geq 6$ and under diffusive scaling, this annealed law satisfies an invariance principle with a positive diffusion constant if the killing rate is small. Our proof is based on the theory of thermodynamic formalism, where we extend some classic results for Markov shifts with a finite alphabet and a potential of summable variation to the case of an uncountable non-compact alphabet.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of perturbing a large, i.i.d. random matrix by a finite rank error. It is known that when elements of the i.i.d. matrix have finite fourth moment, then the outlier eigenvalues of the perturbed matrix are close to the outlier eigenvalues of the error, as long as the perturbation is relatively small. We first prove that under a merely second moment condition, for a large class of perturbation matrix with bounded rank and bounded operator norm, the outlier eigenvalues of perturbed matrix still converge to that of the perturbation. We then prove that for a matrix with i.i.d. Bernoulli $(d/n)$ entries or Bernoulli $(d_n/n)$ entries with $d_n=n^{o(1)}$, the same result holds for perturbation matrices with a bounded number of nonzero elements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove existence of a stochastic flow of diffeomorphisms generated by SDEs with drift in $L^q_t C^{0, \alpha}_x$ for any $q \in [2, \infty)$ and $\alpha \in (0, 1)$. This result is achieved using a Zvonkin-type transformation for the SDE. As a key intermediate step, well-posedness and optimal regularity for a class of parabolic PDEs related to the transformation is established. Using the existence of a differentiable stochastic flow, we prove well-posedness of $BV_\text{loc}$-solutions of stochastic transport equations and weak solutions of stochastic continuity equations with so-called transport noise and velocity fields in $L^q_t C^{0, \alpha}_x$. For both equations, solutions may fail to be unique in the deterministic setting.</description>

Abstract: We continue our work [arXiv:2403.07628] on asymptotic expansions at the soft edge for the classical $n$-dimensional Gaussian and Laguerre random matrix ensembles. By revisiting the construction of the associated skew-orthogonal polynomials in terms of wave functions, we obtain concise expressions for the level densities that are well suited for proving asymptotic expansions in powers of a certain parameter $h \asymp n^{-2/3}$. In the unitary case, the expansion for the level density can be used to reconstruct the first correction term in an established asymptotic expansion of the associated generating function. In the orthogonal and symplectic cases, we can even reconstruct the conjectured first and second correction terms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the Paquette-Zeitouni law of fractional logarithm (LFL) for the extreme eigenvalues [arXiv:1505.05627] in full generality, and thereby verify a conjecture from [arXiv:1505.05627]. Our result holds for any Wigner minor process and both symmetry classes, in particular for the GOE minor process, while [arXiv:1505.05627] and the recent full resolution of LFL by Baslingker et.~al.~[arXiv:2410.11836] cover only the GUE case which is determinantal. Lacking the possibility for a direct comparison with the Gaussian case, we develop a robust and natural method for both key parts of the proof. On one hand, we rely on a powerful martingale technique to describe precisely the strong correlation between the largest eigenvalue of an $N\times N$ Wigner matrix and its $(N-k)\times (N-k)$ minor if $k\ll N^{2/3}$. On the other hand, we use dynamical methods to show that this correlation is weak if $k\gg N^{2/3}$.</description>

      <title>Phase Synchronization in Random Geometric Graphs on the 2D Sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kuramoto model is a classical nonlinear ODE system designed to study synchronization phenomena. Each equation represents the phase of an oscillator and the coupling between them is determined by a graph. There is an increasing interest in understanding the relation between the graph topology and the spontaneous synchronization of the oscillators. Abdalla, Bandeira and Invernizzi considered random geometric graphs on the $d$-dimensional sphere and proved that the system synchronizes with high probability as long as the mean number of neighbors and the dimension $d$ go to infinity. They posed the question about the behavior when $d$ is small. In this paper, we prove that synchronization holds for random geometric graphs on the two-dimensional sphere, with high probability as the number of nodes goes to infinity, as long as the initial conditions converge to a smooth function. We conjecture a similar behavior for more general simply-connected closed Riemannian manifolds but we expect global synchronization to fail if the manifold is not simply-connected, as was shown in [11] and suggested in [9].</description>

Abstract: We study the problem of sampling from strongly log-concave distributions over $\mathbb{R}^d$ using the Poisson midpoint discretization (a variant of the randomized midpoint method) for overdamped/underdamped Langevin dynamics. We prove its convergence in the 2-Wasserstein distance ($W_2$), achieving a cubic speedup in dependence on the target accuracy ($\epsilon$) over the Euler-Maruyama discretization, surpassing existing bounds for randomized midpoint methods. Notably, in the case of underdamped Langevin dynamics, we demonstrate the complexity of $W_2$ convergence is much smaller than the complexity lower bounds for convergence in $L^2$ strong error established in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On the 1+2 dimensional lattice, we consider a directed polymer in a random Gaussian environment that is independent in time and correlated in space. The spatial correlation is supposed to decay as $(\log |x|)^a /|x|^{2}$, $a&gt;-1$, where the square in the polynomial is known to be critical (Lacoin, Ann. Prob. (2011)). We introduce an intermediate regime of temperature $\beta_N \propto \hat \beta/(\log N)^{\frac{a+2}{2}}$, under which the log-partition function $\log W_N^{\beta_N}$ converges in distribution towards a Gaussian random variable if $\hat \beta\in (0,\hat \beta_c)$, whereas $W_N^{\beta_N}$ vanishes for $\hat \beta\geq \hat \beta_c$. The variance of the limiting Gaussian distribution, which is given by an inverse Bessel function, is determined by an induction scheme whose multi-scale dependence reflects the critical nature of the correlation. The Gaussianity of the limit follows from a decoupling argument of Cosco, Donadini (2024+).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the behavior of a function sampled from the invariant measure associated to the focusing discrete Non Linear Schr\"odinger equation, defined on a discrete torus of dimension $d \geq 3$, and nonlinearity parameter $p&gt;4$, in the infinite volume limit. The Gibbs measure has two parameters, the inverse temperature and the strength of the non linearity, and the scaling is such that the non linear and linear parts of the Hamiltonian contribute on the same scale. It was shown by Dey, Kirkpatrick and the first author that this measure undergoes a phase transition, concerning concentration of mass of a typical function {at the level of partition functions}. We prove that the three regions of the phase diagram yield three distinct local limits, a massive Gaussian free field, a massless Gaussian free field plus a random constant, and finally a (possibly trivial) mixture of massive Gaussian free fields, where some mass is ``lost'' to the region of concentration. Our proof relies on the analysis of the spherical model of a ferromagnet. The measure under consideration is an exponential tilt of the spherical model, and the additional tilt can be seen to induce an additional phase transition. Although our motivations come from the NLS equation and soliton resolution conjecture, our proofs are completely probabilistic, and can be read without any knowledge of PDE theory.</description>

Abstract: We investigate regularity properties of some non-local equations defined on Dirichlet spaces equipped with sub-gaussian estimates for the heat kernel associated to the generator. We prove that weak solutions for homogeneous equations involving pure powers of the generator are actually H\"older continuous and satisfy an Harnack inequality. Our methods are based on a version of the Caffarelli-Silvestre extension method which is valid in any Dirichlet space and our results complement the existing literature on solutions of PDEs on classes of Dirichlet spaces such as fractals.</description>

      <title>Graphon Particle Systems, Part I: Spatio-Temporal Approximation and Law of Large Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16760v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a class of graphon particle systems with time-varying random coefficients. In a graphon particle system, the interactions among particles are characterized by the coupled mean field terms through an underlying graphon and the randomness of the coefficients comes from exogenous stochastic processes. By constructing two-level approximated sequences converging in 2-Wasserstein distance, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the system. Besides, by constructing two-level approximated functions converging to the graphon mean field terms, we establish the law of large numbers, which reveals that if the number of particles tends to infinity and the discretization step tends to zero, then the discrete-time interacting particle system over a large-scale network converges to the graphon particle system. As a byproduct, we discover that the graphon particle system can describe the limiting dynamics of the distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm over the large-scale network and prove that if the gradients of the local cost functions are Lipschitz continuous, then the graphon particle system can be regarded as the spatio-temporal approximation of the discrete-time distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm as the number of network nodes tends to infinity and the algorithm step size tends to zero.</description>

      <title>Graphon Particle Systems, Part II: Dynamics of Distributed Stochastic Continuum Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02765v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the distributed optimization problem over a graphon with a continuum of nodes, which is regarded as the limit of the distributed networked optimization as the number of nodes goes to infinity. Each node has a private local cost function. The global cost function, which all nodes cooperatively minimize, is the integral of the local cost functions on the node set. We propose stochastic gradient descent and gradient tracking algorithms over the graphon. We establish a general lemma for the upper bound estimation related to a class of time-varying differential inequalities with negative linear terms, based upon which, we prove that for both kinds of algorithms, the second moments of the nodes' states are uniformly bounded. Especially, for the stochastic gradient tracking algorithm, we transform the convergence analysis into the asymptotic property of coupled nonlinear differential inequalities with time-varying coefficients and develop a decoupling method. For both kinds of algorithms, we show that by choosing the time-varying algorithm gains properly, all nodes' states achieve $\mathcal{L}^{\infty}$-consensus for a connected graphon. Furthermore, if the local cost functions are strongly convex, then all nodes' states converge to the minimizer of the global cost function and the auxiliary states in the stochastic gradient tracking algorithm converge to the gradient value of the global cost function at the minimizer uniformly in mean square.</description>

      <title>Fractional Sobolev paths on Wasserstein spaces and their energy-minimizing particle representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12068v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a generalization of the Monge--Kantorovich optimal transport problem. Given a prescribed family of time-dependent probability measures $(\mu_t)$, we aim to find, among all path-continuous stochastic processes whose one-dimensional time marginals coincide with $(\mu_t)$ (if there is any), a process that minimizes a given energy. After discussing a sufficient condition for the energy to ensure the existence of a minimizer, we investigate fractional Sobolev energies. Given a deterministic path $(\mu_t)$ on a $p$-Wasserstein space with fractional Sobolev regularity $W^{\alpha,p}$, where $1/p &lt; \alpha &lt; 1$, we provide conditions under which we prove the existence of a process that minimizes the energy and construct a process that realizes the regularity of $(\mu_t)$. While continuous paths of low regularity on Wasserstein spaces naturally appear in stochastic analysis, they can also arise deterministically as solutions to the continuity equation. This paper is devoted to the deterministic setting to gain some understanding of the required conditions. The subsequent companion paper (arXiv:2503.10859) focuses on the stochastic setting and applications to SPDEs.</description>
