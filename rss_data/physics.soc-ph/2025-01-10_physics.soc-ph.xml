      <title>A mathematical model for the bullying dynamics in schools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a mathematical model to understand the dynamics of bullying in schools. The model considers a population divided into four groups: susceptible individuals, bullies, individuals exposed to bullying, and violent individuals. Transitions between these states occur at rates designed to capture the complex interactions among students, influenced by factors such as romantic rejection, conflicts with peers and teachers, and other school-related challenges. These interactions can escalate into bullying and violent behavior. The model also incorporates the role of parents and school administrators in mitigating bullying through intervention strategies. The results suggest that bullying can be effectively controlled if anti-bullying programs implemented by schools are sufficiently robust. Additionally, the conditions under which bullying persists are explored.</description>

      <title>Recovery of activation propagation and self-sustained oscillation abilities in stroke brain networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Healthy brain networks usually show highly efficient information communication and self-sustained oscillation abilities. However, how the brain network structure affects these dynamics after an injury (stroke) is not very clear. The recovery of structure and dynamics of stroke brain networks over time is still not known precisely. Based on the analysis of a large number of strokes' brain network data, we show that stroke changes the network properties in connection weights, average degree, clustering, community, etc. Yet, they will recover gradually over time to some extent. We then adopt a simplified reaction-diffusion model to investigate stroke patients' activation propagation and self-sustained oscillation abilities. Our results reveal that the stroke slows the adoption time across different brain scales, indicating a weakened brain's activation propagation ability. In addition, we show that the lifetime of self-sustained oscillatory patterns at three months post-stroke patients' brains significantly departs from the healthy one. Finally, we examine the properties of core networks of self-sustained oscillatory patterns, in which the directed edges denote the main pathways of activation propagation. Our results demonstrate that the lifetime and recovery of self-sustaining patterns are related to the properties of core networks, and the properties in the post-stroke greatly vary from those in the healthy group. Most importantly, the strokes' activation propagation and self-sustained oscillation abilities significantly improve at one year post-stroke, driven by structural connection repair. This work may help us to understand the relationship between structure and function in brain disorders.</description>

      <title>Variable Goal Approach (VGA) Enhancing Pedestrian Dynamics Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the existing literature, pedestrian dynamics models have successfully captured various complex scenarios such as lane formation, evacuation, bottlenecks, crowd intersections, etc. However, many models, particularly force-based models, struggle to replicate simple yet real-life scenarios due to the absence of human intelligence during the processes. In this study, we present a novel Variable Goal Approach (VGA), which incorporates human intelligence into pedestrian dynamics models, significantly enhancing their efficiency and realism. VGA introduces the concept of multiple intermediate goals, termed variable goals, which guide pedestrians toward their final destination while minimizing interactions and disruptions. These variable goals act as a guidance system, allowing smoother transitions and adaptive navigation. By strategically positioning variable goals, VGA introduces an element of stochasticity. This allows the model to simulate varied pedestrian paths under identical conditions, reflecting the diversity in human decision-making. In addition to its effectiveness in simple scenarios, VGA demonstrates strong performance in replicating high-density scenarios, such as lane formation, providing results that closely match real-world data.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Pedestrian Dynamics Models for Common Scenarios: An Evaluation of Force-Based Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extensive research in pedestrian dynamics has primarily focused on crowded conditions and associated phenomena, such as lane formation, evacuation, etc. Several force-based models have been developed to predict the behavior in these situations. In contrast, there is a notable gap in terms of investigations of the moderate-to-low density situations. These scenarios are extremely commonplace across the world, including the highly populated nations like India. Additionally, the details of force-based models are expected to show significant effects at these densities, whereas the crowded, nearly packed, conditions may be expected to be governed largely by contact forces. In this study, we address this gap and comprehensively evaluate the performance of different force-based models in some common scenarios. Towards this, we perform controlled experiments in four situations: avoiding a stationary obstacle, position-swapping by walking toward each other, overtaking to reach a common goal, and navigating through a maze of obstacles. The performance evaluation consists of two stages and six evaluating parameters - successful trajectories, overlapping proportion, oscillation strength, path smoothness, speed deviation, and travel time. Firstly, models must meet an eligibility criterion of at least 80\% successful trajectories and secondly, the models are scored based on the cutoff values established from the experimental data. We evaluated five force-based models where the best one scored 57.14\%. Thus, our findings reveal significant shortcomings in the ability of these models to yield accurate predictions of pedestrian dynamics in these common situations.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Traffic Patterns with Percolation Theory: A Case Study of Seoul Roads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban traffic systems are characterized by dynamic interactions between congestion and free-flow states, influenced by human activity and road topology. This study employs percolation theory to analyze traffic dynamics in Seoul, focusing on the transition point $q_c$ and Fisher exponent $\tau$. The transition point $q_c$ quantifies the robustness of the free-flow clusters, while the exponent $\tau$ captures the spatial fragmentation of the traffic networks. Our analysis reveals temporal variations in these metrics, with lower $q_c$ and lower $\tau$ values during rush hours representing low-dimensional behavior. Weight-weight correlations are found to significantly impact cluster formation, driving the early onset of dominant traffic states. Comparisons with uncorrelated models highlight the role of real-world correlations. This approach provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating traffic resilience and informs strategies to optimize urban transportation systems.</description>

      <title>40 Years of Interdisciplinary Research: Phases, Origins, and Key Turning Points (1981-2020)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines the historical evolution of interdisciplinary research (IDR) over a 40-year period, focusing on its dynamic trends, phases, and key turning points. We apply time series analysis to identify critical years for interdisciplinary citations (CYICs) and categorizes IDR into three distinct phases based on these trends: Period I (1981-2002), marked by sporadic and limited interdisciplinary activity; Period II (2003-2016), characterized by the emergence of large-scale IDR led primarily by Medicine, with significant breakthroughs in cloning and medical technology; and Period III (2017-present), where IDR became a widely adopted research paradigm. Our findings indicate that IDR has been predominantly concentrated within the Natural Sciences, with Medicine consistently at the forefront, and highlights increasing contributions from Engineering and Environmental disciplines as a new trend. These insights enhance the understanding of the evolution of IDR, its driving factors, and the shifts in the focus of interdisciplinary collaborations.</description>

      <title>Exploring near-optimal energy systems with stakeholders: a novel approach for participatory modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Involving people in energy systems planning can increase the legitimacy and socio-political feasibility of energy transitions. Participatory research in energy modelling offers the opportunity to engage with stakeholders in a comprehensive way, but is limited by how results can be generated and presented without imposing assumptions and discrete scenarios on the participants. To this end, we present a methodology and a framework, based on near-optimal modelling results, that can incorporate stakeholders in a holistic and engaging way. We confront stakeholders with a continuum of modelling-based energy system designs via an interactive interface allowing them to choose essentially any combination of components that meet the system requirements. Together with information on the implications of different technologies, it is possible to assess how participants prioritise different aspects in energy systems planning while also facilitating learning in an engaging and stimulating way. We showcase the methodology for the remote Arctic settlement of Longyearbyen and illustrate how participants deviate consistently from the cost optimum. At the same time, they manage to balance different priorities such as emissions, costs, and system vulnerability leading to a better understanding of the complexity and intertwined nature of decisions.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the progress of Indian states chasing sustainable development goals using complex network framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) offer a critical global framework for addressing challenges like poverty, inequality, climate change, etc. They encourage a holistic approach integrating economic growth, social inclusion, and environmental sustainability to create a better future. We aim to examine India's responsibility in achieving the SDGs by recognizing the contributions of its diverse states in the federal structure of governance. As the nodal agency in India, the NITI Aayog's existing SDG index, using various socioeconomic indicators to determine the performance across different goals, serves as a foundation for assessing each state's progress. Building on the seminal works of Hidalgo and Hausmann (2009) and Tachhella et al. (2012), which introduced the economic complexity/fitness index, Sciarra et al. (2020) proposed the SDGs-Generalized Economic Complexity (GENEPY) framework to quantify "complexity" by computing "ranks for states" and "scores for goals", treating them as part of a complex bipartite network. In this paper, we apply the SDGs-GENEPY, to evaluate the progress and evolution of Indian states and union territories over several years. This enables us to identify each state's capacity (and rank) in achieving the SDGs. We can interpret these complexity scores as "centrality measures" of a complex bipartite network of the states and the goals. This enhances our understanding of the complex relationship between state capabilities and the achievability of SDGs within the Indian context and enables data-driven policy-making.</description>

      <title>Control of Overpopulated Tails in Kinetic Epidemic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce model-based transition rates for controlled compartmental models in mathematical epidemiology, with a focus on the effects of control strategies applied to interacting multi-agent systems describing contact formation dynamics. In the framework of kinetic control problems, we compare two prototypical control protocols: one additive control directly influencing the dynamics and another targeting the interaction strength between agents. The emerging controlled macroscopic models are derived for an SIR compartmentalization to illustrate their impact on epidemic progression and contact interaction dynamics. Numerical results show the effectiveness of this approach in steering the dynamics and controlling epidemic trends, even in scenarios where contact distributions exhibit an overpopulated tail.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growth of urban areas intensifies the need for sustainable, efficient transportation infrastructure and mobility systems, driving initiatives to enhance infrastructure and public transit while reducing traffic congestion and emissions. By utilizing real-world data, a data-driven approach can provide crucial insights for urban mobility planning and decision-making. This study explores the efficacy of leveraging telecoms data from cellular network signals for studying crowd movement patterns, focusing on Trondheim, Norway. It examines routing reports to understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of various transportation routes and modes. A data preprocessing and feature engineering framework was developed to process raw routing reports for historical analysis. This enabled the examination of geospatial trends and temporal patterns, including a comparative analysis of various transportation modes, along with public transit usage. Specific routes and areas were analyzed in-depth to compare their mobility patterns with the broader city context. The study highlights the potential of cellular network data as a resource for shaping urban transportation and mobility systems. By identifying deficiencies and potential improvements, city planners and stakeholders can foster more sustainable and effective transportation and mobility solutions.</description>

      <title>Exploiting the geometry of heterogeneous networks: A case study of the Indian stock market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04710v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we model the Indian stock market as heterogenous scale free network, which is then embedded in a two dimensional hyperbolic space through a machine learning based technique called as coalescent embedding. This allows us to apply the hyperbolic kmeans algorithm on the Poincare disc and the clusters so obtained resemble the original network communities more closely than the clusters obtained via Euclidean kmeans on the basis of well-known measures normalised mutual information and adjusted mutual information. Through this, we are able to clearly distinguish between periods of market stability and volatility by applying non-parametric statistical tests with a significance level of 0.05 to geometric measures namely hyperbolic distance and hyperbolic shortest path distance. After that, we are able to spot significant market change early by leveraging the Bollinger Band analysis on the time series of modularity in the embedded networks of each window. Finally, the radial distance and the Equidistance Angular coordinates help in visualizing the embedded network in the Poincare disc and it is seen that specific market sectors cluster together.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents, for the first time, a conceptual and formal model of postsingular science (PSS), which analyses and interprets changes in scientific knowledge driven by accelerating technological progress, singularity, and the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into scientific processes. The PSS model is based on the interplay of six key components: cumulative knowledge, intelligence, technological synergy, quantum information, social dynamics, and environmental sustainability. The interaction of these variables is described through a system of nonlinear differential equations, reflecting the complex feedback loops and synergetic effects characteristic of the postsingular world. A differentiation table contrasting postsingular and classical science is also presented, highlighting the most fundamental differences between contemporary classical science and future postsingular science. The model emphasizes the synergy between humans and artificial intelligence, the role of quantum technologies in accelerating scientific discovery, and the impact of social and ecological factors that either constrain or stimulate scientific progress. It is anticipated that new forms of scientific information dissemination will replace traditional academic publications and that scientific processing will reach an entirely new level of development following the singularity-driven acceleration of technological progress and the integration of AI into R&amp;D. This will herald an era of nonstop, ultrarapid science operating 24/7. The synergy of humans and artificial intelligence will create a scientific union on the basis of fundamentally new principles and methods. This research provides an initial theoretical foundation for further interdisciplinary studies aimed at developing sustainable strategies and effectively managing scientific progress in the postsingular era.</description>

      <title>Deep Overlapping Community Search via Subspace Embedding</title>

Abstract: Overlapping Community Search (OCS) identifies nodes that interact with multiple communities based on a specified query. Existing community search approaches fall into two categories: algorithm-based models and Machine Learning-based (ML) models. Despite the long-standing focus on this topic within the database domain, current solutions face two major limitations: 1) Both approaches fail to address personalized user requirements in OCS, consistently returning the same set of nodes for a given query regardless of user differences. 2) Existing ML-based CS models suffer from severe training efficiency issues. In this paper, we formally redefine the problem of OCS. By analyzing the gaps in both types of approaches, we then propose a general solution for OCS named Sparse Subspace Filter (SSF), which can extend any ML-based CS model to enable personalized search in overlapping structures. To overcome the efficiency issue in the current models, we introduce Simplified Multi-hop Attention Networks (SMN), a lightweight yet effective community search model with larger receptive fields. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ML-based study of overlapping community search. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance of SMN within the SSF pipeline, achieving a 13.73% improvement in F1-Score and up to 3 orders of magnitude acceleration in model efficiency compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Trading Devil RL: Backdoor attack via Stock market, Bayesian Optimization and Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of generative artificial intelligence, particularly large language models, a number of sub-fields of deep learning have made significant progress and are now very useful in everyday applications. For example, well-known financial institutions simulate a wide range of scenarios for various models created by their research teams using reinforcement learning, both before production and after regular operations. In this work, we propose a backdoor attack that focuses solely on data poisoning. This particular backdoor attack is classified as an attack without prior consideration or trigger, and we name it FinanceLLMsBackRL. Our aim is to examine the potential effects of large language models that use reinforcement learning systems for text production or speech recognition, finance, physics, or the ecosystem of contemporary artificial intelligence models.</description>

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has presented unprecedented challenges worldwide, necessitating effective modelling approaches to understand and control its transmission dynamics. In this study, we propose a novel approach that integrates asymptomatic and super-spreader individuals in a single compartmental model. We highlight the advantages of utilizing incommensurate fractional order derivatives in ordinary differential equations, including increased flexibility in capturing disease dynamics and refined memory effects in the transmission process. We conduct a qualitative analysis of our proposed model, which involves determining the basic reproduction number and analysing the disease-free equilibrium's stability. By fitting the proposed model with real data from Portugal and comparing it with existing models, we demonstrate that the incorporation of supplementary population classes and fractional derivatives significantly improves the model's goodness of fit. Sensitivity analysis further provides valuable insights for designing effective strategies to mitigate the spread of the virus.</description>
