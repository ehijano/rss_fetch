      <title>The weakest condition for a Kannan-type contraction mapping on a complete metric space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the weakest possible conditions for fixed point theorems concerning two types of mappings: Kannan and Chatterjea. We employ the so-called CJM condition, which has been successfully applied to the classical Banach-type mappings by \'Ciri\'c [7]. We show that the CJM condition is nearly the weakest possible to have a fixed point, and that a slight modification yields the weakest condition even for these two types of mappings.</description>

      <title>Convolutions of Orlicz spaces and Orlicz Schatten classes, with applications to Toeplitz operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Phi$ be a Young function. We study convolution properties for symbol classes $s_{A,\Phi}$, which consist of all $a$ such that the pseudo-differential operator $\operatorname{Op} _A(a)$ is in the Orlicz Schatten class $\mathscr I _\Phi (L^2(\mathbf R^d))$. Especially we prove Young type results for such classes. We apply the results on Toeplitz operators and prove Orlicz Schatten properties of such operators.</description>

      <title>An atomic decomposition for functions of bounded variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a decomposition of the gradient measure $Du$ of an arbitrary function of bounded variation $u$ into a sum of atoms $\mu=D\chi_{F}$, where $F$ is a set of finite perimeter. The atoms further satisfy the support, cancellation, normalization, and size conditions: For each $\mu$, there exists a cube $Q$ such that $\operatorname*{supp}\mu\subset Q$, $\mu(Q)=0$, $|\mu|(Q)\leq 1$, and, denoting by $p_t$ the heat kernel in $\mathbb{R}^d$, \[ \sup_{x \in \mathbb{R}^d, t&gt;0} |t^{1/2} p_t \ast \mu (x)| \leq \frac{1}{l(Q)^{d-1}}. \] Our proof relies on a sampling of the coarea formula and a new boxing identity. We present several consequences of this result, including Sobolev inequalities, dimension estimates, and trace inequalities.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Szeg\"o-Dirichlet kernel of the right half-plane $\mathbb H_{1/2}$ is given by ${\varkappa}(s, u) = \zeta(s+\overline{u}),$ $s, u \in \mathbb H_{1/2},$ where $\zeta$ denotes the Riemann zeta function. We show that none of the positive integer powers of $\varkappa$ has $2$-point scalar Pick property. Nevertheless, a network realization formula for the right half-plane $\mathbb H_0$ is obtained.</description>

      <title>Matrix-Weighted Besov-Triebel-Lizorkin Spaces of Optimal Scale: Real-Variable Characterizations, Invariance on Integrable Index, and Sobolev-Type Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, using growth functions we introduce generalized matrix-weighted Besov-Triebel-Lizorkin-type spaces with matrix $\mathcal{A}_{\infty}$ weights. We first characterize these spaces, respectively, in terms of the $\varphi$-transform, the Peetre-type maximal function, and the Littlewood-Paley functions. Furthermore, after establishing the boundedness of almost diagonal operators on the corresponding sequence spaces, we obtain the molecular and the wavelet characterizations of these spaces. As applications, we find the sufficient and necessary conditions for the invariance of those Triebel-Lizorkin-type spaces on the integrable index and also for the Sobolev-type embedding of all these spaces. The main novelty exists in that these results are of wide generality, the growth condition of growth functions is not only sufficient but also necessary for the boundedness of almost diagonal operators and hence this new framework of Besov-Triebel-Lizorkin-type is optimal, some results either are new or improve the known ones even for known matrix-weighted Besov-Triebel-Lizorkin spaces, and, furthermore, even in the scalar-valued setting, all the results are also new.</description>

      <title>Generalized Double Operator Integrals for Continuous Spectrum Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous spectrum operators (CSOs), characterized by spectra comprising continuous intervals rather than discrete eigenvalues, are pivotal in quantum mechanics, wave propagation, and systems governed by partial differential equations. Traditional double operator integrals (DOIs), central to analyzing operator functions and perturbations, have been limited to operators with finite or countable spectra, relying critically on self-adjointness. This work introduces a comprehensive framework for Generalized Double Operator Integrals (GDOIs), extending DOI theory to non-self-adjoint operators through the spectral structure of CSOs. By reinterpreting DOIs as instances of the spectral mapping theorem for CSOs, we establish GDOIs as a rigorous generalization, enabling their application to operators with continuous spectra. Key contributions include the development of GDOIs' algebraic properties, perturbation formulas generalizing classical results, norm and Lipschitz-type inequalities, and continuity with respect to operator and function parameters. Applications to differentiating operator-valued functions demonstrate the framework's utility in functional calculus. Furthermore, integrating recent spectral mapping theorems allows natural extension to hybrid spectrum operators, bridging operator theory with applied fields. This work significantly expands the analytical toolbox for systems with continuous spectral phenomena, offering new methodologies for quantum mechanics, control theory, and stochastic analysis, where non-self-adjoint and continuous spectral features are fundamental. The results unify and extend existing operator-theoretic techniques, fostering interdisciplinary advances in mathematics, physics, and engineering.</description>

      <title>Geometric Banach property (T) for metric spaces via Banach representations of Roe algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a notion of geometric Banach property (T) for metric spaces, which jointly generalizes Banach property (T) for groups and geometric property (T) for metric spaces. Our framework is achieved by Banach representations of Roe algebras of metric spaces. We show that geometric Banach property (T) is a coarse geometric invariant and establish several equivalent characterizations of this property, including a characterization via Kazhdan projections in Roe algebras. Further, we investigate foundational properties of geometric Banach property (T), including: the geometric Banach property (T) of sequences of finite Cayley graphs to the Banach property (T) of their limit groups (this partially extends the classical correspondence between residually finite groups and their box spaces), and the connection between the coarse fixed point property and geometric Banach property (T). Additionally, we provide a geometric characterization of V. Lafforgue's strong Banach property (T) for residually finite groups in terms of geometric Banach property (T) of its box spaces.</description>

      <title>Modular convergence of Steklov sampling operators in Orlicz spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we deal with the family of Steklov sampling operators in the general setting of Orlicz spaces. The main result of the paper is a modular convergence theorem established following a density approach. To do this, a Luxemburg norm convergence for the Steklov sampling series based on continuous functions with compact support, and a modular-type inequality in the case of functions in Orlicz spaces has been preliminary proved. As a particular case of general theory, the results in $L^p$, in the Zygmund (interpolation), and in the exponential spaces are deduced. A crucial aspect in the above results is the choice of both band- and duration- limited kernel functions satisfying the partition of the unit property; to provide such examples an equivalent condition based on the Poisson summation formula and the computation of the Fourier transform of the kernel has been employed.</description>

      <title>Frequently hypercyclic composition operators on the little Lipschitz space of a rooted tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the strictly increasing symbols $\varphi:\mathbb{N}_0\longrightarrow\mathbb{N}_0$ whose composition operators~$C_{\varphi}$ satisfy the Frequent Hypercyclicity Criterion on the little Lipschitz space $\mathcal{L}_0(\mathbb{N}_0)$. With this result we continue the recent research about this kind of spaces and operators, but our approach relies on establishing a natural isomorphism between the Lipschitz-type spaces over rooted trees and the classical spaces $\ell^{\infty}$ and $c_0$. Such isomorphism provides an alternative framework that simplifies and allows to improve many previous results about these spaces and the operators defined there.</description>

      <title>Topological Center of the Double Dual of the Orlicz Fig\`{a}-Talamanca Herz Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a locally compact group $G$ and a Young function $\Phi,$ let $A_\Phi(G)$ be the Orlicz analogue of the Fig\`{a}-Talamanca Herz algebra $A_p(G).$ Let $\Lambda(A_\Phi(G)^{\ast\ast})$ denote the topological center of the double dual of $A_\Phi(G),$ when considered as a Banach algebra with the first Arens product. In this article, we present certain results concerning the existence of left and right identities in the Banach algebra $A_\Phi(G)^{\ast\ast}$ and explore their relationship with the space $UCB_\Psi(\widehat{G}).$ Further, for amenable groups, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for the equality $\Lambda(A_\Phi(G)^{\ast\ast}) = A_\Phi(G)$ to hold. Moreover, we derive several results related to the semi-simplicity of the Banach algebras $A_\Phi(G)^{\ast\ast}$ and $UCB_\Psi(\widehat{G})^\ast.$</description>

      <title>The Multidimensional Quadratic Phase Fourier Transform: Theoretical Analysis and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quadratic phase Fourier transform (QPFT) is a generalization of several well-known integral transforms, including the linear canonical transform (LCT), fractional Fourier transform (FrFT), and Fourier transform (FT). This paper introduces the multidimensional QPFT and investigates its theoretical properties, including Parseval's identity and inversion theorems. Generalized convolutions and correlation for multiple variables, extending the conventional convolution for single-variable functions, are proposed within the QPFT setting. Additionally, a Boas-type theorem for the multidimensional QPFT is established. As applications, multiplicative filter design and the solution of integral equations using the proposed convolution operation are explored.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the dynamics of defects in planar pattern-forming systems, we study Fredholm properties of elliptic operators with singular coefficients in weighted Sobolev spaces. In particular, we consider a family of doubly weighted spaces that encode algebraic decay/growth of functions at infinity, and near the origin. Our results give conditions on the weights under which the operators are either injective, surjective, or isomorphisms. We also give a precise description of the kernel and range of these operators.</description>

      <title>Boundedness of pseudo-differential operators on the torus revisited. II</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we continue our program of revisiting the new aspects about the boundedness properties of pseudo-differential operators on the torus. Here we prove $H^p$-$L^p$ and $H^p$-estimates for H\"ormander classes of pseudo-differential operators on the torus $\mathbb{T}^n$ for $p\leq 1$. The results are presented in the context of the global symbolic analysis developed by Ruzhansky and Turunen on $\mathbb{T}^n \times \mathbb{Z}^n$ by using the discrete Fourier analysis, which extends the $(\rho, \delta)$-H\"ormander classes on $\mathbb{T}^n$ defined by local coordinate systems. These results extend those proved by \'Alvarez and Hounie for the Euclidean case, considering even the case $\rho\leq\delta$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider inequalities between $L_p$-norms of partial derivatives, $p\in [1,+\infty]$, for bivariate concave functions on a convex domain that vanish on the boundary. Can the ratio between those norms be arbitrarily large? If not, what is the upper bound? We show that for $p=1$, the ratio is always bounded and find sharp estimates, while for $p&gt;1$, the answer depends on the geometry of the domain.</description>

      <title>Faster logconcave sampling from a cold start in high dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a faster algorithm to generate a warm start for sampling an arbitrary logconcave density specified by an evaluation oracle, leading to the first sub-cubic sampling algorithms for inputs in (near-)isotropic position. A long line of prior work incurred a warm-start penalty of at least linear in the dimension, hitting a cubic barrier, even for the special case of uniform sampling from convex bodies.
  Our improvement relies on two key ingredients of independent interest. (1) We show how to sample given a warm start in weaker notions of distance, in particular $q$-R\'enyi divergence for $q=\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(1)$, whereas previous analyses required stringent $\infty$-R\'enyi divergence (with the exception of Hit-and-Run, whose known mixing time is higher). This marks the first improvement in the required warmness since Lov\'asz and Simonovits (1991). (2) We refine and generalize the log-Sobolev inequality of Lee and Vempala (2018), originally established for isotropic logconcave distributions in terms of the diameter of the support, to logconcave distributions in terms of a geometric average of the support diameter and the largest eigenvalue of the covariance matrix.</description>

      <title>Spectral gap of the KMP and other stochastic exchange models on arbitrary graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a simple strategy to derive universal bounds on the spectral gap of reversible stochastic exchange models on arbitrary graphs. The Kipnis-Marchioro-Presutti (KMP) model, the harmonic process (HP), and the immediate exchange model (IEM) are all examples that fall into this class. Our upper and lower bounds depend only on two features: worst-case linear statistics and a kinetic factor, which is, in essence, graph-independent. For the three aforementioned examples, these bounds are sharp, and even saturate to an identity for HP and IEM in some log-concave regimes. The proof -- which yields bounds for eigenvalues even in the non-reversible context -- crucially exploits the rigidity of the eigenstructure of these models and quantitative contraction rates of the corresponding hidden parameter models recently introduced in [DMFG24, GRT25].</description>

      <title>On the Palais-Smale condition in geometric knot theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that various families of energies relevant in
  geometric knot theory satisfy the Palais-Smale condition (PS)
  on submanifolds of arclength para\-metrized knots.
  These energies
  include linear combinations of the Euler-Bernoulli
  bending energy with a wide variety of non-local
  knot energies, such as
  O'Hara's self-repulsive potentials $E^{\alpha,p}$, generalized
  tangent-point energies $\TP^{(p,q)}$, and generalized integral
  Menger curvature functionals $\intM^{(p,q)}$. Even the
  tangent-point energies $\TP^{(p,2)}$ for $p\in (4,5)$ alone
  are shown to fulfill the (PS)-condition. For all energies mentioned
  we can therefore prove existence of minimizing knots in any prescribed
  ambient isotopy class, and we
  provide long-time existence of their Hilbert-gradient flows,
  and subconvergence to critical knots as time goes to infinity.
  In addition, we prove $C^\infty$-smoothness of all arclength constrained
  critical knots, which shows in particular that these critical knots
  are also critical for the energies on the larger open set of
  regular knots under a fixed-length constraint.</description>

      <title>Unconditional Schauder frames of exponentials and of uniformly bounded functions in $L^p$ spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that there is no unconditional basis of exponentials in the space $L^p(\Omega)$, $p \ne 2$, for any set $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ of finite measure. This is a consequence of a more general result due to Gaposhkin, who proved that the space $L^p(\Omega)$ does not admit a seminormalized unconditional basis consisting of uniformly bounded functions. We show that the latter result fails if the word "basis" is replaced with "Schauder frame". On the other hand we prove that if $\Omega$ has nonempty interior then there are no unconditional Schauder frames of exponentials in the space $L^p(\Omega)$, $p \ne 2$.</description>

      <title>Discrete signature tensors for persistence landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Signature tensors of paths are a versatile tool for data analysis and machine learning. Recently, they have been applied to persistent homology, by embedding barcodes into spaces of paths. Among the different path embeddings, the persistence landscape embedding is injective and stable, however it loses injectivity when composed with the signature map. Here we address this by proposing a discrete alternative. The critical points of a persistence landscape form a time-series, of which we compute the discrete signature. We call this association the discrete landscape feature map (DLFM). We give results on the injectivity, stability and computability of the DLFM. We apply it to a knotted protein dataset, capturing sequence similarity and knot depth with statistical significance.</description>

      <title>Heat kernel-based p-energy norms on metric measure spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.10414v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate heat kernel-based and other $p$-energy norms (1&lt;p&lt;\infty) on bounded and unbounded metric measure spaces, in particular, on nested fractals and their blowups. With the weak-monotonicity properties for these norms, we generalise the celebrated Bourgain-Brezis-Mironescu (BBM) type characterization for p\neq2. When there admits a heat kernel satisfying the two-sided estimates, we establish the equivalence of various $p$-energy norms and weak-monotonicity properties, and show that these weak-monotonicity properties hold when p=2 (in the case of Dirichlet form). Our paper's key results concern the equivalence and verification of various weak-monotonicity properties on fractals. Consequently, many classical results on p-energy norms hold on nested fractals and their blowups, including the BBM type characterization and Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz-free spaces and representations of group actions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15208v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate actions of topological groups $G$ on Lipschitz-free spaces $\mathcal{F}(M)$, induced by isometric actions on pointed metric spaces $M$. In particular, we study the associated dynamical $G$-systems under the weak-star topology, focusing on the dual action on $\mathrm{Lip}_0(M) = \mathcal{F}(M)^*$ and the bidual $\mathcal{F}(M)^{**}$. Two natural compactification constructions are considered: the metric compactification of isometric $G$-spaces over pointed metric spaces, and the Gromov $G$-compactification of bounded metric $G$-spaces. We show that for every bounded stable metric $G$-space $(M, d, \mathbf{0})$, the corresponding metric $G$-compactification defines a weakly almost periodic $G$-flow. We also explore notions of amenability in this setting, particularly in relation to the metric compactification, and introduce a topometric version of Lipschitz-free spaces.</description>

      <title>Discrete Zak Transform and Multi-window Gabor Systems on Discrete Periodic Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03423v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, $\mathcal{G}(g,L,M,N)$ denotes a $L-$window Gabor system on a periodic set $\mathbb{S}$, where $L,M,M\in \mathbb{N}$ and $g=\{g_l\}_{l\in \mathbb{N}_L}\subset \ell^2(\mathbb{S})$. We characterize which $g$ generates a complete multi-window Gabor system and a multi-window Gabor frame $\mathcal{G}(g,L,M,N)$ on $\mathbb{S}$ using the Zak transform. Admissibility conditions for a periodic set to admit a complete multi--window Gabor system, multi-window Gabor (Parseval) frame, and multi--window Gabor (orthonormal) basis $\mathcal{G}(g,L,M,N)$ are given with respect to the parameters $L$, $M$ and $N$.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of Sobolev functions via Besov-type energy functionals in fractals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the spirit of the ground-breaking result of Bourgain--Brezis--Mironescu, we establish some characterizations of Sobolev functions in metric measure spaces including fractals like the Vicsek set, the Sierpi\'{n}ski gasket and the Sierpi\'{n}ski carpet. As corollaries of our characterizations, we present equivalent norms on the Korevaar--Schoen--Sobolev space, and show that the domain of a $p$-energy form is identified with a Besov-type function space under a suitable $(p,p)$-Poincar\'e inequality, capacity upper bound and the volume doubling property.</description>

Abstract: Every state on the algebra $M_n$ of complex nxn matrices restricts to a state on any matrix system. Whereas the restriction to a matrix system is generally not open, we prove that the restriction to every *-subalgebra of $M_n$ is open. This simplifies topology problems in matrix theory and quantum information theory.</description>

      <title>$p$-Poincar\'e inequalities and cutoff Sobolev inequalities on metric measure spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $p\in(1,+\infty)$, we introduce the cutoff Sobolev inequality on general metric measure spaces, and prove that there exists a metric measure space endowed with a $p$-energy that satisfies the chain condition, the volume regular condition with respect to a doubling scaling function $\Phi$, and that both the Poincar\'e inequality and the the cutoff Sobolev inequality with respect to a doubling scaling function $\Psi$ hold if and only if $$\frac{1}{C}\left(\frac{R}{r}\right)^p\le\frac{\Psi(R)}{\Psi(r)}\le C\left(\frac{R}{r}\right)^{p-1}\frac{\Phi(R)}{\Phi(r)}\text{ for any }r\le R.$$ In particular, given any pair of doubling functions $\Phi$ and $\Psi$ satisfying the above inequality, we construct a metric measure space endowed with a $p$-energy on which all the above conditions are satisfied. As a direct corollary, we prove that there exists a metric measure space which is $d_h$-Ahlfors regular and has $p$-walk dimension $\beta_p$ if and only if $$p\le\beta_p\le d_h+(p-1).$$ Our proof builds on the Laakso-type space theory, which was recently developed by Murugan (arXiv:2410.15611).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general framework of localized operators, i.e., operators whose matrix coefficients with respect to the Gabor frame are concentrated on the diagonal. We show that localized operators are bounded between modulation spaces, and we deduce their compactness from an easily verifiable weak compactness condition. We apply this abstract formalism to unify and extend existing theorems for pseudodifferential and Fourier integral operators, and to obtain new results for three-parameter pseudodifferential operators.</description>

      <title>Numerical Approximation of Delay Differential Equations via Operator Splitting in Fractional Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05483v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a rigorous framework for the numerical approximation of both autonomous and non-autonomous delay differential equations (DDEs), with a focus on the implicit Euler method and sequential operator splitting.
  To overcome the difficulty that the delay operator does not generate an analytic semigroup in the standard space \( L^1[\tau, 0] \), we embed the problem into the interpolation space \( \left(L^1[\tau, 0], W^{1,1}_0[\tau, 0]\right)_{\theta, 1} \) for \( 0 &lt; \theta &lt; 1 \), where the differential operator becomes sectorial. This allows the full operator \( L = A + B \) to generate an analytic semigroup \( T_L(t) \), enabling the use of semigroup theory to derive sharp error estimates.
  We prove that the implicit Euler method achieves a global error of order \( \mathcal{O}(h) \), while the Lie--Trotter splitting method yields an error of order \( \mathcal{O}(h^{2\theta - 1}) \) in the interpolation norm. These theoretical rates are confirmed by numerical experiments, including comparisons with exact solutions obtained via semi-analytical Fourier-based methods in the non-autonomous setting.</description>
