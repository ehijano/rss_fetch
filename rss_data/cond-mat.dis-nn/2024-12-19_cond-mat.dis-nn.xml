      <title>Investigation of reentrant localization transition in one-dimensional quasi-periodic lattice with long-range hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reentrant localization has recently been observed in systems with quasi-periodic nearest-neighbor hopping, where the interplay between dimerized hopping and staggered disorder is identified as the driving mechanism. However, the robustness of reentrant localization in the presence of long-range hopping remains an open question. In this work, we investigate the phenomenon of reentrant localization in systems incorporating long-range hopping. Our results reveal that long-range hopping induces reentrant localization regardless of whether the disorder is staggered or uniform. We demonstrate that long-range hopping does not inherently disrupt localization; instead, under specific conditions, it facilitates the emergence of reentrant localization. Furthermore, by analyzing critical exponents, we show that the inclusion of long-range hopping modifies the critical behavior, leading to transitions that belong to distinct universality classes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $\pm J$ SK model for small $N$'s up to $N=9$. We sort the $2^{N(N-1)/2}$ possible realizations of the coupling matrix into equivalence classes according to the gauge symmetry and permutation symmetry and determine the energy spectra for each of these classes. We also study the energy landscape in these small systems and find that the elements of the hierarchic organization of ground states %and higher energy local minima start to appear in some samples already for $N$'s as small as 6.</description>

      <title>Subwavelength Localisation in Disordered Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider disordered finite systems of subwavelength resonators where the disorder is in the spatial arrangement of the resonators and their material parameters are perturbed randomly. We elucidate the mechanism of wave localisation in such systems. To do so, we employ the capacitance matrix formalism, make precise the notions of bandgap and localised eigenmodes, study their stabilities with respect to fluctuations in the system, and highlight the importance of defect hybridisation and level repulsion in creating localised eigenmodes for a given arrangement of the resonators by randomly changing their material parameters. We also introduce a method of localised eigenmode prediction based on the discrete Green function of the disordered system of resonators and show the existence of bound eigenmodes in disordered systems where local translation invariance is broken.</description>

      <title>Network Renormalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The renormalization group (RG) is a powerful theoretical framework developed to consistently transform the description of configurations of systems with many degrees of freedom, along with the associated model parameters and coupling constants, across different levels of resolution. It also provides a way to identify critical points of phase transitions and study the system's behaviour around them by distinguishing between relevant and irrelevant details, the latter being unnecessary to describe the emergent macroscopic properties. In traditional physical applications, the RG largely builds on the notions of homogeneity, symmetry, geometry and locality to define metric distances, scale transformations and self-similar coarse-graining schemes. More recently, various approaches have tried to extend RG concepts to the ubiquitous realm of complex networks where explicit geometric coordinates do not necessarily exist, nodes and subgraphs can have very different properties, and homogeneous lattice-like symmetries are absent. The strong heterogeneity of real-world networks significantly complicates the definition of consistent renormalization procedures. In this review, we discuss the main attempts, the most important advances, and the remaining open challenges on the road to network renormalization.</description>

      <title>An introduction to reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a growing interest in the development of artificial neural networks that are implemented in a physical system. A major challenge in this context is that these networks are difficult to train since training here would require a change of physical parameters rather than simply of coefficients in a computer program. For this reason, reservoir computing, where one employs high-dimensional recurrent networks and trains only the final layer, is widely used in this context. In this chapter, I introduce the basic concepts of reservoir computing. Moreover, I present some important physical implementations coming from electronics, photonics, spintronics, mechanics, and biology. Finally, I provide a brief discussion of quantum reservoir computing.</description>

      <title>Topological Quantum Spin Glass Order and its realization in qLDPC codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ordered phases of matter have close connections to computation. Two prominent examples are spin glass order, with wide-ranging applications in machine learning and optimization, and topological order, closely related to quantum error correction. Here, we introduce the concept of topological quantum spin glass (TQSG) order which marries these two notions, exhibiting both the complex energy landscapes of spin glasses, and the quantum memory and long-range entanglement characteristic of topologically ordered systems. Using techniques from coding theory and a quantum generalization of Gibbs state decompositions, we show that TQSG order is the low-temperature phase of various quantum LDPC codes on expander graphs, including hypergraph and balanced product codes. Our work introduces a topological analog of spin glasses that preserves quantum information, opening new avenues for both statistical mechanics and quantum computer science.</description>

      <title>Spatial Optical Simulator for Classical Statistical Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical simulators for the Ising model have demonstrated great promise for solving challenging problems in physics and beyond. Here, we develop a spatial optical simulator for a variety of classical statistical systems, including the clock, $XY$, Potts, and Heisenberg models, utilizing a digital micromirror device composed of a large number of tiny mirrors. Spins, with desired amplitudes or phases of the statistical models, are precisely encoded by a patch of mirrors with a superpixel approach. Then, by modulating the light field in a sequence of designed patterns, the spin-spin interaction is realized in such a way that the Hamiltonian symmetries are preserved. We successfully simulate statistical systems on a fully connected network, with ferromagnetic or Mattis-type random interactions, and observe the corresponding phase transitions between the paramagnetic, and the ferromagnetic or spin-glass phases. Our results largely extend the research scope of spatial optical simulators and their versatile applications.</description>

Abstract: Diffusion models are currently the leading generative AI approach used for image generation in e.g. DALL-E and Stable Diffusion. In this talk we relate diffusion models to stochastic quantisation in field theory and employ it to generate configurations for scalar fields on a two-dimensional lattice. We end with some speculations on possible applications.</description>

      <title>Representational Drift and Learning-Induced Stabilization in the Olfactory Cortex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The brain encodes external stimuli through patterns of neural activity, forming internal representations of the world. Recent experiments show that neural representations for a given stimulus change over time. However, the mechanistic origin for the observed "representational drift" (RD) remains unclear. Here, we propose a biologically-realistic computational model of the piriform cortex to study RD in the mammalian olfactory system by combining two mechanisms for the dynamics of synaptic weights at two separate timescales: spontaneous fluctuations on a scale of days and spike-time dependent plasticity (STDP) on a scale of seconds. Our study shows that, while spontaneous fluctuations in synaptic weights induce RD, STDP-based learning during repeated stimulus presentations can reduce it. Our model quantitatively explains recent experiments on RD in the olfactory system and offers a mechanistic explanation for the emergence of drift and its relation to learning, which may be useful to study RD in other brain regions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14856v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive analysis of a collective decision-making model inspired by honeybee behavior. This model integrates individual exploration for option discovery and social interactions for information sharing, while also considering option qualities. Our assessment of the decision process outcome employs standard consensus metrics and investigates its correlation with convergence time, revealing common trade-offs between speed and accuracy. Furthermore, we show the model's compliance with Weber's Law of relative stimulus perception, aligning with previous analysis of collective decision problems. Our study also identifies non-equilibrium critical behavior in specific limits of the model, where the highest values of consensus are achieved. This result highlights the intriguing relationship between optimal performance, critically, and the fluctuations caused by finite size effects, often seen in biological systems. Our findings are especially relevant for finite adaptive systems, as they provide insights into navigating decision-making scenarios with similar options more effectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the update of weight matrices in learning algorithms can be described in the framework of Dyson Brownian motion, thereby inheriting many features of random matrix theory. We relate the level of stochasticity to the ratio of the learning rate and the mini-batch size, providing more robust evidence to a previously conjectured scaling relationship. We discuss universal and non-universal features in the resulting Coulomb gas distribution and identify the Wigner surmise and Wigner semicircle explicitly in a teacher-student model and in the (near-)solvable case of the Gaussian restricted Boltzmann machine.</description>

      <title>Protect Measurement-Induced Phase Transition from Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14109v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scrambling dynamics induced by random unitary gates can protect information from low-rate measurements, which underpins the phenomenon known as the measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT). However, typical decoherence noises disrupts the volume law phase, complicating the observation of MIPT on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Here, we demonstrate that incorporating quantum-enhanced operations can effectively protect MIPT from environmental noise, thereby enabling its detection in experiment. The transition is characterized by the conditional entanglement entropy (CEE), which is associated with a statistical mechanics model wherein noise and quantum-enhanced operations act as competing external random fields. When the net external field is zero, a ferromagnetic-paramagnetic phase transition is expected, resulting in the MIPT. This zero-field condition also ensures an average apparatus-environment symmetry, making CEE a valid probe of entanglement and establishing the transition as a genuine entanglement phase transition. Additionally, we provide numerical results demonstrate the MIPT in a (2+1)-dimensional quantum circuit under dephasing noise. We also propose a method to estimate the noise rate, enabling the zero-field condition to be achieved experimentally and ensuring the feasibility of our protocol. Our result serves as a concrete example of the power of quantum enhancement in combating noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of phase oscillators in the fully disordered Kuramoto model with couplings of defined asymmetry. The mean-field dynamics is reduced to a self-consistent stochastic single-oscillator problem which we analyze perturbatively and by numerical simulations. We elucidate the influence of the asymmetry on the correlation and response function of the system as well as on the distribution of the order parameter. The so-called volcano transition is shown to be robust with respect to a small degree of coupling asymmetry but to disappear when the antisymmetry in the couplings outweighs the symmetry.</description>

      <title>Coherent Information Phase Transition in a Noisy Quantum Circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coherent information quantifies the transmittable quantum information through a channel and is directly linked to the channel's quantum capacity. In the context of dynamical purification transitions, scrambling dynamics sustain extensive and positive coherent information at low measurement rates, but noises can suppress it to zero or negative values. Here we introduce quantum-enhanced operations into a noisy monitored quantum circuit. This circuit, viewed as a quantum channel, undergoes a phase transition in coherent information from a recoverable phase with positive values to an irrecoverable phase with negative values. This transition is modulated by the relative frequency of noise and quantum-enhanced operations. The existence of a recoverable phase implies that quantum-enhanced operations can facilitate reliable quantum information transmission in the presence of diverse noises. Remarkably, we propose a resource-efficient protocol to characterize this phase transition, effectively avoiding post-selection by utilizing every run of the quantum simulation. This approach bridges the gap between theoretical insights and practical implementation, making the phase transition feasible to demonstrate on realistic noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.</description>
