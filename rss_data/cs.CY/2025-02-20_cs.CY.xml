      <title>Make Making Sustainable: Exploring Sustainability Practices, Challenges, and Opportunities in Making Activities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent democratization of personal fabrication has significantly advanced the maker movement and reshaped applied research in HCI and beyond. However, this growth has also raised increasing sustainability concerns, as material waste is an inevitable byproduct of making and rapid prototyping. In this work, we examine the sustainability landscape within the modern maker community, focusing on grassroots makerspaces and maker-oriented research labs through in-depth interviews with diverse stakeholders involved in making and managing making-related activities. Our findings highlight four key themes: the various types of "waste" generated through the making process, the strategies (or lack thereof) for managing this waste, the motivations driving (un)sustainable practices, and the challenges faced. We synthesize these insights into design considerations and takeaways for technical HCI researchers and the broader community, focusing on future tools, infrastructures, and educational approaches to foster sustainable making.</description>

      <title>The "Who'', "What'', and "How'' of Responsible AI Governance: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of (Actor, Stage)-Specific Tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The implementation of responsible AI in an organization is inherently complex due to the involvement of multiple stakeholders, each with their unique set of goals and responsibilities across the entire AI lifecycle. These responsibilities are often ambiguously defined and assigned, leading to confusion, miscommunication, and inefficiencies. Even when responsibilities are clearly defined and assigned to specific roles, the corresponding AI actors lack effective tools to support their execution.
  Toward closing these gaps, we present a systematic review and comprehensive meta-analysis of the current state of responsible AI tools, focusing on their alignment with specific stakeholder roles and their responsibilities in various AI lifecycle stages. We categorize over 220 tools according to AI actors and stages they address. Our findings reveal significant imbalances across the stakeholder roles and lifecycle stages addressed. The vast majority of available tools have been created to support AI designers and developers specifically during data-centric and statistical modeling stages while neglecting other roles such as institutional leadership, deployers, end-users, and impacted communities, and stages such as value proposition and deployment. The uneven distribution we describe here highlights critical gaps that currently exist in responsible AI governance research and practice. Our analysis reveals that despite the myriad of frameworks and tools for responsible AI, it remains unclear \emph{who} within an organization and \emph{when} in the AI lifecycle a tool applies. Furthermore, existing tools are rarely validated, leaving critical gaps in their usability and effectiveness. These gaps provide a starting point for researchers and practitioners to create more effective and holistic approaches to responsible AI development and governance.</description>

      <title>Thinking Outside the (Gray) Box: A Context-Based Score for Assessing Value and Originality in Neural Text Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the increasing use of large language models for creative tasks, their outputs often lack diversity. Common solutions, such as sampling at higher temperatures, can compromise the quality of the results. Drawing on information theory, we propose a context-based score to quantitatively evaluate value and originality. This score incentivizes accuracy and adherence to the request while fostering divergence from the learned distribution. We propose using our score as a reward in a reinforcement learning framework to fine-tune large language models for maximum performance. We validate our strategy through experiments in poetry generation and math problem solving, demonstrating that it enhances the value and originality of the generated solutions.</description>

      <title>Two Tickets are Better than One: Fair and Accurate Hiring Under Strategic LLM Manipulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an era of increasingly capable foundation models, job seekers are turning to generative AI tools to enhance their application materials. However, unequal access to and knowledge about generative AI tools can harm both employers and candidates by reducing the accuracy of hiring decisions and giving some candidates an unfair advantage. To address these challenges, we introduce a new variant of the strategic classification framework tailored to manipulations performed using large language models, accommodating varying levels of manipulations and stochastic outcomes. We propose a ``two-ticket'' scheme, where the hiring algorithm applies an additional manipulation to each submitted resume and considers this manipulated version together with the original submitted resume. We establish theoretical guarantees for this scheme, showing improvements for both the fairness and accuracy of hiring decisions when the true positive rate is maximized subject to a no false positives constraint. We further generalize this approach to an $n$-ticket scheme and prove that hiring outcomes converge to a fixed, group-independent decision, eliminating disparities arising from differential LLM access. Finally, we empirically validate our framework and the performance of our two-ticket scheme on real resumes using an open-source resume screening tool.</description>

      <title>When People are Floods: Analyzing Dehumanizing Metaphors in Immigration Discourse with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metaphor, discussing one concept in terms of another, is abundant in politics and can shape how people understand important issues. We develop a computational approach to measure metaphorical language, focusing on immigration discourse on social media. Grounded in qualitative social science research, we identify seven concepts evoked in immigration discourse (e.g. "water" or "vermin"). We propose and evaluate a novel technique that leverages both word-level and document-level signals to measure metaphor with respect to these concepts. We then study the relationship between metaphor, political ideology, and user engagement in 400K US tweets about immigration. While conservatives tend to use dehumanizing metaphors more than liberals, this effect varies widely across concepts. Moreover, creature-related metaphor is associated with more retweets, especially for liberal authors. Our work highlights the potential for computational methods to complement qualitative approaches in understanding subtle and implicit language in political discourse.</description>

      <title>PCB Renewal: Iterative Reuse of PCB Substrates for Sustainable Electronic Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: PCB (printed circuit board) substrates are often single-use, leading to material waste in electronics making. We introduce PCB Renewal, a novel technique that "erases" and "reconfigures" PCB traces by selectively depositing conductive epoxy onto outdated areas, transforming isolated paths into conductive planes that support new traces. We present the PCB Renewal workflow, evaluate its electrical performance and mechanical durability, and model its sustainability impact, including material usage, cost, energy consumption, and time savings. We develop a software plug-in that guides epoxy deposition, generates updated PCB profiles, and calculates resource usage. To demonstrate PCB Renewal's effectiveness and versatility, we repurpose a single PCB across four design iterations spanning three projects: a camera roller, a WiFi radio, and an ESPboy game console. We also show how an outsourced double-layer PCB can be reconfigured, transforming it from an LED watch to an interactive cat toy. The paper concludes with limitations and future directions.</description>

      <title>HumT DumT: Measuring and controlling human-like language in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Should LLMs generate language that makes them seem human? Human-like language might improve user experience, but might also lead to overreliance and stereotyping. Assessing these potential impacts requires a systematic way to measure human-like tone in LLM outputs. We introduce HumT and SocioT, metrics for human-like tone and other dimensions of social perceptions in text data based on relative probabilities from an LLM. By measuring HumT across preference and usage datasets, we find that users prefer less human-like outputs from LLMs. HumT also offers insights into the impacts of anthropomorphism: human-like LLM outputs are highly correlated with warmth, social closeness, femininity, and low status, which are closely linked to the aforementioned harms. We introduce DumT, a method using HumT to systematically control and reduce the degree of human-like tone while preserving model performance. DumT offers a practical approach for mitigating risks associated with anthropomorphic language generation.</description>

      <title>Community Notes Moderate Engagement With and Diffusion of False Information Online</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social networks scaffold the diffusion of information on social media. Much attention has been given to the spread of true vs. false content on online social platforms, including the structural differences between their diffusion patterns. However, much less is known about how platform interventions on false content alter the engagement with and diffusion of such content. In this work, we estimate the causal effects of Community Notes, a novel fact-checking feature adopted by X (formerly Twitter) to solicit and vet crowd-sourced fact-checking notes for false content. We gather detailed time series data for 40,074 posts for which notes have been proposed and use synthetic control methods to estimate a range of counterfactual outcomes. We find that attaching fact-checking notes significantly reduces the engagement with and diffusion of false content. We estimate that, on average, the notes resulted in reductions of 45.7% in reposts, 43.5% in likes, 22.9% in replies, and 14.0% in views after being attached. Over the posts' entire lifespans, these reductions amount to 11.4% fewer reposts, 13.0% fewer likes, 7.3% fewer replies, and 5.7% fewer views on average. In reducing reposts, we observe that diffusion cascades for fact-checked content are less deep, but not less broad, than synthetic control estimates for non-fact-checked content with similar reach. This structural difference contrasts notably with differences between false vs. true content diffusion itself, where false information diffuses farther, but with structural patterns that are otherwise indistinguishable from those of true information, conditional on reach.</description>

      <title>"Make the Voodoo Box Go Bleep Bloop:" Exploring End Users' Understanding and Information Needs Regarding Microchips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microchips are fundamental components of modern electronic devices, yet they remain opaque to the users who rely on them daily. This opacity, compounded by the complexity of global supply chains and the concealment of proprietary information, raises significant security, trust, and accountability issues. We investigate end users' understanding of microchips, exploring their perceptions of the societal implications and information needs regarding these essential technologies. Through an online survey with 250 participants, we found that while our participants were aware of some microchip applications, they lacked awareness of the broader security, societal, and economic implications. While our participants unanimously desired more information on microchips, their specific information needs were shaped by various factors such as the microchip's application environment and one's affinity for technology interaction. Our findings underscore the necessity for improving end users' awareness and understanding of microchips, and we provide possible directions to pursue this end.</description>

      <title>Translation in the Hands of Many:Centering Lay Users in Machine Translation Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Converging societal and technical factors have transformed language technologies into user-facing applications employed across languages. Machine Translation (MT) has become a global tool, with cross-lingual services now also supported by dialogue systems powered by multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs). This accessibility has expanded MT's reach to a vast base of lay users, often with little to no expertise in the languages or the technology itself. Despite this, the understanding of MT consumed by this diverse group of users -- their needs, experiences, and interactions with these systems -- remains limited. This paper traces the shift in MT user profiles, focusing on non-expert users and how their engagement with these systems may change with LLMs. We identify three key factors -- usability, trust, and literacy -- that shape these interactions and must be addressed to align MT with user needs. By exploring these dimensions, we offer insights to guide future MT with a user-centered approach.</description>

      <title>Through the Looking-Glass: Transparency Implications and Challenges in Enterprise AI Knowledge Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09410v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Knowledge can't be disentangled from people. As AI knowledge systems mine vast volumes of work-related data, the knowledge that's being extracted and surfaced is intrinsically linked to the people who create and use it. When predictive algorithms that learn from data are used to link knowledge and people, inaccuracies in knowledge extraction and surfacing can lead to disproportionate harms, influencing how individuals see each other and how they see themselves at work. In this paper, we present a reflective analysis of transparency requirements and impacts in this type of systems. We conduct a multidisciplinary literature review to understand the impacts of transparency in workplace settings, introducing the looking-glass metaphor to conceptualize AI knowledge systems as systems that reflect and distort, expanding our view on transparency requirements, implications and challenges. We formulate transparency as a key mediator in shaping different ways of seeing, including seeing into the system, which unveils its capabilities, limitations and behavior, and seeing through the system, which shapes workers' perceptions of their own contributions and others within the organization. Recognizing the sociotechnical nature of these systems, we identify three transparency dimensions necessary to realize the value of AI knowledge systems, namely system transparency, procedural transparency and transparency of outcomes. We discuss key challenges hindering the implementation of these forms of transparency, bringing to light the wider sociotechnical gap and highlighting directions for future Computer-supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) research.</description>

      <title>Addressing the regulatory gap: moving towards an EU AI audit ecosystem beyond the AI Act by including civil society</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07904v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The European legislature has proposed the Digital Services Act (DSA) and Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA) to regulate platforms and Artificial Intelligence (AI) products. We review to what extent third-party audits are part of both laws and how is access to information on models and the data provided. By considering the value of third-party audits and third-party data access in an audit ecosystem, we identify a regulatory gap in that the AIA does not provide access to data for researchers and civil society. Our contributions to the literature include: (1) Defining an AI audit ecosystem incorporating compliance and oversight. (2) Highlighting a regulatory gap within the DSA and AIA regulatory framework, preventing the establishment of an AI audit ecosystem that has effective oversight by civil society and academia. (3) Emphasizing that third-party audits by research and civil society must be part of that ecosystem, we call for AIA amendments and delegated acts to include data and model access for certain AI products. Furthermore, we call for the DSA to provide NGOs and investigative journalists with data access to platforms by delegated acts and for adaptions and amendments of the AIA to provide third-party audits and data and model access, at least for high-risk systems. Regulations modeled after EU AI regulations should enable data access and third-party audits, fostering an AI audit ecosystem that promotes compliance and oversight mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Tutors for Adult Learners: An Analysis of Needs and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04477v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work examines the sociotechnical factors that influence the adoption and usage of intelligent tutoring systems in self-directed learning contexts, focusing specifically on adult learners. The study is divided into two parts. First, we present Apprentice Tutors, a novel intelligent tutoring system designed to address the unique needs of adult learners. The platform includes adaptive problem selection, real-time feedback, and visual dashboards to support learning in college algebra topics. Second, we investigate the specific needs and experiences of adult users through a deployment study and a series of focus groups. Using thematic analysis, we identify key challenges and opportunities to improve tutor design and adoption. Based on these findings, we offer actionable design recommendations to help developers create intelligent tutoring systems that better align with the motivations and learning preferences of adult learners. This work contributes to a wider understanding of how to improve educational technologies to support lifelong learning and professional development.</description>

      <title>Auditing the Fairness of the US COVID-19 Forecast Hub's Case Prediction Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The US COVID-19 Forecast Hub, a repository of COVID-19 forecasts from over 50 independent research groups, is used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for their official COVID-19 communications. As such, the Forecast Hub is a critical centralized resource to promote transparent decision making. While the Forecast Hub has provided valuable predictions focused on accuracy, there is an opportunity to evaluate model performance across social determinants such as race and urbanization level that have been known to play a role in the COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper, we carry out a comprehensive fairness analysis of the Forecast Hub model predictions and we show statistically significant diverse predictive performance across social determinants, with minority racial and ethnic groups as well as less urbanized areas often associated with higher prediction errors. We hope this work will encourage COVID-19 modelers and the CDC to report fairness metrics together with accuracy, and to reflect on the potential harms of the models on specific social groups and contexts.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of selecting $k$ seed nodes in a network to maximize the minimum probability of activation under an independent cascade beginning at these seeds. The motivation is to promote fairness by ensuring that even the least advantaged members of the network have good access to information. Our problem can be viewed as a variant of the classic influence maximization objective, but it appears somewhat more difficult to solve: only heuristics are known. Moreover, the scalability of these methods is sharply constrained by the need to repeatedly estimate access probabilities.
  We design and evaluate a suite of $10$ new scalable algorithms which crucially do not require probability estimation. To facilitate comparison with the state-of-the-art, we make three more contributions which may be of broader interest. We introduce a principled method of selecting a pairwise information transmission parameter used in experimental evaluations, as well as a new performance metric which allows for comparison of algorithms across a range of values for the parameter $k$. Finally, we provide a new benchmark corpus of $174$ networks drawn from $6$ domains. Our algorithms retain most of the performance of the state-of-the-art while reducing running time by orders of magnitude. Specifically, a meta-learner approach is on average only $20\%$ less effective than the state-of-the-art on held-out data, but about $75-130$ times faster. Further, the meta-learner's performance exceeds the state-of the-art on about $20\%$ of networks, and the magnitude of its running time advantage is maintained on much larger networks.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Data Provenance Gap Across Text, Speech and Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Progress in AI is driven largely by the scale and quality of training data. Despite this, there is a deficit of empirical analysis examining the attributes of well-established datasets beyond text. In this work we conduct the largest and first-of-its-kind longitudinal audit across modalities--popular text, speech, and video datasets--from their detailed sourcing trends and use restrictions to their geographical and linguistic representation. Our manual analysis covers nearly 4000 public datasets between 1990-2024, spanning 608 languages, 798 sources, 659 organizations, and 67 countries. We find that multimodal machine learning applications have overwhelmingly turned to web-crawled, synthetic, and social media platforms, such as YouTube, for their training sets, eclipsing all other sources since 2019. Secondly, tracing the chain of dataset derivations we find that while less than 33% of datasets are restrictively licensed, over 80% of the source content in widely-used text, speech, and video datasets, carry non-commercial restrictions. Finally, counter to the rising number of languages and geographies represented in public AI training datasets, our audit demonstrates measures of relative geographical and multilingual representation have failed to significantly improve their coverage since 2013. We believe the breadth of our audit enables us to empirically examine trends in data sourcing, restrictions, and Western-centricity at an ecosystem-level, and that visibility into these questions are essential to progress in responsible AI. As a contribution to ongoing improvements in dataset transparency and responsible use, we release our entire multimodal audit, allowing practitioners to trace data provenance across text, speech, and video.</description>

      <title>Utility Engineering: Analyzing and Controlling Emergent Value Systems in AIs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08640v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As AIs rapidly advance and become more agentic, the risk they pose is governed not only by their capabilities but increasingly by their propensities, including goals and values. Tracking the emergence of goals and values has proven a longstanding problem, and despite much interest over the years it remains unclear whether current AIs have meaningful values. We propose a solution to this problem, leveraging the framework of utility functions to study the internal coherence of AI preferences. Surprisingly, we find that independently-sampled preferences in current LLMs exhibit high degrees of structural coherence, and moreover that this emerges with scale. These findings suggest that value systems emerge in LLMs in a meaningful sense, a finding with broad implications. To study these emergent value systems, we propose utility engineering as a research agenda, comprising both the analysis and control of AI utilities. We uncover problematic and often shocking values in LLM assistants despite existing control measures. These include cases where AIs value themselves over humans and are anti-aligned with specific individuals. To constrain these emergent value systems, we propose methods of utility control. As a case study, we show how aligning utilities with a citizen assembly reduces political biases and generalizes to new scenarios. Whether we like it or not, value systems have already emerged in AIs, and much work remains to fully understand and control these emergent representations.</description>
