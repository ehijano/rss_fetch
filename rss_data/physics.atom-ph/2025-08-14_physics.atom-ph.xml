      <title>Attosecond Transient Absorption Study of Coherent Hole Oscillation in Ar+</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the observation, characterization, and control of the electron dynamics in ionized argon atoms. We utilized an intense mid-infrared (MIR) pulse to create a coherent superposition of the spin-orbit split ground state of the ion. A weak extreme ultraviolet (XUV) pulse then probes the hole oscillation through time-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy. We investigated several 3p to nd transitions accessible with our XUV high harmonics which show a 23fs beat corresponding to the energy separation between the initially populated states. The experimental attosecond transient absorption signals for different pathways were simulated using detailed TDSE simulations and perturbative analytic calculations. The analysis of phase relations between the oscillations reveals important information about transition dipole moments in the system. In addition, we employed another strong MIR pulse to achieve transient control over the absorption by inducing Stark shifts of the states without affecting the electronic coherences.</description>

      <title>Cumulative Fidelity of LMT Clock Atom Interferometers in the Presence of Laser Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clock atom interferometry is an emerging technique in precision measurements that is particularly well suited for sensitivity enhancement through large momentum transfer (LMT). While current systems have demonstrated momentum separations of several hundreds of photon momenta, next-generation quantum sensors are targeting an LMT enhancement factor beyond $10^4$. However, the viability of LMT clock interferometers has recently come into question due to the potential impact of laser frequency noise. Here, we resolve this concern by analyzing the cumulative fidelity of sequential state inversions in an LMT atom interferometer. We show that the population error from $n$ pulses applied from alternating directions scales linearly with $n$. This is a significant advantage over the $n^2$ scaling that occurs when probing a two-level system $n$ times from the same direction. We further show that contributions to the interferometer signal from parasitic paths generated by imperfect pulses are negligible, for any loss mechanism. These results establish that laser frequency noise is not a practical limitation for the development of high-fidelity LMT clock atom interferometers.</description>

      <title>Visualizing intense laser field driven electron dynamics in a multielectron molecule: dynamic electron localization, bonding properties and multiple ionization bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents results and discussion of electron dynamics in molecules in which intense ultrafast pulse drives multiphoton ionization, high harmonic generation, and charge resonance due to the Rabbi flopping in the regime of Charge Resonance Enhanced Ionization (CREI) for the ground state molecular nitrogen cation. We show how ionization rates oscillate with oscillations of envelope reflecting modulation of the population of the excited molecular orbital. We observe the increase in ionization due to mechanisms analogous to Charge Resonance Enhanced Ionization (CREI) and also uncover also the time periods of suppressed ionization. Electronic flux calculations illustrate these changes and help reveal multiple ionization bursts which are for the first time reported for a multielectron non-stretched/ non-dissociating molecule. Furthermore, we discuss the effects of ultrafast intense laser pulses on the bonding properties of a nitrogen molecular ion in these conditions through detailed analysis of electron density and electron density differences, time-dependent average local energy, and time-dependent electron localization function. We illustrate the main characteristics of changes of the electron density that leads to laser induced dynamics of bonding and how the standard criteria lead to the transient properties of double, triple, and lone pair bonding characteristics.</description>

      <title>Light Storage and Retrieval in an Atomic Tripod System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Highly-efficient quantum memories are essential for advancing quantum information processing technologies, including scalable quantum computing and quantum networks. We experimentally demonstrate a light storage and retrieval protocol in a tripod system using an ensemble of laser-cooled $^{87}$Rb atoms. The tripod system, which consists of three ground states and an excited state, offers rich dynamics: its use to coherently store and retrieve a weak probe pulse in the $^{87}$Rb $F=1$ ground state manifold leads to the interference of two spin-wave excitations during storage time that translate to an interference in the peak intensity of the retrieved probe pulse. Our work shows that these interferences, which manifest when varying the pulse sequence or energy level structure, can be controlled experimentally by varying the storage time, optical phase, and magnetic field strength. Theoretical simulations exhibit excellent agreement with the experimental results. This work demonstrates the rich dynamics and versatile capabilities of atomic tripod systems for light storage and retrieval, with key advantages over conventional $\Lambda$-systems, highlighting the potential of atomic tripod systems for applications in quantum information processing, quantum synchronization, and atomic memory protocols.</description>

      <title>Programmable few-atom Bragg scattering and ground-state cooling in a cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By integrating tweezer arrays with a high-cooperativity ring cavity with chiral atom-cavity coupling, we demonstrate highly directional Bragg scattering from a programmable number of atoms. Through accurate control of the interatomic distance, we observe a narrowing-down of the Bragg peak as we increase the atom number one by one. The observed high-contrast Bragg interference is enabled by cavity sideband cooling of both the radial and axial motions to near the ground state with phonon occupation numbers below 0.17 and 3.4, respectively. This new platform that integrates strong and controlled atom-light coupling into atomic arrays enables applications from programmable quantum optics to quantum metrology and computation.</description>

      <title>Oscillating nuclear charge radii as sensors for ultralight dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.10784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that coupling of ultralight dark matter (UDM) to quarks and gluons would lead to an oscillation of the nuclear charge radius for both the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) axion and scalar dark matter. Consequently, the resulting oscillation of electronic energy levels could be resolved with optical atomic clocks, and their comparisons can be used to investigate UDM-nuclear couplings, which were previously only accessible with other platforms. We demonstrate this idea using the ${}^2S_{1/2} (F=0)\leftrightarrow {}^2F_{7/2} (F=3)$ electric octupole and ${}^2S_{1/2} (F=0)\leftrightarrow \,{}^2D_{3/2} (F=2)$ electric quadrupole transitions in ${}^{171}Yb^+$. Based on the derived sensitivity coefficients for these two transitions and a long-term comparison of their frequencies using a single trapped ${}^{171}Yb^+$ ion, we find bounds on the scalar UDM-nuclear couplings and the QCD axion decay constant. These results are at a similar level compared to the tightest spectroscopic limits, and future investigations, also with other optical clocks, promise significant improvements.</description>

      <title>Open system dynamics from fundamental Lagrangian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lagrangians can differ by a total derivative without altering the equations of motion, thus encoding the same physics. This is in general true both classically and quantum mechanically. We show, however, that in the context of open quantum systems, two Lagrangians that differ by a total derivative can lead to different physical predictions. We then discuss the criterion that allows one to choose between such Lagrangians. Further, starting from the appropriate QED Lagrangian, we derive the master equation for the non-relativistic electron interacting with thermal photons upto second order in the interactions. This case study lends further phenomenological support to our proposed criterion.</description>
