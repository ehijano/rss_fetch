      <title>Stability of non-diagonal Einstein metrics on homogeneous spaces $H\times H/ \Delta K$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the homogeneous space $M=H\times H/\Delta K$, where $H/K$ is an irreducible symmetric space and $\Delta K$ denotes diagonal embedding. Recently, Lauret and Will provided a complete classification of $H\times H$-invariant Einstein metrics on M. They obtained that there is always at least one non-diagonal Einstein metric on $M$, and in some cases, diagonal Einstein metrics also exist. We give a formula for the scalar curvature of a subset of $H\times H$-invariant metrics and study the stability of non-diagonal Einstein metrics on $M$ with respect to the Hilbert action, obtaining that these metrics are unstable with different coindexes for all homogeneous spaces $M$.</description>

      <title>Foundations on k-contact geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: k-Contact geometry appeared as a generalisation of contact geometry to analyse field theories. This work provides a new insightful approach to k-contact geometry by devising a theory of k-contact forms and proving that the kernel of a k-contact form is locally equivalent to a distribution of corank k that is distributionally maximally non-integrable and admits k commuting Lie symmetries: a so-called k-contact distribution. Compact manifolds admitting a global k-contact form are analysed, we give necessary topological conditions for their existence, k-contact Lie groups are defined and studied, we extend the Weinstein conjecture for the existence of closed orbits of Reeb vector fields in compact manifolds to the k-contact setting after studying compact low-dimensional manifolds endowed with a global k-contact form, and we provide some physical applications of some of our results. Polarisations for k-contact distributions are introduced and it is shown that a polarised k-contact distribution is locally diffeomorphic to the Cartan distribution of the first-order jet bundle over a fibre bundle of order k, which is a globally defined polarised k-contact distribution. Then, we relate k-contact manifolds to presymplectic and k-symplectic manifolds on fibre bundles of larger dimension and define for the first time types of submanifolds in k-contact geometry. We also review the theory of Hamiltonian k-vector fields, studying Hamilton-De Donder-Weyl equations in general and in Lie groups, which are here studied in an unprecedented manner. A theory of k-contact Hamiltonian vector fields is developed, which describes the theory of characteristics for Lie symmetries for first-order partial differential equations in a k-contact Hamiltonian manner. Our new Hamiltonian k-contact techniques are illustrated by analysing Hamilton-Jacobi and Dirac equations.</description>

      <title>Surfaces in Robertson-Walker Space-Times with Positive Relative Nullity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study space-like and time-like surfaces in a Robertson-Walker space-time,, denoted by $L^4_1(f,c)$, having positive relative nullity. First, we give the necessary and sufficient conditions for such space-like and time-like surfaces in $L^4_1(f,c)$. Then, we obtain the local classification theorems for space-like and time-like surfaces in $L^4_1(f,0)$ with positive relative nullity. Finally, we consider the space-like and time-like surfaces in $\mathbb{E}^1_1\times\mathbb{S}^3$ and $\mathbb{E}^1_1\times\mathbb{H}^3$ with positive relative nullity. These are the special spaces of $L^4_1(f,c)$ when the warping function $f$ is a constant function, with $c=1$ for $\mathbb{E}^1_1\times\mathbb{S}^3$ and $c=-1$ for $\mathbb{E}^1_1\times\mathbb{H}^3$.</description>

      <title>Killing (super)algebras associated to connections on spinors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalise the notion of a Killing superalgebra which arises in the physics literature on supergravity to general dimension, signature and choice of spinor module and squaring map, and also allowing for Lie algebras as well as superalgebras, capturing a set of examples of such algebras on higher-dimensional spheres. We demonstrate that the definition requires a connection on a spinor bundle -- provided by supersymmetry transformations in the supergravity examples and by the Killing spinor equation on the spheres -- and obtain a set of sufficient conditions on such a connection for the Killing (super)algebra to exist. We show that these (super)algebras are filtered deformations of graded subalgebras of (a generalisation of) the Poincar\'e superalgebra and then study such deformations abstractly using Spencer cohomology. In the highly supersymmetric Lorentzian case, we describe the filtered subdeformations which are of the appropriate form to arise as Killing superalgebras, lay out a classification scheme for their odd-generated subalgebras and prove that, under certain technical conditions, there exist homogeneous Lorentzian spin manifolds on which these deformations are realised as Killing superalgebras. Our results generalise previous work in the 11-dimensional supergravity literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide new examples of sub-Riemannian manifolds with boundary equipped with a smooth measure that satisfy the $\mathsf{RCD}(K , N)$ condition. They are constructed by equipping the half-plane, the hemisphere and the hyperbolic half-plane with a two-dimensional almost-Riemannian structure and a measure that vanishes on their boundary. The construction of these spaces is inspired from the geometry of the $\alpha$-Grushin plane.</description>

      <title>Principal binets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conjugate line parametrizations of surfaces were first discretized almost a century ago as quad meshes with planar faces. With the recent development of discrete differential geometry, two discretizations of principal curvature line parametrizations were discovered: circular nets and conical nets, both of which are special cases of discrete conjugate nets. Subsequently, circular and conical nets were given a unified description as isotropic line congruences in the Lie quadric. We propose a generalization by considering polar pairs of line congruences in the ambient space of the Lie quadric. These correspond to pairs of discrete conjugate nets with orthogonal edges, which we call principal binets, a new and more general discretization of principal curvature line parametrizations. We also introduce two new discretizations of orthogonal and Gauss-orthogonal parametrizations. All our discretizations are subject to the transformation group principle, which means that they satisfy the corresponding Lie, M\"obius, or Laguerre invariance respectively, in analogy to the smooth theory. Finally, we show that they satisfy the consistency principle, which means that our definitions generalize to higher dimensional square lattices. Our work expands on recent work by Dellinger on checkerboard patterns.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2011.01633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish {\L}ojasiewicz inequalities for a class of cylindrical self-shrinkers for the mean curvature flow, which includes round cylinders and cylinders over Abresch-Langer curves, in any codimension. We deduce the uniqueness of blowups at singularities modelled on this class of cylinders, and that any such cylinder is isolated in the space of self-shrinkers. The Abresch-Langer case answers a conjecture of Colding-Minicozzi. Our proof uses direct perturbative analysis of the shrinker mean curvature, so it is new even for round cylinders.</description>

      <title>Fano 3-folds and classification of constantly curved holomorphic $2$-spheres of degree $6$ in the complex Grassmannian $G(2,5)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.08525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Up to now the only known constantly curved sextic curve, i.e., holomorphic 2-sphere of degree 6, in the complex $G(2,5)$ has been the first associated curve of the Veronese curve of degree 4, which indicates that such curves are rare to find. Exploring the rich interplay between the ramification of harmonic sequences in differential geometry and algebro-geometric properties of projectively equivalent Fano 3-folds of index 2 and degree 5, we invoke the moduli space structure of sextic curves in the Fano 3-fold often referred to as $V_5$ to confirm the rarity of constancy of curvature, by establishing that the harmonic sequence of a generic sextic curve in $G(2, 5)$ is totally unramified. This paper proposes to investigate from the Galois viewpoint the way ramification can appear in relation to the constancy of curvature among nongeneric sextic curves in $G(2, 5)$. We prove through elaborate $PSL_2$-transvectant and engaged unitary analyses that, up to the ambient unitary equivalence, the moduli space of constantly curved sextic curves in $G(2,5)$ that are $GL(5,{\mathbb C})$-equivalent to those in $V_5$ ramified at the $PSL_2$-invariant 1-dimensional singular locus somewhere, is semialgebraic of dimension 2 all members of which barring the above Veronese curve are nonhomogeneous. Many explicit examples can be constructed.</description>

      <title>Cohomogeneity one solitons for the isometric flow of $G_2$-structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the existence of cohomogeneity one solitons for the isometric flow of $G_2$-structures on the following classes of torsion-free $G_2$-manifolds: the Euclidean $R^7$ with its standard $G_2$-structure, metric cylinders over Calabi-Yau 3-folds, metric cones over nearly K\"ahler 6-manifolds, and the Bryant-Salamon $G_2$-manifolds. In all cases we establish existence of global solutions to the isometric soliton equations, and determine the asymptotic behaviour of the torsion. In particular, existence of shrinking isometric solitons on $R^7$ is proved, giving support to the likely existence of type I singularities for the isometric flow. In each case, the study of the soliton equation reduces to a particular nonlinear ODE with a regular singular point, for which we provide a careful analysis. Finally, to simplify the derivation of the relevant equations in each case, we first establish several useful Riemannian geometric formulas for a general class of cohomogeneity one metrics on total spaces of vector bundles which should have much wider application, as such metrics arise often as explicit examples of special holonomy metrics.</description>

Abstract: In [5], Connes and Chamseddine defined a cycle in the general framework of noncommutative geometry. They computed this cycle for the Dirac operator on 4-dimensioanl manifolds. We propose a way to study the Connes-Chamseddine cycle from the viewpoint of the noncommutative integral on 6-dimensional manifolds in this paper. Furthermore, we compute several interesting noncommutative integral defined in [8] by the normal coodinated way on n-dimensional manifolds. As a corollary, the Connes-Chamseddine cycle on 6-dimensional manifolds is obtained.</description>

      <title>Positive scalar curvature with point singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that in every dimension $n \geq 8$, there exists a smooth closed manifold $M^n$ which does not admit a smooth positive scalar curvature ("psc") metric, but $M$ admits an $\mathrm{L}^\infty$-metric which is smooth and has psc outside a singular set of codimension $\geq 8$. This provides counterexamples to a conjecture of Schoen. In fact, there are such examples of arbitrarily high dimension with only single point singularities. We also discuss related phenomena on exotic spheres and tori. In addition, we provide examples of $\mathrm{L}^\infty$-metrics on $\mathbb{R}^n$ for certain $n \geq 8$ which are smooth and have psc outside the origin, but cannot be smoothly approximated away from the origin by everywhere smooth Riemannian metrics of non-negative scalar curvature. This stands in precise contrast to established smoothing results via Ricci-DeTurck flow for singular metrics with stronger regularity assumptions. Finally, as a positive result, we describe a $\mathrm{KO}$-theoretic condition which obstructs the existence of $\mathrm{L}^\infty$-metrics that are smooth and of psc outside a finite subset. This shows that closed enlargeable spin manifolds do not carry such metrics.</description>

      <title>Local descriptions of the heterotic SU(3) moduli space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The heterotic $SU(3)$ system, also known as the Hull--Strominger system, arises from compactifications of heterotic string theory to six dimensions. This paper investigates the local structure of the moduli space of solutions to this system on a compact 6-manifold $X$, using a vector bundle $Q=(T^{1,0}X)^* \oplus {End}(E) \oplus T^{1,0}X$, where $E\to X$ is the classical gauge bundle arising in the system. We establish that the moduli space has an expected dimension of zero. We achieve this by studying the deformation complex associated to a differential operator $\bar{D}$, which emulates a holomorphic structure on $Q$, and demonstrating an isomorphism between the two cohomology groups which govern the infinitesimal deformations and obstructions in the deformation theory for the system. We also provide a Dolbeault-type theorem linking these cohomology groups to \v{C}ech cohomology, a result which might be of independent interest, as well as potentially valuable for future research.</description>

Abstract: The Poincar\'e-Hopf Theorem relates the Euler characteristic of a 2-dimensional compact manifold to the local behavior of smooth vector fields defined on it. However, despite the importance of Filippov vector fields, concerning both their theoretical and applied aspects, until now, it was not known whether this theorem extends to Filippov vector fields. In this paper, we demonstrate that the Poincar\'e-Hopf Theorem applies to Filippov vector fields defined on 2-dimensional compact manifolds with smooth switching manifolds. As a result, we establish a variant of the Hairy Ball Theorem, asserting that "any Filippov vector field on a sphere with smooth switching manifolds must have at least one singularity (in the Filippov sense) with positive index". This extension is achieved by introducing a new index definition that includes the singularities of Filippov vector fields, such as pseudo-equilibria and tangential singularities. Our work extends the classical index definition for singularities of smooth vector fields to encompass those of Filippov vector fields with smooth switching manifolds. This extension is based on an invariance property under a regularization process, allowing us to establish all classical index properties. We also compute the indices of all generic $\Sigma$-singularities and some codimension-1 $\Sigma$-singularities, including fold-fold tangential singularities, regular-cusp tangential singularities, and saddle-node pseudo-equilibria.</description>

Abstract: We consider capillarity functionals which measure the perimeter of sets contained in a Euclidean half-space assigning a constant weight $\lambda \in (-1,1)$ to the portion of the boundary that touches the boundary of the half-space. Depending on $\lambda$, sets that minimize this capillarity perimeter among those with fixed volume are known to be suitable truncated balls lying on the boundary of the half-space.
  We first give a new proof based on an ABP-type technique of the sharp isoperimetric inequality for this class of capillarity problems. Next we prove two quantitative versions of the inequality: a first sharp inequality estimates the Fraenkel asymmetry of a competitor with respect to the optimal bubbles in terms of the energy deficit; a second inequality estimates a notion of asymmetry for the part of the boundary of a competitor that touches the boundary of the half-space in terms of the energy deficit.
  After a symmetrization procedure, the quantitative inequalities follow from a novel combination of a quantitative ABP method with a selection-type argument.</description>
