      <title>Interlacing of zeros from different sequences of Meixner-Pollaczek, Pseudo-Jacobi and Continuous Hahn polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider interlacing of the zeros of polynomials from different sequences $\{p_n\}$ and $\{g_n\}$. In our main result we consider a mixed recurrence equation necessary for existence of a linear term $(x-A)$ so that the $(n+1)$ zeros of $(x-A)g_n(x)$ interlace with the $n$ zeros of $p_n$. We apply our result to Meixner-Pollaczek, Pseudo-Jacobi and Continuous Hahn polynomials to obtain new interlacing results for the zeros of polynomials of the same degree from different polynomial sequences.</description>

      <title>Bilinear singular integral operators with kernels in weighted spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study boundedness properties of one-dimensional bilinear singular integral operators with homogeneous kernels whose restriction $\Omega$ to the unit sphere $\mathbb S^1$ has vanishing integral and belongs to $L^q(\mathbb S^1)$ for some $q&gt;1$. Under the additional assumption that $\Omega$ is supported away from certain degenerate points, we establish the full quasi-Banach range of $L^{p_1}(\mathbb R) \times L^{p_2}(\mathbb R) \rightarrow L^p(\mathbb R)$ bounds, corresponding to any $1&lt;p_1,p_2&lt;\infty$, $1/2&lt;p&lt;\infty$ satisfying $1/p_1+1/p_2=1/p$. In fact, a more general result is obtained by dropping the support condition on $\Omega$ and requiring that $\Omega\in L^q(\mathbb S^1,u^q)$, where $u(\theta_1,\theta_2)=|\theta_1-\theta_2|^{\min\{2-\frac{1}{p}-\frac{1}{q}-\varepsilon,0\}}$ for some $\varepsilon&gt;0$ and for any $(\theta_1,\theta_2)\in \mathbb S^1$. In addition, we provide counterexamples that show the failure of the $n$-dimensional version of our result when $n\geq 2$, as well as the failure of its $m$-linear variant in dimension one when $m\geq 3$.</description>

      <title>Equality and comparison of generalized quasiarithmetic means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to extend the definition of quasiarithmetic means by taking a strictly monotone generating function instead of a strictly monotone and continuous one. We establish the properties of such means and compare them to the analogous properties of standard quasiarithmetic means. The comparability and equality problems of generalized quasiarithmetic are also solved. We also provide an example of a mean which, depending on the underlying interval or on the number of variables, could be or could not be represented as a generalized quasiarithmetic mean.</description>

      <title>Complex binomial theorem and pentagon identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider different pentagon identities realized by the hyperbolic hypergeometric functions and investigate their degenerations to the level of complex hypergeometric functions. In particular, we show that one of the degenerations yields the complex binomial theorem which coincides with the Fourier transformation of the complex analogue of the Euler beta integral. At the bottom we obtain a Fourier transformation formula for the complex gamma function. This is done with the help of a new type of the limit $\omega_1+\omega_2\to 0$ (or $b\to \textrm{i}$ in two-dimensional conformal field theory) applied to the hyperbolic hypergeometric integrals.</description>

      <title>Estimates for strongly singular operators along curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a proper function $f$ on the plane, we study the operator \[ Tf(x,y) = \lim_{\varepsilon\to 0} \int_\varepsilon^1 f(x-t,y-t^k) \frac{e^{2\pi i \gamma(t)}}{\psi(t)} dt, \] where $k\ge1$ and $\psi$ and $\gamma$ are functions defined near the origin such that $\psi(t)\to 0$ and $|\gamma(t)|\to\infty$ as $t\to 0$. We give sufficient regularity and growth conditions on $\psi$ and $\gamma$ for its multiplier to be a bounded function, and thus for the operator to be bounded on $L^2(\mathbb R^2)$. We consider an extension to $L^p(\mathbb R^2)$, for certain $p's$.</description>

      <title>Pointwise ergodic theorems along fractional powers of primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish pointwise convergence for nonconventional ergodic averages taken along $\lfloor p^c\rfloor$, where $p$ is a prime number and $c\in(1,4/3)$ on $L^r$, $r\in(1,\infty)$. In fact, we consider averages along more general sequences $\lfloor h(p)\rfloor$, where $h$ belongs in a wide class of functions, the so-called $c$-regularly varying functions. We also establish uniform multiparameter oscillation estimates for our ergodic averages and the corresponding multiparameter pointwise ergodic theorem in the spirit of Dunford and Zygmund. A key ingredient of our approach are certain exponential sum estimates, which we also use for establishing a Waring-type result. Assuming that the Riemann zeta function has any zero-free strip upgrades our exponential sum estimates to polynomially saving ones and this makes a conditional result regarding the behavior of our ergodic averages on $L^1$ to not seem entirely out of reach.</description>

      <title>Existence and Uniqueness of Domain Walls for Notched Ferromagnetic Nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate a simple model of notched ferromagnetic nanowires using tools from calculus of variations and critical point theory. Specifically, we focus on the case of a single unimodal notch and establish the existence and uniqueness of the critical point of the energy. This is achieved through a lifting argument, which reduces the problem to a generalized Sturm-Liouville equation. Uniqueness is demonstrated via a Mountain-Pass argument, where the assumption of two distinct critical points leads to a contradiction. Additionally, we show that the solution corresponds to a system of magnetic spins characterized by a single domain wall localized in the vicinity of the notch. We further analyze the asymptotic decay of the solution at infinity and explore the symmetric case using rearrangement techniques.</description>

      <title>Bounds on energy and potentials of discrete measures on the sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish upper and lower universal bounds for potentials of weighted designs on the sphere $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ that depend only on quadrature nodes and weights derived from the design structure. Our bounds hold for a large class of potentials that includes absolutely monotone functions. The classes of spherical designs attaining these bounds are characterized. Additionally, we study the problem of constrained energy minimization for Borel probability measures on $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ and apply it to optimal distribution of charge supported at a given number of points on the sphere. In particular, our results apply to $p$-frame energy.</description>

      <title>Lower Bounds for Admissible Values of the Travelling Wave Speed in Asymmetrically Supported Beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the admissible values of the wave speed $c$ for which the beam equation with jumping nonlinearity possesses a travelling wave solution. In contrast to previously studied problems modelling suspension bridges, the presence of the term with negative part of the solution in the equation results in restrictions of $c$. In this paper, we provide the maximal wave speed range for which the existence of the travelling wave solution can be proved using the Mountain Pass Theorem. We also introduce its close connection with related Dirichlet problems and their Fu\v{c}\'{i}k spectra. Moreover, we present several analytical approximations of the main existence result with assumptions that are easy to verify. Finally, we formulate a conjecture that the infimum of the admissible wave speed range can be described by the Fu\v{c}\'{i}k spectrum of a simple periodic problem.</description>

      <title>Non-symmetric Jacobi polynomials of type $BC_{1}$ as vector-valued polynomials Part 1: spherical functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study non-symmetric Jacobi polynomials of type $BC_{1}$ by means of vector-valued and matrix-valued orthogonal polynomials. The interpretation as matrix-valued orthogonal polynomials yields a new expression of the non-symmetric Jacobi polynomials of type $BC_1$ in terms of the symmetric Jacobi polynomials of type $BC_{1}$. In this interpretation, the Cherednik operator, that has the non-symmetric Jacobi polynomials as eigenfunctions, corresponds to two shift operators for the symmetric Jacobi polynomials of type $BC_{1}$.
  We show that the non-symmetric Jacobi polynomials of type $BC_{1}$ with so-called geometric root multiplicities, interpreted as vector-valued polynomials, can be identified with spherical functions on the sphere $S^{2m+1}=\mathrm{Spin}(2m+2)/\mathrm{Spin}(2m+1)$ associated with the fundamental spin-representation of $\mathrm{Spin}(2m+1)$. The Cherednik operator corresponds to the Dirac operator for the spinors on $S^{2m+1}$ in this interpretation.</description>

      <title>Summing divergent matrix series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend several celebrated methods in classical analysis for summing series of complex numbers to series of complex matrices. These include the summation methods of Abel, Borel, Ces\'aro, Euler, Lambert, N\"orlund, and Mittag-Leffler, which are frequently used to sum scalar series that are divergent in the conventional sense. One feature of our matrix extensions is that they are fully noncommutative generalizations of their scalar counterparts -- not only is the scalar series replaced by a matrix series, positive weights are replaced by positive definite matrix weights, order on $\mathbb{R}$ replaced by Loewner order, exponential function replaced by matrix exponential function, etc. We will establish the regularity of our matrix summation methods, i.e., when applied to a matrix series convergent in the conventional sense, we obtain the same value for the sum. Our second goal is to provide numerical algorithms that work in conjunction with these summation methods. We discuss how the block and mixed-block summation algorithms, the Kahan compensated summation algorithm, may be applied to matrix sums with similar roundoff error bounds. These summation methods and algorithms apply not only to power or Taylor series of matrices but to any general matrix series including matrix Fourier and Dirichlet series. We will demonstrate the utility of these summation methods: establishing a Fej\'{e}r's theorem and alleviating the Gibbs phenomenon for matrix Fourier series; extending the domains of matrix functions and accurately evaluating them; enhancing the matrix Pad\'e approximation and Schur--Parlett algorithms; and more.</description>

      <title>The multilinear circle method and a question of Bergelson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $k\in \mathbb Z_+$ and $(X, \mathcal B(X), \mu)$ be a probability space equipped with a family of commuting invertible measure-preserving transformations $T_1,\ldots, T_k \colon X\to X$. Let $P_1,\ldots, P_k\in\mathbb Z[\rm n]$ be polynomials with integer coefficients and distinct degrees. We establish pointwise almost everywhere convergence of the multilinear polynomial ergodic averages \[A_{N; X, T_1,\ldots, T_k}^{P_1,\ldots, P_k}(f_1,\ldots, f_k)(x) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^Nf_1\big(T_1^{P_1(n)}x\big)\cdots f_k\big(T_k^{P_k(n)}x\big), \qquad x\in X, \]
  as $N\to\infty$ for any functions $f_1, \ldots, f_k\in L^{\infty}(X)$. Besides a couple of results in the bilinear setting (when $k=2$ and then only for single transformations), this is the first pointwise result for general polynomial multilinear ergodic averages in arbitrary measure-preserving systems. This answers a question of Bergelson from 1996 in the affirmative for any polynomials with distinct degrees, and makes progress on the Furstenberg-Bergelson-Leibman conjecture.
  In this paper, we build a versatile multilinear circle method by developing the Ionescu-Wainger multiplier theorem for the set of canonical fractions, which gives a positive answer to a question of Ionescu and Wainger from 2005. We also establish sharp multilinear $L^p$-improving bounds and an inverse theorem in higher order Fourier analysis for averages over polynomial corner configurations, which we use to establish a multilinear analogue of Weyl's inequality and its real counterpart, a Sobolev smoothing inequality.</description>
