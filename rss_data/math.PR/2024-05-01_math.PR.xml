      <title>Imprecise Markov Semigroups and their Ergodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of imprecise Markov semigroup. It allows us to see Markov chains and processes with imprecise transition probabilities as (a collection of diffusion) operators, and thus to unlock techniques from geometry, functional analysis, and (high dimensional) probability to study their ergodic behavior. We show that, if the initial distribution of an imprecise Markov semigroup is known and invariant, under some conditions that also involve the geometry of the state space, eventually the ambiguity around the transition probability fades. We call this property ergodicity of the imprecise Markov semigroup, and we relate it to the classical (Birkhoff's) notion of ergodicity. We prove ergodicity both when the state space is Euclidean or a Riemannian manifold, and when it is an arbitrary measurable space. The importance of our findings for the fields of machine learning and computer vision is also discussed.</description>

      <title>The directed landscape from Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define an almost sure bijection which constructs the directed landscape from a sequence of infinitely many independent Brownian motions. This is the analogue of the RSK correspondence in this setting. The Brownian motions arise as a marginal of the extended Busemann process for the directed landscape, and the inverse map gives an explicit and natural coupling where Brownian last passage percolation converges in probability to the directed landscape. We use this map to prove that the directed landscape on a strip can be reconstructed from the Airy line ensemble. Along the way, we describe two more new versions of RSK in the semi-discrete setting, build a general theory of sorting via Pitman operators, and construct extended Busemann processes for the directed landscape and Brownian last passage percolation.</description>

      <title>Competing bootstrap processes on the random graph $G(n,p)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a generalization of classic bootstrap percolation in which two competing processes concurrently evolve on the same graph $G(n,p)$. Nodes can be in one of three states, conveniently represented by different colors: red, black and white. Initially, a given number $a_R$ of active red nodes (red seeds) are selected uniformly at random among the $n$ nodes. Similarly, a given number $a_B$ of active black nodes (black seeds) are selected uniformly at random among the other $n-a_R$ nodes. All remaining nodes are initially white (inactive). White nodes wake up at times dictated by independent Poisson clocks of rate 1. When a white node wakes up, it checks the state of its neighbors: if the number of red (black) neighbors exceeds the number of black (red) neighbors by a fixed amount $r \geq 2$, the node becomes an active red (black) node, and remains so forever. The parameters of the model are, besides $r$ (fixed) and $n$ (tending to $\infty$), the numbers $a_R$ ($a_B$) of initial red (black) seeds, and the edge existence probability $p=p(n)$. We study the size $A^*_R$ ($A^*_B$) of the final set of active red (black) nodes, identifying different regimes which are analyzed under suitable time-scales, allowing us to obtain detailed (asymptotic) temporal dynamics of the two concurrent activation processes.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity for 2D Navier-Stokes equations with a degenerate pure jump noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the ergodicity for stochastic 2D Navier-Stokes equations driven by a highly degenerate pure jump L\'evy noise. The noise could appear in as few as four directions. This gives an affirmative anwser to a longstanding problem. The case of Gaussian noise was treated in Hairer and Mattingly [\emph{Ann. of Math.}, 164(3):993--1032, 2006]. To obtain the uniqueness of invariant measure, we use Malliavin calculus and anticipating stochastic calculus to establish the equi-continuity of the semigroup, the so-called {\em e-property}, and prove some weak irreducibility of the solution process.</description>

      <title>A variational approach to sampling in diffusion processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the work of Mitter and Newton on an information-theoretic interpretation of Bayes' formula through the Gibbs variational principle. This formulation allowed them to pose nonlinear estimation for diffusion processes as a problem in stochastic optimal control, so that the posterior density of the signal given the observation path could be sampled by adding a drift to the signal process. We show that this control-theoretic approach to sampling provides a common mechanism underlying several distinct problems involving diffusion processes, specifically importance sampling using Feynman-Kac averages, time reversal, and Schr\"odinger bridges.</description>

      <title>Metric geometry of the privacy-utility tradeoff</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic data are an attractive concept to enable privacy in data sharing. A fundamental question is how similar the privacy-preserving synthetic data are compared to the true data. Using metric privacy, an effective generalization of differential privacy beyond the discrete setting, we raise the problem of characterizing the optimal privacy-accuracy tradeoff by the metric geometry of the underlying space. We provide a partial solution to this problem in terms of the "entropic scale", a quantity that captures the multiscale geometry of a metric space via the behavior of its packing numbers. We illustrate the applicability of our privacy-accuracy tradeoff framework via a diverse set of examples of metric spaces.</description>

      <title>Optimal nonparametric estimation of the expected shortfall risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of estimating the expected shortfall risk of a financial loss using a finite number of i.i.d. data. It is well known that the classical plug-in estimator suffers from poor statistical performance when faced with (heavy-tailed) distributions that are commonly used in financial contexts. Further, it lacks robustness, as the modification of even a single data point can cause a significant distortion. We propose a novel procedure for the estimation of the expected shortfall and prove that it recovers the best possible statistical properties (dictated by the central limit theorem) under minimal assumptions and for all finite numbers of data. Further, this estimator is adversarially robust: even if a (small) proportion of the data is maliciously modified, the procedure continuous to optimally estimate the true expected shortfall risk. We demonstrate that our estimator outperforms the classical plug-in estimator through a variety of numerical experiments across a range of standard loss distributions.</description>

      <title>Object detection under the linear subspace model with application to cryo-EM images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting multiple unknown objects in noisy data is a key problem in many scientific fields, such as electron microscopy imaging. A common model for the unknown objects is the linear subspace model, which assumes that the objects can be expanded in some known basis (such as the Fourier basis). In this paper, we develop an object detection algorithm that under the linear subspace model is asymptotically guaranteed to detect all objects, while controlling the family wise error rate or the false discovery rate. Numerical simulations show that the algorithm also controls the error rate with high power in the non-asymptotic regime, even in highly challenging regimes. We apply the proposed algorithm to experimental electron microscopy data set, and show that it outperforms existing standard software.</description>

      <title>Large gap probabilities of complex and symplectic spherical ensembles with point charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider $n$ eigenvalues of complex and symplectic induced spherical ensembles, which can be realised as two-dimensional determinantal and Pfaffian Coulomb gases on the Riemann sphere under the insertion of point charges. For both cases, we show that the probability that there are no eigenvalues in a spherical cap around the poles has an asymptotic behaviour as $n\to \infty$ of the form $$ \exp\Big( c_1 n^2 + c_2 n\log n + c_3 n + c_4 \sqrt n + c_5 \log n + c_6 + \mathcal{O}(n^{-\frac1{12}}) \Big) $$ and determine the coefficients explicitly. Our results provide the second example of precise (up to and including the constant term) large gap asymptotic behaviours for two-dimensional point processes, following a recent breakthrough by Charlier.</description>

      <title>Pricing and delta computation in jump-diffusion models with stochastic intensity by Malliavin calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the pricing of financial derivatives and the calculation of their delta Greek are investigated as the underlying asset is a jump-diffusion process in which the stochastic intensity component follows the CIR process. Utilizing Malliavin derivatives for pricing financial derivatives and challenging to find the Malliavin weight for accurately calculating delta will be established in such models. Due to the dependence of asset price on the information of the intensity process, conditional expectation attribute to show boundedness of moments of Malliavin weights and the underlying asset is essential. Our approach is validated through numerical experiments, highlighting its effectiveness and potential for risk management and hedging strategies in markets characterized by jump and stochastic intensity dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we continue some investigations on the periodic NLSE started by Lebowitz, Rose and Speer and by Bourgain with the addition of a distributional multiplicative potential. We prove that the equation is globally wellposed for a set of data of full normalized Gibbs measure, after suitable truncation in the focusing case. The set and the measure are invariant under the flow. The main ingredients used are Strichartz estimates on periodic NLS with distributional potential to obtain local well-posedness for low regularity initial data.</description>

      <title>Some properties of Euler capital allocation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper discusses capital allocation using the Euler formula and focuses on the risk measures Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected shortfall (ES). Some new results connected to this capital allocation is known. Two examples illustrate that capital allocation with VaR is not monotonous which may be surprising since VaR is monotonous. A third example illustrates why the same risk measure should be used in capital allocation as in the evaluation of the total portfolio. We show how simulation may be used in order to estimate the expected Return on risk adjusted capital in the commitment period of an asset. Finally, we show how Markov chain Monte Carlo may be used in the estimation of the capital allocation.</description>

      <title>Growth in products of matrices: fastest, average, and generic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problems that we consider in this paper are as follows. Let A and B be 2x2 matrices (over reals). Let w(A, B) be a word of length n. After evaluating w(A, B) as a product of matrices, we get a 2x2 matrix, call it W. What is the largest (by the absolute value) possible entry of W, over all w(A, B) of length n, as a function of n? What is the expected absolute value of the largest (by the absolute value) entry in a random product of n matrices, where each matrix is A or B with probability 0.5? What is the Lyapunov exponent for a random matrix product like that? We give partial answer to the first of these questions and an essentially complete answer to the second question. For the third question (the most difficult of the three), we offer a very simple method to produce an upper bound on the Lyapunov exponent in the case where all entries of the matrices A and B are nonnegative.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the question of how many edge-disjoint near-maximal cliques may be found in the dense Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph $G(n,p)$. Recently Acan and Kahn showed that the largest such family contains only $O(n^2/(\log{n})^3)$ cliques, with high probability, which disproved a conjecture of Alon and Spencer. We prove the corresponding lower bound, $\Omega(n^2/(\log{n})^3)$, by considering a random graph process which sequentially selects and deletes near-maximal cliques. To analyse this process we use the Differential Equation Method. We also give a new proof of the upper bound $O(n^2/(\log{n})^3)$ and discuss the problem of the precise size of the largest such clique packing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.04159v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that if $G$ is a countable amenable group, then every stationary non-Gaussian symmetric $\alpha$-stable (S$\alpha$S) process indexed by $G$ is ergodic if and only if it is weakly-mixing, and it is ergodic if and only if its Rosinski minimal spectral representation is null. This extends the results for $\mathbb{Z}^d$, and answers a question of P. Roy on discrete nilpotent groups to the extent of all countable amenable groups. As a result we construct on the Heisenberg group and on many Abelian groups, for all $\alpha$ in (0,2), stationary S$\alpha$S processes that are weakly-mixing but not strongly-mixing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.06956v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study random walks on the giant component of Hyperbolic Random Graphs (HRGs), in the regime when the degree distribution obeys a power law with exponent in the range $(2,3)$. In particular, we first focus on the expected time for a random walk to hit a given vertex or visit, i.e. cover, all vertices. We show that, a.a.s. (with respect to the HRG), and up to multiplicative constants: the cover time is $n(\log n)^2$, the maximum hitting time is $n\log n$, and the average hitting time is $n$. We then determine the expected time to commute between two given vertices a.a.s., up to a small factor polylogarithmic in $n$, and under some mild hypothesis on the pair of vertices involved. Our results are proved by controlling effective resistances using the energy dissipated by carefully designed network flows associated to a tiling of the hyperbolic plane, on which we overlay a forest-like structure.</description>

Abstract: We consider the symmetric inclusion process on a general finite graph. Our main result establishes universal upper and lower bounds for the spectral gap of this interacting particle system in terms of the spectral gap of the random walk on the same graph. In the regime in which the gamma-like reversible measures of the particle systems are log-concave, our bounds match, yielding a version for the symmetric inclusion process of the celebrated Aldous' spectral gap conjecture originally formulated for the interchange process. Finally, by means of duality techniques, we draw analogous conclusions for an interacting diffusion-like unbounded conservative spin system known as Brownian energy process.</description>

      <title>Gaussian random field approximation via Stein's method with applications to wide random neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive upper bounds on the Wasserstein distance ($W_1$), with respect to $\sup$-norm, between any continuous $\mathbb{R}^d$ valued random field indexed by the $n$-sphere and the Gaussian, based on Stein's method. We develop a novel Gaussian smoothing technique that allows us to transfer a bound in a smoother metric to the $W_1$ distance. The smoothing is based on covariance functions constructed using powers of Laplacian operators, designed so that the associated Gaussian process has a tractable Cameron-Martin or Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space. This feature enables us to move beyond one dimensional interval-based index sets that were previously considered in the literature. Specializing our general result, we obtain the first bounds on the Gaussian random field approximation of wide random neural networks of any depth and Lipschitz activation functions at the random field level. Our bounds are explicitly expressed in terms of the widths of the network and moments of the random weights. We also obtain tighter bounds when the activation function has three bounded derivatives.</description>

      <title>Martin boundaries and asymptotic behavior of branching random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03711v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be an infinite, locally finite graph. We investigate the relation between supercritical, transient branching random walk and the Martin boundary of its underlying random walk. We show results regarding the typical asymptotic directions taken by the particles, and as a consequence we find a new connection between $t$-Martin boundaries and standard Martin boundaries. Moreover, given a subgraph $U$ we study two aspects of branching random walks on $U$: when the trajectories visit $U$ infinitely often (survival) and when they stay inside $U$ forever (persistence). We show that there are cases, when $U$ is not connected, where the branching random walk does not survive in $U$, but the random walk on $G$ converges to the boundary of $U$ with positive probability. In contrast, the branching random walk can survive in $U$ even though the random walk eventually exits $U$ almost surely. We provide several examples and counterexamples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16373v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The relative entropy for two different degenerate diffusion processes is estimated by using the Wasserstein distance of initial distributions and the difference between coefficients. As applications, the entropy cost inequality and exponential ergodicity in entropy are derived for distribution dependent stochastic Hamiltonian systems associated with nonlinear kinetic Fokker Planck equations.</description>

      <title>Nodal Volumes as Differentiable Functionals of Gaussian fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize the absolute continuity of the law and the Malliavin-Sobolev regularity of random nodal volumes associated with smooth Gaussian fields on generic $\mathcal{C}^2$ manifolds with arbitrary dimension. Our results extend and generalize the seminal contribution by Angst and Poly (2020) about stationary fields on Euclidean spaces and cover, in particular, the case of two-dimensional manifolds, possibly with boundary and corners. The main tools exploited in the proofs include the use of Gaussian measures on Banach spaces, Morse theory, and the characterization of Malliavin-Sobolev spaces in terms of ray absolute continuity. Several examples are analyzed in detail.</description>

Abstract: We derive explicitly the adapted $2$-Wasserstein distance between non-degenerate Gaussian distributions on $\mathbb{R}^N$ and characterize the optimal bicausal coupling(s). This leads to an adapted version of the Bures-Wasserstein distance on the space of positive definite matrices.</description>

      <title>On Approximating the Potts Model with Contracting Glauber Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the Potts model on a graph can be approximated by a sequence of independent and identically distributed spins in terms of Wasserstein distance at high temperatures. We prove a similar result for the Curie-Weiss-Potts model on the complete graph, conditioned on being close enough to any of its equilibrium macrostates, in the low-temperature regime. Our proof technique is based on Stein's method for comparing the stationary distributions of two Glauber dynamics with similar updates, one of which is rapid mixing and contracting on a subset of the state space. Along the way, we obtain new upper bounds on the mixing times of the Glauber dynamics for the Potts model on a general bounded-degree graph, and for the conditional measure of the Curie-Weiss-Potts model near an equilibrium macrostate.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic estimates of the diameters of the Rubik's Cube groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07337v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The diameter of the Cayley graph of the Rubik's Cube group is the fewest number of turns needed to solve the Cube from any initial configurations. For the 2$\times$2$\times$2 Cube, the diameter is 11 in the half-turn metric, 14 in the quarter-turn metric, 19 in the semi-quarter-turn metric, and 10 in the bi-quarter-turn metric. For the 3$\times$3$\times$3 Cube, the diameter was determined by Rokicki et al. to be 20 in the half-turn metric and 26 in the quarter-turn metric. This study shows that a modified version of the coupon collector's problem in probabilistic theory can predict the diameters correctly for both 2$\times$2$\times$2 and 3$\times$3$\times$3 Cubes insofar as the quarter-turn metric is adopted. In the half-turn metric, the diameters are overestimated by one and two, respectively, for the 2$\times$2$\times$2 and 3$\times$3$\times$3 Cubes, whereas for the 2$\times$2$\times$2 Cube in the semi-quarter-turn and bi-quarter-turn metrics, they are overestimated by two and underestimated by one, respectively. Invoking the same probabilistic logic, the diameters of the 4$\times$4$\times$4 and 5$\times$5$\times$5 Cubes are predicted to be 48 (41) and 68 (58) in the quarter-turn (half-turn) metric, whose precise determinations are far beyond reach of classical supercomputing. It is shown that the probabilistically estimated diameter is approximated by $\ln N / \ln r + \ln N / r$, where $N$ is the number of configurations and $r$ is the branching ratio.</description>

      <title>Separation capacity of linear reservoirs with random connectivity matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that the success of reservoir computing lies within the separation capacity of the reservoirs and show that the expected separation capacity of random linear reservoirs is fully characterised by the spectral decomposition of an associated generalised matrix of moments. Of particular interest are reservoirs with Gaussian matrices that are either symmetric or whose entries are all independent. In the symmetric case, we prove that the separation capacity always deteriorates with time; while for short inputs, separation with large reservoirs is best achieved when the entries of the matrix are scaled with a factor $\rho_T/\sqrt{N}$, where $N$ is the dimension of the reservoir and $\rho_T$ depends on the maximum length of the input time series. In the i.i.d. case, we establish that optimal separation with large reservoirs is consistently achieved when the entries of the reservoir matrix are scaled with the exact factor $1/\sqrt{N}$. We further give upper bounds on the quality of separation in function of the length of the time series. We complement this analysis with an investigation of the likelihood of this separation and the impact of the chosen architecture on separation consistency.</description>

      <title>The Unique stationary boundary property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18140v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a locally compact group and $\mu$ an admissible probability measure on $G$. Let $(B,\nu)$ be the universal topological Poisson $\mu$-boundary of $(G,\mu)$ and $\Pi_s(G)$ the universal minimal strongly proximal $G$-flow. This note is inspired by a recent result of Hartman and Kalantar. We show that for a locally compact second countable group $G$ the following conditions are equivalent: (i) the measure $\nu$ is the unique $\mu$-stationary measure on $B$, (ii) $(B,G) \cong (\Pi_s(G),G)$.</description>
