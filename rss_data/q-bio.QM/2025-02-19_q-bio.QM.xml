      <title>NExT-Mol: 3D Diffusion Meets 1D Language Modeling for 3D Molecule Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D molecule generation is crucial for drug discovery and material design. While prior efforts focus on 3D diffusion models for their benefits in modeling continuous 3D conformers, they overlook the advantages of 1D SELFIES-based Language Models (LMs), which can generate 100% valid molecules and leverage the billion-scale 1D molecule datasets. To combine these advantages for 3D molecule generation, we propose a foundation model -- NExT-Mol: 3D Diffusion Meets 1D Language Modeling for 3D Molecule Generation. NExT-Mol uses an extensively pretrained molecule LM for 1D molecule generation, and subsequently predicts the generated molecule's 3D conformers with a 3D diffusion model. We enhance NExT-Mol's performance by scaling up the LM's model size, refining the diffusion neural architecture, and applying 1D to 3D transfer learning. Notably, our 1D molecule LM significantly outperforms baselines in distributional similarity while ensuring validity, and our 3D diffusion model achieves leading performances in conformer prediction. Given these improvements in 1D and 3D modeling, NExT-Mol achieves a 26% relative improvement in 3D FCD for de novo 3D generation on GEOM-DRUGS, and a 13% average relative gain for conditional 3D generation on QM9-2014. Our codes and pretrained checkpoints are available at https://github.com/acharkq/NExT-Mol.</description>

      <title>Quantitative First-Pass Perfusion CMR: from technical principles to clinical practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Myocardial perfusion cardiovascular magnetic resonance (pCMR) using first-pass contrast-enhanced imaging could play an important role in the detection of epicardial and microvascular coronary artery disease. Recently, the emergence of quantitative pCMR has provided a more reliable and observer-independent analysis compared to visual interpretation of dynamic images. This review aims to cover the basics of quantitative pCMR, from acquisition protocols, its use in preclinical and clinical studies, image reconstruction and motion handling, to automated quantitative pCMR pipelines. It also offers an overview of emerging tools in the field, including artificial intelligence-based methods.</description>

      <title>Towards Quantum Tensor Decomposition in Biomedical Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tensor decomposition has emerged as a powerful framework for feature extraction in multi-modal biomedical data. In this review, we present a comprehensive analysis of tensor decomposition methods such as Tucker, CANDECOMP/PARAFAC, spiked tensor decomposition, etc. and their diverse applications across biomedical domains such as imaging, multi-omics, and spatial transcriptomics. To systematically investigate the literature, we applied a topic modeling-based approach that identifies and groups distinct thematic sub-areas in biomedicine where tensor decomposition has been used, thereby revealing key trends and research directions. We evaluated challenges related to the scalability of latent spaces along with obtaining the optimal rank of the tensor, which often hinder the extraction of meaningful features from increasingly large and complex datasets. Additionally, we discuss recent advances in quantum algorithms for tensor decomposition, exploring how quantum computing can be leveraged to address these challenges. Our study includes a preliminary resource estimation analysis for quantum computing platforms and examines the feasibility of implementing quantum-enhanced tensor decomposition methods on near-term quantum devices. Collectively, this review not only synthesizes current applications and challenges of tensor decomposition in biomedical analyses but also outlines promising quantum computing strategies to enhance its impact on deriving actionable insights from complex biomedical data.</description>

      <title>E2CB2former: Effecitve and Explainable Transformer for CB2 Receptor Ligand Activity Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of CB2 receptor ligand activity is pivotal for advancing drug discovery targeting this receptor, which is implicated in inflammation, pain management, and neurodegenerative conditions. Although conventional machine learning and deep learning techniques have shown promise, their limited interpretability remains a significant barrier to rational drug design. In this work, we introduce CB2former, a framework that combines a Graph Convolutional Network with a Transformer architecture to predict CB2 receptor ligand activity. By leveraging the Transformer's self attention mechanism alongside the GCN's structural learning capability, CB2former not only enhances predictive performance but also offers insights into the molecular features underlying receptor activity. We benchmark CB2former against diverse baseline models including Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, K Nearest Neighbors, Gradient Boosting, Extreme Gradient Boosting, Multilayer Perceptron, Convolutional Neural Network, and Recurrent Neural Network and demonstrate its superior performance with an R squared of 0.685, an RMSE of 0.675, and an AUC of 0.940. Moreover, attention weight analysis reveals key molecular substructures influencing CB2 receptor activity, underscoring the model's potential as an interpretable AI tool for drug discovery. This ability to pinpoint critical molecular motifs can streamline virtual screening, guide lead optimization, and expedite therapeutic development. Overall, our results showcase the transformative potential of advanced AI approaches exemplified by CB2former in delivering both accurate predictions and actionable molecular insights, thus fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation in drug discovery.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inference from time series of allele frequency data using exact simulation techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central statistical problem in population genetics is to infer evolutionary and biological parameters such as the strength of natural selection and allele age from DNA samples extracted from a contemporary population. That all samples come only from the present-day has long been known to limit statistical inference; there is potentially more information available if one also has access to ancient DNA so that inference is based on a time-series of historical changes in allele frequencies. We introduce a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for Bayesian inference from allele frequency time-series data based on an underlying Wright--Fisher diffusion model of evolution, through which one can infer the parameters of essentially any selection model including those with frequency-dependent effects. The chief novelty is that we show this method to be exact in the sense that it is possible to augment the state space explored by MCMC with the unobserved diffusion trajectory, even though the transition function of this diffusion is intractable. Through careful design of a proposal distribution, we describe an efficient method in which updates to the trajectory and accept/reject decisions are calculated without error. We illustrate the method on data capturing changes in coat colour over the past 20,000 years, and find evidence to support previous findings that the mutant alleles ASIP and MC1R responsible for changes in coat color have experienced very strong, possibly overdominant, selection and further provide estimates for the ages of these genes.</description>

      <title>A universal formula explains cell size distributions in lineages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cells actively regulate their size during the cell cycle to maintain volume homeostasis across generations. While various mathematical models of cell size regulation have been proposed to explain how this is achieved, relating these models to experimentally observed cell size distributions has proved challenging. In this paper we present a simple formula for the cell size distribution in lineages as observed in e.g. a mother machine, and provide a new derivation for the corresponding result in populations, assuming exponential cell growth. Our results are independent of the underlying cell size control mechanism and explain the characteristic shape underlying experimentally observed cell size distributions. We furthermore derive universal moment identities for these distributions, and show that our predictions agree well with experimental measurements of E. coli cells, both on the distribution and the moment level.</description>

      <title>Characterizing nonlinear dynamics by contrastive cartography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The qualitative study of dynamical systems using bifurcation theory is key to understanding systems from biological clocks and neurons to physical phase transitions. Data generated from such systems can feature complex transients, an unknown number of attractors, and stochasticity. Making an analogy to bifurcation analysis, which specifies that useful dynamical features are often invariant to coordinate transforms, we leverage contrastive learning to devise a generic tool to discover dynamical classes from stochastic trajectory data. By providing a model-free trajectory analysis tool, this method automatically recovers the dynamical phase diagram of known models and provides a "map" of dynamical behaviors for a large ensemble of dynamical systems. The method thus provides a way to characterize and compare dynamical trajectories without governing equations or prior knowledge of target behavior. This approach can be used as a standalone analysis tool, or as part of a broader data-driven analysis framework.</description>
