      <title>Gravitational radiation reaction for compact binary systems at the fourth-and-a-half post-Newtonian order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the gravitational radiation-reaction force on a compact binary source at the fourth-and-a-half post-Newtonian (4.5PN) order of general relativity, i.e., 2PN order beyond the leading 2.5PN radiation reaction. The calculation is valid for general orbits in a general frame, but in a particular coordinate system which is an extension of the Burke-Thorne coordinate system at the lowest order. With the radiation-reaction acceleration, we derive (from first principles) the flux-balance laws associated with the energy, the angular and linear momenta, and the center-of-mass position, in a general frame and up to 4.5PN order. Restricting our attention to the frame of the center of mass, we point out that the equations of motion acquire a non-local-in-time contribution at the 4.5PN order, made of the integrated flux of linear momentum (responsible for the recoil of the source) together with the instantaneous flux of center-of-mass position. The non-local contribution was overlooked in the past literature, which assumed locality of the radiation-reaction force in the center of mass frame at 4.5PN order. We discuss the consequences of this non-local effect and obtain consistent non-local equations of motion and flux balance laws at 4.5PN order in the center-of-mass frame.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave surrogate model for spinning, intermediate mass ratio binaries based on perturbation theory and numerical relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present BHPTNRSur2dq1e3, a reduced order surrogate model of gravitational waves emitted from binary black hole (BBH) systems in the comparable to large mass ratio regime with aligned spin ($\chi_1$) on the heavier mass ($m_1$). We trained this model on waveform data generated from point particle black hole perturbation theory (ppBHPT) with mass ratios varying from $3 \leq q \leq 1000$ and spins from $-0.8 \leq \chi_1 \leq 0.8$. The waveforms are $13,500 \ m_1$ long and include all spin-weighted spherical harmonic modes up to $\ell = 4$ except the $(4,1)$ and $m = 0$ modes. We find that for binaries with $\chi_1 \lesssim -0.5$, retrograde quasi-normal modes are significantly excited, thereby complicating the modeling process. To overcome this issue, we introduce a domain decomposition approach to model the inspiral and merger-ringdown portion of the signal separately. The resulting model can faithfully reproduce ppBHPT waveforms with a median time-domain mismatch error of $8 \times 10^{-5}$. We then calibrate our model with numerical relativity (NR) data in the comparable mass regime $(3 \leq q \leq 10)$. By comparing with spin-aligned BBH NR simulations at $q = 15$, we find that the dominant quadrupolar (subdominant) modes agree to better than $\approx 10^{-3} \ (\approx 10^{-2})$ when using a time-domain mismatch error, where the largest source of calibration error comes from the transition-to-plunge and ringdown approximations of perturbation theory. Mismatch errors are below $\approx 10^{-2}$ for systems with mass ratios between $6 \leq q \leq 15$ and typically get smaller at larger mass ratio. Our two models - both the ppBHPT waveform model and the NR-calibrated ppBHPT model - will be publicly available through gwsurrogate and the Black Hole Perturbation Toolkit packages.</description>

      <title>IDEAL characterization of vacuum pp-waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An IDEAL characterization of a particular spacetime metric, $g_0$, consists of a set of tensorial equations $T[g] = 0$ arising from expressions constructed from the metric, $g$, its curvature tensor and its covariant derivatives and which are satisfied if and only if $g$ is locally isometric to the original metric $g_0$. Earlier applications of the IDEAL classification of spacetimes relied on the construction of particular scalar polynomial curvature invariants as an important step in the procedure.
  In this paper we investigate the well-known class of vacuum pp-wave spacetimes, where all scalar polynomial curvature invariants vanish, and determine the applicability of an IDEAL classification for these spacetimes. We consider a modification of the IDEAL approach which permits a corresponding extension of the Stewart-Walker lemma. With this change, we are able to construct invariants and IDEAL-ly classify all of the vacuum pp-wave solutions which admit a two- or higher-dimensional isometry group, with the exception of one case.</description>

      <title>Shadow, ISCO, Quasinormal modes, Hawking spectrum, Weak Gravitational lensing, and parameter estimation of a Schwarzschild Black Hole Surrounded by a Dehnen Type Dark Matter Halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider \s black hole (BH) embedded in a Dehnen-$(1,4,0)$ type dark matter halo (DDM) with two additional parameters - core radius $r_s$ and core density $\rho_s$ apart from mass $M$. We analyze the event horizon, photon orbits, and ISCO around DDM BHs and emphasize the impact of DDM parameters on them. Our study reveals the adverse effect of dark matter (DM) on the radii of photon orbits, the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), and the event horizon. We find the expressions for specific energy and angular momentum for massive particles in time-like geodesics around DDM BH and investigate their dependence on DDM parameters. We display BH shadows for various values of core density and radius that reveal smaller shadows cast by a \s BH surrounded by DDM (SDDM) than a \s BH in vacuum (SV). We then move on to study quasinormal modes (QNMs) with the help of the $6th$ order WKB method, the greybody factor using the semi-analytic bounds method, and the Hawking spectrum for scalar and electromagnetic perturbations. Core density and radius are found to have a significant impact on QNMs. Since QNMs for scalar and electromagnetic perturbations differ significantly, we can differentiate the two based on QNM observation. The greybody factor and the power emitted as Hawking radiation are adversely impacted by the presence of DM. We then study the weak gravitational lensing using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem and obtain a deflection angle with higher-order correction terms. Here, we see the deflection angle gets attenuated due to DM. Finally, we use bounds on the deviation from \s, $\delta$, reported by EHT for $M87^*$, Keck, and VLTI observatories for $Sgr A^*$ to gauge the viability of our model. Our model is found to be concordant with observations for finite parameter space. This leads to the possibility of our galactic center being surrounded by DDM.</description>

      <title>On supertranslation invariant Lorentz charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent papers, Fuentealba, Henneaux, and Troessaert (FHT) gave definitions for supertranslation invariant Lorentz charges in the ADM Hamiltonian formalism and showed that their definitions match with the Chen, Wang, Yau (CWY) definitions of Lorentz charges at null infinity which are free from ``supertranslation ambiguities''. In this brief note, motivated by the analysis of FHT, we write expressions for the supertranslation invariant Lorentz charges in Beig-Schmidt variables at spacelike and timelike infinity. We present calculations, building upon the work of Comp\`ere, Gralla, and Wei (CGW), to show that our expressions for supertranslation invariant Lorentz charges match the CWY definitions at null infinity.</description>

      <title>A semi-analytic treatment of quasinormal excitation factors in the eikonal regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an enhanced semi-analytic method for calculating quasinormal excitation factors in the eikonal regime, specifically for Schwarzschild black holes. To achieve improved accuracy in our quasinormal mode computations, we extend the Dolan and Ottewill inverse multipolar expansion technique and incorporate higher-order corrections from the WKB method of Iyer and Will. Our approach is carried out to a higher order than previous methods, thereby reducing the relative error, particularly for lower multipolar numbers. We validate our results by comparing them with those obtained using the Mano, Suzuki, and Takasugi method, demonstrating excellent agreement. A key advantage of our method is its ability to extract quasinormal excitation factors, which are crucial for accurately modeling gravitational wave signals from binary black hole mergers. This advancement provides a useful tool for future gravitational wave studies, enabling better quantification of quasinormal mode excitations and more precise identification of individual modes during black hole ringdowns.</description>

      <title>Hawking radiation with pure states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hawking's seminal work on black hole radiation highlights a critical issue in our understanding of quantum field theory in curved spacetime (QFTCS), specifically the problem of unitarity loss (where pure states evolve into mixed states). In this paper, we examine a recent proposal for a direct-sum QFTCS, which maintains unitarity through a novel quantization method that employs superselection rules based on discrete spacetime transformations. This approach describes a quantum state as components that evolve within superselection sectors of the complete Hilbert space, adhering to the discrete symmetries of a Schwarzschild black hole. Consequently, it represents a maximally entangled pure state as a direct-sum of two components in the interior and exterior regions of the black hole, thereby preserving the unitarity of Hawking radiation by keeping it in the form of pure states.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Exact massless spinor quasibound states of Schwarzschild black hole"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this comment, we point out a series of errors made by Senjaya in your paper (2024) \cite{Senjaya}. In particular, these errors involved the Dirac equation in the 3+1 dimensional Schwarzschild spacetime, tetrad field, curved gamma matrices, and the time-independent Dirac equation written in terms of the inner/scalar product between the gamma matrices and the orbital angular momentum (i.e., $\vec{\gamma}\cdot\vec{L}$). Besides, the strange/peculiar thing about all this is that even Senjaya \cite{Senjaya} citing Collas and Klein \cite{Collas}, where the (mathematical) formalism is correct, everything indicates that he ``ignored'' or ``forgot'' to use such formalism in your paper. Therefore, using Ref. \cite{Collas}, we show here the correct form of the errors made by Senjaya \cite{Senjaya}.</description>

      <title>Diagnostic Approaches for Interacting generalized holographic Ricci Dark Energy Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an analytical solution for the interacting generalized holographic dark energy model, assuming a linear interaction rate between dark energy and dark matter. We determine the equation of state parameter, the generalized holographic Ricci dark energy density, the matter density, and the deceleration parameter. By analyzing the behavior of these cosmological parameters, we demonstrate that our model aligns with recent observations and reproduces the late-time accelerated expansion of the Universe. To compare our model with the $\Lambda$CDM model, we use various diagnostic tools including statefinder, $Om(z)$-diagnostic, statefinder hierarchy, growth rate analysis, and $\omega_H$-$\omega'_H$ plane. We also analyze the stability of the model by examining the speed of sound. These methods show that the dynamics of the Universe remain very close to that of the standard cosmological model.</description>

      <title>A new approach to renormalization group improved gravitational action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new gravitational action is presented that could be a fair minimal description of the effective gravitational action in the context of Asymptotic Safety. It generates consistent modified Einstein equations where $\Lambda$ and $G$ are functions of spacetime. In addition, these equations respect, without any ad hoc choices, the Bianchi identities. We analyse this action in a quantum cosmology scenario. Furthermore, assuming homogeneous and isotropic spacetime, the action gives a non singular cosmology with power law inflation. Tensor and scalar perturbations have been used to constraint the free parameters.</description>

      <title>Kasner interiors from analytic hairy black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conduct an exhaustive study of the interior geometry of a family of asymptotically AdS$_{d+1}$ hairy black holes in an analytically controllable setup. The black holes are exact solutions to an Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton theory and include the well-known Gubser-Rocha model. After reviewing the setup, we scrutinize the geometry beyond the horizon, finding that these backgrounds can exhibit timelike or Kasner singularities. We generalize the no inner-horizon theorem for hairy black holes to accommodate these findings. We then consider observables sensitive to the geometry behind the horizon, such as Complexity = Anything and the thermal $a$-function. In the Kasner case, we propose a new variant of complexity that characterizes the late-time rate by the Kasner exponents, extending previous work by J{\o}rstad, Myers and Ruan. Additionally, we elucidate the power-law behavior of the thermal $a$-function near the singularity, directly relating it to the Kasner exponents. Finally, we introduce axion-like fields in the Gubser-Rocha model to study the impact of translational symmetry breaking on the black hole interior. We show that Kasner singularities occur for both explicit and spontaneous symmetry breaking, with the Kasner exponents depending on the strength of broken translations only in the latter case.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Lorentz invariance violation from the CPT-even SME coefficients through a tensor interaction with cosmological scalar fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerous non-standard interactions between neutrinos and scalar fields have been suggested in the literature. In this work, we have outlined the case of tensorial neutrino non-standard interactions with scalar fields, which can be related to the effective CPT-even dimension-4 operators of the Standard Model Extension (SME). Moreover, in this paper, we have mostly analyzed the projected sensitivities to the CPT-even isotropic $c_{\alpha \beta}$ and $Z-$spatial $c_{\alpha \beta}^{ZZ}$ SME coefficients, in the context of a long-baseline experimental configuration. We study the particular case of DUNE and show its sensitivity to this type of new physics. The current IceCube experiment and upcoming neutrino experiments such as KM3NeT, IceCube-Gen2, and GRAND proposals may clarify these classes of neutrino non-standard interactions.</description>

      <title>Towards unveiling the large-scale nature of gravity with the wavelet scattering transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first application of the Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST) in order to constrain the nature of gravity using the three-dimensional (3D) large-scale structure of the universe. Utilizing the Quijote-MG N-body simulations, we can reliably model the 3D matter overdensity field for the f(R) Hu-Sawicki modified gravity (MG) model down to $k_{\rm max}=0.5$ h/Mpc. Combining these simulations with the Quijote $\nu$CDM collection, we then conduct a Fisher forecast of the marginalized constraints obtained on gravity using the WST coefficients and the matter power spectrum at redshift z=0. Our results demonstrate that the WST substantially improves upon the 1$\sigma$ error obtained on the parameter that captures deviations from standard General Relativity (GR), yielding a tenfold improvement compared to the corresponding matter power spectrum result. At the same time, the WST also enhances the precision on the $\Lambda$CDM parameters and the sum of neutrino masses, by factors of 1.2-3.4 compared to the matter power spectrum, respectively. Despite the overall reduction in the WST performance when we focus on larger scales, it still provides a relatively $4.5\times$ tighter 1$\sigma$ error for the MG parameter at $k_{\rm max}=0.2$ h/Mpc, highlighting its great sensitivity to the underlying gravity theory. This first proof-of-concept study reaffirms the constraining properties of the WST technique and paves the way for exciting future applications in order to perform precise large-scale tests of gravity with the new generation of cutting-edge cosmological data.</description>

Abstract: On a spacetime $(M,g)$ endowed with a density function $h$, we consider the vacuum weighted Einstein field equations: \[h\rho-\operatorname{Hes}_h+\Delta h g=0.\] First, it is shown that the equation characterizes critical metrics for an appropriate action. Then, after describing locally conformally flat solutions in arbitrary dimension, four-dimensional solutions with harmonic curvature are classified.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we make new developments in generic cotangent bundle geometries, depending on all phase-space variables. In particular, we will focus on the so-called generalized Hamilton spaces, discussing how the main ingredients of this geometrical framework, such as the Hamiltonian and the nonlinear and affine connections, can be derived from a given metric. Several properties of this kind of spaces are demonstrated for autoparallel Hamiltonians. Moreover, we study the spacetime and momentum isometries of the metric. Finally, we discuss the possible applications of cotangent bundle geometries in quantum gravity, such as the construction of deformed relativistic kinematics and non-commutative spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from a curvature-induced phase transition of a Higgs-portal dark matter sector</title>

Abstract: The study of interactions between dark matter and the Higgs field opens an exciting connection between cosmology and particle physics, since such scenarios can impact the features of dark matter as well as interfering with the spontaneous breaking of the electroweak symmetry. Furthermore, such Higgs-portal models of dark matter should be suitably harmonised with the various epochs of the universe and the phenomenological constraints imposed by collider experiments. At the same time, the prospect of a stochastic gravitational wave background offers a promising new window into the primordial universe, which can complement the insights gained from accelerators. In this study, we examined whether gravitational waves can be generated from a curvature-induced phase transition of a non-minimally coupled dark scalar field with a portal coupling to the Higgs field. The main requirement is that the phase transition is of first order, which can be achieved through the introduction of a cubic term on the scalar potential and the sign change of the curvature scalar. This mechanism was investigated in the context of a dynamical spacetime during the transition from inflation to kination, while also considering the possibility for inducing electroweak symmetry breaking in this manner for a sufficiently low reheating temperature when the Higgs-portal coupling is extremely weak. We considered a large range of inflationary scales and both cases of positive and negative values for the non-minimal coupling, while taking into account the bound imposed by Big Bang Nucleosythesis. The resulting gravitational wave amplitudes are boosted by kination and thus constrain the parameter space of the couplings significantly. Even though the spectra lie at high frequencies for the standard high inflationary scales, there are combinations of parameter space where they could be probed with future experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we show that the noncovariant metric boundary term obtained from the nonlinear sigma model worldsheet derivation of the bulk off-shell sphere partition function is closely related to the Einstein boundary term in the Gamma-Gamma noncovariant action. In fact, when expressed in terms of the trace of the extrinsic curvature tensor, we illustrate that this boundary term has one-half the coefficient of the Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary term required such that the total (bulk plus boundary) off-shell classical action has a well-posed variational principle with Dirichlet boundary conditions.</description>

Abstract: We study phenomenological features and stability of boson stars in massless and massive scalar-tensor theory of gravity with Damour-Esposito-Farese coupling. This coupling between the tensor and scalar sectors of the theory leads to a phenomenon called spontaneous scalarization, the onset of which we investigate by numerically computing families of boson-star models using shooting and relaxation algorithms. We systematically explore the effects of the theory's coupling, the mass of the gravitational scalar and the choice of the bosonic potential on the structure of weakly and strongly scalarized solutions. Scalarized boson-star models share many common features with neutron stars in the same scalar-tensor theory of gravity. In particular, scalarization can result in boson stars with significantly larger radii and masses, which tend to be energetically favored over their weakly or non-scalarized counterparts. Overall, we find that boson stars are not quite as susceptible to scalarization as neutron stars.</description>

Abstract: We consider a congruence of null geodesics in the presence of a quantized spacetime metric. The coupling to a quantum metric induces fluctuations in the congruence; we calculate the change in the area of a pencil of geodesics induced by such fluctuations. For the gravitational field in its vacuum state, we find that quantum gravity contributes a correction to the null Raychaudhuri equation which is of the same sign as the classical terms. We thus derive a quantum-gravitational focusing theorem valid for linearized quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Shadows and weak gravitational lensing by the black hole in Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04584v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the optical properties of a charged black hole in Einstein-Maxwell-scalar (EMS) theory. We evaluate the shadow cast by the black hole and obtain analytical solutions for both the radius of the photon sphere and the shadow radius. We observe that the black hole parameters $\gamma$ and $\beta$ both influence the shadow of black hole. It is shown that the photon sphere and the shadow radius increase as a consequence of the presence of parameter $\gamma$. Interestingly, we show that shadow radius decreases first and then remains unchanged due to the impact of parameter $\beta$. Finally, we consider the weak gravitational lensing and the total magnification of lensed images around black hole. We find that the black hole charge and parameter $\beta$ both give rise to a significant effect, reducing the deflection angle. Similarly, the same behavior for the total magnification is observed due to the effect of black hole charge and parameter $\beta$.</description>

      <title>Superradiant clouds may be relevant for close compact object binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15003v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bosonic fields (within suitable mass range) may be collectively generated by rotating black holes through the black hole superradiance process. The resulting black hole is surrounded by a ``cloud" of particles whose wave function populates the superradiant energy level of the black hole. For comparable mass ratio binary black hole systems, it has been suggested that these clouds often deplete at large binary separations because of level mixing effects. As a result, these clouds may not be dynamically relevant for black hole and neutron star binaries that enter the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA and LISA detection frequency band. In this work, we point out that the common envelope process during a compact binary evolution may bring the binary to $\sim 0.01$AU in hundreds to thousands of years, so that depletion caused by certain level mixings are no longer important. We derive a relevant regime of binary parameters where the clouds are still present for binary entering the LISA band, and show that common envelop process does enlarge such parameter regime. When the binary separation further decreases due to gravitational wave radiation, we discuss the impact of possible cloud mass transfer between the binary objects.</description>

      <title>Identifying noise transients in gravitational-wave data arising from nonlinear couplings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Noise in various interferometer systems can sometimes couple non-linearly to create excess noise in the gravitational wave (GW) strain data. Third-order statistics, such as bicoherence and biphase, can identify these couplings and help discriminate those occurrences from astrophysical GW signals. However, the conventional analysis can yield large bicoherence values even when no phase-coupling is present, thereby, resulting in false identifications. Introducing artificial phase randomization in computing the bicoherence reduces such occurrences with negligible impact on its effectiveness for detecting true phase-coupled disturbances. We demonstrate this property with simulated disturbances in this work. Statistical hypothesis testing is used for distinguishing phase-coupled disturbances from non-phase coupled ones when employing the phase-randomized bicoherence. We also obtain an expression for the bicoherence value that minimizes the sum of the probabilities of false positives and false negatives. This can be chosen as a threshold for shortlisting bicoherence triggers for further scrutiny for the presence of non-linear coupling. Finally, the utility of the phase-randomized bicoherence analysis in GW time-series data is demonstrated for the following three scenarios: (1) Finding third-order statistical similarities within categories of noise transients, such as blips and koi fish. If these non-Gaussian noise transients, or glitches, have a common source, their bicoherence maps can have similarities arising from common bifrequencies related to that source. (2) Differentiating linear or non-linear phase-coupled glitches from compact binary coalescence signals through their bicoherence maps. This is explained with a simulated signal. (3) Identifying repeated bifrequencies in the second and third observation runs (i.e., O2 and O3) of LIGO and Virgo.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Cosmological Model in Nonmetricity Gravity with Boundary Term</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the cosmological implications of a modified $f(Q, B)$ gravity model, incorporating both the nonmetricity scalar ($Q$) and the boundary term ($B$). A generic connection ($\Gamma_{\mu \nu}^{\alpha}$) has been used to define the four-dimensional metric tensor and the covariant derivative ($\nabla_{\mu}$). Statistical analysis using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques constrains the $H(z)$ model free parameters based on observational data from the Cosmic Chronometers (CC) sample, the extended Pantheon$^+$ dataset, and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements. This analysis clarifies the deceleration and Equation of State (EoS) parameters and reveals a smooth transition from a deceleration to an accelerating expansion phase in the evolution history of the Universe. The most intriguing finding is identifying a stable critical point within the dynamical system of the model. This critical point corresponds to the de Sitter phase, a well-known era of accelerated expansion. The stability of the critical point suggests that, under specific initial conditions, the trajectory of the Universe will inherently be drawn towards and remain within the de Sitter phase. This aligns with the current observations, indicating that the Universe is dominated by dark energy (DE) and undergoing late-time accelerated expansion.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Process Approach for Model-Independent Reconstruction of $f(Q)$ Gravity with Direct Hubble Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increase of discrepancy in the standard procedure to choose the arbitrary functional form of the Lagrangian $f(Q)$ motivates us to solve this issue in modified theories of gravity. In this regard, we investigate the Gaussian process (GP), which allows us to eliminate this issue in a $f(Q)$ model-independent way. In particular, we use the 57 Hubble measurements coming from cosmic chronometers and the radial Baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) to reconstruct $H(z)$ and its derivatives $H'(z)$, $H''(z)$, which resulting lead us to reconstruct region of $f(Q)$, without any assumptions. The obtained mean curve along $\Lambda$CDM constant in the reconstructed region follows a quadratic behavior. This motivates us to propose a new $f(Q)$ parametrization, i.e., $f(Q)= -2\Lambda+ \epsilon Q^2$, with the single parameter $\epsilon$, which signifies the deviations from $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Further, we probe the widely studied power-law and exponential $f(Q)$ models against the reconstructed region and can improve the parameter spaces significantly compared with observational analysis. In addition, the direct Hubble measurements, along with the reconstructed $f(Q)$ function, allow the $H_0$ tension to be alleviated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of the field equations in a five-dimensional spatially flat Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker metric in the context of a Gauss-Bonnet-Scalar field theory where the quintessence scalar field is coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet scalar. Contrary to the four-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet theory, where the Gauss-Bonnet term does not contribute to the field equations, in this five-dimensional Einstein-Scalar-Gauss-Bonnet model, the Gauss-Bonnet term contributes to the field equations even when the coupling function is a constant. Additionally, we consider a more general coupling described by a power-law function. For the scalar field potential, we consider the exponential function. For each choice of the coupling function, we define a set of dimensionless variables and write the field equations into a system of ordinary differential equations. We perform a detailed analysis of the dynamics for both systems and classify the stability of the equilibrium points. We determine the presence of scaling and super-collapsing solutions using the cosmological deceleration parameter. This means that our models can explain the Universe's early and late-time acceleration phases. Consequently, this model can be used to study inflation or as a dark energy candidate.</description>

Abstract: We numerically calculate the spacetime describing the formation and evaporation of a regular black hole in 2D dilaton gravity. The apparent horizons evaporate smoothly in finite time to form a compact trapped region. We nevertheless see rich dynamics; an anti-trapped region forms alongside the black hole, and additional compact trapped and anti-trapped regions are formed by backreaction effects as the mass radiates away. The spacetime is asymptotically flat at future null infinity and is free of singularities and Cauchy horizons. These results suggest that the evaporation of regular 2D black holes is unitary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08363v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Geodesic scattering of a test particle off a Schwarzschild black hole can be parameterized by the speed-at-infinity $v$ and the impact parameter $b$, with a "separatrix", $b=b_c(v)$, marking the threshold between scattering and plunge. Near the separatrix, the scattering angle diverges as $\sim\log(b-b_c)$. The self-force correction to the scattering angle (at fixed $v,b$) diverges even faster, like $\sim A_1(v)b_c/(b-b_c)$. Here we numerically calculate the divergence coefficient $A_1(v)$ in a scalar-charge toy model. We then use our knowledge of $A_1(v)$ to inform a resummation of the post-Minkowskian expansion for the scattering angle, and demonstrate that the resummed series agrees remarkably well with numerical self-force results even in the strong-field regime. We propose that a similar resummation technique, applied to a mass particle subject to a gravitational self-force, can significantly enhance the utility and regime of validity of post-Minkowskian calculations for black-hole scattering.</description>

Abstract: Measuring gravitational interactions on sub-100-$\mu$m length scales offers a window into physics beyond the Standard Model. However, short-range gravity experiments are limited by the ability to position sufficiently massive objects to within small separation distances. Here we propose mass-loaded silicon nitride ribbons as a platform for testing the gravitational inverse square law at separations currently inaccessible with traditional torsion balances. These microscale torsion resonators benefit from low thermal noise due to strain-induced dissipation dilution while maintaining compact size (&lt;100$\,\mu$g) to allow close approach. Considering an experiment combining a 40$\,\mu$g torsion resonator with a source mass of comparable size (130$\,\mu$g) at separations down to 25$\,\mu$m, and including limits from thermomechanical noise and systematic uncertainty, we predict these devices can set novel constraints on Yukawa interactions within the 1-100$\,\mu$m range.</description>

Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTA) hunt for gravitational waves (GW) by searching for the correlations that GWs induce in the time-of-arrival residuals from different pulsars. If the GW sources are of astrophysical origin, then they are located at discrete points on the sky. However, PTA data are often modeled, and subsequently analyzed, via a "standard Gaussian ensemble". That ensemble is obtained in the limit of an infinite density of vanishingly weak, Poisson-distributed sources. In this paper, we move away from that ensemble, to study the effects of two types of "source anisotropy". The first (a), which is often called "shot noise", arises because there are $N$ discrete GW sources at specific sky locations. The second (b) arises because the GW source positions are not a Poisson process, for example, because galaxy locations are clustered. Here, we quantify the impact of (a) and (b) on the mean and variance of the pulsar-averaged Hellings and Downs correlation. For conventional PTA sources, we show that the effects of shot noise (a) are much larger than the effects of clustering (b).</description>

      <title>Inflationary Gravitational Waves as a probe of the unknown post-inflationary primordial Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the key predictions of the standard inflationary paradigm is the quantum mechanical generation of the transverse and traceless tensor fluctuations due to the rapid accelerated expansion of space, which later constitute a stochastic background of primordial gravitational waves (GWs). The amplitude of the (nearly) scale-invariant inflationary tensor power spectrum at large scales provides us with crucial information about the energy scale of inflation in the case of the minimal inflaton coupling to gravity. Furthermore, the spectral energy density, $\Omega_{_{\rm GW}}(f)$, of the GWs at sufficiently small scales (or, large frequencies $f$) serves as an important observational probe of post-inflationary primordial dynamics. In fact, the small-scale spectral tilt, $n_{_{\rm GW}} = \frac{{\rm d}\log{\Omega_{_{\rm GW}}}}{{\rm d}\log{f}}$, of the spectral energy density of GWs is sensitive to the (unknown) post-inflationary equation of state (EoS), $w$, of the universe; with a softer EoS ($w &lt; 1/3$) leading to a red tilt: $n_{_{\rm GW}} &lt; 0$, while a stiffer EoS ($w &gt; 1/3$) resulting in a blue tilt: $n_{_{\rm GW}} &gt; 0$. The post-inflationary dynamics, however, is generically expected to be quite complex, potentially involving a number of distinct phases. Hence, in this work, we discuss the possibility of multiple sharp transitions, namely $w_1 \to w_2 \to w_3 \to ... \to w_n$, in the EoS of the post-inflationary universe and compute the corresponding spectral energy density of the inflationary GWs. We explicitly determine the region of the parameter space $\lbrace{ w_1, \, w_2, \, w_3, ..., w_n\rbrace}$ which leads to a potentially detectable signal in the upcoming GW detectors, without violating the current constraints.</description>

      <title>Investigating tidal heating in neutron stars via gravitational Raman scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a scattering amplitude formalism to study the tidal heating effects of nonspinning neutron stars incorporating both worldline effective field theory and relativistic stellar perturbation theory. In neutron stars, tidal heating arises from fluid viscosity due to various scattering processes in the interior. It also serves as a channel for the exchange of energy and angular momentum between the neutron star and its environment. In the interior of the neutron star, we first derive two master perturbation equations that capture fluid perturbations accurate to linear order in frequency. Remarkably, these equations receive no contribution from bulk viscosity due to a peculiar adiabatic incompressibility which arises in stellar fluid for non-barotropic perturbations. In the exterior, the metric perturbations reduce to the Regge-Wheeler (RW) equation which we solve using the analytical Mano-Suzuki-Takasugi (MST) method. We compute the amplitude for gravitational waves scattering off a neutron star, also known as gravitational Raman scattering. From the amplitude, we obtain expressions for the electric quadrupolar static Love number and the leading dissipation number to all orders in compactness. We then compute the leading dissipation number for various realistic equation-of-state(s) and estimate the change in the number of gravitational wave cycles due to tidal heating during inspiral in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) band.</description>

      <title>Surpassing the Standard Quantum Limit using an Optical Spring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.12222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics places noise limits and sensitivity restrictions on physical measurements. The balance between unwanted backaction and the precision of optical measurements impose a standard quantum limit (SQL) on interferometric systems. In order to realize a sensitivity below the SQL, it is necessary to leverage a back-action evading measurement technique, or else exploit cancellations of any excess noise contributions at the detector. %Many proof of principle experiments have been performed, but only recently has an experiment achieved sensitivity below the SQL. In this work, we extend that initial demonstration and realize sub-SQL measurement sensitivity nearly two times better than previous measurements, and with architecture applicable to interferometric gravitational wave detectors. In fact, this technique is directly applicable to Advanced LIGO, which could observe similar effects with a detuned signal recycling cavity. By exploiting quantum correlations created by an optical spring, we measure a total sensitivity below the SQL by $\textbf{2.8}$ dB, corresponding to a reduction in the noise power by $\textbf{72}\pm\textbf{5.1}$ \% below the quantum limit. Through the use of a detuned optical spring, this noise reduction is tunable, allowing us to choose the desired range of frequencies that fall below the SQL. This result demonstrates access to sensitivities well below the SQL at frequencies ranges applicable to LIGO, with the potential to extend the reach of gravitational wave detectors further into the universe.</description>

      <title>Generalized approach for the perturbative dynamical braneworld in $D$ dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an approach to derive the brane cosmology in the $D$-dimensional braneworld model. We generalize the "bulk-based" approach by treating the 4-brane as a small perturbation to the $D$-dimensional spherically symmetric spacetime. The linear corrections from a static 4-brane to the metric are derived from the linearized perturbation equations, while the nonlinear corrections are found by a parameterization of the perturbed metric solution. We use a time-dependent generalization to give the nonlinearly perturbed metric solution for the dynamical braneworld model, and analyse the stability of the model under the motion of the 4-brane. Through the fine tuning, we can recover the Friedmann equations for the universe with and without an effective cosmological constant. More importantly, the de Sitter expansion of the universe can be reproduced.</description>

      <title>Transition dynamics in the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model: Implications for bound cosmic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05908v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the predictions of $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM, a novel framework suggesting a rapid anti-de Sitter (AdS) to de Sitter (dS) vacua transition in the late Universe, on bound cosmic structures. In its simplest version, the cosmological constant, $\Lambda_{\rm s}$, abruptly switches sign from negative to positive, attaining its present-day value at a redshift of ${z_\dagger\sim 2}$. The $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model emerges as a promising solution to major cosmological tensions, particularly the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions, as well as other less definite tensions. A key aspect of our investigation is examining the impact of the abrupt $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model on the formation and evolution of bound cosmic structures. We identify three primary influences: (i) the negative cosmological constant (AdS) phase for $z &gt; z_\dagger$, (ii) the abrupt transition marked by a type II (sudden) singularity, leading to an abrupt increase in the universe's expansion rate at $z=z_\dagger$, and (iii) an increased expansion rate in the late universe under a positive cosmological constant for $z &lt; z_\dagger$, compared to $\Lambda$CDM. Utilizing the spherical collapse model, we investigate the non-linear evolution of bound cosmic structures within the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM framework. We find that the virialization process of cosmic structures, and consequently their matter overdensity, varies depending on whether the AdS-dS transition precedes or follows the turnaround. Specifically, structures virialize with either increased or reduced matter overdensity compared to the Planck-$\Lambda$CDM model, contingent on the timing of the transition. Additionally, our results demonstrate that the sudden singularity does not result in the dissociation of bound systems. Despite its profound nature, the singularity exerts only relatively weak effects on such systems, thereby reinforcing the model's viability in this context.</description>

      <title>Which symmetry group for elementary particles with an electric charge today and in the past?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the Kaluza-Klein theory from the perspective of the classification of elementary particles based on the coadjoint orbit method. We study the momentum map of the corresponding symmetry group $G_1$ which conserves the hyperbolic metric. We show that the electric charge is not frame-invariant, in contradiction with the experimental observations. In other words, it is not the symmetry group of the Universe today as we know it. To avert this paradox, we scale the fifth coordinate and consider the limit when the cylinder radius vanishes. For the corresponding group $G_0$, the charge is invariant. On this ground, we propose a cosmological scenario in which the elementary particles of the early Universe are classified from the momenta of the group $G_1$, next the three former dimensions inflate quickly while the fifth one shrinks, leading to the 4D era in which as today the particles are characterized by the momenta of the group $G_0$. By this mechanism, the elementary particles can acquire electric charge as a by-product of the 4 + 1 symmetry breaking of the Universe. This work opens the way to the geometric quantization of charged elementary particles. We construct the corresponding $G_0$-connections by pullback on the space-time. Imposing that the linear 5-momentum is parallel-transported, we recover the conservation of the charge and the equation of motion with Lorentz force. We revisit the variational relativity and obtain the field equations for both the gravitation and electromagnetic interactions with coupling terms which are negligible at the Newtonian approximation, allowing to recover Maxwell equations.</description>

      <title>Breaking the mass-sheet degeneracy in strong lensing mass modeling with weak lensing observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hubble constant ($H_0$), a crucial parameter in cosmology, quantifies the expansion rate of the universe so its precise measurement is important to understand the fundamental dynamics of our evolving universe. One of the major limitations of measuring $H_0$ using time-delay cosmography is the presence of the mass-sheet degeneracy (MSD) in the lens mass modeling. We propose and quantitatively assess the use of galaxy-galaxy shear measurements to break the MSD in the strong lensing mass modeling. We use stacked galaxy-galaxy lensing profiles and corresponding covariance matrices from Huang et al. (2022) to constrain the MSD in lens mass modeling with a highly flexible mass profile. Our analyses show that if ideally all galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements from the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey can be used to constrain the MSD, we can achieve $\sim 10\%$ precision on the MSD constraint. We forecast that galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements from LSST-like surveys can in general constrain the MSD with $\sim 1-3\%$ precision. Furthermore, if we push weak lensing measurements to a lower angular scale of $\sim 0.04$ $\rm Mpc$, a survey like LSST can provide $\sim 1\%$ precision on the MSD constraint, enabling a measurement of $H_0$ at the $1\%$ level. We demonstrate that galaxy-galaxy weak lensing can robustly constrain the MSD independent of stellar kinematics of the deflector, with wide-field survey data alone.</description>

      <title>Interplay between the Lyapunov exponents and phase transitions of charged AdS black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the relationship between the standard or extended thermodynamic phase structure of various AdS black holes and the Lyapunov exponents associated with the null and time-like geodesics. We consider dyonic, Bardeen, Gauss-Bonnet, and Lorentz-symmetry breaking massive gravity black holes and calculate the Lyapunov exponents of massless and massive particles in unstable circular geodesics close to the black hole. We find that the thermal profile of the Lyapunov exponents exhibits distinct behaviour in the small and large black hole phases and can encompass certain aspects of the van der Waals type small/large black hole phase transition. We further analyse the properties of Lyapunov exponents as an order parameter and find that its critical exponent is $1/2$, near the critical point for all black holes considered here.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02801v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide evidence for a correspondence between the formation of black holes and the stability of circular null geodesics around the collapsing perturbation. We first show that the critical threshold of the compaction function to form a black hole in radiation is well approximated by the critical threshold for the appearance of the first unstable circular orbit in a spherically symmetric background. We also show that the critical exponent in the scaling law of the primordial black hole mass close to the threshold is set by the inverse of the Lyapunov coefficient of the unstable orbits when a self-similar stage is developed close to criticality.</description>

      <title>Stringy Forces in the Black Hole Interior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective field theories break down inside large black holes on macroscopic scales when tidal forces are string-sized. If $r_0$ is the horizon radius and $\alpha'$ is the square of the string scale, the 4D Schwarzschild interior is strongly curved at $ \big(r_0 \alpha' \big)^{1/3}$. Infalling massless probes that reach this scale stretch and become excited strings. I generalize this picture for a wide class of black hole solutions in string theory. For the black hole dual to the large-$N$ BFSS model in a thermal state, and denoting $\ell_P$ the Planck length, tidal forces are stringy at $r_0 \left(\frac{r_0}{N^{1/3} \ell_P}\right)^{3/11}$, which is greater than the scale where string perturbation theory breaks down for sufficiently large $r_0/\ell_P$. For 4D Kerr, there is a range of spin parameters for which the inner horizon is to the future of the scale of stringy curvature. These results specify the portion of black hole interior solutions where effective field theory can be used; beyond these scales, one must resort to other methods.</description>
