      <title>The importance of the dynamical corotation torque for the migration of low-mass planets -- 1D analytical prescriptions verified by 2D hydrodynamical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments suggested that planet formation occurs in regions of the discs with low turbulent viscosity. There, the dynamical corotation torque is thought to play an important role by slowing down type I migration. We aim to provide a simple analytical prescription for the dynamical corotation torque for use in 1D global models of planet formation and evolution, and assess the importance of the dynamical corotation torque for the migration of low-mass planets in low-viscosity discs. We propose simple prescriptions for calculating in 1D the time evolution of the vortensities of the librating and orbit-crossing flows around a low-mass planet, which both enter the analytical expression for the dynamical corotation torque. One of our prescriptions involves a memory timescale for the librating flow, and 2D hydrodynamical simulations of disc-planet interactions are used to assess the memory timescale and validate our model. The orbital evolution of a low-mass planet is calculated by 1D simulations where the dynamical corotation torque features our prescriptions for the vortensities of the librating and orbit-crossing flows, and by 2D hydrodynamical simulations of disc-planet interactions, assuming locally isothermal discs. We find very good agreement between the 1D and 2D simulations for a wide parameter space, whether the dynamical corotation torque slows down or accelerates inward migration. We provide maps showing how much the dynamical corotation torque reduces the classical type I migration torque as a function of planet mass and orbital distance. The reduction is about 50\% for a 10 Earth-mass planet at 10 au in a young disc with surface density profile in $r^{-1/2}$ and alpha viscosity of $10^{-4}$. In discs with low turbulent viscosity, the dynamical corotation torque should be taken into account in global models as it can strongly slow down type I migration.</description>

      <title>Uniform Reanalysis of JWST MIRI 15{\mu}m Exoplanet Eclipse Observations using Frame-Normalized Principal Component Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST MIRI 15 micron time-series eclipse photometry presents a powerful way to probe for the presence of atmospheres on low-temperature rocky exoplanets orbiting nearby stars. Here, we introduce a novel technique, frame-normalized principal component analysis (FN-PCA) to analyze and detrend these MIRI time-series observations. Using the FN-PCA technique, we perform a uniform reanalysis of the published MIRI 15 micron observations of LHS 1478 b, TOI-1468 b, LHS 1140 c, TRAPPIST-1 b, and TRAPPIST-1 c using our new data reduction pipeline (Erebus) and compare them to different potential atmospheric and surface compositions. We also investigate additional public data sets with the sole purpose of understanding the instrument systematics affecting MIRI. We identify and categorize important detector-level systematics in the observations that are generally present across all 17 analyzed eclipse observations, which we illustrate as eigenimage/eigenvalue pairs in the FN-PCA. One of these eigenimage/eigenvalue pairs corresponds to the prominent ramp effect at the beginning of the time-series observations which has widely been reported for JWST and Spitzer photometry. For JWST/MIRI, we show that the detector settling time scales exponentially with the apparent magnitude of the target star $T_\mathrm{set} \mathrm{[hours]} = 0.063\exp^{0.427\cdot m_K} -0.657$. This uniform reanalysis and investigation of JWST/MIRI systematics is done in preparation for the 500 hour Rocky Worlds DDT survey, to demonstrate a data-driven systematic model usable across all MIRI 15 micron datasets.</description>

      <title>Impact of rotation on synthetic mass-radius relationships of two-layer rocky planets and water worlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have analyzed the effects of rotation on mass-radius relationships for single-layer and two-layer planets having a core and an envelope made of pure materials among iron, perovskite and water in solid phase. The numerical surveys use the DROP code updated with a modified polytropic equation-of-state (EOS) and investigate flattening parameters $f$ up to $0.2$. In the mass range $0.1 M_\oplus &lt; M &lt; 10 M_\oplus$, we find that rotation systematically shifts the curves of composition towards larger radii and/or smaller masses. Relative to the spherical case, the equatorial radius $R_{eq}$ is increased by about $0.36f$ for single-layer planets, and by $0.30f$ to $0.55f$ for two-layer planets (depending on the core size fraction $q$ and planet mass $M$). Rotation is an additional source of confusion in deriving planetary structures, as the radius alterations are of the same order as i) current observational uncertainties for super-Earths, and ii) EOS variations. We have established a multivariate fit of the form $R_{eq}(M,f,q)$, which enables a fast characterization of the core size and rotational state of rocky planets and ocean worlds. We discuss how the observational data must be shifted in the diagrams to self-consistently account for an eventual planet spin, depending on the geometry of the transit (circular/oblate). A simple application to the recently characterized super-Earth candidate LHS1140b is discussed.</description>

      <title>Exoplanet Atmospheric Refraction Effects in the Kepler Sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis on the detection viability of refraction effects in Kepler's exoplanet atmospheres using binning techniques for their light curves in order to compare against simulated refraction effects. We split the Kepler exoplanets into sub-populations according to orbital period and planetary radius, then search for out-of-transit changes in the relative flux associated with atmospheric refraction of starlight. The presence of refraction effects - or lack thereof - may be used to measure and set limits on the bulk properties of an atmosphere, including mean molecular weight or the presence of hazes. In this work, we use the presence of refraction effects to test whether exoplanets above the period-radius valley have H/He atmospheres, which high levels of stellar radiation could evaporate away, in turn leaving rocky cores below the valley. We find strong observational evidence of refraction effects for exoplanets above the period-radius valley based on Kepler photometry, however those related to optically thin H/He atmospheres are not common in the observed planetary population. This result may be attributed to signal dampening caused by clouds and hazes, consistent with the optically thick and intrinsically hotter atmospheres of Kepler exoplanets caused by relatively close host star proximity.</description>

      <title>The 3D Cosmic Shoreline for Nurturing Planetary Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various ``cosmic shorelines" have been proposed to delineate which planets have atmospheres. The fates of individual planet atmospheres may be set by a complex sea of growth and loss processes, driven by unmeasurable environmental factors or unknown historical events. Yet, defining population-level boundaries helps illuminate which processes matter and identify high-priority targets for future atmospheric searches. Here, we provide a statistical framework for inferring the position, shape, and fuzziness of an instellation-based cosmic shoreline, defined in the three-dimensional space of planet escape velocity, planet bolometric flux received, and host star luminosity; explicitly including luminosity partially circumvents the need to estimate host stars' historical X-ray and extreme ultraviolet fluences. Using Solar System and exoplanet atmospheric constraints, under the restrictive assumption that one planar boundary applies across a wide parameter space, we find the critical flux threshold for atmospheres scales with escape velocity with a power-law index of $p=6.08^{+0.69}_{-0.48}$, steeper than the canonical literature slope of $p=4$, and scales with stellar luminosity with a power-law index of $q=1.25^{+0.31}_{-0.22}$, steep enough to disfavor atmospheres on Earth-sized planets out to the habitable zone for stars less luminous than $\log_{10} (L_\star/L_\odot) = -2.22 \pm 0.21$ (roughly spectral type M4.5V). If we relax the assumption that one power law must stretch from the hottest exoplanets to the coolest Solar System worlds, the narrower question of ``Which warm planets have thick CO$_2$ secondary atmospheres?" is still poorly constrained by data but should improve significantly with planned JWST observations.</description>

      <title>Investigating Magnetic Field Fluctuations in Jovian Auroral Electron Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Juno spacecraft provides a unique opportunity to explore the mechanisms generating Jupiter's aurorae. Past analyses of Juno data immensely advanced our understanding of its auroral acceleration processes, however, few studies utilized multiple instruments on Juno in a joint systematic analysis. This study uses measurements from the Juno Ultraviolet Spectrograph (UVS), the Jupiter Energetic particle Detector Instrument (JEDI), and the Juno Magnetometer (MAG) from the first 20 perijoves. On magnetic field lines associated with the diffuse aurora, we consistently find small-scale magnetic field fluctuations with amplitudes of up to 100 nT on time scales of seconds to 1 minute. On magnetic field lines directly linked to the main emission, the electron distribution is field-aligned, mostly broad-band in energy, and accompanied by large-scale magnetic field perturbations of several 100 nT on time scales of tens of min (except one case). These large-scale perturbations are generally associated with quasistatic field-aligned electric currents. Small-scale magnetic fields are not resolved over the main emission zone closer than radial distances 4 Jovian radii due to the digitization limit of the magnetometer. However, in all cases where Juno crosses the main auroral field lines beyond 4RJ, the digitization limit is significantly reduced and we detect small-scale magnetic field fluctuations of 2 nT to 10 nT consistent with a turbulent spectrum. Associated energy fluxes projected to Jupiter can exceed 1000 mW/m2. The general broad-band nature of the electron distributions and the consistent presence of small-scale magnetic field fluctuations over the main emission support that wave-particle interaction can dominantely contribute to power Jupiter's auroral processes.</description>

      <title>A high mutual inclination system around KOI-134 revealed by transit timing variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few planetary systems have measured mutual inclinations, and even less are found to be non-coplanar. Observing the gravitational interactions between exoplanets is an effective tool to detect non-transiting companions to transiting planets. Evidence of these interactions can manifest in the light curve through transit timing variations (TTVs) and transit duration variations (TDVs). Through analysis of Kepler photometry and joint TTV-TDV modeling, we confirm the detection of KOI-134 b, a transiting planet with mass and size similar to Jupiter on a period of ~67 days, and find that it exhibits high TTVs (~20-hr amplitude) and significant TDVs. We explain these signals with the presence of an innermost non-transiting planet in 2:1 resonance with KOI-134 b. KOI-134 c has a mass $M = 0.220^{+0.010}_{-0.011} M_\text{Jup}$ and a moderately-high mutual inclination with KOI-134 b of $i_\text{mut} = 15.4_{-2.5}^{+2.8}{^\circ}$. Moreover, the inclination variations of KOI-134 b are so large that the planet is predicted to stop transiting in about 100 years. This system architecture cannot be easily explained by any one formation mechanism, with other dynamical effects needed to excite the planets' mutual inclination while still preserving their resonance.</description>

      <title>Constraining nearby substellar companion architectures using High Contrast Imaging, Radial Velocity and Astrometry data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nearby stars offer prime opportunities for exoplanet discovery and characterization through various detection methods. By combining HCI, RV, and astrometry, it is possible to better constrain the presence of substellar companions, as each method probes different regions of their parameter space. A detailed census of planets around nearby stars is essential to guide the selection of targets for future space missions seeking to identify Earth-like planets and potentially habitable worlds. In addition, the detection and characterisation of giant planets and brown dwarfs is crucial for understanding the formation and evolution of planetary systems. We aim to constrain the possible presence of substellar companions for 7 nearby M-dwarf stars using a combination of new SPHERE/H2 HCI and archival RV and astrometric data. We investigate how combining these techniques improves the detection constraints for giant planets and brown dwarfs compared to using each method individually. For each star and each data set, we compute the mass limits as a function of semi-major axis or projected separation using standard techniques. We then use a Monte Carlo approach to assess the completeness of the companion mass / semi-major axis parameter space probed by the combination of the three methods, as well as by the three methods independently. Our combined approach significantly increases the fraction of detectable companions. Although no new companion was detected, we could place stronger constraints on potential substellar companions. The combination of HCI, RV and astrometry provides significant improvements in the detection of substellar companions over a wider parameter space. Applying this approach to larger samples and lower-mass companions will help constraining the search space for future space missions aimed at finding potentially habitable or even inhabited planets.</description>

      <title>Partial Differentiation of Callisto as Possible Evidence for Pebble Accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: "Planetesimal or pebble" is one of the most fundamental open questions in planet formation theory. Similarly, "satellitesimal or pebble" remains unsettled regarding the formation of the Galilean satellites. I focus on a unique characteristic of Callisto--its interior is estimated to be only partially differentiated based on gravitational field measurements. I robustly demonstrate that such a state is not achievable through satellitesimal accretion, which inevitably leads to significant differentiation, but can be maintained with pebble accretion. Pebbles can release their impact energy at the surface of the satellite, allowing efficient radiative cooling, and their impact velocities can be reduced by aerodynamic drag from the circumplanetary gas disk. If future missions such as JUpiter ICy moons Explorer (JUICE) confirm that Callisto is indeed only partially differentiated, it could provide the first observed evidence for the pebble accretion mechanism--not only in the context of satellite formation, but also in the broader framework of planet formation.</description>

      <title>Gas Pressure Driven Screening Forces and Pebble Aggregation: A Pathway for Growth in Planet Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of planetesimals from cm-sized pebbles in protoplanetary disks faces significant barriers, including fragmentation and radial drift. We identify a previously unaccounted screening force, arising from mutual shielding of thermal gas particles between pebbles when their separation falls below the gas mean free path. This force facilitates pebble binding, overcoming key growth barriers under turbulent disk conditions. Unlike conventional mechanisms, screening forces operate independently of surface adhesion and complement streaming instability and pressure traps by enhancing aggregation in high-density regions. Our analysis predicts that screening interactions are most effective in the {middle disk regions ($ \sim 0.3$ to few AU),} consistent with ALMA observations (e.g., TW Hya) of enhanced dust concentrations. {Furthermore, we find that screening-induced pebble growth from centimeter to kilometer scales can occur on timescales significantly shorter than the disk lifetime ($\sim 10^5$ years). Importantly, this growth naturally terminates when particles smaller than the local gas mean free path are depleted, thereby avoiding runaway accretion.} Beyond planetary science, the screening forces have {potential} implications for high-energy astrophysics, dusty plasmas, confined particle suspensions and other relevant areas, suggesting a broader fundamental significance.</description>

      <title>Volatile-rich evolution of molten super-Earth L 98-59 d</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small low-density exoplanets are sculpted by strong stellar irradiation but their origin is unknown. Two competing scenarios are that they formed either with rocky interiors and H2-He atmospheres (`gas-dwarfs'), or instead with bulk compositions dominated by H2O phases (`water-worlds'). Observations of L 98-59 d have revealed its unusually low density and spectral characteristics, opening a window for disentangling its origin. We constrain the possible range of evolutionary histories linking L 98-59 d's birth conditions to these observations, using a coupled atmosphere-interior modelling framework. Observations are explained by a chemically-reducing mantle and early substantial (&gt;1.8 mass%) sulfur and hydrogen content, inconsistent with both the gas-dwarf and water-world origin scenarios. Observed spectral features are explained by in-situ photochemical production of SO2 in an H2 background. L 98-59 d's interior comprises a permanent magma ocean, allowing long-term retention of volatiles within its interior over billions of years, consistent with surveyed Kepler Survey trends. Modelling of the `cosmic shoreline' suggests that early volatile-metal budget is a determinant of atmospheric retention - here, we explicitly show that large initial budgets can explain JWST observations of some super-Earth planets (including DDT targets). In breaking with the supposed gas-dwarf/water-world dichotomy, we reveal an evolutionary pathway defined by high-molar-mass atmospheres overlying magma oceans, and invite a more nuanced taxonomy of small exoplanets.</description>

      <title>A Hot Jupiter with a Retrograde Orbit around a Sun-like Star and a Toy Model of Hot Jupiters in Wide Binary Star Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an observation of a transit of the hot Jupiter (HJ) KELT-23A b with the Keck Planet Finder spectrograph and a measurement of the sky-projected obliquity ($\lambda$) of its Sun-like ($T_{\rm eff} \approx 5900$ K) host star. We measured a projected stellar obliquity of $\lambda \approx 180^\circ$, indicating that the orbit of the HJ is retrograde relative to the direction of the stellar spin. Due to the slow sky-projected rotational velocity of the host star ($v \sin{i_\star} \approx 0.5$ km s$^{-1}$), the true orbit of the HJ could be closer to polar. HJs around stars with effective temperatures below the Kraft break -- such as KELT-23A -- are generally found to have prograde orbits that are well-aligned with the equatorial planes of their host stars (i.e., $\lambda \sim 0^\circ$), most likely due to spin-orbit realignment driven by stellar tidal dissipation. This system is therefore a unique outlier that strains migration and tidal theories. The fact that the HJ has a highly misaligned orbit may suggest that the planet arrived at its close-in orbit relatively recently, possibly via interactions with the wide-separation (570 AU) M-dwarf companion in the system, or that it has stalled near an antialigned or polar orientation while realigning. Using Gaia DR3, we determined the orbit of the stellar companion to be moderately face-on ($\gamma = 60 \pm 4^\circ$). We show that the distribution of observed systems in the $\gamma - \lambda$ plane can be broadly reproduced using a toy model in which the orbits of the planetary and stellar companions begin aligned with the equatorial plane of the primary star and, upon migrating inwards, the planet preferentially obtains either an aligned or polar orbit.</description>

      <title>The ESO SupJup Survey VIII. Chemical fingerprints of young L dwarf twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The potentially distinct formation pathways of exoplanets and brown dwarfs may be imprinted in their elemental and isotopic ratios. This work is part of the ESO SupJup Survey, which aims to disentangle the formation pathways of super-Jupiters and brown dwarfs through the analysis of their chemical and isotopic ratios. In this study, we characterize the atmospheres of two young L4 dwarfs, 2MASS J03552337+1133437 (2M0355) and 2MASS J14252798-3650229 (2M1425), in the AB Doradus Moving Group. This involved constraining their chemical composition, $^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO ratio, pressure-temperature profile, surface gravity, and rotational velocity. We have obtained high-resolution CRIRES+ K-band spectra of these brown dwarfs, which we analyzed with an atmospheric retrieval pipeline. Atmospheric models were generated with the radiative transfer code petitRADTRANS, for which we employed a free and equilibrium chemistry approach, which we coupled with the PyMultiNest sampling algorithm to determine the best fit. We report robust detections of $^{13}$CO (13.4 &amp; 8.0 $\sigma$) and HF (11.6 &amp; 15.8 $\sigma$) in 2M0355 and 2M1425, respectively. The objects have similar overall atmospheric properties, including $^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO isotope ratios of $95.5\substack{+6.8 \\ -6.4}$ for 2M0355 and $109.6\substack{+10.6 \\ -9.6}$ for 2M1425. In both brown dwarfs, we find only tentative hints of H$_2^{18}$O (1.1 &amp; 3.0 $\sigma$), with lower limits of H$_2^{16}$O/H$_2^{18}$O $\sim$ 1000. Both objects appear to be close to chemical equilibrium, considering the main spectral contributors. Future studies will put them into the context of other objects observed as part of the ESO SupJup Survey.</description>

      <title>Discovery and Preliminary Characterization of a Third Interstellar Object: 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report initial observations aimed at the characterization of a third interstellar object candidate. This object, 3I/ATLAS -- also C/2025 N1 (ATLAS) -- , was discovered on 2025 July 1 UT and has an orbital eccentricity of $e\sim6.2$, perihelion of $q\sim 1.35$ au, inclination of $\sim175^\circ$, and hyperbolic velocity of $V_\infty\sim 60$ km s$^{-1}$. 3I/ATLAS has an absolute magnitude of $H_V\sim12$, which corresponds to a nuclear radius of $\sim10\text{ km}$, assuming an asteroid-like albedo of $p\sim0.05$. The discovery of this object implies a spatial number density of $n_0\sim10^{-3}$ au$^{-3}$ for objects with radii greater than or equal to that of 3I/ATLAS. We report deep stacked images obtained using the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope that display faint activity. Using images obtained from the Las Cumbres Observatory 0.36 m telescopes at Haleakala and the 2.0 m Faulkes Telescope North, we find a small light curve variation of less than 0.2 mag for the object over a $\sim29$ h time span. The visible/near-infrared spectral slope of the object is red, comparable to 1I/`Oumuamua. The object will be observable until September 2025, unobservable near perihelion due to low solar elongation, and observable again in November. This limitation unfortunately prohibits detailed observations at perihelion when the activity of 3I/ATLAS is likely to peak. Based on the experience of 1I/`Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, we ask the community to maintain a constant observational presence while possible with photometric, spectroscopic, and polarimetric methods. Such observational data would constrain the (i) light curve, (ii) onset and variation of activity, and (iii) nongravitational effects. It is essential that the community collaborate to rapidly and comprehensively characterize these properties of 3I/ATLAS.</description>

      <title>A Highly Carbon-Rich Dayside and Disequilibrium Chemistry in the Ultra-Hot Jupiter WASP-19b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJs) offer exceptional opportunities for detailed atmospheric characterization via emission spectroscopy. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of the dayside atmosphere of WASP-19b$\unicode{x2014}$one of the shortest-period UHJs$\unicode{x2014}$using archival JWST NIRSpec/PRISM observations spanning 0.6-5.3 $\mu$m. We report robust detections of H$_2$O (16.44 $\sigma$), CO (5.47 $\sigma$), and CO$_2$ (10.72 $\sigma$), along with marginal detections of CH$_4$ (3.76 $\sigma$) and C$_2$H$_2$ (2.45 $\sigma$). The retrieved composition reveals a highly carbon-rich atmosphere with a tightly constrained super-solar C/O ratio of 0.94$\pm$0.03. Elevated abundances of carbon-bearing species provide strong evidence (11.69 $\sigma$) for disequilibrium chemistry. We also detect condensate clouds, likely Al$_2$O$_3$(c), at high significance (17.28 $\sigma$), and constrain the atmospheric metallicity to 1.7$_{-0.7}^{+1.2}$ $\times$ solar. These results establish a precise benchmark for modeling dayside conditions in extreme irradiated atmospheres and demonstrate JWST's transformative capabilities for exoplanet science.</description>

      <title>Detecting and characterising the magnetic field of exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic fields play a crucial role in planetary evolution and habitability. While the intrinsic magnetic fields of solar system planets are relatively well understood, the magnetic properties of exoplanets remain largely unconstrained, despite their potential ubiquity. Detecting exoplanetary magnetic fields is essential to advancing our understanding of planetary habitability beyond the solar system. This paper focuses on two promising spectropolarimetric techniques for detecting magnetic fields in hot exoplanets: direct detection through polarization signatures in the He I 1083 nm triplet and indirect detection via star-planet magnetic interactions manifesting as stellar hot spots. The direct method is particularly suited to close-in gas giants, leveraging the Hanle and Zeeman effects to detect low-amplitude magnetic fields. The indirect method can apply to both giant and low-mass planets by identifying magnetic connectivity-induced features in the stellar atmosphere. Although the interpretation of current detections remain tentative, upcoming high-resolution spectropolarimetric capabilities in the UV and near-infrared, particularly with future missions like HWO, promise to enable definitive measurements of exoplanetary magnetic fields. These advancements will open new avenues for probing the magnetic environments of exoplanets and their implications for atmospheric retention and habitability.</description>

Abstract: We present deep $K_s$-band imaging of the extreme T subdwarf CWISE J221706.28$-$145437.6. Using the new photometry, we construct its spectral energy distribution and find this object exhibits exceptionally strong collision-induced absorption in the $H$ and $K$ band. The comparison with the nearest benchmark extreme T subdwarf WISEA J181006.18$-$101000.5 suggests the object would be cooler and more metal-poor than the benchmark.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planets are complicated. Understanding how they work requires connecting individual objects to the context of broader populations. Exoplanets are easier to picture next to their closest Solar System archetypes, and planets in the Solar System are richer when seen alongside a growing community of known exoplanets in the Milky Way. The `exoatlas` toolkit provides a friendly Python interface for retrieving and working with populations of planets, aiming to simplify the process of placing worlds in context.</description>

      <title>A Ground-Based Transit Observation of the Long-Period Extremely Low-Density Planet HIP 41378 f</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a ground-based transit detection of HIP 41378 f, a long-period ($P = 542$ days), extremely low-density ($0.09 \pm 0.02$ g cm$^{-3}$) giant exoplanet in a dynamically complex system. Using photometry from Tierras, TRAPPIST-North, and multiple LCOGT sites, we constrain the transit center time to $T_{C,6} = 2460438.889 \pm 0.049$ BJD TDB. This marks only the second ground-based detection of HIP 41378 f, currently the longest-period and longest-duration transiting exoplanet observed from the ground. We use this new detection to update the TTV solution for HIP 41378 f and refine the predicted times of its next two transits in November 2025 and April 2027. Incorporating new TESS Sector 88 data, we also rule out the 101-day orbital period alias for HIP 41378 d, and find that the remaining viable solutions are centered on the 278, 371, and 1113-day aliases. The latter two imply dynamical configurations that challenge the canonical view of planet e as the dominant perturber of planet f. Our results suggest that HIP 41378 d may instead play the leading role in shaping the TTV of HIP 41378 f.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional Transport-induced Chemistry on Temperate sub-Neptune K2-18b, Part I: the Effects of Atmospheric Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23891v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The low equilibrium temperatures of temperate sub-Neptunes lead to extremely long chemical timescales in their upper atmospheres, causing the abundances of chemical species to be strongly shaped by atmospheric transport. Here, we used a three-dimensional (3D) general circulation model involving a passive tracer to investigate the atmospheric circulation and 3D transport of temperate gas-rich sub-Neptunes, using K2-18b as an example. We model K2-18b as a synchronous or asynchronous rotator, exploring spin-orbit resonances (SOR) of 2:1, 6:1, and 10:1. We find that the strong absorption of CO$_2$ and CH$_4$ induces a detached convective zone between 1 and 5 bar, resulting in strong vertical mixing at these levels. The upper atmosphere is dominated by eastward winds (an equatorial superrotating jet present in all simulations), leading to warmer evening terminators and approximately 20% higher passive tracer mass mixing ratios compared to the morning terminators. Rotation rates have minimal impact on the strength of global mean vertical mixing, but significantly influence the latitudinal distribution of passive tracers. For synchronous, 2:1 SOR, and 6:1 SOR simulations, passive tracers are more abundant in the upwelling branches at latitudes within 60$^\circ$, while for the 10:1 SOR simulation, strong transient eddies at high latitudes (&gt;70$^\circ$) between 0.1 to 1 bar can transport passive tracers upward from the deep atmosphere, making them more abundant there, despite their alignment with the downwelling branch of the large-scale circulation. This study focuses on the atmospheric dynamics and its influence on passive tracer transport, while a follow-up paper will incorporate active chemical species.</description>

      <title>Extreme Forward Scattering Observed in Disk-Averaged Near-Infrared Phase Curves of Titan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Titan, with its thick and hazy atmosphere, is a key world in our solar system for understanding light scattering processes. NASA's Cassini mission monitored Titan between 2004 and 2017, where the derived dataset includes a large number of whole disk observations. Once spatially integrated, these whole disk observations reveal Titan's phase-dependent brightness which can serve as an analog for how hazy worlds might appear around other stars. To explore Titan's phase curve, we present a pipeline for whole disk Titan observations acquired by the Cassini Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) spanning 0.9--5.1 $\mu$m. Application of the pipeline finds over 4,400 quality spatially- and spectrally-resolved datacubes that were then integrated over Titan's disk to yield phase curves spanning 2--165\degree{} in phase angle. Spectra at near-full phase provide a useful approximation for Titan's geometric albedo, thus extending the spectral coverage of previous work. Crescent phase brightness enhancements in the Cassini VIMS phase curves are often more extreme than analogous results seen at optical wavelengths, which can be explained by atmospheric transparency and haze scattering processes. These results provide validation opportunities for exoplanet-focused spectral models and also shed light on how extreme aerosol forward scattering could influence exoplanet observations and interpretations.</description>

      <title>Planet-induced Gas and Dust Substructure Feedbacks on Disk Thermal Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Protoplanets can interact with their natal disks and generate gas and dust substructures such as gaps and rings. However, how these planet-induced substructures affect the disk temperature, and how that in turn influences the substructures, remains unclear. We aim to study disk substructures and the thermal structure self-consistently and explore their impact on volatile distribution. To this end, we perform iterative multi-fluid hydrodynamical and radiative transfer simulations of planet-disk interactions. We find that the temperature in a structured disk deviates significantly from that of a smooth disk due to giant planet formation. In particular, midplane temperatures in gaps can increase by tens of Kelvin, leading to volatile sublimation as well as radial shifts and multiplication of icelines. Comparing our multi-dust models with previous gas-only models, we find that the former produces slightly shallower gaps and temperatures about 10 K ($\sim25\%$) higher. Furthermore, the temperature at dust rings formed by pressure bumps can drop by several Kelvin, creating volatile freeze-out regions. Nevertheless, the overall midplane ice distribution is not strongly sensitive to whether dust is included. We also investigate the effect of varying disk viscosity. Increasing $\alpha$ viscosity from $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-2}$ leads to a roughly 10 K ($\sim25\%$) warmer midplane due to enhanced vertical dust mixing. However, higher viscosity suppresses gap opening and reduces the temperature enhancement within gaps. As a result, iceline locations do not follow a simple trend with viscosity. Finally, we propose an observational strategy using ALMA to test our predicted temperature changes within disk gaps.</description>
