      <title>Existence of Multilateral Nash equilibria for families of games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces two fundamentally new concepts to game theory: multilateral Nash equilibria and families of games. Starting with non-cooperative games, we show how these notions together seamlessly integrate into and naturally extend the classical theory, and simultaneously enable us to prove a powerful (multilateral) Nash equilibrium existence result with minimal assumptions on the game. Classically, a Nash equilibrium is a global strategy such that whichever player unilaterally deviates from the equilibrium, also reduces his own profit. For a k-lateral Nash equilibrium we now require that whichever group of k players collectively changes their strategies, also reduces all of the deviating players' profits. In this way, we obtain a filtration of equilibria, where the higher-lateral equilibria are less frequent. Furthermore, we derive an existence criterion for multilateral Nash equilibria and demonstrate how it reflects the increasing rarity of higher-lateral equilibria. Additionally, we show that some classical games have higher-lateral Nash equilibria, which in every case reveal the structure of these games from a new point of view. A family of games is a parameterized collection of non-cooperative games, where the parameter affects every aspect of the game. Typically, we assume that this dependence is continuous, thereby introducing a new structure. That way, we can avoid analyzing the games one at a time, and instead treat the family as a whole. This allows the parameter to take a central role in our theory, and shifts our attention from seeking a special strategy to searching for a special game with preferred strategies. Our main result proves the existence of a multilateral equilibrium in a family of games, maintaining minimalistic assumptions on the games individually. Surprisingly, the clique covering number of the Kneser graph makes a central appearance.</description>

      <title>Impossible by Degrees: Cohomology &amp; Bistable Visual Paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Penrose triangle, staircase, and related ``impossible objects'' have long been understood as related to first cohomology $H^1$: the obstruction to extending locally consistent interpretations around a loop. This paper develops a cohomological hierarchy for a class of visual paradoxes. Restricting to systems built from \emph{bistable} elements -- components admitting exactly two local states, such as the Necker cube's forward/backward orientations, a gear's clockwise/counterclockwise spin, or a rhombic tiling corner's convex/concave interpretation -- allows the use of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ coefficients throughout, reducing obstruction theory to parity arithmetic. This reveals a hierarchy of paradox classes from $H^0$ through $H^2$, refined at each degree by the relative/absolute distinction, ranging from ambiguity through impossibility to inaccessibility. A discrete Stokes theorem emerges as the central tool: at each degree, the connecting homomorphism of relative cohomology promotes boundary data to interior obstruction, providing the uniform mechanism by which paradoxes ascend the hierarchy.
  Three paradigmatic systems -- Necker cube fields, gear meshes, and rhombic tilings -- are studied in detail. Throughout, we pair cohomology with imagery and animation. To illuminate the underlying structure, we introduce the \emph{Method of Monodromic Apertures}, an animation technique that reveals monodromy through a configuration space of local sections.</description>

      <title>A homotopical Dold-Kan correspondence for Joyal's category $\Theta$ and other test categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for any test category $A$, in the sense of Grothendieck, satisfying a compatibility condition between homology equivalences and weak equivalences of presheaves, the homotopy category of abelian presheaves on $A$ is equivalent to the non-negative derived category of abelian groups. This provides a homotopical generalization of the Dold-Kan correspondence for presheaves of abelian groups over a wide range of test categories. This equivalence of homotopy categories comes from a Quillen equivalence for a model structure on abelian presheaves that we introduce under these conditions. We then show that this result applies to Joyal's category $\Theta$.</description>

      <title>Simple connectedness of the Ran space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09815v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The space of all finite non-empty subsets of a topological space $X$, also known as the Ran space of $X$, is weakly contractible for $X$ path connected. We consider subspaces $\mathrm{Ran}_{\leqslant n}(X)$ of the Ran space given by all subsets of $X$ of size at most $n$, and present results on their first homotopy groups. In particular, we show that the induced map $\pi_1(\mathrm{Ran}_{\leqslant n}(X)) \to \pi_1(\mathrm{Ran}_{\leqslant n+2}(X))$ is trivial for all positive integers $n$, and even more, show that $\pi_1(\mathrm{Ran}_{\leqslant n}(X)) = 0$ for all $n\geqslant 4$, by explicitly drawing the path homotopies that contract any loop to a point.</description>

      <title>Geometric differentiation of simplicial manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a complete geometric solution to the differentiation problem for simplicial manifolds, extending classical Lie theory and subsuming existing homotopical and formal approaches within a unified framework. First, we establish a normal form theorem setting a system of compatible tubular neighborhoods. Building on this description, we identify a differentiating ideal in the algebra of cochains, prove that the quotient is semi-free, and interpret it as the Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra of the thus defined higher Lie algebroid. As an application, we introduce a higher version of the van Est map and prove a van Est isomorphism theorem in cohomology, under natural connectivity assumptions. Finally, we identify the algebraic mechanism underlying geometric differentiation as a monoidal refinement of the dual Dold-Kan correspondence, providing a conceptual explanation of the construction and relating it to earlier homotopical and functor-of-points approaches.</description>

      <title>Simplicity of confinement in SU(3) Yang-Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel observable associated to Abelian monopole currents defined in the Maximal Abelian Projection of SU(3) Yang-Mills theory that captures the topology of the current loop. This observable, referred to as the $\textit{simplicity}$, is defined as the ratio of the zeroth over the first Betti number of the current graph for a given field configuration. A numerical study of the expectation value of the simplicity performed in the framework of Lattice Gauge Theories enables us to determine the deconfinement temperature to a higher degree of accuracy than that reached by conventional methods at a comparable computational effort. Our results suggest that Abelian current loops are strongly correlated with the degrees of freedoms of the theory that determine confinement. Our investigation opens new perspectives for the definition of an order parameter for deconfinement in Quantum Chromodynamics able to expose the potentially rich phase structure of the theory.</description>

      <title>Local Topological Constraints on Berry Curvature in Spin--Orbit Coupled BECs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19282v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a local topological obstruction to the simultaneous flattening of Berry curvature in spin--orbit-coupled Bose--Einstein condensates (SOC BECs), which remains valid even when the global Chern number vanishes. For a generic two-component SOC BEC, the extended parameter space is the total space $M$ of a principal $U(1)_+ \times U(1)_-$ bundle over the Brillouin torus $T^{2}_{\mathrm{BZ}}$. On $M$, we construct a Kaluza--Klein metric and a natural metric connection $\nabla^{C}$ whose torsion 3-form encodes the synthetic gauge fields.
  Under the physically relevant assumption of constant Berry curvatures, the harmonic part of this torsion defines a mixed cohomology class $[\omega] \in \bigl(H^{2}(T^{2}_{\mathrm{BZ}}) \otimes H^{1}(S^{1}_{\phi_{+}})\bigr) \oplus \bigl(H^{2}(T^{2}_{\mathrm{BZ}}) \otimes H^{1}(S^{1}_{\phi_{-}})\bigr) $ with mixed tensor rank $r=1$. By adapting the Pigazzini--Toda (PT) lower bound to the Kaluza--Klein setting through explicit pointwise curvature analysis, we demonstrate that the obstruction kernel $\mathcal{K}$ vanishes for the physical metric, yielding the sharp inequality $\dim \mathfrak{hol}^{\mathrm{off}}(\nabla^{C}) \geq 1$. This bound forces the existence of at least one off-diagonal curvature operator, preventing the complete gauging-away of Berry phases even in regimes with zero net topological charge. This work provides the first cohomological lower bound, based on the PT framework, certifying locally irremovable curvature in SOC BECs beyond the Chern-number paradigm.</description>
