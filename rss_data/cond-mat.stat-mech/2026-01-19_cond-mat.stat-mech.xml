      <title>L\'evy walkers inside spherical shells with absorbing boundaries: Towards settling the optimal L\'evy walk strategy for random searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The L\'evy flight foraging hypothesis states that organisms must have evolved adaptations to exploit L\'evy walk search strategies. Indeed, it is widely accepted that inverse square L\'evy walks optimize the search efficiency in foraging with unrestricted revisits (also known as non-destructive foraging). However, a mathematically rigorous demonstration of this for dimensions $D \geq 2$ is still lacking. Here we study the very closely related problem of a L\'evy walker inside annuli or spherical shells with absorbing boundaries. In the limit that corresponds to the foraging with unrestricted revisits, we show that inverse square L\'evy walks optimize the search. This constitutes the strongest formal result to date supporting the optimality of inverse square L\'evy walks search strategies.</description>

      <title>Eigen Microstate Condensation and Critical Phenomena in the Lennard-Jones Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite extensive study of the liquid-gas phase transition, accurately determining the critical point and the critical exponents in fluid systems through direct simulation remains a challenge. We employ the eigen microstate theory (EMT) to investigate the liquid-gas continuous phase transition in the Lennard-Jones (LJ) fluid within the canonical ensemble. In EMT, the probability amplitudes of eigen microstates serve as the order parameter. Using finite-size scaling of probability amplitudes, we simultaneously determine the critical temperature, $T_c = 1.188(2)$, and critical density, $\rho_c = 0.320(4)$. Furturemore, we obtain critical exponents of the LJ fluid, $\beta = 0.32(2)$ and $\nu = 0.64(3)$, which demonstrate a great agreement with the Ising universality class. This method also reveals the mesoscopic structure of the emergent phase, characterizing the three-dimensional (3D) spatial configuration of the fluid in the critical region. This work also confirms the finite-size scaling behavior of the probability amplitudes of the eigen microstates in the critical region. The EMT provides a powerful tool for studying the critical phenomena of complex fluid system.</description>

      <title>Exact solution of a two-dimensional (2D) Ising model with the next nearest interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exact solution of a two-dimensional (2D) Ising model with the next nearest interactions at zero magnetic field is derived. At first, the transfer matrices are analyzed in three representations, i.e., Clifford algebraic representation, transfer tensor representation and schematic representation, to inspect nontrivial topological structures in this system. The system is equivalent to a triangular Ising model plus an interaction along the z axis, so that the approaches developed for the 3D Ising model are modified to be appropriable for solving the exact solution of the 2D Ising model with the next nearest interactions. The partition function and the spontaneous magnetization are obtained. The comparison with the exact solutions of other Ising lattices reveals that either the increase of the number of interactions in a unit cell or the presence/increase of topological contributions enhances the critical point of the Ising lattices. The results obtained in this work are helpful for understanding the physical properties of the 2D magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Irreversible Kinetics Emerges from Bayesian Inference over Admissible Histories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A probabilistic formulation of irreversible kinetics is introduced in which incrementally admissible histories are weighted by a Gibbs-type measure built from an energy-dissipation action and observation constraints, with Theta controlling epistemic uncertainty. This measure can be interpreted as a Bayesian posterior over histories. In the zero-uncertainty limit, it concentrates on maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) histories, recovering classical deterministic evolution by incremental minimization in the convex generalized-standard-material setting, while allowing multiple competing MAP histories for non-convex energies or temporally coupled constraints. This emergence is demonstrated across seven distinct forward-in-time examples and an inverse inference problem of unknown histories from sparse observations via a global constrained minimum-action principle.</description>

      <title>Exact and Approximate Constants of Motion in Stochastic Contact Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a variety of stochastic contact processes -- directly related to models of rumor and disease spreading -- from the viewpoint of their constants of motion, either exact or approximated. Much as in deterministic systems, constants of motion in stochastic dynamics make it possible to reduce the number of relevant variables, confining the set of accessible states, and thus facilitating their analytical treatment. For processes of rumor propagation based on the Maki-Thompson model, we show how to construct exact constants of motion as linear combinations of conserved quantities in each elementary contact event, and how they relate to the constants of motion of the corresponding mean-field equations, which are obtained as the continuous-time, large-size limit of the stochastic process. For SIR epidemic models, both in homogeneous systems and on heterogeneous networks, we find that a similar procedure produces approximate constants of motion, whose average value is preserved along the evolution. We also give examples of exact and approximate constants of motion built as nonlinear combinations of the relevant variables, whose expressions are suggested by their mean-field counterparts.</description>

      <title>Exponential gain in clock precision using quantum correlated ticks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Creating precise timing devices at ultra-short time scales is not just an important technological challenge, but confronts us with foundational questions about timekeeping's ultimate precision limits. Research on clocks has either focused on long-term stability using an oscillator stabilized by a level transition, limiting precision at short timescales, or on making individual stochastic ticks as precise as possible. Here, we prove the viability of a conceptually different avenue: the autonomous self-correction of consecutive ticks by quantum correlations. This provides a new paradigm that integrates the advantages and insights from quantum transport theory to operate clocks at ultra-short timescales. We fully solve a model of coupled quantum systems and show how the emergent Pauli exclusion principle correlates the clock at the quantum level yielding an exponential advantage in precision. We furthermore demonstrate through simulations with realistic imperfections that this remarkable gain in precision remains stable providing a roadmap for implementation with contemporary quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Critical non-equilibrium phases from noisy topological memories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of an extended non-equilibrium critical phase, characterized by sub-exponential decay of conditional mutual information (CMI), in the surface code subject to heralded random Pauli measurement channels. By mapping the resulting mixed state to the ensemble of completely packed loops on a square lattice, we relate the extended phase to the Goldstone phase of the loop model. In particular, CMI is controlled by the characteristic length scale of loops, and we use analytic results of the latter to establish polylogarithmic decay of CMI in the critical phase. We find that the critical phase retains partial logical information that can be recovered by a global decoder, but not by any quasi-local decoder. To demonstrate this, we introduce a diagnostic called punctured coherent information which provides a necessary condition for quasi-local decoding.</description>

      <title>Parent Hamiltonians for stabilizer quantum many-body scars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) have attracted considerable interest due to their role in weak ergodicity breaking in many-body systems. We present a general construction that embeds stabilizer states as QMBS of local Hamiltonians. The method relies on a notion of factorizability of Pauli strings on a lattice, which is used to convert stabilizer elements into local, few-body operators that annihilate the stabilizer state. This enables the systematic construction of parent Hamiltonians with zero-energy stabilizer QMBS typically near the middle of the spectrum. The method reproduces several known results in a unified framework, including recent examples of volume-law entangled QMBS, such as the ``rainbow'' QMBS and the entangled antipodal Bell pair state. We also apply the framework to construct examples of stabilizer QMBS with a more complex entanglement structure, such as the cluster state, the toric code state, and a volume-law entangled state we dub the antipodal toric code (ATC) state. Exact diagonalization confirms our results and reveal the stabilizer states as exact eigenstates of their parent Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Entanglement complexity of spanning pairs of lattice polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the entanglement complexity of a system consisting of two simple-closed curves (self-avoiding polygons) that span a lattice tube, referred to as a 2SAP. 2SAPs are of interest as the first known model of confined ring polymers where the linking probability goes to 1 exponentially with the size of the system. Atapour et al proved this in 2010 by showing that all but exponentially few sufficiently large 2SAPs contain a pattern that guarantees the 2SAP is non-split, provided that the requisite pattern fits in the tube. This result was recently extended to all tubes sizes that admit non-trivial links. Here we develop and apply knot theory results to answer more general questions about the entanglement complexity of 2SAPs.
  We first extend the 1992 concept of a good measure of knot complexity to a good measure, $F$, of spanning-link complexity for $k$-component links. Using tangle products, we show, for example, that the more complex the prime knot decomposition of any component of a given link type, the greater its $F$-measure. We then prove that all but exponentially few size $m$ 2SAPs have $F$ complexity that grows at least linearly in $m$ as $m\to \infty$. We establish that good measures of knot complexity yield good measures of spanning-link complexity. We also establish conditions whereby more general link invariants can yield good measures. In particular, we establish that measures based on several classical invariants are good measures by our definition, eg bridge number or the number of $p$-colourings.
  Finally, we consider how the tube dimensions affect which links are embeddable as 2SAPs as well as geometric restrictions on the entanglement complexity of the embeddings. For example, we establish that there are two-component links that occur as 2SAPs in a given tube size only when one of the components is forced into a non-minimal bridge number conformation.</description>

      <title>The distribution of the maximum of independent resetting Brownian motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The probability distribution of the maximum $M_t$ of a single resetting Brownian motion (RBM) of duration $t$ and resetting rate $r$, properly centred and scaled, is known to converge to the standard Gumbel distribution of the classical extreme value theory. This Gumbel law describes the typical fluctuations of $M_t$ around its average $\sim \ln (r t)$ for large $t$ on a scale of $O(1)$. Here we compute the large-deviation tails of this distribution when $M_t = O(t)$ and show that the large-deviation function has a singularity where the second derivative is discontinuous, signalling a dynamical phase transition. Then we consider a collection of independent RBMs with initial (and resetting) positions uniformly distributed with a density $\rho$ over the negative half-line. We show that the fluctuations in the initial positions of the particles modify the distribution of $M_t$. The average over the initial conditions can be performed in two different ways, in analogy with disordered systems: (i) the annealed case where one averages over all possible initial conditions and (ii) the quenched case where one considers only the contributions coming from typical initial configurations. We show that in the annealed case, the limiting distribution of the maximum is characterized by a new scaling function, different from the Gumbel law but the large-deviation function remains the same as in the single particle case. In contrast, for the quenched case, the limiting (typical) distribution remains Gumbel but the large-deviation behaviors are new and nontrivial. Our analytical results, both for the typical as well as for the large-deviation regime of $M_t$, are verified numerically with extremely high precision, down to $10^{-250}$ for the probability density of $M_t$.</description>

Abstract: We derive and classify properties of the power-spectrum tensor for systems in general steady-states, including stationary states not necessarily corresponding to equilibrium configurations. We establish a rigorous connection between the power-spectrum tensor and other quantities that characterize these systems, providing a systematic comparison with their equilibrium counterparts. As a physical application, we investigate the problem of quantum friction, describing the contactless quantum-electrodynamic drag acting on a particle moving in close proximity to material bodies at zero temperature. Specifically, we demonstrate how including additional information about the system's physical properties facilitates the derivation of more precise constraints on the power spectrum and its functional dependencies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) underpins much of our modern understanding of the thermalization of closed quantum many-body systems. Here, we investigate the statistical properties of observables in the eigenbasis of the Lindbladian operator of a Markovian open quantum system. We demonstrate the validity of a Lindbladian ETH ansatz through extensive numerical simulations of several physical models. To highlight the robustness of Lindbladian ETH, we consider what we dub the dilute-click regime of the model, in which one postselects only quantum trajectories with a finite fraction of quantum jumps. The average dynamics are generated by a non-trace-preserving Liouvillian, and we show that the Lindbladian ETH ansatz still holds in this case. On the other hand, the no-click limit is a singular point at which the Lindbladian reduces to a doubled non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and Lindbladian ETH breaks down.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09145v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the finite-timestep Brownian dynamics of a single particle confined in one dimension, with a nonuniform temperature profile. In such an open-boundary scenario, one cannot observe any net probability current in the nonequilibrium steady state (NESS). On the other hand, the nonequilibrium nature of this system is exhibited through the asymmetry in forward and backward transition probabilities, as is reported in this work through the stochastic simulation analysis and theoretical arguments. The irreversibility becomes prominent nearby the temperature interface. We propose that the observed irreversibility can be accounted for via a virtual-gyration scenario, while the collapse of virtual gyrations upon the one-dimensional coordinate leads to the absence of probability current.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy of timescales in a disordered spin-$1/2$ XX ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20078v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the timescales associated with relaxation to equilibrium in closed quantum many-body systems is one of the central focuses in the study of their non-equilibrium dynamics. At late times, these relaxation processes exhibit universal behavior, emerging from the inherent randomness of chaotic Hamiltonians. In this work, we investigate a disordered spin-$1/2$ XX ladder - an experimentally realizable model known for its diffusive dynamics - to explore the connection between transport properties and spectral measures derived solely from the system's energy levels via these relaxation timescales. We begin by analyzing the spectral form factor, which yields the time when the system begins to follow the random matrix theory (RMT) statistics, known as the RMT time. We then determine the Thouless times - the average times for a local excitation to diffuse across the entire finite system - through the linear-response theory for both spin and energy transport. Our numerical results confirm that the RMT time scales quadratically with system size and upper bounds the Thouless times. Interestingly, we also find that, unlike other non-integrable models, spin diffusion proceeds faster than energy diffusion.</description>

      <title>The Wishart--Rosenzweig--Porter random matrix ensemble</title>

Abstract: In recent years the Rosenzweig--Porter (RP) ensemble, obtained by adding a diagonal matrix with independent and identically distributed elements to a Gaussian random matrix, has been widely used as a minimal model for the emergence of fractal eigenstates in complex many-body systems. A key open question concerns the robustness of its phase diagram when the assumption of independent and uncorrelated entries is relaxed -- an assumption that simplifies its analysis, but is generally violated in realistic quantum systems. In this work, we take a first step in this direction by considering a deformed Wishart (rather than Gaussian) random matrix, which we dub the ``Wishart--RP'' ensemble. Using perturbation theory, as well as the cavity and replica methods and the Dyson Brownian motion approach, we characterize its phase diagram and localization properties. Remarkably, we show that the level compressibility, which quantifies spectral correlations in the fractal phase, coincides with that of the Gaussian RP model, thereby extending the universality conjectured in [SciPost Phys. 14, 110 (2023)] beyond the fully uncorrelated setting. We confirm our results with numerical tests.</description>

Abstract: Linear response theory has found many applications in statistical physics. One of these is to compute minimal-work protocols that drive nonequilibrium systems between different thermodynamic states, which are useful for designing engineered nanoscale systems and understanding biomolecular machines. We compare and explore the relationships between linear-response-based approximations used to study optimal protocols in different driving regimes by showing that they arise as controlled truncations of a general causal response (Volterra) expansion. We then construct higher-order response terms and discuss the drawbacks and utility of their inclusion. We illustrate our results for an overdamped particle in a harmonic trap, ultimately showing that the inclusion of higher-order response in calculating optimal protocols provides marginal improvement in effectiveness despite incurring a significant computational expense, while introducing the possibility of predicting arbitrarily low and unphysical negative excess work.</description>

      <title>Unavoidable Canonical Nonlinearity Induced by Gaussian Measures Discretization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08381v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When we consider canonical averages for classical discrete systems, typically referred to as substitutional alloys, the map phi from many-body interatomic interactions to thermodynamic equilibrium configurations generally exhibits complicated nonlinearity. This canonical nonlinearity is fundamentally rooted in deviations of the discrete configurational density of states (CDOS) from continuous Gaussian families, and has conventionally been characterized by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence on discrete statistical manifold. Thus, the previous works inevitablly missed intrinsic nonlinearities induced by discretization of Gaussian families, which remains invisible within conventional information-geometric descriptions. In the present work, we identify and quantify such unavoidable canonical nonlinearity by employing the 2-Wasserstein distance with a cost function aligned with the Fisher metric for Gaussian families. We derive an explicit expression for the Wasserstein distance in the limit of vanishing discretization scale d to 0: W2 = d*sqrt(Tr(Gamma)^(-1)/12), where Gamma denotes covariance matrix of the CDOS. We further show that this limiting Wasserstein distance admits a clear geometric interpretation on the statistical manifold, equivalent to a KL divergence associated with the expected parallel translations of continuous Gaussian. Our framework thus provides a transport-information-geometric characterization of discretization-induced nonlinearity in classical discrete systems. In addition, we confirm that this W2-KL equivalence admits a natural generalization beyond Gaussian families, provided that the transport cost is aligned with the Fisher metric of an underlying statistical submanifold and the discretization scale induces infinitesimal parameter variations.</description>

      <title>A Strategy for Proving the Strong Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis : Chaotic Systems and Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09746v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The strong eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) provides a sufficient condition for thermalization and equilibration. Although it is expected to be hold in a wide class of highly chaotic theories, there are only a few analytic examples demonstrating the strong ETH in special cases, often through methods related to integrability. In this paper, we explore sufficient conditions for the strong ETH that may apply to a broad range of chaotic theories. These conditions are expressed as inequalities involving the long-time averages of real-time thermal correlators. Specifically, as an illustration, we consider simple toy examples which satisfy these conditions under certain technical assumptions. This toy models have same properties as holographic theories at least in the perturbation in large $N$. We give a few comments for more realistic holographic models.</description>

      <title>Discontinuous percolation via suppression of neighboring clusters in a network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02336v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our recent study on the Bethe lattice reported that a discontinuous percolation transition emerges as the number of occupied links increases and each node rewires its links to locally suppress the growth of neighboring clusters. However, since the Bethe lattice is a tree, a macroscopic cluster forms as an infinite spanning tree but does not contain a finite fraction of the nodes. In this paper, we study a bipartite network that can be regarded as a locally tree-like structure with long-range neighbors. In this network, each node in one of the two partitions is allowed to rewire its links to nodes in the other partition to suppress the growth of neighboring clusters. We observe a discontinuous percolation transition characterized by the emergence of a single macroscopic cluster containing a finite fraction of nodes, followed by critical behavior of the cluster size distribution. We also provide an analytical explanation of the underlying mechanism.</description>

      <title>Planckian bound on quantum dynamical entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20914v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a simple definition of dynamical entropy for quantum systems under continuous monitoring, inspired by Connes, Narnhofer and Thirring. It quantifies the amount of information gained about the initial condition. A nonzero entropy rate can be obtained by monitoring the thermal fluctuation of an extensive observable in a generic many-body system (away from classical or large N limit). We explicitly compute the entropy rate in the thermodynamic and long-time limit, in terms of the two-point correlation functions. We conjecture a universal Planckian bound for the entropy rate. Related results on the purification rate are also obtained.</description>

      <title>Time Evolution of Multi-Party Entanglement Signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the real-time dynamics of multi-party entanglement signals in chaotic quantum many-body systems including but not necessarily restricted to holographic conformal field theories. We find that scrambling dynamics generates multiparty entanglement with rich structure including: (a) qualitatively different dynamical behaviours for different signals, likely reflecting different dynamics for different kinds of entanglement patterns, (b) discontinuities indicating dynamical phase transitions in the entanglement structure, (c) transient and non-monotonic multiparty entanglement, and (d) periods during which the extensive entanglement of some regions is entirely multipartite. Our main technical tool is the membrane theory of entanglement dynamics.</description>

      <title>Topological BF Theory construction of twisted dihedral quantum double phases from spontaneous symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonabelian topological orders host exotic anyons central to quantum computing, yet established realizations rely on case-by-case constructions that are often conceptually involved. In this work, we present a systematic construction of nonabelian dihedral quantum double phases based on a continuous $O(2)$ gauge field. We first formulate a topological $S[O(2)\times O(2)]$ BF theory, and by identifying the Wilson loops and twist operators of this theory with anyons, we show that our topological BF theory reproduces the complete anyon data, and can incorporate all Dijkgraaf--Witten twists. Building on this correspondence, we present a microscopic model with $O(2)$ lattice gauge field coupled to Ising and rotor matter whose Higgsing yields the desired dihedral quantum double phase. A perturbative renormalization group analysis further suggests a direct transition from this phase to a $U(1)$ Coulomb or chiral topological phase at a stable multicritical point with emergent $O(3)$ symmetry. Our proposal offers an alternative route to nonabelian topological order with promising prospects in synthetic gauge field platforms.</description>
