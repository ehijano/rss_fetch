      <title>Congruence subgroups of braid groups and crystallographic quotients. Part II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following previous work on congruence subgroups and crystallographic braid groups, we study the lower central series of congruence braid groups related to the braid group $B_3$, showing in particular that corresponding quotients are almost crystallographic.</description>

      <title>Group theory in OSCAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: OSCAR is an innovative new computer algebra system which combines and extends the power of its four cornerstone systems - GAP (group theory), Singular (algebra and algebraic geometry), Polymake (polyhedral geometry), and Antic (number theory). Assuming little familiarity with the subject, we give an introduction to computations in group theory using OSCAR, as a chapter of the upcoming OSCAR book.</description>

      <title>Extremely closed subgroups and a variant on Glauberman's $Z^*$-theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group and let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$. We say that $H$ is extremely closed in $G$ if $\langle H,H^g\rangle\cap N_G(H)=H$ for all $g\in G.$ In this paper, we determine the structure of finite groups with an extremely closed abelian $p$-subgroup for some prime $p$. In particular, we show that if $G$ contains such a subgroup $H$, then $G=N_G(H)O_{p'}(G).$ This is a variant on the celebrated Glauberman's $Z^*$-Theorem.</description>

      <title>A generalization of concise words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of verbal subgroups within a group is well-known for being an effective tool to obtain structural information about a group. Therefore, conditions that allow the classification of words in a free group are of paramount importance. One of the most studied problems is to establish which words are concise, where a word $w$ is said to be concise if the verbal subgroup $w(G)$ is finite in each group $G$ in which $w$ takes only a finite number of values.
  The purpose of this article is to present some results, in which a hierarchy among words is introduced, generalizing the concept of concise word.</description>

      <title>Inverse Sets and Inverse Correspondences Over Inverse Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce notions called inverse set and inverse correspondence over inverse semigroups. These are analogies of Hilbert $C^*$-modules and \Ccorrs in the $C^*$-algebra theory. We show that inverse semigroups and inverse correspondences form a bicategory. In this bicategory, two inverse semigroups are equivalent if and only if they are Morita equivalent.</description>

      <title>The walled Brauer category and stable cohomology of $\mathrm{IA}_n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The IA-automorphism group is the group of automorphisms of the free group $F_n$ that act trivially on the abelianization $F_n^{\mathrm{ab}}$. This group is in many ways analoguous to Torelli groups of surfaces and their higher dimensional analogues. In recent work, the stable rational cohomology of such groups was studied by Kupers and Randal-Williams, using the machinery of so-called Brauer categories. In this paper, we adapt their methods to study the stable rational cohomology of the IA-automorphism group. We obtain a conjectural description of the algebraic part of the stable rational cohomology and prove that it holds up to degree $Q+1$, given the assumption that the stable cohomology groups are stably finite dimensional in degrees up to $Q$. In particular, this allows us to compute the algebraic part of the stable cohomology in degree 2, which we show agrees with the part generated by the first cohomology group via the cup product map and which has previously been computed by Pettet.
  In the appendix, written by Mai Katada, it is shown how the results of the paper can be applied to compute the stable Albanese (co)homology of the IA-automorphism group.</description>

      <title>Groups with presentations in EDT0L</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To any family of languages LAN, let us associate the class, denoted $\pi(\text{LAN})$, of finitely generated groups that admit a group presentation whose set of relators forms a language in LAN. We show that the class of L-presented groups, as introduced by the first author in 2003, is exactly the class of groups that admit presentations in the family of languages EDT0L. We show that the marked isomorphism problem is not semi-decidable for groups given by EDT0L presentations, contrary to the finite presentation case. We then extend and unify results of the first author with Eick and Hartung about nilpotent and finite quotients, by showing that it is possible to compute the marked hyperbolic and marked metabelian quotients of a group given by an EDT0L presentation. Finally, we show how the results about quotient computations enable the construction of recursively presented groups that do not have EDT0L presentations, thus proving $\pi(\text{EDT0L})\ne \pi(\text{REC})$. This is done by building a residually nilpotent group with solvable word problem whose sequence of maximal nilpotent quotients is non-computable.</description>

      <title>Strong 1-boundedness, $L^2$-Betti numbers, algebraic soficity, and graph products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that graph products of non trivial finite dimensional von Neumann algebras are strongly 1-bounded when the underlying *-algebra has vanishing first L2-Betti number. The proof uses a combination of the following two key ideas to obtain lower bounds on the Fuglede-Kadison determinant of matrix polynomials in a generating set: a notion called ''algebraic soficity'' for *-algebras allowing for the existence of Galois bounded microstates with asymptotically constant diagonals; a probabilistic construction of the authors of permutation models for graph independence over the diagonal.</description>
