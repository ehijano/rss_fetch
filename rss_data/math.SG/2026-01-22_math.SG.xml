      <title>Contactomorphic vertically convex domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the standard Darboux space equipped with the radial symmetric contact form. We study co-orientation preserving contactomorphisms between relatively compact domains up to the boundary. We determine the contactomorphism classes among all strict vertically convex domains over a round ball in the Liouville hyperplane that are radially symmetric about the Reeb axis and whose boundary coincide along a neighbourhood of the common equator. The total invariant is the mean curvature of the bounding sphere at the umbilic points with the same sign. Replacing the Liouville hyperplane by codisc bundles of closed non-Besse Riemannian manifolds or finite symplectisations of closed non-Besse strict contact manifolds analogous results are formulated in terms of characteristic length and total characteristic action, resp.</description>

      <title>Majorization between symplectic spectra of positive semidefinite matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given $2n \times 2n$ real symmetric positive semidefinite matrix $A$ with symplectic kernel, there exists a real $2n \times 2n$ \emph{symplectic matrix} $M$ such that $M^TAM= D \oplus D$, where $D$ is an $n \times n$ non-negative diagonal matrix which is unique up to permutation of its diagonal entries.
  The diagonal entries of $D$ are called the \emph{symplectic eigenvalues} or symplectic spectrum of $A$.
  In this work, we investigate some majorization and weak supermajorization relations between the symplectic spectra of two positive semidefinite matrices.
  More explicitly, suppose $A$ and $B$ are $2n \times 2n$ real symmetric positive semidefinite matrices with symplectic kernels.
  We show that if the symplectic spectrum of $A$ is majorized by the symplectic spectrum of $B$, then $A$ lies in the convex hull of the symplectic orbit of $B$.
  We also establish that only a weak converse of this statement holds; i.e., if $A$ lies in the convex hull of the symplectic orbit of $B$ then the symplectic spectrum of $A$ is \emph{weakly supermajorized} by the symplectic spectrum of $B$.
  Several consequences of our results are also presented.
  Our methods make use of well-known connections between the theory of majorization, doubly stochastic, doubly superstochastic, and symplectic matrices.</description>

      <title>Cone structures from a dynamical and probabilistic viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this note is to explore, from a geometric and probabilistic point of view, the dynamics of cone structures adapted to open book decompositions. This is inspired by the picture which arises in the study of the circular restricted three body problem (CR3BP). This yields geometric obstructions to reaching a point from another point in the phase space of the CR3BP.</description>

      <title>On geometric models in representation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geometric models have emerged as an important tool in the representation theory of algebras. Surface models associated to gentle algebras have been particularly fruitful in advancing our understanding of their module and derived categories. We give an overview of some of the theoretical advances that geometric surface models for the derived categories of graded gentle algebras and their connections to Fukaya categories of surfaces have made possible.</description>

      <title>Positroid Links and Braid varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.13948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.13948v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study braid varieties and their relation to open positroid varieties. We discuss four different types of braids associated to open positroid strata and show that their associated Legendrian links are all Legendrian isotopic. In particular, we prove that each open positroid stratum can be presented as the augmentation variety for four different Legendrian fronts described in terms of either permutations, juggling patterns, cyclic rank matrices or Le diagrams. We also relate braid varieties to open Richardson varieties and brick manifolds, showing that the latter provide projective compactifications of braid varieties, with normal crossing divisors at infinity.</description>

      <title>Tropical methods for stable octic double planes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02735v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper has been written to illustrate the power of techniques from tropical geometry and mirror symmetry for studying the KSBA moduli space of surfaces on or near the Noether line. We focus on the moduli space of octic double planes ($K^2 = 2$, $p_g = 3$) and use methods from tropical and toric geometry to classify the strata corresponding to normal KSBA-stable surfaces, focusing on the non-Gorenstein case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06453v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new version of symplectic annular Khovanov homology and establish spectral sequences from (i) the symplectic annular Khovanov homology of a knot to the link Floer homology of the lift of the annular axis in the double branched cover; (ii) the symplectic Khovanov homology of a two-periodic knot to the symplectic annular Khovanov homology of its quotient; and (iii) the symplectic Khovanov homology of a strongly invertible knot to the cone of the axis-moving map between the symplectic annular Khovanov homology of the two resolutions of its quotient.</description>
