      <title>FloorSet - a VLSI Floorplanning Dataset with Design Constraints of Real-World SoCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Floorplanning for systems-on-a-chip (SoCs) and its sub-systems is a crucial and non-trivial step of the physical design flow. It represents a difficult combinatorial optimization problem. A typical large scale SoC with 120 partitions generates a search-space of nearly 10E250. As novel machine learning (ML) approaches emerge to tackle such problems, there is a growing need for a modern benchmark that comprises a large training dataset and performance metrics that better reflect real-world constraints and objectives compared to existing benchmarks. To address this need, we present FloorSet - two comprehensive datasets of synthetic fixed-outline floorplan layouts that reflect the distribution of real SoCs. Each dataset has 1M training samples and 100 test samples where each sample is a synthetic floor- plan. FloorSet-Prime comprises fully-abutted rectilinear partitions and near-optimal wire-length. A simplified dataset that reflects early design phases, FloorSet-Lite comprises rectangular partitions, with under 5 percent white-space and near-optimal wire-length. Both datasets define hard constraints seen in modern design flows such as shape constraints, edge-affinity, grouping constraints, and pre-placement constraints. FloorSet is intended to spur fundamental research on large-scale constrained optimization problems. Crucially, FloorSet alleviates the core issue of reproducibility in modern ML driven solutions to such problems. FloorSet is available as an open-source repository for the research community.</description>

      <title>Shape-Optimized Electrooptic Beam Scanners: Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new horn-shaped electrooptic scanner is described with significantly improved scanning sensitivity over rectangular- shaped devices. In the new device, the shape of the scanner is chosen to follow the trajectory of the beam. An example design is described that exhibits a factor of two larger scanning sensitivity than a rectangular device with comparable maximum scanning angle. Beam propagation simulations and measurements on an experimental device verify the scanner performance.</description>

      <title>TroLLoc: Logic Locking and Layout Hardening for IC Security Closure against Hardware Trojans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to cost benefits, supply chains of integrated circuits (ICs) are largely outsourced nowadays. However, passing ICs through various third-party providers gives rise to many security threats, like piracy of IC intellectual property or insertion of hardware Trojans, i.e., malicious circuit modifications.
  In this work, we proactively and systematically protect the physical layouts of ICs against post-design insertion of Trojans. Toward that end, we propose TroLLoc, a novel scheme for IC security closure that employs, for the first time, logic locking and layout hardening in unison. TroLLoc is fully integrated into a commercial-grade design flow, and TroLLoc is shown to be effective, efficient, and robust. Our work provides in-depth layout and security analysis considering the challenging benchmarks of the ISPD'22/23 contests for security closure. We show that TroLLoc successfully renders layouts resilient, with reasonable overheads, against (i) general prospects for Trojan insertion as in the ISPD'22 contest, (ii) actual Trojan insertion as in the ISPD'23 contest, and (iii) potential second-order attacks where adversaries would first (i.e., before Trojan insertion) try to bypass the locking defense, e.g., using advanced machine learning attacks. Finally, we release all our artifacts for independent verification [2].</description>

      <title>Quantum Computing - A new scientific revolution in the making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.11840v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given the impending timeline of developing good-quality quantum processing units, it is time to rethink the approach to advance quantum computing research. Rather than waiting for quantum hardware technologies to mature, we need to start assessing in tandem the impact of the occurrence of quantum computing, or rather Quantum Computing Logic (QC-Logic), on various scientific fields. This is where the subtitle comes from. A new scientific revolution is unfolding. In making real scientific progress, we need to use an additional and complementary approach, which the NISQ program or any follow-up approach does not propose. We must be aware that defining, implementing, and testing quantum concepts in any field is tremendous work. The main reason is that QC initiates an overall revolution in all scientific fields, and how those machines will be used in daily life is a very big challenge. That is why we propose a complete update of the first PISQ paper. We still advocate the additional PISQ approach: Perfect Intermediate-Scale Quantum computing based on a well-established concept of perfect qubits. We expand the quantum road map with (N)FTQC, which stands for (Non) Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing. This will allow researchers to focus exclusively on developing new applications by defining the algorithms in terms of perfect qubits and evaluating them in two ways. Either executed on quantum computing simulators executed on supercomputers or hardware-based qubit chips. This approach will be explained in this paper. Our planet needs a long-term vision and solution. It will enable universities and companies alike to accelerate the development of new quantum algorithms, build the necessary know-how, and thus address one of the key bottlenecks within the quantum industry: the lack of talent to develop well-tested quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Citadel: Real-World Hardware-Software Contracts for Secure Enclaves Through Microarchitectural Isolation and Controlled Speculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14882v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hardware isolation primitives such as secure enclaves aim to protect sensitive programs, but remain vulnerable to transient execution attacks. Complete microarchitectural isolation is not a satisfactory defense mechanism as it leaves out public shared memory, critical for usability and application performance. Conversely, hardware-software co-designs for secure speculation can counter these attacks but are not yet practical, since they make assumptions on the speculation modes, the exposed microarchitectural state, and the software, which are all hard to support for the entire software stack. This paper advocates for processors to incorporate microarchitectural isolation primitives and mechanisms for controlled speculation, enabling different execution modes. These modes can restrict what is exposed to an attacker, effectively balancing performance and program-analysis complexity. We introduce two mechanisms to securely share memory between an enclave and an untrusted OS in an out-of-order processor. We show that our two modes are complementary, achieving speculative non-interference with a reasonable performance impact, while requiring minimal code annotation and simple program analysis doable by hand. Our prototype, Citadel, is a multicore processor running on an FPGA, booting untrusted Linux, and supporting comprehensive enclave capabilities, such as shared memory, and remote attestation. To our knowledge, Citadel is the first end-to-end enclave platform to run secure applications, such as cryptographic libraries or small private inference workloads, on a speculative out-of-order multicore processor while protecting against a significant class of side-channel attacks.</description>
