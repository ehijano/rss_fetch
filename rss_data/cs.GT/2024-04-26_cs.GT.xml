      <title>Intelligent Machines and Incomplete Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distribution of efficient individuals in the economy and the efforts that they will put in if they are hired, there are two important concerns for a technologically advanced firm. wants to open a new branch. The firm does not have information about the exact level of efficiency of an individual when she is hired. We call this situation incomplete information. The standard principal agent models assume that employees know their efficiency levels. Hence these models design incentive-compatible mechanisms. An incentive-compatible mechanism ensures that a participant does not have the incentive to misreport her efficiency level. This paper does not assume that employees know how efficient they are. This paper assumes that the production technology of the firm is intelligent, that is, the output of the machine reveals the efficiency levels of employees. Employees marginal contributions to the total output of the intelligent machine, the probability distribution of the levels of efficiency and employees costs of efforts together define a game of incomplete information. A characterization of ex-ante Nash Equilibrium is established. The results of the characterization formalize the relationship between the distribution of efficiency levels and the distribution of output.</description>

      <title>A Game-Theoretic Analysis of Auditing Differentially Private Algorithms with Epistemically Disparate Herd</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Privacy-preserving AI algorithms are widely adopted in various domains, but the lack of transparency might pose accountability issues. While auditing algorithms can address this issue, machine-based audit approaches are often costly and time-consuming. Herd audit, on the other hand, offers an alternative solution by harnessing collective intelligence. Nevertheless, the presence of epistemic disparity among auditors, resulting in varying levels of expertise and access to knowledge, may impact audit performance. An effective herd audit will establish a credible accountability threat for algorithm developers, incentivizing them to uphold their claims. In this study, our objective is to develop a systematic framework that examines the impact of herd audits on algorithm developers using the Stackelberg game approach. The optimal strategy for auditors emphasizes the importance of easy access to relevant information, as it increases the auditors' confidence in the audit process. Similarly, the optimal choice for developers suggests that herd audit is viable when auditors face lower costs in acquiring knowledge. By enhancing transparency and accountability, herd audit contributes to the responsible development of privacy-preserving algorithms.</description>
