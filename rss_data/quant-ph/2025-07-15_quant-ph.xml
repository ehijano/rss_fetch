      <title>Relativistic electrodynamics with a universal length scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the analogues of the Dirac and Pauli equations from a spatially fourth-order Klein--Gordon equation with a universal length scale. Starting from a singularly perturbed variant of Maxwell's equations, we deduce a 32-dimensional variant of the Dirac equation for spin-$1/2$ particles through an algebraic factorization procedure. We illustrate an experimental test of the theory from the split lines of the electron beam in a Stern--Gerlach experiment. This hyperfine splitting leads to four distinct eigenvalues of the spin operator, which can be grouped into two pairs centered around the classic values of $\pm\hbar/2$. The modified electrodynamic framework features particle-antiparticle asymmetry and an oriented, micropolar spacetime.</description>

      <title>Variational subspace methods and application to improving variational Monte Carlo dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a formalism that allows for the direct manipulation and optimization of subspaces, circumventing the need to optimize individual states when using subspace methods. Using the determinant state mapping, we can naturally extend notions such as distance and energy to subspaces, as well as Monte Carlo estimators, recovering the excited states estimation method proposed by Pfau et al. As a practical application, we then introduce Bridge, a method that improves the performance of variational dynamics by extracting linear combinations of variational time-evolved states. We find that Bridge is both computationally inexpensive and capable of significantly mitigating the errors that arise from discretizing the dynamics, and can thus be systematically used as a post-processing tool for variational dynamics.</description>

      <title>Long-ranged gates in quantum computation architectures with limited connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a quantum computation architecture based on geometries with nearest-neighbor interactions, including e.g. planar structures. We show how to efficiently split the role of qubits into data and entanglement-generation qubits. Multipartite entangled states, e.g. 2D cluster states, are generated among the latter, and flexibly transformed via mid-circuit measurements to multiple, long-ranged Bell states, which are used to perform several two-qubit gates in parallel on data qubits. We introduce planar architectures with $n$ data and $n$ auxiliary qubits that allow one to perform $O(\sqrt n)$ long-ranged two-qubit gates simultaneously, with only one round of nearest neighbor gates and one round of mid-circuit measurements. We also show that our approach is applicable in existing superconducting quantum computation architectures, with only a constant overhead.</description>

      <title>Robust Chiral Edge Dynamics of a Kitaev Honeycomb on a Trapped Ion Processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kitaev's honeycomb model is a paradigmatic exactly solvable system hosting a quantum spin liquid with non-Abelian anyons and topologically protected edge modes, offering a platform for fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, real candidate Kitaev materials invariably include complex secondary interactions that obscure the realization of spin-liquid behavior and demand novel quantum computational approaches for efficient simulation. Here we report quantum simulations of a 22-site Kitaev honeycomb lattice on a trapped-ion quantum processor, without and with non-integrable Heisenberg interactions that are present in real materials. We develop efficient quantum circuits for ground-state preparation, then apply controlled perturbations and measure time-dependent spin correlations along the system's edge. In the non-Abelian phase, we observe chiral edge dynamics consistent with a nonzero Chern number -- a hallmark of topological order -- which vanishes upon transition to the Abelian toric code phase. Extending to the non-integrable Kitaev-Heisenberg model, we find that weak Heisenberg interactions preserve chiral edge dynamics, while stronger couplings suppress them, signaling the breakdown of topological protection. Our work demonstrates a viable route for probing dynamical signatures of topological order in quantum spin liquids using programmable quantum hardware, opening new pathways for quantum simulation of strongly correlated materials.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithm for Protein Structure Prediction Using the Face-Centered Cubic Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present the first implementation of the face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice model for protein structure prediction with a quantum algorithm. Our motivation to encode the FCC lattice stems from our observation that the FCC lattice is more capable in terms of modeling realistic secondary structures in proteins compared to other lattices, as demonstrated using root mean square deviation (RMSD). We utilize two quantum methods to solve this problem: a polynomial fitting approach (PolyFit) and the Variational Quantum Eigensolver with constraints (VQEC) based on the Lagrangian duality principle. Both methods are successfully deployed on Eagle R3 (ibm_cleveland) and Heron R2 (ibm_kingston) quantum computers, where we are able to recover ground state configurations for the 6-amino acid sequence KLVFFA under noise. A comparative analysis of the outcomes generated by the two QPUs reveals a significant enhancement (reaching nearly a two-fold improvement for PolyFit and a three-fold improvement for VQEC) in the prediction and sampling of the optimal solution (ground state conformations) on the newer Heron R2 architecture, highlighting the impact of quantum hardware advancements for this application.</description>

      <title>Approximate quantum circuit compilation for proton-transfer kinetics on quantum processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proton transfer reactions are fundamental to many chemical and biological systems, where quantum effects such as tunneling, delocalization, and zero-point motion play key kinetic control roles. However, classical methods capable of accurately capturing these phenomena scale prohibitively with system size. Here, we develop and demonstrate quantum computing algorithms based on the Nuclear-Electronic Orbital framework, treating the transferring proton quantum mechanically. We assess the potential of current quantum devices for simulating proton transfer kinetics with high accuracy. We first construct a deep initial ans\"atze within a truncated orbital space by employing the frozen natural orbital approximation. Then, to balance circuit depth against state fidelity, we implement an adaptive form of approximate quantum compiling. Using resulting circuits at varying compression levels transpiled for the ibm_fez device, we compute barrier heights and delocalised proton densities along the proton transfer pathway using a realistic hardware noise model. We find that, although current quantum hardware introduces significant noise relative to the demanding energy tolerances involved, our approach allows substantial circuit simplification while maintaining energy barrier estimates within 13% of the reference value. Despite present hardware limitations, these results offer a practical means of approximating key circuit segments in near-term devices and early fault-tolerant quantum computing systems.</description>

      <title>Photon-Number-Resolving Detector Based on a Cascade of Waveguide-Coupled Quantum Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the operation of a photon-number-resolving (PNR) detector consisting of a cascade of waveguide-coupled lambda-type emitters, where each waveguide-coupled emitter extracts a single photon from the input light and sends it to a single-photon detector. Using Green's function and input-output formalisms, we derive the scattering matrices and photon-photon correlators for individual scatterers. By cascading these results, we obtain a closed-form expression for the detector's precision in the linear regime and predict how correlations generated by nonlinear photon-photon interactions influence this precision. To evaluate the performance of this PNR detector in the nonlinear regime, we apply the quantum trajectory method to the cascaded setup, calculating the achievable precision and analyzing its dependence on key system parameters, such as the number of emitters and their coupling strength to the waveguide. We compare the performance of the proposed PNR detector with that of a conventional PNR scheme based on spatial demultiplexing via beamsplitters. Our results indicate that the proposed scheme can outperform conventional detectors under realistic conditions, making it a promising candidate for next-generation PNR detection.</description>

      <title>Microcausality and Tunneling Times in Relativistic Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show, in the framework of a space-time resolved relativistic quantum eld theory approach to tunneling, that microcausality precludes superluminal tunneling dynamics. More specically in this work dealing with Dirac and Klein-Gordon elds, we rst prove that microcausality holds for such elds in the presence of a background potential. We then use this result to show that an intervention performed on a localized region of an initial wave packet subsequently scattering on a potential barrier does not result in any eect outside the light cone emanating from that region. We illustrate these results with numerical computations for Dirac fermions and Klein-Gordon bosons.</description>

      <title>Time crystals and nonequilibrium dissipative phase transitions mediated by squeezed bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonequilibrium dissipative phase transition, arising from the competition of cooperative behavior and coherent field driving, discovered in the 1970s by Narducci et al. and Walls et al., has been found to exhibit time-crystal behavior when the driving field exceeds the cooperative decay rate. This was seen through the study of the eigenvalues of the Liouvillian superoperator that describes the joint effect of drive and cooperativity. The cooperative decay depends on the nature of the reservoir correlations. If the reservoir correlations have phase-sensitive behavior, then the eigenvalues of the Liouvillian will be different. We investigate the time-crystal behavior of the nonequilibrium dissipative phase transitions under the influence of a squeezed vacuum reservoir. We analyze the steady-state phase diagram as a function of the control parameter and demonstrate that increasing the squeezing strength sharpens the dissipative phase transition. Spectral analysis of the Liouvillian reveals gap closings and the emergence of purely imaginary eigenvalues in the thermodynamic limit, indicating the time-crystal phase. We find that the real parts of subleading eigenvalues exhibit nonmonotonic behavior with increasing squeezing, reflecting the sensitivity of relaxation dynamics to the reservoir properties. Time-domain simulations confirm that the oscillation frequencies correspond to the imaginary parts of the Liouvillian eigenvalues. We also present results on quantum fluctuations in the time-crystal phase. Our results call attention to the study of time crystals in models of cooperativity based on engineered environments.</description>

      <title>The temporal resolution limit in quantum sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal resolution is a critical figure of merit in quantum sensing. This study combines the distinguishable condition of quantum states with quantum speed limits to establish a lower bound on interrogation time. When the interrogation time falls below this bound, the output state becomes statistically indistinguishable from the input state, and the information will inevitably be lost in noise. Without loss of generality, we extend these conclusions to time-dependent signal Hamiltonian. In theory, leveraging certain quantum control techniques allows us to calculate the minimum interrogation time for arbitrary signal Hamiltonian. Finally, we illustrate the impact of quantum speed limits on magnetic field measurements and temporal resolution.</description>

      <title>Spin Squeezing in Electron Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum metrology experiments in atomic physics and quantum optics have demonstrated measurement accuracy beyond the shot-noise limit via multi-particle entanglement. At the same time, electron microscopy, an essential tool for high-resolution imaging of biological systems, is severely constrained in its signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by shot noise, due to the dose limit imposed by electron beam-induced damage. Here, we show theoretically that spin squeezing, a form of quantum metrology based on entanglement, is a natural fit for improving the SNR in electron microscopy. We investigate the generation of the necessary entangled states through electron-electron Coulomb interactions and quantum non-demolition measurements. Our results connect the fields of quantum metrology and electron interferometry, paving the way toward electron microscopy with SNR beyond the shot-noise limit.</description>

      <title>Order-preserving condition for coherence measures of projective measurements with One Example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superposition is an essential feature of quantum mechanics. From the Schrodinger's cat to quantum algorithms such as Deutsch-Jorsza algorithm, quantum superposition plays an important role. It is one fundamental and crucial question how to quantify superposition. Until now, the framework of coherence has been well established as one typical instance of quantum resource theories. And the concept of coherence has been generalized into linearly independent basis, projective measurements and POVMs. In this work, we will focus on coherence measures for projective measurements or orthogonal subspaces. One new condition, order-preserving condition, is proposed for such measures. This condition is rooted in the mathematical structure of Hilbert spaces' orthogonal decomposition. And by generalizing the 1/2-affinity of coherence into subspace cases, we verify that this generalized coherence measure satisfies the order-preserving condition. And it also satisfies other reasonable conditions to be a good coherence measure. As the partial order relationship exists for not only projective measurements, but also POVMs, it's natural to study the order-preserving condition in POVM cases, which will be the last part of this work.</description>

      <title>Defects and their Time Scales in Quantum and Classical Annealing of the Two-Dimensional Ising Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate defects in the two-dimensional transverse-field Ising ferromagnet on periodic $L\times L$ lattices after quantum annealing from high to vanishing field. With exact numerical solutions for $L \le 6$, we observe the expected critical Kibble-Zurek (KZ) time scale $\propto L^{z+1/\nu}$ (with $z=1$ and $1/\nu \approx 1.59$) at the quantum phase transition. We also observe KZ scaling of the ground-state fidelity at the end of the process. The excitations evolve by coarsening dynamics of confined defects, with a time scale $\propto L^2$, and interface fluctuations of system-spanning defects, with life time $\propto L^3$. We build on analogies with classical simulated annealing, where we characterize system-spanning defects in detail and find differences in the dynamic scales of domain walls with winding numbers $W=(1,0)/(0,1)$ (horizontal/vertical) and $W=(1,1)$ (diagonal). They decay on time scales $\propto L^3$ (which applies also to system-spanning domains in systems with open boundaries) and $\propto L^{3.4}$, respectively, when imposed in the ordered phase. As a consequence of $L^{3.4}$ exceeding the classical KZ scale $L^{z+1/\nu}=L^{3.17}$ the probability of $W=(1,1)$ domains in SA scales with the KZ exponent even in the final $T=0$ state. In QA, also the $W=(1,0)/(0,1)$ domains are controlled by the KZ time scale $L^{2.59}$. The $L^3$ scale can nevertheless be detected in the excited states, using a method that we develop that should also be applicable in QA experiments.</description>

      <title>Impedance-Engineered Josephson Parametric Amplifier with Single-Step Lithography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the experimental demonstration of an impedance-engineered Josephson parametric amplifier (IEJPA) fabricated in a single-step lithography process. Impedance engineering is implemented using a lumped-element series LC circuit. We use a simpler lithography process where the entire device -- impedance transformer and JPA -- are patterned in a single electron beam lithography step, followed by a double-angle Dolan bridge technique for Al-AlO$_x$-Al deposition. We observe nearly quantum-limited amplification with 18 dB gain over a wide 400 MHz bandwidth centered around 5.3 GHz, and a saturation power of -114 dBm. To accurately explain our experimental results, we extend existing theories for impedance-engineered JPAs to incorporate the full sine nonlinearity of both the JPA and the transformer. Our work shows a path to simpler realization of broadband JPAs and provides a theoretical foundation for a novel regime of JPA operation.</description>

      <title>Superinductor-based ultrastrong coupling in a superconducting circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an ultrastrong superinductor-based coupling consisting of a flux qubit galvanically coupled to a resonator. The coupling inductor is fabricated in granular Aluminum, a superinductor material able to provide large surface inductances. Spectroscopy measurements on the qubit-resonator system reveal a Bloch-Siegert shift of \SI{23}{\mega\hertz} and a coupling fraction of $g/\omega_r \simeq 0.13$, entering the perturbative ultrastrong coupling (USC) regime. We estimate the inductance of the coupler independently by low-temperature resistance measurements providing $L_c = (0.74\pm0.14)\,\mathrm{nH}$, which is compatible with $g/\omega \gtrsim 0.1$. Our results show that superinductors are a promising tool to study USC physics in high-coherence circuits using flux qubits with small loop areas and low persistent currents.</description>

      <title>Local unitary decomposition of tripartite arbitrary leveled qudit stabilizer states into $p$-level-qudit EPR and GHZ state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the entanglement structure of tripartite stabilizer states on $N$ qudits of dimension $D$, distributed across parties $A$, $B$, and $C$, under arbitrary local unitaries. Prior work by Bravyi et al. and Looi et al. showed that qubit and squarefree qudit stabilizer states can be transformed via local Clifford unitaries into tensor products of GHZ states, EPR pairs, and unentangled qudits [arXiv:quant-ph/0504208, arXiv:1107.1761]. We generalize this to arbitrary integer $D$ by introducing local unitaries beyond the Clifford group, enabling decomposition of prime-power qudit stabilizer states into $p$-level GHZ states, EPR pairs, and unentangled qudits. Our algorithm leverages subsystem phase matrices to characterize entanglement and applies to quantum protocols requiring efficient entanglement distribution.</description>

      <title>Simulating plasma wave propagation on a superconducting quantum chip</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers may one day enable the efficient simulation of strongly-coupled plasmas that lie beyond the reach of classical computation in regimes where quantum effects are important and the scale separation is large. In this letter, we take the first step towards efficient simulation of quantum plasmas by demonstrating linear plasma wave propagation on a superconducting quantum chip. Using high-fidelity and highly expressive device-native gates, combined with a novel error mitigation technique, we simulate the scattering of laser pulses from inhomogeneous plasmas. Our approach is made feasible by the identification of a suitable local spin model whose excitations mimic plasma waves, whose circuit implementation requires a lower gate count than other proposed approaches that would require a future fault-tolerant quantum computer. This work opens avenues to study more complicated phenomena that cannot be simulated efficiently on classical computers, such as nonlinear quantum dynamics when strongly-coupled plasmas are driven out of equilibrium.</description>

      <title>A theoretical treatment of optical metasurfaces as an efficient basis for quantum correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement is a cornerstone of quantum technology, playing a key role in quantum computing, cryptography, and information processing. Conventional methods for generating entanglement via optical setups rely on beam splitters, nonlinear media, or quantum dots, which often require bulky configurations and precise phase control. In contrast, metasurfaces - ultrathin, engineered optical interfaces - offer a compact and tunable alternative for quantum photonics. In this work, we demonstrate that metasurfaces can serve as a promising platform for generating Bell states through a Hamiltonian-driven spin-entanglement mechanism. By analyzing the system's evolution under a metasurface interaction Hamiltonian, we show that an initially separable spin state evolves into a maximally entangled Bell state. We further study classical and quantum correlations, evaluate the impact of environmental decoherence, and compute quantum discord to quantify correlation robustness beyond entanglement. Our analysis shows that metasurfaces can generate Bell states with a concurrence of about 0.995 and maintain quantum discord for up to 29 microseconds. These results establish metasurfaces as scalable, high-fidelity components for next-generation quantum photonic architectures.</description>

      <title>Echoes in a parametrically perturbed Kerr-nonlinear oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study classical and quantum echoes in a Kerr oscillator driven by a frequency-controlling pulsed perturbation. We consider dynamical response to the perturbation for a single coherent state and for Schr\"odinger cat states constructed as both balanced and imbalanced superpositions of two coherent states. For individual coherent states, we demonstrate that a weak parametric drive yields a long-lived sequence of classical echoes. Cat states are found to exhibit distinct quantum echoes that are sensitive to the initial relative phase and weights of the coherent states in superposition. We examine the effect of dissipation on quantum echoes and quantum revivals of cat states. We demonstrate that, even when dissipation suppresses quantum revivals, quantum echoes can be recovered by properly tuning the timing and strength of the perturbation. These results may be useful for characterizing and mitigating errors of cat qubits.</description>

      <title>Design and Experimental Realization of Various Protocols for Secure Quantum Computation and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A set of new schemes for quantum computation and communication have been either designed or experimentally realized using optimal quantum resources. A multi-output quantum teleportation scheme, where a sender (Alice) teleports an m and m+1-qubit GHZ-like unknown state to a receiver (Bob), has been demonstrated using two copies of the Bell state instead of a five-qubit cluster state and implemented on IBM's quantum computer for the m=1 case. Another scheme, known as quantum broadcasting where a known state is sent to two spatially separated parties (Bob and Charlie) has also been realized using two Bell states. It is shown that existing quantum broadcasting schemes can be reduced to multiparty remote state preparation. After achieving teleportation of unknown and known states, sending a quantum operator becomes the next step. A scheme for remote implementation of operators (RIO), specifically a controlled joint-RIO (CJRIO), has been proposed using a four-qubit hyper-entangled state involving spatial and polarization degrees of freedom. In this direction, two more variants, remote implementation of hidden and partially unknown operators (RIHO and RIPUO) have also been proposed. Their success probabilities are analyzed considering dissipation of an auxiliary coherent state interacting with the environment. For secure multiparty tasks like quantum voting or auction, secure multiparty quantum computation (SMQC) becomes essential. A quantum anonymous voting (QAV) scheme has been experimentally implemented on IBM's quantum computer. Finally, two quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols, coherent one-way (COW) and differential phase shift (DPS), are experimentally demonstrated and the key rates are analyzed as functions of post-processing parameters and detector dead times across various distances.</description>

      <title>Ensemble-IR: Concise Representation for Quantum Ensemble Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging quantum applications such as error mitigation, system characterization, and hybrid protocols often require running large families of related quantum circuits. Existing intermediate representations (IRs) and frameworks such as Qiskit, QIR, MitiQ, and OpenQASM do not provide primitives to concisely express such workloads. These tools instead rely on explicit enumeration of the unique circuits within each workload. We introduce Ensemble-IR, an intermediate representation designed to concisely express these ensemble workloads. Rather than enumerating each circuit separately, Ensemble-IR encodes an entire workload through a rich, shared unified program. This program specifies common circuit structure along with symbolic operations to express points of variation - such as gate types, gate placement, parameter values, or qubit configurations. Ensemble-IR enables quantum systems to load an entire family of circuits onto a device as a single concise file, allowing contained circuits to instead be recreated on-the-fly at runtime. We demonstrate Ensemble-IR across 18 real-world workloads from prior literature, highlighting its widespread utility for scalable quantum system development.</description>

      <title>Barnett effect boosted nonreciprocal entanglement and EPR-steering in magnomechanics in the presence of coherent feedback loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an experimental scheme for enhancing entanglement, achieving asymmetric Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering, and creating nonreciprocal quantum correlations within a hybrid system. This system integrates a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere, which exhibits magnon-phonon coupling via magnetostriction, with a silica sphere featuring optomechanical whispering-gallery modes. By tuning the Barnett effect through the magnetic field direction, our system enables controllable asymmetric EPR steering and nonreciprocal entanglement between both directly and indirectly coupled modes. We demonstrate that adjusting the reflectivity of a beam splitter can boost stationary quantum steering and entanglement, effectively countering thermal noise. This approach allows for the generation of multipartite entanglement and both one-way and two-way steering. The proposed system is experimentally feasible and holds significant promise for various quantum information applications.</description>

      <title>Exploiting emergent symmetries in disorder-averaged quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetries are a key tool in understanding quantum systems, and, among many other things, can be exploited to increase the efficiency of numerical simulations of quantum dynamics. Disordered systems usually feature reduced symmetries and additionally require averaging over many realizations, making their numerical study computationally demanding. However, when studying quantities linear in the time-evolved state, i.e. expectation values of observables, one can apply the averaging procedure to the time evolution operator, resulting in an effective dynamical map, which restores symmetry at the level of super operators. In this work, we develop schemes for efficiently constructing symmetric sectors of the disorder-averaged dynamical map using short-time and weak-disorder expansions. To benchmark the method, we apply it to an Ising model with random all-to-all interactions in the presence of a transverse field. After disorder averaging, this system becomes effectively permutation-invariant, and thus the size of the symmetric subspace scales polynomially in the number of spins allowing for the simulation of large system.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of quantum Fisher and Wigner-Yanase skew information following a noisy quench</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the influence of noise on the dynamics of a transverse field Ising model when quenched across a quantum critical point. To quantify two-spin correlations properties, we employ the quantum Fisher information (QFI) and Wigner-Yanase skew information (WYSI) as measures of quantum coherence. In the absence of noise, despite the entanglement, both QFI and WYSI increase monotonically with the ramp quench time, approaching their adiabatic limits without exhibiting any Kibble-Zurek type scaling with quench duration. When noise is added to the quench protocol, the coherence dynamics change dramatically: QFI and WYSI both decay exponentially with time scale of a ramp quench, with the exponent depending on the noise intensity. Furthermore, the maximum ramp time, at which either of these measures reach their maximum, scales linearly with the noise variance, featuring the same exponent that determines the optimal annealing time for minimizing defect production in noisy quantum annealing.</description>

      <title>Quantum Convolution for Structure-Based Virtual Screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) is a key computational strategy for identifying potential drug candidates by estimating the binding free energies (delta G_bind) of protein-ligand complexes. The immense size of chemical libraries, combined with the need to account for protein and ligand conformations as well as ligand translations and rotations, makes these tasks computationally intensive on classical hardware. This study proposes a quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) framework to estimate delta G_bind efficiently. Using the PDBbind v2020 dataset, we trained QCNN models with 9 and 12 qubits, with the core set designated as the test set. The best-performing model achieved a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.694 on the test set. To assess robustness, we introduced quantum noise under two configurations. While noise increased the root mean square deviation, the Pearson correlation coefficient remained largely stable. These results demonstrate the feasibility and noise tolerance of QCNNs for high-throughput virtual screening and highlight the potential of quantum computing to accelerate drug discovery.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magic state distillation and injection is a promising strategy towards universal fault tolerant quantum computation, especially in architectures based on the bosonic Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes where non-Clifford gates remain challenging to implement. Here we address GKP magic state preparation by studying a non-Gaussian unitary mediated by a Kerr interaction which realizes a logical gate $\sqrt{H}_L$ for square GKP codes. This gate does not directly involve an auxiliary qubit and is compatible with finite energy constraints on the code. Fidelity can be further enhanced using the small-Big-small (SBS) error correction protocol and post-selection, making the scheme robust against a single photon loss event. We finally propose a circuit QED implementation to operate the Kerr interaction.</description>

      <title>Quantum Singular Value Transformation for Solving the Time-Dependent Maxwell's Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09686v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a quantum algorithm for solving linear systems of equations of the form $\mathbf{A}{\frac{\mathbf{\partial f}}{\mathbf{\partial x}}} = \mathbf{B}\mathbf{f}$, based on the Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT). The algorithm uses block-encoding of $A$ and applies an 21st-degree polynomial approximation to the inverse function $f(x) = 1/x$, enabling relatively shallow quantum circuits implemented on 9 qubits, including two ancilla qubits, corresponding to a grid size of 128 points. Phase angles for the QSVT circuit were optimized classically using the Adagrad gradient-based method over 100 iterations to minimize the solution cost. This approach was simulated in PennyLane and applied to solve a 1D benchmark case of Maxwell's equations in free space, with a Gaussian pulse as the initial condition, where the quantum-computed solution showed high fidelity of more than 99.9% when compared to the normalized classical solution. Results demonstrate the potential of QSVT-based linear solvers on simulators with full quantum state access. However, practical hardware implementations face challenges because accessing the complete quantum state is infeasible. This limitation restricts applicability to cases where only $O({poly}(n))$ observables are needed. These findings highlight both the promise and current limitations of using quantum algorithms, such as QSVT, to solve linear systems of equations, and they point to the need for the development of measurement-efficient algorithms for near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Small Quantum Low Parity Density Check Codes for Near-Term Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is widely accepted that quantum error correction is essential for realizing large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computing. Recent experiments have demonstrated error correction codes operating below threshold, primarily using local planar codes such as the surface code and color code. In parallel, theoretical advances in quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes promise significantly lower overheads, albeit at the cost of requiring non-local parity checks. While these results are encouraging, implementing such codes remains challenging for near-term experiments, creating obstacles to holistic benchmarking of hardware architectures capable of supporting long-range couplers. In this work, we present a simple construction recipe for small quantum LDPC codes based on recent developments in the field. Our codes are approximately twice as efficient as comparable surface codes, yet require only weight-four parity checks, which simplifies experimental realization compared to other quantum LDPC codes. We provide concrete proposals for implementations with superconducting qubits in flip-chip architectures and with semiconductor spin qubits using shuttling-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Exceptional sensitivity near the bistable transition point of a hybrid quantum system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase transitions can dramatically alter system dynamics, unlocking new behavior and improving performance. Exceptional points (EPs), where the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors of a coupled linear system coalesce, are particularly relevant for sensing applications as they can increase sensor response to external perturbations to a range of phenomena from optical phase shifts to gravitational waves. However, the coalescence of eigenstates at linear EPs amplifies noise, negating the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) enhancement. Here, we overcome this limitation using nonlinearity, which exhibits exceptional SNR around a bistable transition point (BP). We couple a state-of-the-art diamond quantum sensor to a nonlinear Van der Pol oscillator, forming a self-oscillating hybrid system that exhibits both a single-valued and bistable phase. The boundaries between these phases are marked by both adiabatic and deterministic non-adiabatic transitions that enable chiral state switching and state coalescence at the BP. Crucially, NV magnetometry performed near the BP exhibits a 17x enhancement in SNR, achieving a record sensitivity of 170 fT/\sqrt{Hz}. This result surpasses the sensitivity limit of an ideal, thermally-limited electron magnetometer and resolves a long-standing debate regarding EP-like physics in advanced quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum-Classical Generative Adversarial Networks with Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have demonstrated immense potential in synthesizing diverse and high-fidelity images. However, critical questions remain unanswered regarding how quantum principles might best enhance their representational and computational capacity. In this paper, we investigate hybrid quantum-classical GAN architectures supplemented by transfer learning to systematically examine whether incorporating Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) into the generator, the discriminator, or both improves performance over a fully classical baseline. Our findings indicate that fully hybrid models, which incorporate VQCs in both the generator and the discriminator, consistently produce images of higher visual quality and achieve more favorable quantitative metrics compared to their fully classical counterparts. In particular, VQCs in the generator accelerate early feature learning, whereas those in the discriminator, despite exhibiting slower initial convergence, ultimately facilitate more refined synthetic outputs. Moreover, the model sustains near-comparable performance even when the dataset size is drastically reduced, suggesting that transfer learning and quantum enhancements mitigate the problem of data scarcity. Overall, the results underscore that carefully integrating quantum computing with classical adversarial training and pretrained feature extraction can considerably enrich GAN-based image synthesis. These insights open avenues for future work on higher-resolution tasks, alternative quantum circuit designs, and experimentation with emerging quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Multi-Mode Interference for Passive Suppression of Purcell Decay in Superconducting Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decoherence due to radiative decay remains an important consideration in scaling superconducting quantum processors. We introduce a passive, interference-based methodology for suppressing radiative decay using only the intrinsic multi-mode structured environment of superconducting circuits. By taking into account the full electromagnetic mode-mode couplings within the device, we derive analytic conditions that enable destructive interference. These conditions are realized by introducing controlled geometric asymmetries -- such as localized perturbations to the transmon capacitor -- which increase mode hybridization and activate interference between multiple decay pathways. We validate this methodology using perturbation theory, full-wave electromagnetic simulations, and experimental measurements of a symmetry-broken transmon qubit with improved coherence times.</description>

      <title>When the Weak Becomes Strong: Effective Observables via Time-Symmetric Quantum Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the sequential composition of weak values in the framework of time-symmetric quantum mechanics. Specifically, we consider a forward'' weak measurement from a preselected state $\ket{\psi}$ to a post-selected state $\ket{\phi}$, followed by a reverse'' weak measurement. We show that the product of these two weak values corresponds to the normalized expectation value of a strong, state-conditioned observable $B = A P_\psi A$, where $P_\psi = \ket{\psi}\bra{\psi}$ is the projector onto the preselected state. Analyzing the structure of $B$, we demonstrate how it encodes interference information, particularly when $\ket{\psi}$ is a superposition rather than an eigenstate of $A$. This formulation extends naturally to mixed states by replacing $P_\psi$ with a generic density matrix $\rho$, linking the construction to the formalism of generalized quantum measurements. We illustrate practical applications in quantum information, including state-specific error witnessing in quantum computing, and show how the phase of a weak value can be inferred via strong measurements in the pure-state case.</description>

      <title>Response to "Are Hilbert Spaces Unphysical? Hardly, My Dear!''</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent criticism of our paper ``The unphysicality of Hilbert spaces'' by Nivaldo Lemos refutes our central argument that a state with finite expectation value can be mapped to a state with infinite expectation value by a coordinate transformation. By conflating coordinate transformation with change of basis in quantum mechanics, Lemos argues that expectation values are invariant under change of variables. In the present work, we clarify the distinction between coordinate transformation and change of basis, and rebut Lemos' main argument.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a pulse optimization method for accelerating adiabatic control protocols, including adiabatic population transfer and adiabatic quantum computation. Our method relies on identifying control pulses under which the evolving quantum system adheres to its instantaneous ground state. Our method is both efficient -- by using advanced gradient-free optimization tools and robust -- by utilizing analytic adiabatic solutions in defining the cost function for quantum optimal control (QOC). To demonstrate the generality of our approach, we run digitized adiabatic protocols with superconducting qubits on the IBM quantum platform and numerically simulate adiabatic algorithms for solving graph optimization problems with Rydberg atom arrays.</description>

      <title>Decomposition of multi-qutrit gates generated by Weyl-Heisenberg strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decomposing unitary operations into native gates is an essential step for implementing quantum algorithms. For qubit-based devices, where native gates are typically single- and two-qubit operations, a range of decomposition techniques have been developed. In particular, efficient algorithms exist for decomposing exponentials of Pauli strings while taking hardware topology in account. Motivated by the growing interest in qutrit-based quantum computing, we develop analogous decomposition methods for qutrit systems. Specifically, we introduce an algorithm that decomposes the exponential of an arbitrary tensor product of Weyl-Heisenberg operators (plus their Hermitian conjugation) into single- and two-qutrit gates. We further extend this approach to unitaries generated by Gell-Mann string (i.e., a tensor product of Gell-Mann matrices). Since both Gell-Mann matrices and Weyl-Heisenberg operators form (together with identity) complete operator bases of qutrit operators, we can use this result also to decompose any multi-qutrit gate that is diagonal up to single-qutrit rotations. As a practical application, we use our method to decompose the layers of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm for qutrit-based implementations of the graph k-coloring problem. For values of $k$ well-suited to qutrit architectures (e.g., $k=3$ or in general $k=3^n$), our approach yields significantly shallower circuits compared to qubit-based implementations, an advantage that grows with problem size, while also requiring a smaller total Hilbert space dimension. Finally, we also address the routing challenge in qutrit architectures that arises due to the limited connectivity of the devices. In particular, we generalize the Steiner-Gauss method, originally developed to reduce CNOT counts in qubit circuit, to optimize gate routing in qutrit-based systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Solution Framework for Finite-Horizon LQG Control via Block Encodings and QSVT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantum algorithm for solving the finite-horizon discrete-time Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control problem, which integrates optimal control and state estimation in the presence of stochastic disturbances and noise. Classical approaches to LQG require solving a backward Riccati recursion and a forward Kalman filter, both requiring computationally expensive matrix operations with overall time complexity $\mathcal{O}(T n^3)$, where $n$ is the system dimension and $T$ is the time horizon. While efficient classical solvers exist, especially for small to medium-sized systems, their computational complexity grows rapidly with system dimension. To address this, we reformulate the full LQG pipeline using quantum linear algebra primitives, including block-encoded matrix representations and quantum singular value transformation (QSVT) techniques for matrix inversion and multiplication. We formally analyze the time complexity of each algorithmic component. Under standard assumptions on matrix condition numbers and encoding precision, the total runtime of the quantum LQG algorithm scales polylogarithmically with the system dimension $n$ and linearly with the time horizon $T$, offering an asymptotic quantum speedup over classical methods.</description>

      <title>Robust Entanglement Generation in Bipartite Quantum Systems Using Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a key resource for quantum technologies, yet its efficient and high-fidelity generation remains a challenge due to the complexity of quantum dynamics. This paper presents a quantum optimal control framework to maximize bipartite entanglement within a fixed time horizon, under bounded control inputs. By leveraging Pontryagin's Minimum Principle, we derive a set of necessary conditions that guide the design of time-dependent control fields to steer a two-qubit system toward maximally entangled Bell states. The entanglement is quantified using concurrence, and the control objective is formulated as maximizing this measure at the terminal time. Our approach is validated through numerical simulations of Liouville-von Neumann dynamics. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of switching-based control strategies in achieving robust entanglement, offering insights into practical implementations of quantum control for entanglement generation in quantum networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Taking as a model the fact that Heisenberg's matrix mechanics was derived from Hamiltonian mechanics using the correspondence principle, we explore a class of dynamical systems involving discrete variables, with Nambu mechanics as the starting point. Specifically, we reconstruct an extended version of matrix mechanics that describes dynamical systems possessing physical quantities expressed through generalized matrices. Furthermore, we reconfirm that a multiple commutator involving generalized matrices can serve as a discrete (quantized) version of the Nambu bracket or the Jacobian.</description>

      <title>Evaluating a Multi-Color Entangled-Photon Source for a Bosonic Silicon Quantum Circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluated a multi-color two-photon entangled state generated in silicon via spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) as a potential source for bosonic integrated circuits. Spatially entangled photon states were created using a pair of silicon waveguides that produced signal and idler photons through SFWM, allowing us to observe quantum interference between them. Assuming that the frequencies of the multi-color photons were nearly identical, we characterized the generated quantum state by performing quantum state tomography on the bosonic system using a linear optical circuit. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using photon-pair sources generated in silicon via SFWM in bosonic optical circuits and highlights their potential for a wide range of applications in silicon-based optical quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Error-mitigated inference of quantum network topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Paramount for performances of quantum network applications are the structure and quality of distributed entanglement. Here we propose a scalable and efficient approach to reveal the topological information of unknown quantum networks, and quantify entanglement simultaneously. The scheme exploits entropic uncertainty, an operationally meaningful measure of correlation, by performing only two local measurements on each qubit. Moreover, when measurement outcomes in each node are collectively evaluated, integrating uncertainty and mutual information enables a direct count of the number of bipartite sources between any two nodes. This surpasses what is possible via applying either approach solely. Moreover, quantum error mitigation techniques including probabilistic error cancellation (PEC) and virtual distillation (VD), which have been widely applied to suppress biases in single expectation value, are further incorporated to mitigate errors in entropic quantities. We find that PEC successfully removes deviations in correlation estimations. Meanwhile, VD extends the depolarizing noise strength that allows for valid bipartite entanglement certification from 8.8% to 26.4%, thus substantially enhancing robustness against bias-inducing noise in practical situations. The proposal is applicable to a broad variety of platforms and helps to spur future studies toward harnessing the advantages of quantum networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A microwave-optical transducer of sufficiently low noise and high signal transfer rate would allow entanglement to be distributed between superconducting quantum processors at a rate faster than the lifetimes of the quantum memories being linked. Here we present measurements of a membrane-based opto-electromechanical transducer with high signal throughput, as quantified by an efficiency-bandwidth-duty-cycle product of 7 kHz, approaching quantum-enabled operation in upconversion as well as downconversion, with input-referred added noise of 3 photons. In downconversion, throughput of this magnitude at the few-photon noise level is unprecedented. Using the quantum channel capacity, we also find an expression for the maximum rate at which quantum information can be transduced, providing insight into the importance of improving both a transducer's throughput and noise performance. With feasible improvements, the high throughput achieved with this device positions membrane-based transducers as a strategic choice for demonstrations of a quantum network with reasonable averaging times.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterization of quantum systems from experimental data is a central problem in quantum science and technology. But which measurements should be used to gather data in the first place? While optimal measurement choices can be worked out for small quantum systems, the optimization becomes intractable as the system size grows large. To address this problem, we introduce a deep neural network with a sequence model architecture that searches for efficient measurement choices in a data-driven, adaptive manner. The model can be applied to a variety of tasks, including the prediction of linear and nonlinear properties of quantum states, as well as state clustering and state tomography tasks. In all these tasks, we find that the measurement choices identified by our neural network consistently outperform the uniformly random choice. Intriguingly, for topological quantum systems, our model tends to recommend measurements at the system's boundaries, even when the task is to predict bulk properties. This behavior suggests that the neural network may have independently discovered a connection between boundaries and bulk, without having been provided any built-in knowledge of quantum physics.</description>

      <title>The Ontic Necessity of the Quantum Wavefunction: Why Epistemic Views Struggle with the Uncertainty Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ontological status of the quantum wavefunction remains one of the most debated questions in quantum theory. While epistemic interpretations regard the wavefunction as a reflection of our knowledge or beliefs, ontic interpretations treat it as a real physical object. In this paper, we argue that epistemic approaches struggle to explain the universality and precision of the uncertainty principle, a core feature of quantum mechanics. By contrast, treating the wave-function as ontic allows a consistent and natural derivation of quantum uncertainty from the mathematical structure of Hilbert space. We examine key interpretations on both sides and highlight why the epistemic view falls short in addressing constraints that appear to be intrinsic to nature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Device-independent quantum random number generation (DIQRNG) is the gold standard for generating truly random numbers, as it can produce certifiably random numbers from untrusted devices. However, the stringent device requirements of traditional DIQRNG protocols have limited their practical applications. Here, we introduce Device-Independent Private Quantum Randomness Beacon (DIPQRB), a novel approach to generate random numbers from untrusted devices based on routed Bell tests. This method significantly relaxes the device requirements, enabling a more practical way of generating randomness from untrusted devices. By distributing the device requirements across a network of servers and clients, our proposal allows the server to operate high-performance devices while the clients can be equipped with more cost-effective devices. Moreover, the outputs of the client's device are also private, even against the server, which is essential in cryptographic applications. Therefore, DIPQRB provides a cost-effective method to generate secure and private random numbers from untrusted devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heat and work in thermodynamics refer to the measurement of changes in energy content of external bodies (baths and agents). We discuss the implications of quantum mechanics on the possibility to measure work in a mesoscopic context. The agent is a quantum entity (say an oscillator) that is used to drive the system. An obvious limitation is related to back-reaction, leading to a classical-like restriction. We find that in order to resolve fingerprints of interference an additional quantum uncertainty limitation should be taken into account in the design of the agent. The quantum limitation is fundamental, and cannot be relaxed by super-resolution techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As we approach the centennial anniversary of modern quantum mechanics this paper revisits the foundational debates through a new poll within the research community. Inspired by the survey by Schlosshauer, Kofler, and Zeilinger at the specialized 2011 Quantum Physics and the Nature of Reality conference, we expanded our recruitment to include a more representative sample of the broader community of physicists with the aim to reveal potential shifts in scientists' views and compare our findings with those from several previous polls. While quantum foundations still lack a consensus interpretation, our results indicate a persistent preference for the Copenhagen interpretation. This enduring support likely reflects both the educational emphasis on the Copenhagen interpretation and its pragmatic appeal in avoiding complex metaphysical questions and introducing new notions (e.g., other worlds or the pilot wave). Our findings thus underscore the relative stability of interpretational preferences over the past decades.</description>

      <title>Indiscernibility of quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we develop a mathematical framework for indiscernibility of quantum states, arguing that, given a set of observables, the ``distinguishable objects'' are the equivalence classes modulo indiscernibility relative to the observables. The structure of the set of distinguishable objects - called the Holevo space - is investigated in detail, and it is shown that the observables admit a natural lift to continuous functions on the Holevo space. The theory is illustrated by several examples where the ``distinguishable objects'' can be described explicitly. Among other things, the Holevo spaces and the lifted functions are described for position measurements on a free particle and for spin measurements in the EPR and Bell experiments.</description>

      <title>Testing APS conjecture on regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The maximum energy of the EPR model on a weighted graph is known to be upper-bounded by the sum of the total weight and the value of maximum-weight fractional matching~(MWFM). Recently, Apte, Parekh and Sud~(APS) conjecture that the bound could be strengthened by replacing MWFM with maximum weight matching~(MWM). Here we test this conjecture on a special class of regular graphs that Henning and Yeo constructed many years ago. On this class of regular graphs, MWMs achieve tight lower bounds. As for the maximum energy of the EPR model, we have recently devised a new algorithm called Fractional Entanglement Distribution~(FED) based on quasi-homogeneous fractional matchings, which could achieve rather high accuracy. Applying the FED algorithm to the EPR model on Henning-Yeo graphs, we could thus obtain energy as high as possible and matching value as low as possible, and then make high-precision tests of the APS conjecture. Nevertheless, our numerical results do not show any evidence that the APS conjecture could be violated.</description>

      <title>Davies equation without the secular approximation: Reconciling locality with quantum thermodynamics for open quadratic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a thermodynamically consistent quantum master equation that satisfies locality for quadratic systems coupled to independent and identical baths at each site. We show that the quasi-local Redfield equation coincides exactly with the Davies equation, which satisfies the detailed-balance condition, due to cancellation of quantum coherence generated by each bath. This derivation does not rely on the secular approximation, which fails in systems with vanishing energy-level spacings. We discuss generalizations of our result to slowly driven quadratic systems and generic quantum many-body systems. Our result paves the way to a thermodynamically consistent description of quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constructing large-scale quantum resources is an important foundation for further improving the efficiency and scalability of quantum communication. Here, we present an efficient extraction and stable control scheme of 40 pairs of entangled sideband modes from the squeezed light by specially designing optical parametric oscillator. Utilizing the low-loss optical frequency comb control technology and the local cross-correlation algorithm, we model and manage the efficient separation process of the entangled sidebands modes facilitated by the optical filtering cavities, a maximum entanglement level of 6.5 dB is achieved. The feasibility of large-capacity quantum dense coding based on these entangled sideband modes is proved experimentally, which is of great significance for optimizing the utilization of quantum resources, thereby contributing to the advancement of large-capacity quantum communication networks and enabling the realization of more secure and efficient quantum communication systems.</description>

      <title>On the Importance of Fundamental Properties in Quantum-Classical Machine Learning Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of how quantum circuit design, specifically the depth of the variational ansatz and the choice of quantum feature mapping, affects the performance of hybrid quantum-classical neural networks on a causal classification task. The architecture combines a convolutional neural network for classical feature extraction with a parameterized quantum circuit acting as the quantum layer. We evaluate multiple ansatz depths and nine different feature maps. Results show that increasing the number of ansatz repetitions improves generalization and training stability, though benefits tend to plateau beyond a certain depth. The choice of feature mapping is even more critical: only encodings with multi-axis Pauli rotations enable successful learning, while simpler maps lead to underfitting or loss of class separability. Principal Component Analysis and silhouette scores reveal how data distributions evolve across network stages. These findings offer practical guidance for designing quantum circuits in hybrid models. All source codes and evaluation tools are publicly available.</description>

      <title>Secure and Efficient Quantum Signature Scheme Based on the Controlled Unitary Operations Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum digital signatures ensure unforgeable message authenticity and integrity using quantum principles, offering unconditional security against both classical and quantum attacks. They are crucial for secure communication in high-stakes environments, ensuring trust and long-term protection in the quantum era. Nowadays, the majority of arbitrated quantum signature (AQS) protocols encrypt data qubit by qubit using the quantum one-time pad (QOTP). Despite providing robust data encryption, QOTP is not a good fit for AQS because of its susceptibility to many types of attacks. In this work, we present an efficient AQS protocol to encrypt quantum message ensembles using a distinct encryption technique, the chained controlled unitary operations. In contrast to existing protocols, our approach successfully prevents disavowal and forgery attacks. We hope this contributes to advancing future investigations into the development of AQS protocols.</description>

      <title>Tracing attosecond currents and controlling their direction in a scanning tunneling microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tunneling effect driven by waveform-controlled laser pulses is a cornerstone of attosecond science and contributes decisively to its extreme time resolution. In the spatial domain, electron tunneling through a bias-driven junction between a nanotip and a surface enables atomic-scale spatial resolution in scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Recently, first signatures of attosecond modulation of STM currents have shown that simultaneous attosecond-nanometer resolution is feasible. However, while sub-cycle attosecond dynamics are routinely controlled and determined with high precision, controlling the direction of the currents and determining their duration have remained elusive in STM. Here, we induce STM tunneling currents using two-color laser pulses and dynamically control their direction, relying solely on the sub-cycle waveform of the pulses. Projecting our measurement data onto numerical and analytical solutions of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation reveals non-adiabatic tunneling as the underlying physical mechanism, yielding current burst durations on the order of 900 as. Despite working under ambient conditions but free from thermal artifacts, we achieve a lateral spatial resolution of 2 nm and sub-angstr\"om topographic sensitivity. Directional control of attosecond bursts in STM will enable triggering and detecting ultrafast charge dynamics in molecular systems and defect states at the spatio-temporal frontier of microscopy.</description>

      <title>Efficient Measurement of Bosonic Non-Gaussianity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Gaussian states are essential resources in quantum information processing. In this work, we investigate methods for quantifying bosonic non-Gaussianity in many-body systems. Building on recent theoretical insights into the self-convolution properties of bosonic pure states, we introduce non-Gaussian entropy as a new measure to characterize non-Gaussianity in bosonic pure states. We further propose a practical protocol for measuring non-Gaussian entropy using three beam splitters and four copies of the input state. In addition, we extend this framework to mixed states, providing a general approach to quantifying non-Gaussianity. Our results offer a convenient and efficient method for characterizing bosonic non-Gaussianity, paving the way for its implementation on near-term experimental platforms.</description>

      <title>Thermal rectification in a qubit-resonator system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A qubit-oscillator junction connecting as a series two bosonic heat baths at different temperatures can display heat valve and diode effects. In particular, the rectification can change in magnitude and even in sign, implying an inversion of the preferential direction for the heat current with respect to the temperature bias. We perform a systematic study of these effects in a circuit QED model of qubit-oscillator system and find that the features of current and rectification crucially depend on the qubit-oscillator coupling. While at small coupling, transport occurs via a resonant mechanism between the sub-systems, in the ultrastrong coupling regime the junction is a unique, highly hybridized system and the current becomes largely insensitive to the detuning. Correspondingly, the rectification undergoes a change of sign. In the nonlinear transport regime, the coupling strength determines whether the current scales sub- or super-linearly with the temperature bias and whether the rectification, which increases in magnitude with the bias, is positive or negative. We also find that steady-state coherence largely suppresses the current and enhances rectification. An insight on these behaviors with respect to changes in the system parameters is provided by analytical approximate formulas.</description>

      <title>From Linear Differential Equations to Unitaries: A Moment-Matching Dilation Framework with Near-Optimal Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum speed-ups for dynamical simulation usually demand unitary time-evolution, whereas the large ODE/PDE systems encountered in realistic physical models are generically non-unitary. We present a universal moment-fulfilling dilation that embeds any linear, non-Hermitian flow $\dot x = A x$ with $A=-iH+K$ into a strictly unitary evolution on an enlarged Hilbert space: \[
  ( (l| \otimes I )
  \mathcal T e^{-i \int ( I_A\otimes H +i F\otimes K) dt}
  ( |r) \otimes I )
  = \mathcal T e^{\int A dt}, \] provided the triple $( F, (l|, |r) )$ satisfies the compact moment identities $(l| F^{k}|r) =1$ for all $k\ge 0$ in the ancilla space. This algebraic criterion recovers both \emph{Schr\"odingerization} [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 230602 (2024)] and the linear-combination-of-Hamiltonians (LCHS) scheme [Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 150603 (2023)], while also unveiling whole families of new dilations built from differential, integral, pseudo-differential, and difference generators. Each family comes with a continuous tuning parameter \emph{and} is closed under similarity transformations that leave the moments invariant, giving rise to an overwhelming landscape of design space that allows quantum dilations to be co-optimized for specific applications, algorithms, and hardware.
  As concrete demonstrations, we prove that a simple finite-difference dilation in a finite interval attains near-optimal oracle complexity. Numerical experiments on Maxwell viscoelastic wave propagation confirm the accuracy and robustness of the approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excited states play a central role in determining the physical properties of quantum matter, yet their accurate computation in many-body systems remains a formidable challenge for numerical methods. While neural quantum states have delivered outstanding results for ground-state problems, extending their applicability to excited states has faced limitations, including instability in dense spectra and reliance on symmetry constraints or penalty-based formulations. In this work, we rigorously formalize the framework introduced by Pfau et al.~\cite{pfau2024accurate} in terms of Grassmann geometry of the Hilbert space. This allows us to generalize the Stochastic Reconfiguration method for the simultaneous optimization of multiple variational wave functions, and to introduce the multidimensional versions of operator variances and overlaps. We validate our approach on the Heisenberg quantum spin model on the square lattice, achieving highly accurate energies and physical observables for a large number of excited states.</description>

      <title>Quantum i.i.d. Steady States in Open Many-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how a quantum many-body state is maintained stably as a nonequilibrium steady state is of fundamental and practical importance for exploration and exploitation of open quantum systems. We establish a general equivalent condition for an open quantum many-body system governed by the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad dynamics under local drive and/or dissipation to have a quantum independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) steady state. We present a sufficient condition for a system to have a quantum i.i.d. steady state by identifying a set of operators that commute with arbitrary quantum i.i.d. states. In particular, a set of quantum i.i.d. states is found to be an invariant subset of time evolution superoperators for systems that satisfy the sufficient condition. These findings not only identify a class of models with exactly solvable steady states but also lead to a no-go theorem that precludes quantum entanglement and spatial correlations in a broad class of quantum many-body steady states in a dissipative environment.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method to suppress crosstalk from implementing controlled-Z gates via local addressing in neutral atom quantum computers. In these systems, a fraction of the laser light that is applied locally to implement gates typically leaks to other atoms. We analyze the resulting crosstalk in a setup of two gate atoms and one neighboring third atom. We then perturbatively derive a spin-echo-inspired gate protocol that suppresses the leading order of the amplitude error, which dominates the crosstalk. Numerical simulations demonstrate that our gate protocol improves the fidelity by two orders of magnitude across a broad range of experimentally relevant parameters. To further reduce the infidelity, we develop a circuit to cancel remaining phase errors. Our results pave the way for using local addressing for high-fidelity quantum gates on Rydberg-based quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Exponential-recovery model for free-running SPADs with capacity-induced dead-time imperfections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current count-rate models for single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) typically assume an instantaneous recovery of the quantum efficiency following dead-time, leading to a systematic overestimation of the effective detection efficiency for high photon flux. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a generalized analytical count-rate model for free-running SPADs that models the non-instantaneous, exponential recovery of the quantum efficiency following dead-time. Our model, framed within the theory of non-homogeneous Poisson processes, only requires one additional detector parameter -- the exponential-recovery time constant $\tau_\mathrm{r}$. The model accurately predicts detection statistics deep into the saturation regime, outperforming the conventional step-function model by two orders of magnitude in terms of the impinging photon rate. For extremely high photon flux, we further extend the model to capture paralyzation effects. Beyond photon flux estimation, our model simplifies SPAD characterization by enabling the extraction of quantum efficiency $\eta_0$, dead-time $\tau_\mathrm{d}$, and recovery time constant $\tau_\mathrm{r}$ from a single inter-detection interval histogram. This can be achieved with a simple setup, without the need for pulsed lasers or externally gated detectors. We anticipate broad applicability of our model in quantum key distribution (QKD), time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC), LIDAR, and related areas. Furthermore, the model is readily adaptable to other types of dead-time-limited detectors. A Python implementation is provided as supplementary material for swift adoption.</description>

      <title>State-Based Classical Shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical Shadow Tomography (Huang, Kueng and Preskill, Nature Physics 2020) is a method for creating a classical snapshot of an unknown quantum state, which can later be used to predict the value of an a-priori unknown observable on that state. In the short time since their introduction, classical shadows received a lot of attention from the physics, quantum information, and quantum computing (including cryptography) communities. In particular there has been a major effort focused on improving the efficiency, and in particular depth, of generating the classical snapshot.
  Existing constructions rely on a distribution of unitaries as a central building block, and research is devoted to simplifying this family as much as possible. We diverge from this paradigm and show that suitable distributions over \emph{states} can be used as the building block instead. Concretely, we create the snapshot by entangling the unknown input state with an independently prepared auxiliary state, and measuring the resulting entangled state. This state-based approach allows us to consider a building block with arguably weaker properties that has not been studied so far in the context of classical shadows. Notably, our cryptographically-inspired analysis shows that for \emph{efficiently computable} observables, it suffices to use \emph{pseudorandom} families of states. To the best of our knowledge, \emph{computational} classical shadow tomography was not considered in the literature prior to our work.
  Finally, in terms of efficiency, the online part of our method (i.e.\ the part that depends on the input) is simply performing a measurement in the Bell basis, which can be done in constant depth using elementary gates.</description>

      <title>Optimization and characterization of laser excitation for quantum sensing with single nitrogen-vacancy centres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we present a comprehensive method of characterization and optimization of laser irradiation within a confocal microscope tailored to quantum sensing experiments using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres. While confocal microscopy is well-suited for such experiments, precise control and understanding of several optical parameters are essential for reliable single-emitter studies. We investigate the laser beam intensity profile, single-photon emission statistics, fluorescence response under varying polarization and saturation conditions, spectral characteristics, and the temporal profiles of readout and reinitialization pulses. The beam quality is assessed using the beam propagation factor $M^2$, determined via the razorblade technique. Optical fluorescence spectrum is recorded to confirm NV centre emission. To confirm single-emitter operation, we measure second-order autocorrelation function $g^{(2)}(\tau)$. Saturation behaviour is analysed by varying laser power and recording the corresponding fluorescence, while polarization dependence is studied using a half-wave ($\lambda/2$) plate. Temporal laser pulse profile is examined by modulating the power of an acousto-optic modulator. After optimizing all relevant parameters, we demonstrate the microscope's capabilities in driving spin transitions of a single NV centre. This work establishes a straightforward and effective protocol for laser excitation optimization, enhancing the performance and reliability of NV-based quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>Fault-Tolerant Quantum Error Correction for Constant-Excitation Stabilizer Codes under Coherent Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective coherent noise poses challenges for fault-tolerant quantum error correction (FTQEC), as it falls outside the usual stochastic noise models. While constant excitation (CE) codes can naturally avoid coherent noise, a complete fault-tolerant framework for the use of these codes under realistic noise models has been elusive. Here, we introduce a complete fault-tolerant architecture for CE CSS codes based on dual-rail concatenation. After showing that transversal CNOT gates violate CE code constraints, we introduce CE-preserving logical CNOT gates and modified Shor- and Steane-type syndrome extraction schemes using zero-controlled NOT gates and CE-compatible ancilla. This enables fault-tolerant syndrome-extraction circuits fully compatible with CE constraints. We also present an extended stabilizer simulation algorithm that efficiently tracks both stochastic and collective coherent noise. Using our framework, we identify minimal CE codes, including the $[[12,1,3]]$ and $[[14,3,3]]$ codes, and demonstrate that the $[[12,1,3]]$ code achieves strong performance under coherent noise. Our results establish the first complete FTQEC framework for CE codes, demonstrating their robustness to coherent noise. This highlights the potential of CE codes as a possible solution for quantum processors dominated by collective coherent noise.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Quantum Sensing with a Frustrated Kitaev Trimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the response of a Ramsey interferometric quantum sensor based on a frustrated, three-spin system (a Kitaev trimer) to a classical time-dependent field (signal). The system eigenspectrum is symmetric about a critical point, $|\vec{b}| = 0$, with four of the spectral components varying approximately linearly with the magnetic field and four exhibiting a nonlinear dependence. Under the adiabatic approximation and for appropriate initial states, we show that the sensor's response to a zero-mean signal is such that below a threshold, $|\vec{b}| &lt; b_\mathrm{th}$, the sensor does not respond to the signal, whereas above the threshold, the sensor acts as a detector that the signal has occurred. This thresholded response is approximately omnidirectional. Moreover, when deployed in an entangled multisensor configuration, the sensor achieves sensitivity at the Heisenberg limit. Such detectors could be useful both as standalone units for signal detection above a noise threshold and in two- or three-dimensional arrays, analogous to a quantum bubble chamber, for applications such as particle track detection and long-baseline telescopy.</description>

      <title>A Rigorous Introduction to Hamiltonian Simulation via High-Order Product Formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10501v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work provides a rigorous and self-contained introduction to numerical methods for Hamiltonian simulation in quantum computing, with a focus on high-order product formulas for efficiently approximating the time evolution of quantum systems. Aimed at students and researchers seeking a clear mathematical treatment, the study begins with the foundational principles of quantum mechanics and quantum computation before presenting the Lie-Trotter product formula and its higher-order generalizations. In particular, Suzuki's recursive method is explored to achieve improved error scaling. Through theoretical analysis and illustrative examples, the advantages and limitations of these techniques are discussed, with an emphasis on their application to $k$-local Hamiltonians and their role in overcoming classical computational bottlenecks. The work concludes with a brief overview of current advances and open challenges in Hamiltonian simulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work classifies stabilizer codes by the set of diagonal Clifford gates that can be implemented transversally on them. We show that, for any stabilizer code, its group of diagonal transversal Clifford gates on $\ell$ code blocks must be one of six distinct families of matrix groups. We further develop the theory of classifying stabilizer codes by via matrix algebras of endomorphisms first introduced by Rains, and give a complete classification of the diagonal Clifford symmetries of $\ell$ code blocks. A number of corollaries are given in the final section.</description>

      <title>Wave packets in QFT: leading order width corrections to decay rates and clock behaviour under Lorentz boosts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.13768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decay rates in quantum field theory (QFT) are typically calculated assuming the particles are represented by momentum eigenstates (i.e. plane waves). However, strictly speaking, localized free particles should be represented by wave packets. This yields width corrections to the decay rate and to the clock behaviour under Lorentz boosts. We calculate the decay rate of a particle of mass $M$ modeled as a Gaussian wavepacket of width $a$ and centered at zero momentum. We find the decay rate to be $\Gamma_0 \big[1- \frac{3 a^2}{4 M^2} +\mathcal{O}\big(\tfrac{a^4}{M^4}\big)\big]$ where $\Gamma_0$ is the decay rate of the particle at rest treated as a plane wave. The leading correction is then of order $\tfrac{a^2}{M^2}$. We then perform a Lorentz boost of velocity $v$ on the above Gaussian and find that its decay rate does not decrease \textit{exactly} by the Lorentz factor $\sqrt{1-v^2}$. There is a correction of order $\tfrac{a^2v^2}{M^2}$. Therefore, the decaying wave packet does not act exactly like a typical clock under Lorentz boosts and we refer to it is a "WP clock" (wave packet clock). A WP clock does not move with a single velocity relative to an observer but has a spread in velocities (more specifically, a spread in momenta). Nonetheless, it is best viewed as a single clock as the wave packet represents a one-particle state in QFT. WP clocks do not violate Lorentz symmetry and are not based on new physics: they are a consequence of the combined requirements of special relativity, quantum mechanics and \textit{localized} free particles.</description>

      <title>Two types of series expansions valid at strong coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that perturbative expansions in powers of the coupling in quantum mechanics (QM) and quantum field theory (QFT) are asymptotic series. This can be useful at weak coupling but fails at strong coupling. In this work, we present two types of series expansions valid at strong coupling. We apply the series to a basic integral as well as a QM path integral containing a quadratic and quartic term with coupling constant $\lambda$. The first series is the usual asymptotic one, where the quartic interaction is expanded in powers of $\lambda$. The second series is an expansion of the quadratic part where the interaction is left alone. This yields an absolutely convergent series in inverse powers of $\lambda$ valid at strong coupling. For the basic integral, we revisit the first series and identify what makes it diverge even though the original integral is finite. We fix the problem and obtain, remarkably, a series in powers of the coupling which is absolutely convergent and valid at strong coupling. We explain how this series avoids Dyson's argument on convergence. We then consider the QM path integral (discretized with time interval divided into $N$ equal segments). As before, the second series is absolutely convergent and we obtain analytical expressions in inverse powers of $\lambda$ for the $n$th order terms by taking functional derivatives of generalized hypergeometric functions. The expressions are functions of $N$ and we work them out explicitly up to third order. The general procedure has been implemented in a Mathematica program that generates the expressions at any order $n$. We present numerical results at strong coupling for different values of $N$ starting at $N=2$. The series matches the exact numerical value for a given $N$ (up to a certain accuracy). The continuum is formally reached when $N\to \infty$ but in practice this can be reached at small $N$.</description>

Abstract: The sensory perceptions of vision and sound may be considered as complementary doorways towards interpreting and understanding physical phenomena. We provide a few selected samples where scientific data of systems usually not directly accessible to humans may be listened to. The examples are chosen close to the regime where quantum mechanics is applicable. Visual and auditory renderings are compared with some connections to music, illustrating in particular a kind of fractal complexity along the time axis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop the groundwork for a graph theoretic toy model of supersymmetric quantum mechanics. Using discrete Witten-Morse theory, we demonstrate that finite graphs have a natural supersymmetric structure and use this structure to incorporate supersymmetry into an existing model of graph quantum mechanics. We prove that although key characteristics of continuum supersymmetric systems are preserved on finite unweighted graphs, supersymmetry cannot be spontaneously broken. Finally, we prove new results about the behavior of supersymmetric graph quantum systems under edge rewiring.</description>

      <title>Sensing the binding and unbinding of anyons at impurities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anyons are quasiparticles with fractional charge and statistics that arise in strongly correlated two-dimensional systems such as the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect and fractional Chern insulators (FCI). Interactions between anyons can lead to emergent phenomena, such as anyon superconductivity as well as anyon condensation which allows for a hierarchical construction of quantum Hall states. In this work, we study how quasihole anyons in a $\nu=1/3$ Laughlin fractional quantum Hall state can be bound together by a sufficiently strong attractive impurity potential. The competition between the repulsive interaction between the quasiholes themselves and the attractive interaction between the quasiholes and the impurity leads to states with different numbers of quasiholes bound to the impurity. Tuning the chemical potential via gating while remaining within a quantum Hall plateau changes the number of quasiholes bound to the impurity. We propose methods for studying these states experimentally, for example using scanning tunneling microscopy and exciton spectroscopy. While the impurities in traditional platforms such as GaAs heterostructures are typically too weak to observe the binding of anyons, the recently discovered zero-field fractional Chern insulators in twisted MoTe$_2$ offer a platform which may realize the strong-impurity regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of anyons in topologically ordered quantum systems has mainly relied on edge-state interferometry. However, realizing controlled braiding of anyons necessitates the ability to detect and manipulate individual anyons within the bulk. Here, we propose and theoretically investigate a first step toward this goal by demonstrating that a long-lived, optically generated interlayer exciton can bind to a quasihole in a fractional quantum Hall state, forming a composite excitation we term an anyon-trion. Using exact diagonalization, we show that mobile anyon-trions possess a binding energy of approximately 0.5 meV, whereas static anyon-trions exhibit a binding energy of about 0.9 meV, that is linearly proportional to the quasiholes fractional charge. An experimental realization based on photoluminescence from localized interlayer excitons in a quantum twisting microscope setup should allow for a direct optical observation of anyon-trions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Improving the coherence of superconducting qubits is essential for advancing quantum technologies. While superconductors are theoretically perfect conductors, they consistently exhibit residual energy dissipation when driven by microwave currents, limiting coherence times. Here, we report a universal scaling between microwave dissipation and the superfluid density, a bulk property of superconductors related to charge carrier density and disorder. Our analysis spans a wide range of superconducting materials and device geometries, from highly disordered amorphous films to ultra-clean systems with record-high quality factors, including resonators, 3D cavities, and transmon qubits. This scaling reveals an intrinsic bulk dissipation channel, independent of surface dielectric losses, that originates from a universal density of nonequilibrium quasiparticles trapped within disorder-induced spatial variations of the superconducting gap. Our findings define a fundamental limit to coherence set by intrinsic material properties and provide a predictive framework for selecting materials and the design of next-generation superconducting quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Surprisingly High Redundancy in Electronic Structure Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) models for electronic structure rely on large datasets generated through expensive Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory simulations. This study reveals a surprisingly high level of redundancy in such datasets across various material systems, including molecules, simple metals, and complex alloys. Our findings challenge the prevailing assumption that large, exhaustive datasets are necessary for accurate ML predictions of electronic structure. We demonstrate that even random pruning can substantially reduce dataset size with minimal loss in predictive accuracy, while a state-of-the-art coverage-based pruning strategy retains chemical accuracy and model generalizability using up to 100-fold less data and reducing training time by threefold or more. By contrast, widely used importance-based pruning methods, which eliminate seemingly redundant data, can catastrophically fail at higher pruning factors, possibly due to the significant reduction in data coverage. This heretofore unexplored high degree of redundancy in electronic structure data holds the potential to identify a minimal, essential dataset representative of each material class.</description>

      <title>Expansion dynamics of strongly correlated lattice bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the spatio-temporal dynamics of interacting bosons on a two-dimensional Hubbard lattice in the strongly interacting regime, taking into account the dynamics of condensate amplitude as well as the direct transport of non-condensed fluctuations. To that end we develop a selfconsistent density-matrix approach which goes beyond the standard Gutzwiller mean-field theory. Starting from the Liouville-von-Neumann equation we derive a quantum master equation for the time evolution of the system's local density matrix at each lattice site, with a dynamical bath that represents the rest of the system. We apply this method to the expansion dynamics of an initially prepared cloud of interacting bosons in an optical lattice. We observe a ballistic expansion of the condensate, as expected, followed by slow, diffusive transport of the normal bosons. We discuss, in particular, the robustness of the Mott insulator phase as well as its melting due to incoherent transport. The method should be applicable to various models of lattice bosons in the strongly correlated regime.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov formulation of band theory for disordered non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Bloch band theory serves as a cornerstone for understanding intriguing non-Hermitian phenomena, such as the skin effect and extreme spectral sensitivity to boundary conditions. Yet this theory hinges on translational symmetry and thus breaks down in disordered systems. Here, we develop a real-space Lyapunov formulation of band theory that governs the spectra and eigenstates of disordered non-Hermitian systems. This framework yields universal non-Hermitian Thouless relations linking spectral density and localization to Lyapunov exponents under different boundary conditions. We further identify an exact topological criterion: skin modes and Anderson-localized modes correspond to nonzero and zero winding numbers, respectively, revealing the topological nature of the skin-Anderson transition. This transition is dictated by an essential Lyapunov exponent and gives rise to novel unidirectional critical states. Our formulation provides a unified and exact description of spectra and localization in generic one-dimensional non-Hermitian systems without translational symmetry, offering new insights into the interplay among non-Hermiticity, disorder, and topology.</description>

Abstract: A family of discrete Schr\"{o}dinger equations with imaginary potentials $V(x)$ is studied. Inside the domain ${\cal D}$ of unitarity-compatible values of $V(x)$, the reality of all of the bound-state energies survives up to the ``exceptional-point'' (EP) maximally non-Hermitian spectral-degeneracy boundaries $\partial {\cal D}$. The computer-assisted localization of the EP limits is performed showing that the complexity of the task grows quickly with the number $N$ of grid points $x$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We predict a new class of quantum Hall phenomena in completely neutral systems, demonstrating that the interplay between radial electric fields and dipole moments induces exact $e^2/h$ quantization without the need for Landau levels or external magnetic fields. Contrary to conventional wisdom, our theory reveals that: (i) the singularity of line charges does not destroy topological protection, (ii) spin-control of quantization emerges from boundary conditions alone, and (iii) the effect persists up to 25 K, surpassing typical neutral systems. These findings establish electric field engineering as a viable route to topological matter beyond magnetic paradigms.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Hydrogen Exchange Reaction in a Dark Cavity: A Benchmark for Bridging the Gap Between Theory and Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gas-phase hydrogen exchange reaction (HER) is the most fundamental chemical process for benchmarking quantum reaction dynamics. In this Letter, we focus on controlling HER by means of strong light-matter coupling inside a resonant cavity, an approach often called polariton chemistry. In particular, we focus on the isotopic variation of HER involving collisions between molecular hydrogen H$_2$ and deuterium atom D, i.e., H$_2$+D$\to$HD+H. We find that the asymmetry introduced by the different isotopes, despite being small, enables strong cavity-induced modifications of reaction rates. Outside of the cavity the reaction is as usual D+H${_2}$$\to$DH+H. However, inside the cavity another type of reactions take place where D+H$_2$$\to$DH+H+E$_{photon}$, where E$_{photon}$=$\hbar\omega_{cav}$. Our results show that HER is an ideal platform to make a significant step toward closing the gap between theory and experiment in polariton chemistry.</description>

      <title>Emergent Distance from Mutual Information in the Critical 1D XXZ Spin Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The possibility that spatial geometry may emerge from the entanglement structure of a quantum many-body system is a subject of fundamental interest. Here, we propose and numerically test a candidate distance metric in 1D, d_E, defined purely from quantum mutual information (I) via the relation d_E = K_0 / sqrt(I). Using large-scale density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we compute this emergent distance for the ground state of the 1D spin-1/2 XXZ chain, a canonical model system. Our simulations show that in the quantum critical phase at anisotropy $\Delta = 1.0$, the mutual information exhibits a power-law decay consistent with the emergence of a valid metric space. In stark contrast, within the gapped, antiferromagnetic phase ($\Delta = 2.0$), where mutual information decays exponentially, the emergent distance grows exponentially, a behavior inconsistent with the triangle inequality. These results provide numerical evidence that this information-theoretic definition can yield a well-behaved geometry in critical systems, offering a quantitative tool for probing quantum phases and motivating further analytical investigation into the foundations of emergent space.</description>

      <title>Observation of Quantum Coulomb Blockade Facilitated by P-Donor Molecules in Silicon Nano-Transistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-donor architecture developed on the base of silicon technology holds significant potential towards room-temperature qubit and other single-electron tunneling (SET) functionalities. However, within such architecture, the overlap of multiple donor wave-functions results in a complex internal electronic configuration with discrete energy levels. Probing these discrete states, observed as multiple conductance peaks, is essential for understanding inter-donor coupling and exchange interactions towards coherent electron transfer. In this direction, we have experimentally demonstrated one-by-one electron filling within multiple-donor molecules with the fundamental analysis of clear and sustained quantum Coulomb blockade (QCB) effect. Moreover, the underlying physics of molecular orbitals, where the increasing energy leads to a larger spatial extent of the corresponding orbital, has been reflected by the systematic decrement of the respective charging-energies. The molecular energy levels, resulting from the orbital hybridization of individual donors, are also confirmed through first-principles simulations using density functional theory (DFT). Furthermore, Monte Carlo simulations based on the orthodox theory of Coulomb blockade support the observed QCB characteristics.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic adsorption potential of superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the general thermodynamic analysis of Polanyi adsorption potential, the adsorption potential condition for superconductors is obtained exactly by using the quantum state equation we presented. Because this adsorption potential results in changes of electron concentration, temperature and pressure in a certain volume (adsorption space) adjacent to the surface of the lattice, the composition and structure of superconductors are of course decisive for the adsorption potential. Then we calculate the molar adsorption potentials for those typical superconductors, and find that it is positively correlated to the superconductivity temperature , which reveals that those high-superconductors are mainly determined by the higher molar adsorption potentials. In addition, the adsorption potential at still works despite the disappearance of the energy gap of the BCS theory. This shows that beyond the electron-phonon interaction mechanism, the Cooper-paired electrons are mainly formed by this physical adsorption potential for high-superconductors. This adsorption potential theory could explain almost all common facts about high-temperature superconductors, including many anomalies of the normal and superconducting states.</description>

Abstract: We explore the effect of self-orthogonality at exceptional points (EPs) in non-Hermitian Parity-Time-symmetric systems. Using a driven three-band lattice model, we show that the Rabi frequency diverges as the system approaches an EP due to the coalescence of eigenstates. We demonstrate that this divergence manifests in experimentally accessible power oscillations, establishing a direct observable for self-orthogonality. Our results provide a pathway for probing EP physics in various metamaterial platforms.</description>

      <title>Dissipation induced Majarona $0$- and $\pi$-modes in a driven Rashba nanowire</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Periodic drive is an intriguing way of creating topological phases in a non-topological setup. However, most systems are often studied as a closed system, despite being always in contact with the environment, which induces dissipation. Here, we investigate a periodically driven Rashba nanowire in proximity to an $s$-wave superconductor in a dissipative background. The system's dynamics is governed by a periodic Liouvillian operator, from which we construct the Liouvillian time-evolution operator and use the third-quantization method to obtain the `Floquet damping matrix', which captures the spectral and topological properties of the system. We show that the system exhibits edge-localized topological Majorana $0$-modes (MZMs) and $\pi$-modes (MPMs). Additionally, the system also supports a trivial $0$-modes (TZMs) and $\pi$-modes (TPMs), which are also localized at the edges of the system. The MZMs and the MPMs are connected to the bulk topology and carry a bulk topological invariant, while the emergence of TZMs and TPMs is primarily tied to exceptional points and is topologically trivial. We study the topological phase diagrams in terms of the topological invariants and show that the dissipation can modify the topological phase diagram substantially and even induce topological phases in the system. Our work extends the understanding of a driven-dissipative topological superconductor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The negatively charged diamond nitrogen-vacancy ($\mathrm{{NV}^-}$) center plays a central role in many cutting edge quantum sensing applications; despite this, much is still unknown about the energy levels in this system. The ionization energy of the $\mathrm{^{1}E}$ singlet state in the $\mathrm{{NV}^-}$ has only recently been measured at between 2.25 eV and 2.33 eV. In this work, we further refine this energy by measuring the $\mathrm{^{1}E}$ energy as a function of laser wavelength and diamond temperature via magnetically mediated spin-selective photoluminescence (PL) quenching; this PL quenching indicating at what wavelength ionization induces population transfer from the $\mathrm{^{1}E}$ into the neutral $\mathrm{{NV}^0}$ charge configuration. Measurements are performed for excitation wavelengths between 450 nm and 470 nm and between 540 nm and 566 nm in increments of 2 nm, and for temperatures ranging from about 50 K to 150 K in 5 K increments. We determine the $\mathrm{^{1}E}$ ionization energy to be between 2.29 and 2.33 eV, which provides about a two-fold reduction in uncertainty of this quantity. Distribution level: A.

Abstract: We explore and generalize a Cauchy-Schwarz-type inequality originally proved in [Electronic Journal of Linear Algebra 35, 156-180 (2019)]: $\|\mathbf{v}^2\|\|\mathbf{w}^2\| - \langle\mathbf{v}^2,\mathbf{w}^2\rangle \leq \|\mathbf{v}\|^2\|\mathbf{w}\|^2 - \langle\mathbf{v},\mathbf{w}\rangle^2$ for all $\mathbf{v},\mathbf{w} \in \mathbb{R}^n$. We present three new proofs of this inequality that better illustrate "why" it is true and generalize it in several different ways: we generalize from vectors to matrices, we explore which exponents other than 2 result in the inequality holding, and we derive a version of the inequality involving three or more vectors.</description>

      <title>Polaritonic Machine Learning for Graph-based Data Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic and polaritonic systems offer a fast and efficient platform for accelerating machine learning (ML) through physics-based computing. To gain a computational advantage, however, polaritonic systems must: (1) exploit features that specifically favor nonlinear optical processing; (2) address problems that are computationally hard and depend on these features; (3) integrate photonic processing within broader ML pipelines. In this letter, we propose a polaritonic machine learning approach for solving graph-based data problems. We demonstrate how lattices of condensates can efficiently embed relational and topological information from point cloud datasets. This information is then incorporated into a pattern recognition workflow based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), leading to significantly improved learning performance compared to physics-agnostic methods. Our extensive benchmarking shows that photonic machine learning achieves over 90\% accuracy for Betti number classification and clique detection tasks - a substantial improvement over the 35\% accuracy of bare CNNs. Our study introduces a distinct way of using photonic systems as fast tools for feature engineering, while building on top of high-performing digital machine learning.</description>

Abstract: For chaotic scattering systems we investigate the left-right Husimi representation, which combines left and right resonance states. We demonstrate that the left-right Husimi representation is invariant in the semiclassical limit under the corresponding closed classical dynamics, which we call quantum invariance. Furthermore, we show that it factorizes into a classical multifractal structure times universal quantum fluctuations. Numerical results for a dielectric cavity, the three-disk scattering system, and quantum maps confirm both the quantum invariance and the factorization.</description>

Abstract: Relativistic quantum mechanics can be considered to have begun with a search for wave equations corresponding to each intrinsic spin. However, relativistic quantum physics differs fundamentally from the non-relativistic wave mechanics. It requires a formalism allowing \ creation and destruction of particles. This gets proper treatment only in a framework called quantum field theory. This article is a semi-historic account of the intriguing new features which emerge as a part of quantum field theory. Such a discussion is impossible without a basic presentation of the formalism itself. Hence some mathematics is included in finer print. The article is directed mostly to those familiar with essential classical mechanics and basic quantum mechanics, though I strive to provide a flavour of the subject to the keenly interested non-physics reader.</description>

Abstract: The Hubbard model at $U\to\infty$ has recently been shown to have resonant valence bond (RVB) ground states on the corner-sharing sawtooth and pyrochlore lattices in the dilute doping limit of a single vacancy. In an effort to further generalize those results, I study how the ground state is modified when not all corners are shared between two tetrahedra as in the quasi-1D lattices of a pyrochlore stripe, and how to approach the problem in the case of finite doping. Using a non-Abelian version of the flux inequality, the tetrahedron chain is shown to have degenerate RVB-like ground states. The Bethe ansatz (BA) is adapted to solve the sawtooth chain with spinless or spin-polarized fermions and multiple holons, which is the first example of applying BA to a quasi-1D lattice.</description>

Abstract: Strontium-88 is a versatile atomic species often used in quantum optics, precision metrology, and quantum computing. Consolidated atomic data is essential for the planning, execution, and evaluation of experiments. In this reference, we present physical and optical properties of neutral $^{88}$Sr relevant to these applications. Here we focus on experimental results and supplement these with theoretical values. We present equations to convert values and derive important parameters. Tabulated results include key parameters for commonly used transitions in $^{88}$Sr ($^1\mathrm{S}_0 \rightarrow \, ^1\mathrm{P}_1$, $^1\mathrm{S}_0 \rightarrow \, ^3\mathrm{P}_{0,1,2}$, and $^3\mathrm{P}_{0,1,2} \rightarrow \, ^3\mathrm{S}_1$). This dataset serves as an up-to-date reference for studies involving bosonic $^{88}$Sr.</description>

      <title>Towards the ultimate limits of quantum channel discrimination and quantum communication</title>

Abstract: Distinguishability is fundamental to information theory and extends naturally to quantum systems. While quantum state discrimination is well understood, quantum channel discrimination remains challenging due to the dynamic nature of channels and the variety of discrimination strategies. This work advances the understanding of quantum channel discrimination and its fundamental limits. We develop new tools for quantum divergences, including sharper bounds on the quantum hypothesis testing relative entropy and additivity results for channel divergences. We establish a quantum Stein's lemma for memoryless channel discrimination, and link the strong converse property to the asymptotic equipartition property and continuity of divergences. Notably, we prove the equivalence of exponentially strong converse properties under coherent and sequential strategies. We further explore the interplay among operational regimes, discrimination strategies, and channel divergences, deriving exponents in various settings and contributing to a unified framework for channel discrimination. Finally, we recast quantum communication tasks as discrimination problems, uncovering deep connections between channel capacities, channel discrimination, and the mathematical structure of channel divergences. These results bridge two core areas of quantum information theory and offer new insights for future exploration.</description>

      <title>Globally Optimal Quantum Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.05790v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimization of constrained quantum control problems powers quantum technologies. This task becomes very difficult when these control problems are non-convex and plagued with dense local extrema. For such problems current optimization methods must be repeated many times to find good solutions, each time requiring many simulations of the system. Here, we present Quantum Control via Polynomial Optimization (QCPOP), a method that eliminates this problem by directly finding globally optimal solutions. The resulting increase in speed, which can be a thousandfold or more, makes it possible to solve problems that were previously intractable. This remarkable advance is due to global optimization methods recently developed for polynomial functions. We demonstrate the power of this method by showing that it obtains an optimal solution in a single run for a problem in which local extrema are so dense that gradient methods require thousands of runs to reach a similar fidelity. Since QCPOP is able to find the global optimum for quantum control, we expect that it will not only enhance the utility of quantum control by making it much easier to find the necessary protocols, but provide a key tool for understanding the precise limits of quantum technologies. Finally, we note that the ability to cast quantum control as polynomial optimization resolves an open question regarding the computability of exact solutions to quantum control problems.</description>

      <title>Practical quantum secure direct communication with squeezed states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.14322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) is a rapidly developing quantum communication approach, where secure information is directly transmitted, providing an alternative to key-based (de)encryption processes via Quantum Key Distribution (QKD). During the last decade, optical QSDC protocols based on discrete variable encodings have been successfully realized. Recently, continuous-variable (CV) QSDC schemes have been proposed, benefiting from less-sophisticated implementations with proven security. Here, we report the first table-top experimental demonstration of a CV-QSDC system and assess its security. For this realization, we analyze the security of different configurations, including coherent and squeezed sources, with Wyner wiretap channel theory in presence of a beam splitter attack. This practical protocol not only demonstrates the principle of QSDC systems based on CV encoding, but also showcases the advantage of squeezed states over coherent ones in attaining enhanced security and reliable communication in lossy and noisy channels. Our realization, which is founded on mature telecom components, paves the way into future threat-less quantum metropolitan networks, compatible with coexisting advanced wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) systems.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum Rabi model: Solutions and exceptional points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09749v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric non-Hermitian quantum Rabi model (QRM) with imaginary coupling is solved using the Bogoliubov operators approach. A transcendental function responsible for the exact solutions is derived, with its zeros yielding the regular spectrum. We find two types of intersections: One is the exceptional point (EP), which is widely studied in the non-Hermitian system; another one is due to doubly degenerate states caused by the conserved QRM parity, which is well-known in the Hermitian QRM. These intersections are identified through this transcendental function. EPs emerge between pairs of adjacent excited energy levels, shifting toward lower coupling strengths as energy levels increase. The fidelity susceptibility diverges to negative infinity at the EPs, consistent with recent findings in non-Hermitian systems, while it diverges to positive infinity at the doubly degenerate points. The EPs are further confirmed by the vanishing c-product in the biorthogonal basis. All eigenstates are characterized by conserved energy and QRM parity. We conclude that the non-Hermitian QRM is integrable, analogous to its Hermitian counterpart.</description>

      <title>Rate Function Modelling of Quantum Many-Body Adiabaticity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17415v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum adiabatic theorem is a fundamental result in quantum mechanics, with a multitude of applications, both theoretical and practical. Here, we investigate the dynamics of adiabatic processes for quantum many-body systems %in detail by analysing the properties of observable-free, intensive quantities. In particular, we study the adiabatic rate function $f(T, \Delta \lambda)$ in dependence of the ramp time $T$, which gives us a complete characterization of the many-body adiabatic fidelity as a function of $T$ and the strength of the parameter displacement $\Delta \lambda$. $f(T, \Delta \lambda)$ quantifies the deviation from adiabaticity for a given process and therefore allows us to control and define the notion of adiabaticity in many-body systems. First we study $f(T, \Delta \lambda)$ for the 1D transverse field Ising model and the Luttinger liquid, both of which are quadratic systems and therefore allow us to look at the thermodynamic limit. For ramps across gapped phases, we relate $f(T, \Delta \lambda)$ to the transition probability of the system and for ramps across a gapless point, or gapless phase we relate it to the excitation density of the relevant quasiparticles. Then we investigate the XXZ model which allows us to see the qualitative features that survive when interactions are turned on. Several key results in the literature regarding the interplay of the thermodynamic and the adiabatic limit are obtained as inferences from the properties of $f(T, \Delta \lambda)$ in the large $T$ limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02595v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces the Quantum Federated Neural Network for Financial Fraud Detection (QFNN-FFD), a cutting-edge framework merging Quantum Machine Learning (QML) and quantum computing with Federated Learning (FL) for financial fraud detection. Using quantum technologies' computational power and the robust data privacy protections offered by FL, QFNN-FFD emerges as a secure and efficient method for identifying fraudulent transactions within the financial sector. Implementing a dual-phase training model across distributed clients enhances data integrity and enables superior performance metrics, achieving precision rates consistently above 95%. Additionally, QFNN-FFD demonstrates exceptional resilience by maintaining an impressive 80% accuracy, highlighting its robustness and readiness for real-world applications. This combination of high performance, security, and robustness against noise positions QFNN-FFD as a transformative advancement in financial technology solutions and establishes it as a new benchmark for privacy-focused fraud detection systems. This framework facilitates the broader adoption of secure, quantum-enhanced financial services and inspires future innovations that could use QML to tackle complex challenges in other areas requiring high confidentiality and accuracy.</description>

Abstract: The local Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) quantum master equation is a powerful tool for the study of open quantum many-body systems. However, its microscopic derivation applicable to many-body systems is available only in limited cases of weak internal couplings, and it has yet to be fully understood under what microscopic conditions the local GKSL equation is valid. We derive the local GKSL equation on the basis of the Lieb-Robinson bound, which provides an upper bound of the propagation of information in quantum many-body systems. We numerically test the validity of the derived local GKSL equation for a one-dimensional tight-binding fermion chain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05068v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A universal quantum computer can simulate diverse quantum systems, with electronic structure for chemistry offering challenging problems for practical use cases around the hundred-qubit mark. While current quantum processors have reached this size, deep circuits and large number of measurements lead to prohibitive runtimes for quantum computers in isolation. Here, we demonstrate the use of classical distributed computing to offload all but an intrinsically quantum component of a workflow for electronic structure simulations. Using a Heron superconducting processor and the supercomputer Fugaku, we simulate the ground-state dissociation of N$_2$ and the [2Fe-2S] and [4Fe-4S] clusters, with circuits up to 77 qubits and 10,570 gates. The proposed algorithm processes quantum samples to produce upper bounds for the ground-state energy and sparse approximations to the ground-state wavefunctions. Our results suggest that, for current error rates, a quantum-centric supercomputing architecture can tackle challenging chemistry problems beyond sizes amenable to exact diagonalization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08941v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the efficacy of Stochastic Hill Climbing with Random Restarts (SHC-RR) compared to Local Search (LS) strategies within the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) framework across various problem models. Employing uniform parameter settings, including the number of restarts and SHC steps, we analyze LS with two distinct perturbation operations: multiplication and summation. Our comparative analysis encompasses multiple versions of max-cut and random Ising model (RI) problems, utilizing QAOA models with depths ranging from $1L$ to $3L$. These models incorporate diverse mixing operator configurations, which integrate $RX$ and $RY$ gates, and explore the effects of an entanglement stage within the mixing operator. Our results consistently show that SHC-RR outperforms LS approaches, showcasing superior efficacy despite its ostensibly simpler optimization mechanism. Furthermore, we observe that the inclusion of entanglement stages within mixing operators significantly impacts model performance, either enhancing or diminishing results depending on the specific problem context.</description>

      <title>Probing quantum complexity via universal saturation of stabilizer entropies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04190v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonstabilizerness or `magic' is a key resource for quantum computing and a necessary condition for quantum advantage. Non-Clifford operations turn stabilizer states into resourceful states, where the amount of nonstabilizerness is quantified by resource measures such as stabilizer R\'enyi entropies (SREs). Here, we show that SREs saturate their maximum value at a critical number of non-Clifford operations. Close to the critical point SREs show universal behavior. Remarkably, the derivative of the SRE crosses at the same point independent of the number of qubits and can be rescaled onto a single curve. We find that the critical point depends non-trivially on R\'enyi index $\alpha$. For random Clifford circuits doped with T-gates, the critical T-gate density scales independently of $\alpha$. In contrast, for random Hamiltonian evolution, the critical time scales linearly with qubit number for $\alpha&gt;1$, while is a constant for $\alpha&lt;1$. This highlights that $\alpha$-SREs reveal fundamentally different aspects of nonstabilizerness depending on $\alpha$: $\alpha$-SREs with $\alpha&lt;1$ relate to Clifford simulation complexity, while $\alpha&gt;1$ probe the distance to the closest stabilizer state and approximate state certification cost via Pauli measurements. As technical contributions, we observe that the Pauli spectrum of random evolution can be approximated by two highly concentrated peaks which allows us to compute its SRE. Further, we introduce a class of random evolution that can be expressed as random Clifford circuits and rotations, where we provide its exact SRE. Our results opens up new approaches to characterize the complexity of quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) requires significant quantum resources to address practical real-world problems. When the underlying quantum information exhibits hierarchical structures in the data, limitations persist in training complexity and generalization. Research should prioritize both the efficient design of quantum architectures and the development of learning strategies to optimize resource usage. We propose a framework called quantum curriculum learning (Q-CurL) for quantum data, where the curriculum introduces simpler tasks or data to the learning model before progressing to more challenging ones. Q-CurL exhibits robustness to noise and data limitations, which is particularly relevant for current and near-term noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. We achieve this through a curriculum design based on quantum data density ratios and a dynamic learning schedule that prioritizes the most informative quantum data. Empirical evidence shows that Q-CurL significantly enhances training convergence and generalization for unitary learning and improves the robustness of quantum phase recognition tasks. Q-CurL is effective with physical learning applications in physics and quantum chemistry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02923v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately estimating the properties of quantum systems is a central challenge in quantum computing and quantum information. We propose a method to obtain unbiased estimators of multiple observables with low statistical error by post-processing informationally complete measurements using tensor networks. Compared to other observable estimation protocols based on classical shadows and measurement frames, our approach offers several advantages: (i) it can be optimised to provide lower statistical error, resulting in a reduced measurement budget to achieve a specified estimation precision; (ii) it scales to a large number of qubits due to the tensor network structure; (iii) it can be applied to any measurement protocol with measurement operators that have an efficient tensor-network representation. We benchmark the method through various numerical examples, including spin and chemical systems, and show that our method can provide statistical error that are orders of magnitude lower than the ones given by classical shadows.</description>

      <title>Barycentric bounds on the error exponents of quantum hypothesis exclusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13728v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum state exclusion is an operational task that has significance in studying foundational questions related to interpreting quantum theory. In such a task, one is given a system whose state is randomly selected from a finite set, and the goal is to identify a state from the set that is not the true state of the system. An error, i.e., an unsuccessful exclusion, occurs if and only if the state identified is the true state. In this paper, we study the optimal error probability of quantum state exclusion and its error exponent -- the rate at which the error probability decays asymptotically -- from an information-theoretic perspective. Our main finding is a single-letter upper bound on the error exponent of state exclusion given by the multivariate log-Euclidean Chernoff divergence, and we prove that this improves upon the best previously known upper bound. We also extend our analysis to the more complicated task of quantum channel exclusion, and we establish a single-letter and efficiently computable upper bound on its error exponent, even assuming the use of adaptive strategies. We derive both upper bounds, for state and channel exclusion, based on one-shot analysis and formulate them as a type of multivariate divergence measure called a barycentric Chernoff divergence. Moreover, our result on channel exclusion has implications in two important special cases. First, for the special case of two hypotheses, our upper bound provides the first known efficiently computable upper bound on the error exponent of symmetric binary channel discrimination. Second, for the special case of classical channels, we show that our upper bound is achievable by a parallel strategy, thus solving the exact error exponent of classical channel exclusion and generalising a similar result on symmetric binary classical channel discrimination.</description>

      <title>A Counterdiabatic Route to Entanglement Steering and Dynamical Freezing in the Floquet Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Controlling the dynamics of quantum many-body systems is crucial for developing quantum technologies. This work demonstrates that counter-diabatic (CD) driving provides a powerful tool for steering collective spin systems along entangled trajectories for a long time. In particular, CD driving leads to approximate stroboscopic freezing and eternal entanglement oscillations for a large class of initial states in the periodically driven Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model. Intriguingly, CD driving generates spin squeezing and its associated metrologically useful multipartite entanglement at the mid-point of every drive cycle, when the system is initially prepared in a fully x-polarized state. The CD driving induced non-ergodic dynamics is accompanied by a decrease in the average eigenstate entanglement and inverse participation ratio, thereby signalling greater eigenstate localization. Our work opens a new route to evade Floquet heating and control entanglement generation in collective spin systems.</description>

Abstract: The performance of quantum key distribution (QKD) heavily depends on statistical inference. For a broad class of protocols, the central statistical task is a random sampling problem, customarily addressed using a hypergeometric tail bound due to Serfling. Here, we provide an alternative solution for this task of unprecedented tightness among QKD security analyses. As a by-product, confidence intervals for the average of nonidentical Bernoulli parameters follow too. These naturally fit in statistical analyses of decoy-state QKD and also outperform standard tools. Last, we show that, in a vast parameter regime, the use of tail bounds is not enforced because the cumulative mass function of the hypergeometric distribution is accurately computable. This sharply decreases the minimum block sizes necessary for QKD, and reveals the tightness of our analytical bounds when moderate-to-large blocks are considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08301v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe an inexpensive and accessible instructional setup that explores particle trapping with a planar linear ion trap. The planar trap is constructed using standard printed circuit board manufacturing and is designed to trap macroscopic charged particles in air. Trapping, shuttling, and splitting are demonstrated to students using these particles, which are visible to the naked eye. Students control trap voltages and can compare properties of particle motion with an analytic model of the trap using a computer vision program for particle tracking. Learning outcomes include understanding the design considerations for planar AC traps, mechanisms underpinning particle ejection, the physics of micromotion, and methods of data analysis using standard computer vision libraries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a method for visualizing the internal structure of multipartite entanglement in pure stabilizer states. Our algorithm graphically organizes the many-body correlations in a hierarchical structure. This provides a rich taxonomy from which one can simultaneously extract many quantitative features of a state including some traditional quantities such as entanglement depth, k-uniformity and entanglement entropy. Our method also presents an alternative computational tool for extracting the exact entanglement depth and all separable partitions of a stabilizer state. Our construction is gauge invariant and goes beyond traditional entanglement measures by visually revealing how quantum information and entanglement is distributed. We use this tool to analyze the internal structures of prototypical stabilizer states (GHZ state, cluster state, stabilizer error correction codes) and are able to contrast the complexity of highly entangled volume law states generated by random unitary operators and random projective measurements.</description>

      <title>On some states minimizing uncertainty relations: A new look at these relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08131v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analyzing Heisenberg--Robertson (HR) and Schr\"{o}dinger uncertainty relations we found, that there can exist a large set of states of the quantum system under considerations, for which the lower bound of the product of the standard deviations of a pair of non--commuting observables, $A$ and $B$, is zero, and which differ from those described in the literature. These states are not eigenstates of either the observable $A$ or $B$. The correlation function for these observables in such states is equal to zero. We have also shown that the so--called "sum uncertainty relations" also do not provide any information about lower bounds on the standard deviations calculated for these states. We additionally show that the uncertainty principle in its most general form has two faces: one is that it is a lower bound on the product of standard deviations, and the other is that the product of standard deviations is an upper bound on the modulus of the correlation function of a pair of the non--commuting observables in the state under consideration.</description>

      <title>Matchgate circuits deeply thermalize</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the ensemble of states generated by performing projective measurements on the output of a random matchgate (or free-fermionic) quantum circuit. We rigorously show that this `projected ensemble' exhibits deep thermalization: For large system sizes, it converges towards a universal ensemble that is uniform over the manifold of Gaussian fermionic states. As well as proving moment-wise convergence of these ensembles, we demonstrate that the full distribution of any physical observable in the projected ensemble is close to its universal form in Wasserstein-1 distance, which we argue is an appropriate and efficiently computable measure of convergence when studying deep thermalization. Using this metric, we also numerically find that local matchgate circuits deeply thermalize after a timescale $t \sim L^2$ set by the diffusive spreading of quantum information. Our work opens up new avenues to experimentally accessible protocols to probe the emergence of quantum statistical mechanics and benchmark quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>LEP-QNN: Loan Eligibility Prediction using Quantum Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting loan eligibility with high accuracy remains a significant challenge in the finance sector. Accurate predictions enable financial institutions to make informed decisions, mitigate risks, and effectively adapt services to meet customer needs. However, the complexity and the high-dimensional nature of financial data have always posed significant challenges to achieving this level of precision. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel approach that employs Quantum Machine Learning (QML) for Loan Eligibility Prediction using Quantum Neural Networks (LEP-QNN). Our innovative approach achieves an accuracy of 98% in predicting loan eligibility from a single, comprehensive dataset. This performance boost is attributed to the strategic implementation of a dropout mechanism within the quantum circuit, aimed at minimizing overfitting and thereby improving the model's predictive reliability. In addition, our exploration of various optimizers leads to identifying the most efficient setup for our LEP-QNN framework, optimizing its performance. We also rigorously evaluate the resilience of LEP-QNN under different quantum noise scenarios, ensuring its robustness and dependability for quantum computing environments. This research showcases the potential of QML in financial predictions and establishes a foundational guide for advancing QML technologies, marking a step towards developing advanced, quantum-driven financial decision-making tools.</description>

      <title>Overcoming Quantum Metrology Singularity through Sequential Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The simultaneous estimation of multiple unknown parameters is the most general scenario in quantum sensing. Quantum multi-parameter estimation theory provides fundamental bounds on the achievable precision of simultaneous estimation. However, these bounds can become singular (no finite bound exists) in multi-parameter sensing due to parameter interdependencies, limited probe accessibility, and insufficient measurement outcomes. Here, we address the singularity issue in quantum sensing through a simple mechanism based on a sequential measurement strategy. This sensing scheme overcomes the singularity constraint and enables the simultaneous estimation of multiple parameters with a local and fixed measurement throughout the sensing protocol. This is because sequential measurements, involving consecutive steps of local measurements followed by probe evolution, inherently produce correlated measurement data that grows exponentially with the number of sequential measurements. Finally, through two different examples, namely a strongly correlated probe and a light-matter system, we demonstrate how such singularities are reflected when inferring the unknown parameters through Bayesian estimation.</description>

      <title>Interaction-Induced Second-Order Skin Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In contrast to the conventional (first-order) non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) in a $d$-dimensional system with linear size $L$, the $n$th-order (higher-order) NHSE is characterized by skin modes localized at lower-dimensional boundaries of dimension $(d-n)$. The total number of these modes scales linearly with the system size $L$. Significant progress has been made in understanding higher-order NHSE in non-interacting systems. In this work, we demonstrate the many-body interaction induced second-order skin effect in a two-dimensional non-Hermitian bosonic system. Specifically, we construct a square lattice that incorporates nonreciprocal single-boson hopping, onsite many-body interactions and two-boson pairing hopping. In the absence of interactions, no second-order NHSE is observed. However, with the inclusion of interactions, we identify interaction-induced skin modes for in-gap doublon states (i.e., bound pairs of bosons) localized at the corners of the lattice, while the bulk doublon states remain extended. These corner-localized skin modes arise from the interplay between interaction-induced edge states, localized along one-dimensional boundaries, and the nonreciprocal hopping along these boundaries. Furthermore, the number of corner skin modes scales linearly with the system size, confirming the presence of second-order NHSE in this interacting system. Our findings introduce a novel approach to realizing higher-order skin effects by leveraging interactions.</description>

Abstract: We investigate nonreciprocal scattering within the modes of a microwave frequency comb. Adjusting the pump frequencies, amplitudes, and phases of a Josephson parametric oscillator, we control constructive interference for the $m \longrightarrow \ell$ scattering processes, while concurrently achieving destructive interference for the inverse process $\ell \longrightarrow m$. We outline the methodology for realizing nonreciprocity in the context of two-mode isolation and a three-mode circulation, which we extend to multiple modes. We find good agreement between the experiments and a linearized theoretical model. Nonreciprocal scattering expands the toolset for parametric control, with the potential to engineer alternative quantum correlations.</description>

Abstract: As quantum computers require highly specialized and stable environments to operate, expanding their capabilities within a single system presents significant technical challenges. By interconnecting multiple quantum processors, distributed quantum computing can facilitate the execution of more complex and larger-scale quantum algorithms. End-to-end heuristics for the distribution of quantum circuits have been developed so far. In this work, we derive an exact integer programming approach for the Distributed Quantum Circuit (DQC) problem, assuming fixed module allocations. Since every DQC algorithm necessarily yields a module allocation function, our formulation can be integrated with it as a post-processing step. This improves on the hypergraph partitioning formulation, which finds a module allocation function and an efficient distribution at once. We also show that a suboptimal heuristic to find good allocations can outperform previous methods. In particular, for quantum Fourier transform circuits, we conjecture from experiments that the optimal module allocation is the trivial one found by this method.</description>

      <title>Excessive precision compromises accuracy even with unlimited resources due to the trade-off in quantum metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precision and accuracy, as two crucial criteria for quantum metrology, have previously lacked rigorous definitions and distinctions. In this paper, we provide a unified definition of precision and accuracy from the perspective of distinguishing neighboring quantum states. Using the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound as a lower bound for precision, we find that the corresponding accuracy will fall short of expectations, because the bias of the parameter estimation cannot be ignored. Given that probability estimation is unbiased, defining precision from the perspective of probability distributions provides a more comprehensive approach. This leads to a correction of the traditional precision lower bound by a factor of 2. The trade-off between precision and accuracy shows that precision can be further improved by sacrificing accuracy, while it should be restricted by inherent precision limit. The inherent precision limit, determined by the number of sampling, can reach the Heisenberg scaling even without entanglement resources, which, however, comes at the cost of significantly reduced accuracy. We show that accuracy may actually decrease with increasing sampling when one pursues excessive precision, which indicates the trade-off should be considered even with unlimited resources.</description>

      <title>Dirac's variational approach to semiclassical Kramers problem in Smoluchowski limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kramers escape from a metastable state in the presence of both thermal and quantum fluctuations under strong damping is treated as a thermally activated process in a quantum modified semiclassical potential. Dirac's time-dependent variational method together with the Jackiw-Kerman function is employed to derive the semiclassical potential. Quantum correction is incorporated in the drift potential, and is determined by quasi-stationary conditions and minimal uncertainty relation. The semiclassical rate obtained here is consistent in form with those from the quantum Smoluchowski equations deduced heuristically by modifying the diffusion coefficient using the path-integral method. Unlike approaches using the path-integral, which involves continuation into imaginary time, the approach here is simpler and more easily understood in terms of classical picture.</description>

      <title>Indefinite Time Directed Quantum Metrology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18264v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the performance of the metrology scheme by employing a quantum time flip during encoding, a specific case of processes with indefinite time direction, which we refer to as indefinite time directed metrology (ITDM). In the case of single parameter estimation of a unitary, we demonstrate that our protocol can achieve Heisenberg scaling (1/N) with product probe states, surpassing the standard quantum limit (1/\sqrt{N}), where N is the number of particles in the probe. We establish this by computing the quantum Fisher information (QFI) which is a lower bound on the root mean square error occurred during parameter estimation. Although we analytically prove the optimality of the symmetric product probe state in ITDM, entangled probe states produce a higher QFI than optimal product probes without enhancing scaling, highlighting the non-essentiality of entanglement. For phase estimation, we propose a single-qubit measurement on the control qubit that accomplishes near-optimal Fisher information and eventually reaches Heisenberg scaling. Our findings reveal the best orientation of product probe states in every pertinent situation, emphasizing its independence from the parameter to be estimated in the limiting case. Furthermore, we illustrate the benefits of ITDM in noisy metrology, outperforming existing techniques in some situations.</description>

      <title>Fidelity Aware Multipath Routing for Multipartite State Distribution in Quantum Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of distributing entangled multipartite states across a quantum network with improved distribution rate and fidelity. For this, we propose fidelity-aware multi-path routing protocols, assess their performance in terms of the rate and fidelity of the distributed Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, and compare such performance against that of single-path routing. Simulation results show that the proposed multi-path routing protocols select routes that require more Bell states compared to single-path routing, but also require fewer rounds of Bell state generation. We also optimised the trade-off between distribution rate and fidelity by selecting an appropriate cutoff to the quantum memory storage time. Using such a cutoff technique, the proposed multi-path protocols can achieve up to an 8.3 times higher distribution rate and up to a 28% improvement in GHZ state fidelity compared to single-path routing. These results show that multi-path routing both improves the distribution rates and enhances fidelity for multipartite state distribution.</description>

Abstract: A lattice beam configuration which results in an isotropic 3D trap near the surface of an atom chip is described. The lattice is formed near the surface of a reflectively coated atom chip, where three incident beams and three reflected beams intersect. The coherent interference of these six beams form a phase-stable optical lattice which extends to the surface of the atom chip. The lattice is experimentally realized and the trap frequency is measured. Degenerate Raman sideband cooling is performed in the optical lattice, cooling 80 million atoms to 1.1 $\mu$K.</description>

      <title>Quantum Coherence of Topologically Frustrated Spin Chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of entanglement and magic properties in topologically frustrated systems suggests that, in the thermodynamic limit, these quantities decompose into two distinct contributions. One is determined by the specific nature of the model and its Hamiltonian, and another arises from topological frustration itself, resulting in being independent of the Hamiltonian's parameters. In this work, we test the generality of this picture by investigating an additional quantum resource, namely quantum coherence, in two different models where topological frustration is induced through an appropriate choice of boundary conditions. Our findings reveal a perfect analogy between the behavior of quantum coherence and that of other quantum resources, particularly magic, providing further evidence in support of the universality of this picture and the topological nature of this source of frustration.</description>

      <title>Feedback Connections in Quantum Reservoir Computing with Mid-Circuit Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22380v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing approaches to quantum reservoir computing can be broadly categorized into restart-based and continuous protocols. Restart-based methods require reinitializing the quantum circuit for each time step, while continuous protocols use mid-circuit measurements to enable uninterrupted information processing. A gap exists between these two paradigms: while restart-based methods naturally have high execution times due to the need for circuit reinitialization, they can employ novel feedback connections to enhance performance. In contrast, continuous methods have significantly faster execution times but typically lack such feedback mechanisms. In this work, we investigate a novel quantum reservoir computing scheme that integrates feedback connections, which can operate within the coherence time of a qubit. We demonstrate our architecture using a minimal example and evaluate memory capacity and predictive capabilities. We show that the correlation coefficient for the short-term memory task on past inputs is nonzero, indicating that feedback connections can effectively operate during continuous processing to allow the model to remember past inputs.</description>

      <title>PHOENIX: Pauli-Based High-Level Optimization Engine for Instruction Execution on NISQ Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03529v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQA) based on Hamiltonian simulation represent a specialized class of quantum programs well-suited for near-term quantum computing applications due to its modest resource requirements in terms of qubits and circuit depth. Unlike the conventional single-qubit (1Q) and two-qubit (2Q) gate sequence representation, Hamiltonian simulation programs are essentially composed of disciplined subroutines known as Pauli exponentiations (Pauli strings with coefficients) that are variably arranged. To capitalize on these distinct program features, this study introduces PHOENIX, a highly effective compilation framework that primarily operates at the high-level Pauli-based intermediate representation (IR) for generic Hamiltonian simulation programs. PHOENIX exploits global program optimization opportunities to the greatest extent, compared to existing SOTA methods despite some of them also utilizing similar IRs. Experimental results demonstrate that PHOENIX outperforms SOTA VQA compilers across diverse program categories, backend ISAs, and hardware topologies.</description>

      <title>Survival of the Optimized: An Evolutionary Approach to T-depth Reduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Error Correction (QEC) is the cornerstone of practical Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing (FTQC), but incurs enormous resource overheads. Circuits must decompose into Clifford+T gates, and the non-transversal T gates demand costly magic-state distillation. As circuit complexity grows, sequential T-gate layers ("T-depth") increase, amplifying the spatiotemporal overhead of QEC. Optimizing T-depth is NP-hard, and existing greedy or brute-force strategies are either inefficient or computationally prohibitive. We frame T-depth reduction as a search optimization problem and present a Genetic Algorithm (GA) framework that approximates optimal layer-merge patterns across the non-convex search space. We introduce a mathematical formulation of the circuit expansion for systematic layer reordering and a greedy initial merge-pair selection, accelerating the convergence and enhancing the solution quality. In our benchmark with ~90-100 qubits, our method reduces T-depth by 79.23% and overall T-count by 41.86%. Compared to the reversible circuit benchmarks, we achieve a 2.58x improvement in T-depth over the state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its viability for near-term FTQC.</description>

      <title>Entropy bounds from quantum thermodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within an inherently classical perspective, there is always an unavoidable energy cost associated with the information deletion and this common lore is at the heart of the Landauer's conjecture that does not impose, per se, any relevant limit on the information acquisition. Although such a mindset should generally apply to systems of any size, its quantum mechanical implications are particularly intriguing and, for this reason, we examine here a minimal physical structure where the system and the environment are described, respectively, by a pair of quantum oscillators coupled by an appropriate Hermitian interaction able to amplify the entropy of the initial state. Since at the onset of the dynamical evolution the system is originally in a pure state, its entropy variation is always positive semidefinite and the Landauer's conjecture should not impose any constraint. Nonetheless, provided the quantum amplification is effective, it turns out that the entropy variation of the system always undershoots the heat transferred to the environment. When the initial thermal state of the environment is characterized by a chemical potential, the entropy growth is bounded both by the particles and by the heat flowing to the environment. The limits deduced in the quantum thermodynamical framework are also scrutinized from a field theory standpoint where species of different spins are copiously produced (especially in a cosmological context) thanks to the rapid variation of the space-time curvature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13414v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) for Quantum Machine Learning typically rely on a fixed Hermitian observable, often built from Pauli operators. Inspired by the Heisenberg picture, we propose an adaptive non-local measurement framework that substantially increases the model complexity of the quantum circuits. Our introduction of dynamical Hermitian observables with evolving parameters shows that optimizing VQC rotations corresponds to tracing a trajectory in the observable space. This viewpoint reveals that standard VQCs are merely a special case of the Heisenberg representation.
  Furthermore, we show that properly incorporating variational rotations with non-local observables enhances qubit interaction and information mixture, admitting flexible circuit designs. Two non-local measurement schemes are introduced, and numerical simulations on classification tasks confirm that our approach outperforms conventional VQCs, yielding a more powerful and resource-efficient approach as a Quantum Neural Network.</description>

Abstract: Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD), enhances quantum cryptography by mitigating detector-side vulnerabilities. This study analyzes MDI-QKD performance in thermal-loss and phase noise channels, modeled as depolarizing and dephasing channels to capture thermal and phase noise effects. Based on this channel framework, we derive analytical expressions for Bell state measurement probabilities, quantum bit error rates (QBER), and secret key rates (SKR) of MDI-QKD. Our simulations reveal that SKR decreases exponentially with transmission distance, with performance further degraded by increasing thermal noise and phase noise, particularly under high thermal noise conditions. These findings offer insights into enhancing MDI-QKD's noise resilience, supporting secure key generation in practical, noisy environments.</description>

Abstract: Quantum energy teleportation (QET) exploits the existence of correlations to enable remote energy transfer without the need for physical energy carriers between emitter and receiver. This paper presents a review of the thermodynamic foundations of QET and reviews its first experimental demonstration (performed using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance), along with its implementation on publicly available superconducting quantum hardware. Additionally, we review an application of QET in the field of quantum thermodynamics as an efficient algorithmic cooling technique to cool down individual parts of interacting systems. Finally, we will review how QET can be employed to optimally generate exotic quantum states characterized by negative average stress-energy densities, offering a new operational approach to engineering such states which are promising in the context of semiclassical gravity.</description>

Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence have highlighted the remarkable capabilities of neural network (NN)-powered systems on classical computers. However, these systems face significant computational challenges that limit scalability and efficiency. Quantum computers hold the potential to overcome these limitations and increase processing power beyond classical systems. Despite this, integrating quantum computing with NNs remains largely unrealized due to challenges posed by noise, decoherence, and high error rates in current quantum hardware. Here, we propose a novel quantum echo-state network (QESN) design and implementation algorithm that can operate within the presence of noise on current IBM hardware. We apply classical control-theoretic response analysis to characterize the QESN, emphasizing its rich nonlinear dynamics and memory, as well as its ability to be fine-tuned with sparsity and re-uploading blocks. We validate our approach through a comprehensive demonstration of QESNs functioning as quantum observers, applied in both high-fidelity simulations and hardware experiments utilizing data from a prototypical chaotic Lorenz system. Our results show that the QESN can predict long time-series with persistent memory, running over 100 times longer than the median T1 and T2 of the IBM Marrakesh QPU, achieving state-of-the-art time-series performance on superconducting hardware.</description>

      <title>Performance of rotation-symmetric bosonic codes in the presence of random telegraph noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decoherence in quantum devices, such as qubits and resonators, is often caused by bistable fluctuators modeled as random telegraph noise (RTN), leading to significant dephasing. We analyze the impact of individual and multiple fluctuators on a bosonic mode in continuous variable systems, identifying non-Markovian behavior governed by two timescales: the fluctuator switching rate ($\xi$) and coupling strength ($\nu$). Using the Breuer-Piilo-Laine (BLP) measure, we show that for Gaussian states, squeezing and thermal fluctuations do not enhance non-Markovianity. In contrast, for non-Gaussian states, the measure becomes unbounded. For rotation-symmetric bosonic (RSB) codes, known for their error correction advantages, non-Markovianity grows linearly with code symmetry. We evaluate the performance of RSB codes under simultaneous loss and RTN dephasing. For a teleportation-based Knill error-correction circuit, the codes perform robustly in the Markovian limit. In the non-Markovian regime, the performance depends on the time the error correction is performed for a given codeword. The average gate fidelity of the error-corrected state in this case exhibits oscillations as a function of time due to the oscillatory nature of the dephasing function of the RTN noise; however, for most of the parameter ranges, the values stay above the break-even point. Extending to multiple fluctuators that produce $1/f$ noise, we observe that non-Markovianity decays with increasing fluctuator count, while the performance of RSB codes remains effective with increasing number of fluctuators.</description>

      <title>Impact of Clifford operations on non-stabilizing power and quantum chaos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-stabilizerness, alongside entanglement, is a crucial ingredient for fault-tolerant quantum computation and achieving a genuine quantum advantage. Despite recent progress, a complete understanding of the generation and thermalization of non-stabilizerness in circuits that mix Clifford and non-Clifford operations remains elusive. While Clifford operations do not generate non-stabilizerness, their interplay with non-Clifford gates can strongly impact the overall non-stabilizing dynamics of generic quantum circuits. In this work, we establish a direct relationship between the final non-stabilizing power and the individual powers of the non-Clifford gates, in circuits where these gates are interspersed with random Clifford operations. By leveraging this result, we unveil the thermalization of non-stabilizing power to its Haar-averaged value in generic circuits. As a precursor, we analyze two-qubit gates and illustrate this thermalization in analytically tractable systems. Extending this, we explore the operator-space non-stabilizing power and demonstrate its behavior in physical models. Finally, we examine the role of non-stabilizing power in the emergence of quantum chaos in brick-wall quantum circuits. Our work elucidates how non-stabilizing dynamics evolve and thermalize in quantum circuits and thus contributes to a better understanding of quantum computational resources and of their role in quantum chaos.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Certifying maximal quantum randomness without assumptions about system dimension remains a pivotal challenge for secure communication and foundational studies. Here, we introduce a generalized framework to directly certify maximal randomness from observed probability distributions across systems with arbitrary user numbers, without relying on the Bell-inequality violations. By analyzing probability distributions directly, we identify a class of quantum states and projective measurements that achieve maximal randomness in bipartite and tripartite scenarios, ensuring practical feasibility. Further analysis reveals a counterintuitive trade-off governing measurement incompatibility among users: sufficient incompatibility for one user permits arbitrarily small incompatibility for others, defying conventional symmetry assumptions in the Bell test. This asymmetry provides a pathway to optimize device-independent protocols by strategically distributing quantum resources. Our results establish a versatile and experimentally accessible route to scalable randomness certification, with implications for quantum cryptography and the physics of nonlocal correlations.</description>

      <title>Critical Spectrum and Quantum Criticality in the Two-Photon Rabi-Stark Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the spectral properties and quantum criticality of the two-photon Rabi-Stark model. Using the exact solution of this model, we rigorously derive a condition for complete spectral collapse, where all bound states vanish. In this case, the energy gap closes at a critical coupling, signaling a continuous quantum phase transition. The corresponding gap exponent differs from those in both the one-photon Rabi-Stark model and the quantum Rabi model, suggesting a distinct universality class. While in the general case, an infinite number of discrete bound states exist when spectral collapse occur and the energy gap remains open. By mapping to an inverse square potential well, these bound levels approach the threshold energy exponentially. Our results offer new insights into novel spectral phenomena in nonlinear quantum Rabi models, with potential implications for experimental realizations in circuit QED and trapped ion systems.</description>

      <title>Scalable Quantum Algorithm for Meson Scattering in a Lattice Gauge Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scattering processes are fundamental for understanding the structure of matter, yet simulating their real-time dynamics remains challenging for classical computers. Quantum computing and quantum-inspired methods offer a promising avenue for efficiently simulating such phenomena. In this work, we investigate meson scattering in a (1+1)-dimensional Z2 lattice gauge theory with staggered fermions. We develop a quantum subspace expansion technique to construct high-fidelity meson creation operators across a broad range of masses and momenta. Using Tensor Networks simulations, we study both elastic and inelastic scattering and provide a detailed analysis of energy transfer, entanglement entropy, and new particle production during the dynamics. In addition, we design an efficient quantum circuit for meson wave packet preparation using Givens rotations, significantly reducing the circuit depth compared to existing methods. Our work provides a non-variational and scalable framework for simulating meson scattering on near-term quantum devices, and provides a concrete strategy for quantum simulation to analyze non-perturbative dynamical processes in confining gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Statistical Signal Processing for Quantum Error Mitigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, quantum error mitigation (QEM) is essential for producing reliable outputs from quantum circuits. We present a statistical signal processing approach to QEM that estimates the most likely noiseless outputs from noisy quantum measurements. Our model assumes that circuit depth is sufficient for depolarizing noise, producing corrupted observations that resemble a uniform distribution alongside classical bit-flip errors from readout. Our method consists of two steps: a filtering stage that discards uninformative depolarizing noise and an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm that computes a maximum likelihood (ML) estimate over the remaining data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on small-qubit systems using IBM circuit simulations in Qiskit and compare its performance to contemporary statistical QEM techniques. We also show that our method scales to larger qubit counts using synthetically generated data consistent with our noise model. These results suggest that principled statistical methods can offer scalable and interpretable solutions for quantum error mitigation in realistic NISQ settings.</description>

      <title>Quantum Complexity and Chaos in Many-Qudit Doped Clifford Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02127v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of quantum complexity and chaos in doped Clifford circuits acting on qudits of odd prime dimension $d$. Using doped Clifford Weingarten calculus and a replica tensor network formalism, we derive exact results and perform large-scale simulations in regimes challenging for tensor network and Pauli-based methods. We begin by analyzing generalized stabilizer entropies, computable magic monotones in many-qudit systems, and identify a dynamical phase transition in the doping rate, marking the breakdown of classical simulability and the onset of Haar-random behavior. The critical behavior is governed by the qudit dimension and the magic content of the non-Clifford gate. Using the qudit $T$-gate as a benchmark, we show that higher-dimensional qudits converge faster to Haar-typical stabilizer entropies. For qutrits ($d=3$), analytical predictions match numerics on brickwork circuits, showing that locality plays a limited role in magic spreading. We also examine anticoncentration and entanglement growth, showing that $O(\log N)$ non-Clifford gates suffice for approximating Haar expectation values to precision $\varepsilon$, and relate antiflatness measures to stabilizer entropies in qutrit systems. Finally, we analyze out-of-time-order correlators and show that a finite density of non-Clifford gates is needed to induce chaos, with a sharp transition fixed by the local dimension, twice that of the magic transition. Altogether, these results establish a unified framework for diagnosing complexity in doped Clifford circuits and deepen our understanding of resource theories in multiqudit systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose two quantum experiments - modified Bell tests - that could detect contextual hidden variables underlying quantum mechanics. The experiments are inspired by hydrodynamic pilot-wave systems that mimic a wide range of quantum effects and exhibit a classical analog of contextuality. To justify the experiments, we show that contextual hidden variables are 'physics as usual' if a unification between quantum mechanics and general relativity is possible. Accordingly, contextual theories can bypass Bell's theorem in a way that is both local and non-conspiratorial. We end with a note on the relevance of exploratory experiments in the foundations of quantum physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum technologies promise profound advances in communication security, sensing and computing. The underpinning hardware must be engineered to generate, manipulate and detect quantum phenomena with exceptional performance, whilst being mass-manufacturable for real-world applications. A leading approach is chip-scale quantum photonics. The continuous-variable regime for quantum optics has been exploited in a number of technologies, including the detection of gravitational waves, by operating below the standard quantum limit of the light's shot noise. The availability of room-temperature, deterministic sources and high efficiency detectors suitable for continuous-variable state generation and measurement is a compelling motivation for this particular paradigm. This review focusses on efforts to integrate sources and detectors of continuous-variable light states into chip-scale photonic integrated circuits.</description>

Abstract: A gradient-based optimization approach combined with automatic differentiation is employed to ensure high accuracy and scalability when working with high-dimensional parameter spaces. Numerical simulations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method: the population is reliably transferred to the target state with minimal occupation of intermediate levels, while the control pulses remain smooth and physically implementable. The developed framework serves as a universal and experimentally applicable tool for automated control pulse design in quantum systems. It is particularly useful in scenarios where analytical methods or manual parameter tuning--such as standard schemes like STIRAP--prove to be inefficient or inapplicable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Noise is a major challenge for building practical quantum computing systems. Precise characterization of quantum noise is crucial for developing effective error mitigation and correction schemes. However, state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors on many current platforms can introduce large ambiguity into conventional noise characterization methods. In this work, we propose a scheme for enhancing quantum noise characterization using additional energy levels. We first develop a comprehensive theory on the identifiability of n-qudit SPAM noise given high-quality single-qudit control, showing the existence of gauge freedoms which can be completely described using subsystem depolarizing maps. We then show how to use these extra energy levels to reduce the gauge ambiguity in characterizing both SPAM and gate noise in the qubit subspace. We experimentally implement these ideas on a superconducting quantum computing device and demonstrate a qutrit-enabled enhancement in noise characterization precision.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09298v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an effective set of necessary and sufficient criteria for block-positivity of matrices of order $4$ over $\mathbb{C}$. The approach is based on Sturm sequences and quartic polynomial positivity conditions presented in recent literature. The procedure allows us to test whether a given $4\times 4$ complex matrix corresponds to an entanglement witness, and it is exact when the matrix coefficients belong to the rationals, extended by $\mathrm{i}$. The method can be generalized to $\mathcal{H}_2\otimes\mathcal{H}_d$ systems for $d&gt;2$ to provide necessary but not sufficient criterion for block-positivity. We also outline an alternative approach to the problem relying on Gr\"obner bases.</description>

      <title>Symmetric quantum states: a review of recent progress</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10185v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetric quantum states are fascinating objects. They correspond to multipartite systems that remain invariant under particle permutations. This symmetry is reflected in their compact mathematical characterisation but also in their unique physical properties: they exhibit genuine multipartite entanglement and notable robustness against noise and perturbations. These features make such states particularly well-suited for a wide range of quantum information tasks. Here, we provide a pedagogic analysis of the mathematical structure and relevant physical properties of this class of states. Beyond the theoretical framework, robust tools for certifying and verifying the properties of symmetric states in experimental settings are essential. In this regard, we explore how standard techniques -- such as quantum state tomography, Bell tests, and entanglement witnesses -- can be specifically adapted for symmetric systems. Next, we provide an up-to-date overview of the most relevant applications in which these states outperform other classes of states in specific tasks. Specifically, we address their central role in quantum metrology, highlight their use in quantum error correction codes, and examine their contribution in computation and communication tasks. Finally, we present the current state-of-the-art in their experimental generation, ranging from systems of cold atoms to implementations via quantum algorithms. We also review the most significant results obtained in the different experimental realizations. Despite the notable progress made in recent years with regard to the characterisation and application of symmetric quantum states, several intriguing questions remain unsolved. We conclude this review by discussing some of these open problems and outlining promising directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Isoholonomic inequalities and speed limits for cyclic quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum speed limits set fundamental lower bounds on the time required for a quantum system to evolve between states. Traditional bounds, such as those by Mandelstam-Tamm and Margolus-Levitin, rely on state distinguishability and become trivial for cyclic evolutions where the initial and final states coincide. In this work, we explore an alternative approach based on isoholonomic inequalities, which bound the length of closed state space trajectories in terms of their holonomy. Building on a gauge-theoretic framework for mixed state geometric phases, we extend the concept of isoholonomic inequalities to closed curves of isospectral and isodegenerate density operators. This allows us to derive new quantum speed limits that remain nontrivial for cyclic evolutions. Our results reveal deep connections between the temporal behavior of cyclic quantum systems and holonomy.</description>

      <title>Observing High-dimensional Bell Inequality Violations using Multi-Outcome Spectral Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20796v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Violation of Bell inequalities is an essential requirement for many quantum information and communication protocols. In high-dimensional systems, Bell inequality tests face the challenge of implementing genuinely multi-outcome measurements, since the emulation of these with separate dichotomic projections opens a binarisation loophole that local hidden variable theories can exploit. Here we show that the joint spectral intensity of a two-photon entangled state contains access to the necessary multi-outcome measurements to overcome this obstacle and certify and violate a Bell inequality for high-dimensional states. This result is contrary to the belief that the joint spectral intensity is a phase-insensitive quantity and does not have sufficient information to certify entanglement or Bell-nonlocality. Using this approach, we violate the CGLMP Bell inequality up to dimension d = 8, all with negligible p-values, and for the first time close the binarisation loophole in high-dimensional Bell experiments. Guaranteeing Bell-nonlocal correlations using frequency-only measurements removes the technological hurdle of measurements in the temporal domain, thus greatly simplifying any practical implementation of future high-dimensional quantum information protocols.</description>

      <title>HaQGNN: Hardware-Aware Quantum Kernel Design Based on Graph Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing effective quantum kernels is a central challenge in Quantum Machine Learning (QML), particularly under the limitations of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices with a limited number of qubits, error-prone gate operations, and restricted qubit connectivity. To address this, we propose HaQGNN, a hardware-aware quantum kernel design method that integrates quantum device topology, noise characteristics, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to evaluate and select task-relevant quantum circuits that define quantum kernels. First, each quantum circuit is represented as a directed acyclic graph that encodes hardware-specific features, including gate types, target qubits, and noise characteristics. Next, two GNNs are trained to predict surrogate metrics, Probability of Successful Trials (PST) and Kernel-Target Alignment (KTA), for fast and accurate fidelity and performance estimation. Additionally, feature selection is further incorporated to reduce input dimensionality and improve compatibility with limited-qubit devices. Finally, extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, Credit Card (CC), MNIST-5, and FMNIST-4, demonstrate that HaQGNN outperforms existing baselines in terms of classification accuracy. Our results highlight the potential of learning-based and hardware-aware strategies for advancing practical quantum kernel design on near-term quantum hardware.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by experiments on Rydberg atom arrays, we explore the properties of uniform quantum superpositions of kagome dimer configurations and construct an efficient algorithm for experimentally producing them. We begin by considering the thin cylinder limit, where these states have simple descriptions. We then develop a matrix product representation of the states on arbitrary cylinders, which leads to a natural protocol to efficiently grow them. We explain how our approach can be adapted to other quantum computing hardware.</description>

Abstract: After publishing my book "Quantum Computing Architecture and Hardware for Engineers: Step by Step" [1] (now I call it Volume I), in which spin qubit and superconducting qubit quantum computers were covered, I decided to continue to write the second volume to cover the trapped ion qubit quantum computer, which was also taught in my EE274 class. I follow the same structure as in Volume I by discussing the physics, mathematics, and their connection to laser pulses and electronics based on how they fulfill the five DiVincenzo's criteria. I also think it would be a good idea to share the second volume on arXiv so that more people can read it for free, and I can continue to update the contents. As of July 2025, I have finished the trapped ion quantum computer part. In the future, I plan to write more critical topics in a step-by-step manner to bridge engineers who did not receive rigorous training in Physics to the quantum computing world.</description>

Abstract: We describe a 88Sr+ ion trap apparatus with the capability to produce high-quality 408 nm photons aimed at distributed quantum computing and networking applications. This instrument confines ion chains using a surface electrode trap with a two-dimensional magneto-optical trap as an atomic source. Several laser systems spanning 400-1100 nm are used to achieve high fidelity state preparation and readout. Photons are produced via the decay of an exited state, which is accessed using a custom 408 nm laser system that produces 150 ps optical pulses using non-linear photonics. We demonstrate single photon production through a Hanbury Brown-Twiss measurement for one to six ions.</description>

      <title>Classification of four-qubit pure codes and five-qubit absolutely maximally entangled states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that every 5-qubit absolutely maximally entangled (AME) state is equivalent by a local unitary transformation to a point in the unique ((5,2,3)) quantum error correcting code C. Furthermore, two points in C are equivalent if and only if they are related by a group of order 24 acting on C. There exists a set of 3 invariant polynomials that separates equivalence classes of 5-qubit AME states. We also show that every 4-qubit pure code is equivalent to a subspace of the unique ((4,4,2)) and construct an infinite family of 3-uniform n-qubit states for even $n\geq 6$. The proofs rely heavily on results from Vinberg and classical invariant theory.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning-Enhanced Entanglement Detection Under Noisy Quantum Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum measurements are inherently noisy, hindering reliable entanglement detection and limiting the scalability of quantum technologies. While error mitigation and correction strategies exist, they often impose prohibitive resource overheads. Here, we introduce a machine-learning-based approach to achieve noise-resilient entanglement classification even with imperfect measurements. Using support vector machines (SVMs) trained on features extracted from Pauli measurements, we develop a robust optimal entanglement witness (ROEW) that remains effective under unknown measurement noise. By optimizing SVM parameters against worst-case errors, our protocol significantly outperforms conventional methods in classification accuracy.
  Numerical experiments demonstrate that ROEW achieves high-fidelity entanglement detection with minimal measurements, even when measurement errors exceed 10\%. This work bridges machine learning and quantum information science, offering a practical tool for noise-robust quantum characterization and advancing the feasibility of entanglement-based technologies in real-world settings.</description>

      <title>Tight Bound for Quantum Unitary Time-Reversal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-reversal of unitary evolution is fundamental in quantum information processing. Many scenarios, particularly those in quantum learning and metrology, assume free access to the time-reverse of an unknown unitary. In this paper, we settle the query complexity of the unitary time-reversal task: approximately implementing $U^{-1}$ given only black-box access to an unknown $d$-dimensional unitary $U$. We provide a tight query lower bound $\Omega((1-\epsilon)d^2)$ for the unitary time-reversal to within diamond norm error $\epsilon$. Notably, our lower bound applies to general coherent protocols with unbounded ancillas, and holds even when $\epsilon$ is an average-case distance error. Moreover, our result implies a query lower bound $\Omega(d^2)$ for approximately implementing control-$U$ up to an irrelevant phase, which is also tight with respect to the dimension.</description>

      <title>Mixed states for reference frames transformations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the concept of transformations among reference frames (classical or quantum). Usually transformations among classical reference frames have sharply defined parameters; geometrically they can be considered as pure states in the parameters' space, and they form a group. It is however possible that the distributions in the parameters' space are mixed state; such states form a semigroup. Similarly, transformations among quantum reference frames can be either pure or mixed. This gives rise to interesting consequences, in particular, the state of a system S can be pure with respect to a reference frame and mixed with respect to another. We argue that these nonpure transformations are natural, and give an application to the connections of time and (inverse) temperature for thermal states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding topological features in networks is crucial for unravelling complex phenomena across fields such as neuroscience, condensed matter, and high-energy physics. However, identifying higher-order topological structures -- such as $k$-cliques, fundamental building blocks of complex networks -- remains a significant challenge. Here we develop a universal programmable photonic quantum processor that enables the encoding of arbitrary complex-weight networks, providing a direct pathway to uncovering their topological structures. We demonstrate how this quantum approach can identify weighted $k$-cliques and estimate Betti numbers by leveraging the Gaussian boson sampling algorithm's ability to preferentially select high-weight, dense subgraphs. The unique capabilities of our programmable quantum processor allow us to observe topological phase transitions and identify clique percolation phenomena directly from the entropy of the sampling results. These findings showcase how photonic quantum computing can be applied to analyse the topological characteristics of real-world complex networks, opening new possibilities for quantum-enhanced data analysis.</description>

      <title>Continuous-time parametrization of neural quantum states for quantum dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural quantum states are a promising framework for simulating many-body quantum dynamics, as they can represent states with volume-law entanglement. As time evolves, the neural network parameters are typically optimized at discrete time steps to approximate the wave function at each point in time. Given the differentiability of the wave function stemming from the Schr\"odinger equation, here we impose a time-continuous and differentiable parameterization of the neural network by expressing its parameters as linear combinations of temporal basis functions with trainable, time-independent coefficients. We test this ansatz, referred to as the smooth neural quantum state ($s$-NQS) with a loss function defined over an extended time interval, under a sudden quench of a non-integrable many-body quantum spin chain. We demonstrate accurate time evolution using simply a restricted Boltzmann machine as the instantaneous neural network architecture. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the parameterization is efficient in the number of parameters and the smooth neural quantum state allows us to initialize and evaluate the wave function at times not included in the training set, both within and beyond the training interval.</description>

      <title>A unified realization of electrical quantities from the quantum International System of Units</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the revised International System of Units (SI), the ohm and the volt are realized from the von Klitzing constant and the Josephson constant, and a practical realization of the ampere is possible by applying Ohm's law directly to the quantum Hall and Josephson effects. As a result, it is possible to create an instrument capable of realizing all three primary electrical units, but the development of such a system remains challenging. Here we report a unified realization of the volt, ohm, and ampere by integrating a quantum anomalous Hall resistor (QAHR) and a programmable Josephson voltage standard (PJVS) in a single cryostat. Our system has a quantum voltage output that ranges from 0.24 mV to 6.5 mV with combined relative uncertainties down to 3 $\mu$V/V. The QAHR provides a realization of the ohm at zero magnetic field with uncertainties near 1 $\mu\Omega$/$\Omega$. We use the QAHR to convert a longitudinal current to a quantized Hall voltage and then directly compare that against the PJVS to realize the ampere. We determine currents in the range of 9.33 nA to 252 nA, and our lowest uncertainty is 4.3 $\mu$A/A at 83.9 nA. For other current values, a systematic error that ranges from -10 $\mu$A/A to -30 $\mu$A/A is present due to the imperfect isolation of the PJVS microwave bias.</description>

      <title>A hierarchy of eigencomputations for polynomial optimization on the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17827v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a convergent hierarchy of lower bounds on the minimum value of a real form over the unit sphere. The main practical advantage of our hierarchy over the real sum-of-squares (RSOS) hierarchy is that the lower bound at each level of our hierarchy is obtained by a minimum eigenvalue computation, as opposed to the full semidefinite program (SDP) required at each level of RSOS. In practice, this allows us to compute bounds on much larger forms than are computationally feasible for RSOS. Our hierarchy outperforms previous alternatives to RSOS, both asymptotically and in numerical experiments. We obtain our hierarchy by proving a reduction from real optimization on the sphere to Hermitian optimization on the sphere, and invoking the Hermitian sum-of-squares (HSOS) hierarchy. This opens the door to using other Hermitian optimization techniques for real optimization, and gives a path towards developing spectral hierarchies for more general constrained real optimization problems. To this end, we use our techniques to develop a hierarchy of eigencomputations for computing the real tensor spectral norm.</description>

Abstract: We discuss anyon condensation in mixed-state topological order. The phases were recently conjectured to be classified by pre-modular fusion categories. Just like anyon condensation in pure-state topological order, a bootstrap analysis shows condensable anyons are given by connected \'etale algebras. We explain how to perform generic anyon condensation including non-invertible anyons and successive condensations. Interestingly, some condensations lead to pure-state topological orders. We clarify when this happens. We also compute topological invariants of equivalence classes.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic Thermalization for Highly Degenerate Hamiltonians After Slight Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15832v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We say of an isolated macroscopic quantum system in a pure state $\psi$ that it is in macroscopic thermal equilibrium (MATE) if $\psi$ lies in or close to a suitable subspace $\mathcal{H}_{eq}$ of Hilbert space. It is known that every initial state $\psi_0$ will eventually reach and stay there most of the time (``thermalize'') if the Hamiltonian is non-degenerate and satisfies the appropriate version of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), i.e., that every eigenvector is in MATE. Tasaki recently proved the ETH for a certain perturbation $H_\theta^{fF}$ of the Hamiltonian $H_0^{fF}$ of $N\gg 1$ free fermions on a one-dimensional lattice. The perturbation is needed to remove the high degeneracies of $H_0^{fF}$. Here, we first point out that also for degenerate Hamiltonians all $\psi_0$ thermalize if the ETH holds, i.e., if every eigenbasis lies in MATE, and we prove that this is the case for $H_0^{fF}$. Inspired by the fact that there is one eigenbasis of $H_0^{fF}$ for which MATE can be proved more easily than for the others, with smaller error bounds, and also in higher spatial dimensions, we show for any given $H_0$ that the existence of one eigenbasis in MATE implies quite generally that most eigenbases of $H_0$ lie in MATE. We also show that, as a consequence, after adding a small generic perturbation, $H=H_0+\lambda V$ with $\lambda\ll 1$, for most perturbations $V$ the perturbed Hamiltonian $H$ satisfies ETH and all states thermalize.</description>

      <title>Quick design of feasible tensor networks for constrained combinatorial optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01699v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers are expected to enable fast solving of large-scale combinatorial optimization problems. However, their limitations in fidelity and the number of qubits prevent them from handling real-world problems. Recently, a quantum-inspired solver using tensor networks has been proposed, which works on classical computers. Particularly, tensor networks have been applied to constrained combinatorial optimization problems for practical applications. By preparing a specific tensor network to sample states that satisfy constraints, feasible solutions can be searched for without the method of penalty functions. Previous studies have been based on profound physics, such as U(1) gauge schemes and high-dimensional lattice models. In this study, we devise to design feasible tensor networks using elementary mathematics without such a specific knowledge. One approach is to construct tensor networks with nilpotent-matrix manipulation. The second is to algebraically determine tensor parameters. We showed mathematically that such feasible tensor networks can be constructed to accommodate various types of constraints. For the principle verification, we numerically constructed a feasible tensor network for facility location problem, to find much faster construction than conventional methods. Then, by performing imaginary time evolution, feasible solutions were always obtained, ultimately leading to the optimal solution.</description>

Abstract: The study of undecidability in problems arising from physics has experienced a renewed interest, mainly in connection with quantum information problems. The goal of this review is to survey this recent development. After a historical introduction, we first explain the necessary results about undecidability in mathematics and computer science. Then we briefly review the first results about undecidability in physics which emerged mostly in the 80s and early 90s. Finally we focus on the most recent contributions, which we divide in two main categories: many body systems and quantum information problems.</description>

      <title>Post-Newtonian Effective Field Theory Approach to Entanglement Harvesting, Quantum Discord and Bell's Nonlocality Bound Near a Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09409v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Black holes, as characterized by the Hawking effect and Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, can be treated as a compact object carrying nontrivial quantum information obscured behind the event horizon. Thus, the black hole may convey and retract its quantum information to the nearby quantum probes via the surrounding mediator fields. In this paper, we investigate the effects of a quantum black hole on the reduced states of a pair of static qubit-type Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors acting as a probe, using three complementary quantum information measures: concurrence characterizing entanglement harvesting, quantum discord, and Bell's nonlocality bound. This sheds light on the nature of the quantum state of the black holes. By treating the black hole as a tidally deformable thermal body under the quantum fluctuation of the mediator fields as observed in \cite{Goldberger:2019sya, goldberger2020virtual, biggs2024comparing}, we employ a post-Newtonian effective field theory (PN-EFT) to derive the reduced states of the UDW probes analytically. Based on this, we can easily obtain all three quantum information measures without encountering the complicated Matsubara sum of infinite thermal poles, as in the conventional approach based on quantum fields in curved spacetime. By tuning the relative strengths in the action of PN-EFT, we can extract the effects of the black hole on the entanglement, quantum correlation, and nonlocality bound of the UDW probe systems. Our PN-EFT approach can be extended to include the backreaction on the black holes in future studies by taking the higher-order PN corrections into account.</description>

Abstract: We considered the vacuum polarization of a quantized charged scalar matter field in the background of a topological defect modeled by a finite-thickness tube with magnetic flux inside. The tube is impenetrable for quantum matter, and a generalized boundary condition of the Robin type is imposed at its surface. We have shown that in the flat space-time, the total induced vacuum energy does not depend on the coupling $(\xi)$ of the scalar field's interaction with the space-time curvature, only for the partial cases of the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions on the tube's edge. However, for generalized Robin boundary conditions, the total induced energy depends on the coupling $\xi$ in flat space-time, at least for negative values of the boundary condition parameter $-\pi/2&lt;\theta&lt;0$.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by near term quantum computing hardware limitations, combinatorial optimization problems that can be addressed by current quantum algorithms and noisy hardware with little or no overhead are used to probe capabilities of quantum algorithms such as the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). In this study, a specific class of near term quantum computing hardware defined combinatorial optimization problems, Ising models on heavy-hex graphs both with and without geometrically local cubic terms, are examined for their classical computational hardness via empirical computation time scaling quantification. Specifically the Time-to-Solution metric using the classical heuristic simulated annealing is measured for finding optimal variable assignments (ground states), as well as the time required for the optimization software Gurobi to find an optimal variable assignment. Because of the sparsity of these Ising models, the classical algorithms are able to find optimal solutions efficiently even for large instances (i.e. $100,000$ variables). The Ising models both with and without geometrically local cubic terms exhibit average-case linear-time or weakly quadratic scaling when solved exactly using Gurobi, and the Ising models with no cubic terms show evidence of exponential-time Time-to-Solution scaling when sampled using simulated annealing. These findings point to the necessity of developing and testing more complex, namely more densely connected, optimization problems in order for quantum computing to ever have a practical advantage over classical computing. Our results are another illustration that different classical algorithms can indeed have exponentially different running times, thus making the identification of the best practical classical technique important in any quantum computing vs. classical computing comparison.</description>

      <title>Critical Dynamics of Spin Boson Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the low-energy properties of the spin-boson model (SBM), which describes the dynamics of a 1/2 spin associated with a thermostat characterized by a power law spectral density, $f(\omega)\propto \omega^s$. The theoretical description is constructed in the Schwinger--Keldysh technique, based on the representation of the 1/2-spin by Majorana spinors. We study the critical dynamics of the system near the quantum phase transition by constructing and analyzing the system of renormalization group equations. Our theoretical approach is more universal, contrary to the one based on quantum-classical mapping, since it is applicable for $s\leq 1$. We show that in both the ohmic case $s=1$, and the weakly subohmic case $s\lesssim 1$, the second order quantum phase transition is observed in the model considered, and the critical magnetization exponent agrees with the exact hyperscaling result, $1/\delta=(1-s)/(1+s)$. Furthermore, we obtain the dependence of the critical value of the spin-boson coupling constant on the temperature of the ohmic bosonic thermal bath.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional spectroscopy of bosonic collective excitations in disordered many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel theoretical approach for computing and analyzing two-dimensional spectroscopy of bosonic collective excitations in disordered many-body systems. Specifically, we employ the Keldysh formalism to derive, within a non-pertubative treatment of disorder effects, the third-order nonlinear response and obtain two-dimensional spectroscopy maps. In the weak nonlinear regime of our formalism, we demonstrate the ability of the echo peak to distinguish between elastic and inelastic scattering processes, in perfect agreement with the intuition developed in isolated two-level systems. Furthermore, we discuss unique many-body effects on the echo peak signature arising from interaction induced quantum fluctuations. In particular, we show that these quantum fluctuations induce a finite nonrephasable broadening and examine how the echo peak is influenced by the attractive or repulsive nature of the collective excitations.</description>

      <title>Counterflow of lattice polarons in harmonically confined optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a mobile impurity in a one-dimensional harmonically confined optical lattice interacting repulsively with a bosonic bath. The behavior of the impurity across baths with superfluid and Mott-insulator domains is examined, including its full back-action effect on the bath. We characterize the bath-impurity phase diagram and reveal the appearance of a correlated counterflow phase, which we support with an analytical model for a mobile impurity-hole pair. This phase shows an extended combined insulator domain of unity filling but no independent domain of constant density. The transition to this phase features a sudden orthogonality and the change of the shape of the impurity's profile to that of a free particle in an infinite square well. The findings of this work suggest the appearance of unconventional counterflow in trapped imbalanced atomic mixtures.</description>

      <title>Interaction-Induced Higher-Order Topological Insulator via Floquet Engineering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Higher-order topological insulators have attracted significant interest in both static single-particle and many-body lattice systems. While periodically driven (Floquet) higher-order topological phases have been explored at the single-particle level, the role of interactions in such systems remains less understood. In this paper, we extend previous studies by investigating interaction-induced higher-order topological phases through Floquet engineering. To achieve this, we construct an extended Bose-Hubbard model on a square lattice subjected to periodic driving. We demonstrate the emergence of interaction-induced normal Floquet second-order topological corner states for doublons (i.e., bound boson pairs) from a trivial phase, which exhibit robustness against disorder. Notably, beyond the normal phase, we reveal an interaction-induced anomalous Floquet second-order topological phase, where in-gap corner states of doublons emerge within the $\pi/T$ gap ($T$ being the driving period). Our model, accessible with state-of-the-art ultracold atom techniques, provides a platform for realizing interaction-driven higher-order topological phases uniquely enabled by periodic driving, with no direct counterparts in static or single-particle systems.</description>

      <title>Particles in finite volumes and a toy model of decaying neutrons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that the momentum spectra of particles confined to finite spatial volumes deviate from the continuous spectra used for unconfined particles. In this article, we consider real scalar particles confined to finite volumes with periodic boundary conditions, such that the particles' spectra are discrete. We directly compute the density matrices describing the decay processes $\phi \to \varphi^2$ and $\phi \to \varphi\chi\nu$, and subsequently derive expressions for the decay probabilities both for confined and unconfined particles. The latter decay process is used as a rough toy model for a neutron decaying into a proton, an electron, and an anti-electron neutrino. We propose that finite volume effects can have an impact on the outcomes of experiments measuring the neutron lifetime. In addition, our findings at the toy model level suggest that taking into account possible initial correlations between neutrons and their daughter particles might be relevant as well.</description>

      <title>Multiparty entanglement loops in quantum spin liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) give rise to exotic emergent particles by weaving intricate entanglement patterns in the underlying electrons. Bipartite measures between subregions can detect the presence of anyons, but little is known about the full entanglement structure of QSLs. Here, we study the multiparty entanglement of QSLs via entanglement microscopy. We find that in contrast to conventional matter, the genuine multiparty entanglement (GME) between spins is absent in the smallest subregions, a phenomenon we call "entanglement frustration". Instead, GME is more collective, and arises solely in loops. By exploiting exact results and large-scale numerics, we confirm these properties in various gapped and gapless QSLs realised in physically motivated Hamiltonians, as well as with string-net wavefunctions hosting abelian or non-abelian anyons. Our results shed new light on the phase diagram of Kitaev's honeycomb model in a Zeeman field, and the Kagome Heisenberg model under various perturbations. Going beyond QSLs, we provide evidence that entanglement loops are a universal property of quantum gauge theories. This leads to a new understanding of fractionalization, and the means by which gauge bosons encode quantum information.</description>

      <title>Inverse Microparticle Design for Enhanced Optical Trapping and Detection Efficiency in All Six Degrees of Freedom</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01837v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving quantum-limited motional control of optically trapped particles beyond the sub-micrometer scale is an outstanding problem in levitated optomechanics. A key obstacle is solving the light scattering problem and identifying particle geometries that allow stable trapping and efficient motional detection of their center of mass and rotational motion in three dimensions. Here, we present a computational framework that combines an efficient electromagnetic scattering solver with the adjoint method to inversely design printable microparticles tailored for levitated optomechanics. Our method allows identifying optimized geometries, characterized by enhanced optical trapping and detection efficiencies compared to conventional microspheres. This improves the feasibility of quantum-limited motional control of all translational and rotational degrees of freedom in a standard standing-wave optical trap.</description>

      <title>Scaling and Universality at Noisy Quench Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14355v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) have been studied in the extended XY model under both noiseless and noisy linear driven staggered field cases. In the time-independent staggered field case, the model exhibits a single critical point where the transition occurs from the spin-liquid phase to the antiferromagnetic phase. In the noiseless ramp case, unlike the transverse field XY model where DQPT always occurs for a quench crossing the single critical point, there is a critical sweep velocity above which the kinks corresponding to a DQPT are completely removed. Furthermore, in this case there are only two critical modes whose excitation probability is one-half. In the presence of a Gaussian white noise, we find that this critical sweep velocity decreases by increasing the noise strength, and scales linearly with the square of the noise intensity. A surprising result occurs when the noise intensity and sweep velocity are about the same order of magnitude, the number of critical modes is significantly increased, signalling a region with multiple critical modes. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the scaling of the dynamical free energy near the DQPTs time is the same for both noiseless and noisy ramp quenches.</description>

      <title>Temperature-Dependent Emission Spectroscopy of Quantum Emitters in Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Color centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have attracted significant interest due to their potential applications in future optical quantum technologies. For most applications, scalable on-demand fabrication is a key requirement. Recent advances using localized electron irradiation have demonstrated near-identical emitters in the blue and yellow spectral regions. While the blue emitters have been demonstrated in cryogenic temperatures, the yellow emitters remain uncharacterized under such conditions. In this work, we therefore extended the study of yellow emitters to cryogenic temperatures. Initially, multiple spectral features were observed, prompting a systematic investigation that led to the identification of a defect emission centered around 547.5 nm with high brightness and excellent photostability. By tuning the excitation wavelength, we are able to distinguish Raman scattering peaks from the emitter emission. Further analysis of the vibronic emissions allowed us to identify an optical phonon mode, whose contribution becomes increasingly dominant at elevated temperatures. Photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy (PLE) reveals excitation through this phonon mode enhances the emission by almost 5-fold in cryogenic temperature. Temperature-dependent studies further elucidate the role of phonons in the emission process. These observations deepen our understanding of the nature of the emitters, opening new avenues for precise tuning of quantum light sources.</description>

      <title>Neural networks leverage nominally quantum and post-quantum representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that deep neural networks, including transformers and RNNs, pretrained as usual on next-token prediction, intrinsically discover and represent beliefs over 'quantum' and 'post-quantum' low-dimensional generative models of their training data -- as if performing iterative Bayesian updates over the latent state of this world model during inference as they observe more context. Notably, neural nets easily find these representation whereas there is no finite classical circuit that would do the job. The corresponding geometric relationships among neural activations induced by different input sequences are found to be largely independent of neural-network architecture. Each point in this geometry corresponds to a history-induced probability density over all possible futures, and the relative displacement of these points reflects the difference in mechanism and magnitude for how these distinct pasts affect the future.</description>
