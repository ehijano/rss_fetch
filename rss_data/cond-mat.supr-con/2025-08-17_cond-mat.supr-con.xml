      <title>Superconductivity in atom-intercalated quaternary hydrides under ambient pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen-rich materials are the most promising candidates for high-temperature conventional superconductors under ambient pressure. Multinary hydrides have abundant structural configurations and are more promising to find high-temperature superconductors at ambient pressure, but searching for multinary materials in complex phase space is a great challenge. In this work, we used our developed AI search engine (InvDesFlow) to perform extensive investigations regarding ambient stable superconducting hydrides. Several quaternary hydrides with high superconducting temperature~($T_c$) are predicted. In particular, the superconducting $T_c$ of K$_2$GaCuH$_6$ and K$_2$LiCuH$_6$ are calculated to be 68~K and 53~K under ambient pressure, respectively, which shows a significant enhancement in comparison with that of K$_2$CuH$_6$~($T_c$ $\sim$ 16~K). We also find that intercalating atoms could cause phonon softening and induce more phonon modes with strong electron-phonon coupling. Hence, we propose that intercalating atoms is a feasible approach in searching for superconducting quaternary hydrides.</description>

      <title>Study on fluctuations of interface-enhanced superconductivity in ultrathin FeSe/SrTiO3 by the Nernst effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrathin FeSe films on SrTiO3 substrate show interface-enhanced superconductivity. However, how the superconductivity is established including superconducting fluctuations remains unclear. This study investigates the Nernst effect, which is sensitive to superconducting fluctuations, in ultrathin FeSe films on SrTiO3. Temperature dependence of Nernst signals in the normal state is similar to bulk FeSe, suggesting that the electrons of SrTiO3 are transferred only to a few layers near the FeSe/SrTiO3 interface. The Nernst effect caused by SC fluctuations was observed only below T ~ 1.2 Tconset within our measurement resolution, which is similar to other Fe chalcogenide systems. Our results suggest that the pseudogap in monolayer FeSe/STO possibly originates in other electronic states rather than superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing and Tuning Superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ Films: Oxygen Recycling Protocol Reveals Hole-Doping Analogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent achievement of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ with transition temperatures exceeding 40 K in thin films under compressive strain and 80 K in bulk crystals under high pressure opens new avenues for research on high-temperature superconductivity. The realization of superconductivity in thin films requires delicate control of growth conditions, which presents significant challenges in the synthesis process. Furthermore, the stability of superconducting La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ films is compromised by oxygen loss, which complicates their characterization. We introduce an effective recycling protocol that involves oxygen removal in a precursor phase followed by ozone-assisted annealing, which restores superconducting properties. By tuning the oxygen content, we construct an electronic phase diagram that highlights oxygen addition as a potential analogue to hole doping via La substitution with Sr, providing insights into the doping mechanism and guiding future material optimization.</description>

      <title>Low barrier ZrO$_x$-based Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Josephson junction is a crucial element in superconducting devices, and niobium is a promising candidate for the superconducting material due to its large energy gap relative to aluminum. AlO$_x$ has long been regarded as the highest quality oxide tunnel barrier and is often used in niobium-based junctions. Here we propose ZrO$_x$ as an alternative tunnel barrier material for Nb electrodes. We theoretically estimate that zirconium oxide has excellent oxygen retention properties and experimentally verify that there is no significant oxygen diffusion leading to NbO$_x$ formation in the adjacent Nb electrode. We develop a top-down, subtractive fabrication process for Nb/Zr-ZrO$_x$/Nb Josephson junctions, which enables scalability and large-scale production of superconducting electronics. Using cross sectional scanning transmission electron microscopy, we experimentally find that depending on the Zr thickness, ZrO$_x$ tunnel barriers can be fully crystalline with chemically abrupt interfaces with niobium. Further analysis using electron energy loss spectroscopy reveals that ZrO$_x$ corresponds to tetragonal ZrO$_2$. Room temperature characterization of fabricated junctions using Simmons' model shows that ZrO$_2$ exhibits a low tunnel barrier height, which is promising in merged-element transmon applications. Low temperature transport measurements reveal sub-gap structure, while the low-voltage sub-gap resistance remains in the megaohm range.</description>

      <title>The superconducting diode effect in Josephson junctions fabricated from structurally chiral Mo$_3$Al$_2$C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect occurs in superconducting materials in which both spin and inversion symmetry are broken. The recently observed chirality-induced spin selectivity effect demonstrates that chiral materials break both symmetries. Thus a Josephson junction interface with the left-handed structure on one side of the junction and the right-handed structure on the other should exhibit a diode effect. Here, we report the electrical transport properties of right-handed/left-handed and right-handed/right-handed devices fabricated from single crystals of the structurally chiral superconductor Mo$_3$Al$_2$C. A magnetic-field-induced superconducting diode effect is demonstrated in both devices by a statistically significant difference in $I_{c+}$ and $|I_{c-}|$, and we show evidence for a zero-field diode effect in the right-handed/left-handed device but not the right-handed/right-handed device. A maximum asymmetry of 5\% is observed in both devices. We provide a few explanations for the presence of the superconducting diode effect in these devices.</description>

      <title>Fermi-liquid-like phase driven by next-nearest-neighbor couplings in a lightly doped kagome-lattice $t$-$J$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the interplay between charge fluctuation and geometry frustration, the doped kagome-lattice Mott insulator is a fascinating platform to realize exotic quantum states. Through the state-of-the-art density matrix renormalization group calculation, we explore the quantum phases of the lightly doped kagome-lattice $t$-$J$ model in the presence of the next-nearest-neighbor electron hopping $t_2$ and spin interaction $J_2$. On the $L_y = 3$ cylinder ($L_y$ is the number of unit cells along the circumference direction), we establish a quantum phase diagram with tuning $t_2 &gt; 0$ and $J_2 &gt; 0$, showing an emergent Fermi-liquid-like phase driven by increased $t_2$ and $J_2$, which sits at the neighbor of the previously identified charge density wave (CDW) phase. Compared with the CDW phase, the charge order is significantly suppressed in the Fermi-liquid-like phase, and most correlation functions are greatly enhanced with power-law decay. In particular, we find the absence of hole pairing and a strong three-sublattice magnetic correlation. On the wider $L_y = 4$ cylinder, this Fermi-liquid-like phase persists at low doping levels, strongly suggesting that this state might be stable in the two-dimensional kagome system.</description>

      <title>Linear Magnetoresistance and Anomalous Hall Effect in the Superconductor NiBi$_{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The NiBi$_{3}$ compound exhibits a compelling interplay between superconductivity and magnetism, further enriched by topological characteristics that make it an exceptional platform for exploring emergent electronic phenomena. Here, we report experimental evidence of unconventional magnetic phenomena in high-quality single crystals of NiBi$_3$, revealed through detailed magnetotransport measurements. The magnetoresistance displays a non-usual temperature dependence, featuring both a classical Lorentz-like component and a linear-in-field contribution. In addition, anomalous Hall effect signal persist down to the superconducting transition temperature and vanish above 75 K. These observations suggest that magnetic fluctuations play a significant role in charge transport in NiBi$_{3}$, highlighting a magnetically and topologically intertwined electronic structure. Our findings underscore the complex and multifaceted nature of this material.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometric origin of the Meissner effect and superfluid weight marker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The momentum space of conventional superconductors is recently recognized to possess a quantum metric defined from the overlap of filled quasihole states at neighboring momenta. For multiband superconductors with arbitrary intraband and interband s-wave pairing, we elaborate that their superfluid weight in London equations is given by the momentum integration of the elements of quantum metric times the quasiparticle energy, indicating the quantum geometric origins of Meissner effect and vortex state. The momentum integration of the quantum metric further yields a spread of quasihole Wannier functions that characterizes the stability of the superconducting state. Our formalism allows the diamagnetic response of conventional superconductors to be mapped to individual lattice sites as a superfluid weight marker, which can incorporate the effect of disorder through self-consistently solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations. Using single-band s-wave superconductors in 2D and 3D as examples, our marker reveals a diamagnetic current that becomes turbulent in the presence of nonmagnetic impurities, and the increase of London penetration depth by disorder that is consistent with experiments.</description>

      <title>Engineering subgap states in superconductors by altermagnetism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the realization and control of subgap states by tailored altermagnetic fields on unconventional superconductors. When the symmetries of altermagnetism and unconventional superconductivity align, we demonstrate the emergence of bulk zero-energy flat bands, giving rise to a zero-bias conductance peak. The symmetry and strength of $d$- and $g$-wave altermagnets strongly affect the surface Andreev states from $d$-wave and chiral $d$- and $p$-wave superconductors. As a result, distinct types of subgap states are realized, including curved and flat bands, that can be detected by tunneling spectroscopy. Furthermore, we find that the altermagnetism-induced subgap states give rise to a large spin conductance at zero net magnetization which helps identify the strength of the underlying altermagnetism and superconductivity. Our results offer a solid route for designing and manipulating subgap states in superconducting systems, which can be useful for functionalizing superconducting spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in imbalanced bilayer Hubbard model: enhanced $d$-wave and weakened $s^\pm$-wave pairing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the bilayer model with two layers of imbalanced densities coupled by the interlayer hybridization. Using the large-scale dynamical cluster quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we discovered that increased hybridization induces a transition in the superconducting pairing from $d$-wave to $s^{\pm}$-wave and the superconducting $T_c$ of $d$-wave pairing exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the density imbalance. Remarkably, the optimal SC occurs at a moderate imbalance, whose SC is solely hosted by the layer with higher density (lower hole doping). Our results support the possibility of $T_c$ enhancement in composite picture where the underdoped layer provides the pairing strength while the overdoped layer promotes the phase coherence. The uncovered SC hosted by a single layer is reminiscent of our recent exploration on the trilayer Hubbard model. Our present study thus provides new insight that the SC can be enhanced via the layer differentiation.</description>

      <title>Topological Insulator nano-SQUID: Flux-tunable platform for topological superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07993v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many efforts have been made in the past decade to realize topological superconductivity using superconducting proximity effect, but an ideal platform is still lacking. A 3D topological insulator (TI) is promising for this purpose due to the spin-momentum-locked surface state. Here we propose a novel yet simple TI platform which gives rise to a topological phase that is robust against disorder. It consists of a bulk-insulating rectangular TI nanowire laterally sandwiched by two superconductors. In this structure, the top and bottom surfaces individually work as SNS line junctions, forming a nanometer-scale columnar SQUID in which the nanowire cross-section defines the threading magnetic flux $\Phi$ in axial magnetic fields. We theoretically show that, when the two junctions are asymmetric, a robust topological phase occurs periodically for a wide range of $\Phi$, independently of the chemical potential. Our experiment found that a TI device of this structure indeed behaves as a columnar nano-SQUID where the supercurrent flows only through the top and bottom surfaces with vanishing bulk contribution. Furthermore, the top/bottom asymmetry can be tuned by a back gate, a key ingredient for the topological phase.</description>

      <title>Vortex Fractional Fermion Number through Heat Kernel methods and Edge States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computing the vacuum expectation of fermion number operator on a soliton background is often challenging. A recent proposal in arXiv:2305.13606 simplifies this task by considering the soliton in a bounded region and relating the $\eta$ invariant, and thus the fermion number, to a specific heat kernel coefficient and to contributions from the edge states. We test this method in a system of charged fermions living on an Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen (ANO) vortex background. We show that the resulting $\eta$ invariant does not depend on boundary conditions (within a certain class), thereby supporting the validity of the method. Our analysis reveals a nontrivial feature for the fermionic spectrum in the vortex-induced Higgs phase. As a by-product, we also find that for a vortex living on a disk, the edge states carry fractional charge.</description>

      <title>Time-tagging data acquisition system for testing superconducting electronics based on an RFSoC and custom analog frontend</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21714v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Novel electronic devices can often be operated in a plethora of ways, which makes testing circuits comprised of them difficult. Often, no single tool can simultaneously analyze the operating margins, maximum speed, and failure modes of a circuit, particularly when the intended behavior of subcomponents of the circuit is not standardized. This work demonstrates a cost-effective time-domain data acquisition system for electronic circuits that enables more intricate verification techniques than are practical with conventional experimental setups. We use high-speed digital-to-analog converters and real-time multi-gigasample-per-second waveform processing to push experimental circuits beyond their maximum operating speed. Our custom time-tagging data capture firmware reduces memory requirements and can be used to determine when errors occur. The firmware is combined with a thermal-noise-limited analog frontend with 50 dB of dynamic range. Compared to currently available commercial test equipment that is seven times more expensive, this data acquisition system was able to operate a superconducting shift register at a nearly three-times-higher clock frequency (200 MHz vs. 80 MHz).</description>

      <title>Symmetry-breaking-induced topology in FeSe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: FeSe has been one of the most intensively studied iron-based superconductors over the past two decades, exhibiting a wide range of phenomena such as unconventional superconductivity, nematic order, magnetism, orbital-selective correlations, and structural phase transitions. While topologically non-trivial phases have been identified in certain cases -- such as Te-doped FeSe and monolayer FeSe -- topology in bulk FeSe has largely remained unexplored. In this work, we propose a new route to realize topological phases directly in bulk FeSe. We demonstrate that breaking the tetragonal $C_4$ rotational symmetry, thereby lowering the crystal symmetry, can drive FeSe into a strong topological insulating phase. To support this, we perform density functional theory calculations and analyze the band structure using Topological Quantum Chemistry and symmetry-based indicators. Our results show that both uniaxial strain and temperature-induced structural changes lead to non-trivial band topology. Moreover, incorporating electronic correlations through dynamical mean field theory reveals that the topological characteristics near the Fermi level remain robust, as the relevant bands experience only moderate renormalization. These findings highlight strain as a promising mechanism to induce topological phases in FeSe</description>
