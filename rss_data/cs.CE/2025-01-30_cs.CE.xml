      <title>Pandora's Box: Cross-Chain Arbitrages in the Realm of Blockchain Interoperability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over recent years, the blockchain ecosystem has grown significantly with the emergence of new Layer-1 (L1) and Layer-2 (L2) networks. These blockchains typically host Decentralized Exchanges (DEXes) for trading assets such as native currencies and stablecoins. While this diversity enriches the ecosystem, it also fragments liquidity, posing challenges for DEXes offering the same assets across multiple blockchains. This fragmentation leads to price discrepancies, creating opportunities like arbitrages for profit-seeking traders, which fall under the broader category of exploitative economic practices known as Maximal Extractable Value (MEV). Although MEV extraction has been extensively studied within single domains (i.e., individual blockchains), cross-chain arbitrages, a form of cross-domain MEV, have received little attention due to their non-atomic nature, complicating both execution and detection.
  In this paper, we shed light on opaque cross-chain MEV activities by presenting the first systematic study of two non-atomic cross-chain arbitrage strategies: Sequence-Independent Arbitrage (SIA) and Sequence-Dependent Arbitrage (SDA). The former involves independent, opposite-direction trades across chains, while the latter relies on asset bridges. We analyze the effectiveness of these strategies across nine blockchains over a one-year period from September 2023 to August 2024, identifying 260,808 cross-chain arbitrages, 32.37% of which involve bridging solutions. These arbitrages generated a lower-bound profit of 9,496,115.28 USD from a total traded volume of 465,797,487.98 USD. Additionally, we examine the security implications of cross-chain arbitrages, uncovering centralization among arbitrageurs, network congestion caused by failed transactions, and growing private mempool adoption. Finally, we discuss sequencer incentives and propose a risk-optimized arbitrage strategy.</description>

      <title>Drivetrain simulation using variational autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work proposes variational autoencoders (VAEs) to predict a vehicle's jerk from a given torque demand, addressing the limitations of sparse real-world datasets. Specifically, we implement unconditional and conditional VAEs to generate jerk signals that integrate features from different drivetrain scenarios. The VAEs are trained on experimental data collected from two variants of a fully electric SUV, which differ in maximum torque delivery and drivetrain configuration. New meaningful jerk signals are generated within an engineering context through the interpretation of the VAE's latent space. A performance comparison with baseline physics-based and hybrid models confirms the effectiveness of the VAEs. We show that VAEs bypass the need for exhaustive manual system parametrization while maintaining physical plausibility by conditioning data generation on specific inputs.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Fallback Architecture for High Risk Online Machine Learning Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open Banking powered machine learning applications require novel robustness approaches to deal with challenging stress and failure scenarios. In this paper we propose an hierarchical fallback architecture for improving robustness in high risk machine learning applications with a focus in the financial domain. We define generic failure scenarios often found in online inference that depend on external data providers and we describe in detail how to apply the hierarchical fallback architecture to address them. Finally, we offer a real world example of its applicability in the industry for near-real time transactional fraud risk evaluation using Open Banking data and under extreme stress scenarios.</description>

      <title>Transforming Medical Regulations into Numbers: Vectorizing a Decade of Medical Device Regulatory Shifts in the USA, EU, and China</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Navigating the regulatory frameworks that ensure the safety and efficacy of medical devices can be challenging, especially across different regions. These frameworks often require redundant testing, slowing down the process of getting innovations to patients. This study leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze 664 regulations and guidelines from the USA, EU, and China over the past decade, covering over 200 million tokens. We categorize regulations into key phases, such as animal studies, clinical trials, and other testing stages, and use Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) to perform Named Entity Recognition (NER), identifying key regulatory terms and entities. By converting these texts into numerical representations and segmenting them by phase, country, and year, we compare jurisdictional requirements and assess their alignment. Additionally, we apply Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for theme analysis to observe changes in regulatory focus over time, reflecting evolving priorities and challenges. Our analysis reveals notable semantic similarities and differences between countries and phases. For instance, the closest alignment in animal study regulations is between China and the USA, with a mean cosine distance of 0.33. These findings highlight the computational potential in regulatory science, offering valuable insights for researchers, policymakers, and industry professionals.</description>
