      <title>[Beat-to-beat AV nodal assessment] ECG-based beat-to-beat assessment of AV node conduction properties during AF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The refractory period and conduction delay of the atrioventricular (AV) node play a crucial role in regulating the heart rate during atrial fibrillation (AF). Beat-to-beat variations in these properties are known to be induced by the autonomic nervous system (ANS) but have previously not been assessable during AF. Assessing these could provide novel information for improved diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment on an individual basis.
  To estimate AV nodal conduction properties with beat-to-beat resolution, we propose a methodology comprising a network model of the AV node, a particle filter, and a smoothing algorithm. The methodology was evaluated using simulated data and using synchronized electrogram (EGM) and ECG recordings from five patients in the intracardiac atrial fibrillation database. The methodology's ability to quantify ANS-induced changes in AV node conduction properties was evaluated by analyzing ECG data from 21 patients in AF undergoing a tilt test protocol.
  The estimated refractory period and conduction delay matched the simulated ground truth based on ECG recordings with a mean absolute error ($\pm$ std) of 169$\pm$14 ms for the refractory period in the fast pathway; 131$\pm$13 ms for the conduction delay in the fast pathway; 67$\pm$10 ms for the refractory period in the slow pathway; and 178$\pm$28 ms for the conduction delay in the slow pathway. These errors decreased when using simulated ground truth based on EGM recordings. Moreover, a decrease in conduction delay and refractory period in response to head-up tilt was seen during the tilt test protocol, as expected under sympathetic activation.
  These results suggest that beat-to-beat estimation of AV nodal conduction properties during AF from ECG is feasible, with different levels of uncertainty, and that the estimated properties agree with expected AV nodal modulation.</description>

      <title>Staining normalization in histopathology: Method benchmarking using multicenter dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) has been the gold standard in tissue analysis for decades, however, tissue specimens stained in different laboratories vary, often significantly, in appearance. This variation poses a challenge for both pathologists' and AI-based downstream analysis. Minimizing stain variation computationally is an active area of research. To further investigate this problem, we collected a unique multi-center tissue image dataset, wherein tissue samples from colon, kidney, and skin tissue blocks were distributed to 66 different labs for routine H&amp;E staining. To isolate staining variation, other factors affecting the tissue appearance were kept constant. Further, we used this tissue image dataset to compare the performance of eight different stain normalization methods, including four traditional methods, namely, histogram matching, Macenko, Vahadane, and Reinhard normalization, and two deep learning-based methods namely CycleGAN and Pixp2pix, both with two variants each. We used both quantitative and qualitative evaluation to assess the performance of these methods. The dataset's inter-laboratory staining variation could also guide strategies to improve model generalizability through varied training data</description>
