      <title>Polarization and Gorenstein liaison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major open question in the theory of Gorenstein liaison is whether or not every arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay subscheme of $\mathbb{P}^n$ can be G-linked to a complete intersection. Migliore and Nagel showed that, if such a scheme is generically Gorenstein (e.g., reduced), then, after re-embedding so that it is viewed as a subscheme of $\mathbb{P}^{n+1}$, indeed it can be G-linked to a complete intersection. Motivated by this result, we consider techniques for constructing G-links on a scheme from G-links on a closely related reduced scheme.
  Polarization is a tool for producing a squarefree monomial ideal from an arbitrary monomial ideal. Basic double G-links on squarefree monomial ideals can be induced from vertex decompositions of their Stanley-Reisner complexes. Given a monomial ideal $I$ and a vertex decomposition of the Stanley-Reisner complex of its polarization $\mathcal{P}(I)$, we give conditions that allow for the lifting of an associated basic double G-link of $\mathcal{P}(I)$ to a basic double G-link of $I$ itself. We use the relationship we develop in the process to show that the Stanley-Reisner complexes of polarizations of artinian monomial ideals and of stable Cohen-Macaulay monomial ideals are vertex decomposable, recovering and strengthening the recent result of Fl{\o}ystad and Mafi that these complexes are shellable.
  We then introduce and study polarization of a Gr\"obner basis of an arbitrary homogeneous ideal and give a relationship between geometric vertex decomposition of a polarization and elementary G-biliaison that is analogous to our result on vertex decomposition and basic double G-linkage.</description>

      <title>Generically nonreduced components of Hilbert schemes on fourfolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We exhibit generically nonreduced components of the Hilbert scheme of at least $21$ points on a smooth variety of dimension at least four. The result was announced in~[Jelisiejew__open_problems] and answers a question~[Problem~3.8, AIMPL]. The method is similar to the one of~[\S6, Jelisiejew-\v{S}ivic].</description>

      <title>Taylor Morphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study generalised Taylor morphisms, functors which construct differential ring homomorphisms from ring homomorphisms in a uniform way, analogous to the Taylor expansion for smooth functions. We generalise the construction of the twisted Taylor morphism by Le\'on S\'anchez and Tressl to arbitrary differential rings by `twisting' the ring of Hurwitz series, and prove that this results in a functor which is the right adjoint to a certain forgetful functor. We therefore give a concrete characterisation of all generalised Taylor morphisms over all differential rings with finitely many commuting derivations.</description>

      <title>On General fiber product rings, Poincar\'e series and their structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present paper deals with the investigation of the structure of general fiber product rings $R\times_TS$, where $R$, $S$ and $T$ are local rings with common residue field. We show that the Poincar\'e series of any $R$-module over the fiber product ring $R\times_TS$ is bounded by a rational function. In addition, we give a description of ${\rm depth}(R\times_TS)$, which is an open problem in this theory. As a biproduct, using the characterization of the Betti numbers over $R\times_TS$ obtained, we provide certain cases of the Cohen-Macaulayness of $R\times_TS$ and, in particular, we show that $R\times_TS$ is always non-regular. Some positive answers for the Buchsbaum-Eisenbud-Horrocks and Total rank conjectures over $R\times_TS$ are also established.</description>

      <title>Exact Algorithms for Computing Generalized Eigenspaces of Matrices via Annihilating Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.04807v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An effective exact method is proposed for computing generalized eigenspaces of a matrix of integers or rational numbers. Keys of our approach are the use of minimal annihilating polynomials and the concept of the Jourdan-Krylov basis. A new method, called Jordan-Krylov elimination, is introduced to design an algorithm for computing Jordan-Krylov basis. The resulting algorithm outputs generalized eigenspaces as a form of Jordan chains. Notably, in the output, components of generalized eigenvectors are expressed as polynomials in the associated eigenvalue as a variable.</description>

      <title>When is the ring of integers of a number field coverable?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A commutative ring R is said to be coverable if it is the union of its proper subrings and said to be finitely coverable if it is the union of a finite number of them. In the latter case, we denote by {\sigma}(R) the minimal number of required subrings. In this paper, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for the ring of integers A of a given number field to be finitely coverable and a formula for {\sigma}(A) is given which holds when they are met. The conditions are expressed in terms of the existence of common index divisors and (or) common divisors of values of polynomials.</description>
