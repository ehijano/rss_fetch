      <title>CR-Enabled NOMA Integrated Non-Terrestrial IoT Networks with Transmissive RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes a T-RIS-equipped LEO satellite communication in cognitive radio-enabled integrated NTNs. In the proposed system, a GEO satellite operates as a primary network, and a T-RIS-equipped LEO satellite operates as a secondary IoT network. The objective is to maximize the sum rate of T-RIS-equipped LEO satellite communication using downlink NOMA while ensuring the service quality of GEO cellular users. Our framework simultaneously optimizes the total transmit power of LEO, NOMA power allocation for LEO IoT (LIoT) and T-RIS phase shift design subject to the service quality of LIoT and interference temperature to the primary GEO network. To solve the non-convex sum rate maximization problem, we first adopt successive convex approximations to reduce the complexity of the formulated optimization. Then, we divide the problem into two parts, i.e., power allocation of LEO and phase shift design of T-RIS. The power allocation problem is solved using KKT conditions, while the phase shift problem is handled by Taylor approximation and semidefinite programming. Numerical results are provided to validate the proposed optimization framework.</description>

      <title>Towards Equivalence Checking of Classical Circuits Using Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers and quantum algorithms have made great strides in the last few years and promise improvements over classical computing for specific tasks. Although the current hardware is not yet ready to make real impacts at the time of writing, this will change over the coming years. To be ready for this, it is important to share knowledge of quantum computing in application domains where it is not yet represented. One such application is the verification of classical circuits, specifically, equivalence checking. Although this problem has been investigated over decades in an effort to overcome the verification gap, how it can potentially be solved using quantum computing has hardly been investigated yet. In this work, we address this question by considering a presumably straightforward approach: Using Grover's algorithm. However, we also show that, although this might be an obvious choice, there are several pitfalls to avoid in order to get meaningful results. This leads to the proposal of a working concept of a quantum computing methodology for equivalent checking providing the foundation for corresponding solutions in the (near) future.</description>

      <title>Security Concerns in IoT Light Bulbs: Investigating Covert Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has raised significant concerns regarding their security vulnerabilities. This paper explores the security risks associated with smart light systems, focusing on covert communication channels. Drawing upon previous re-search highlighting vulnerabilities in communication protocols and en-cryption flaws, the study investigates the potential for exploiting smart light systems for covert data transmission. Specifically, the paper repli-cates and analyzes an attack method introduced by Ronen and Shamir, which utilizes the Philips Hue White lighting system to create a covert channel through visible light communication (VLC). Experimental re-sults demonstrate the feasibility of transmitting data covertly through subtle variations in brightness levels, leveraging the inherent functional-ity of smart light bulbs. Despite limit. ations imposed by device constraints and communication protocols, the study underscores the need for heightened awareness and security measures in IoT environment. Ultimately, the findings emphasize the importance of implementing robust security practices and exercising caution when deploying networked IoT devices in sensitive environment.</description>

      <title>Sustainable Data Democratization: A Multifaceted Investment for an Equitable Future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The urgent need for data democratization in scientific research was the focal point of a panel discussion at SC23 in Denver, Colorado, from November 12 to 17, 2023. This article summarizes the outcomes of that discussion and subsequent conversations. We advocate for strategic investments in financial, human, and technological resources for sustainable data democratization. Emphasizing that data is central to scientific discovery and AI deployment, we highlight barriers such as limited access, inadequate financial incentives for cross-domain collaboration, and a shortage of workforce development initiatives. Our recommendations aim to guide decision-makers in fostering an inclusive research community, breaking down research silos, and developing a skilled workforce to advance scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>SLA Conceptual Model for IoT Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since SLAs specify the contractual terms that are formally used between consumers and providers, there is a need to aggregate QoS requirements from the perspectives of Clouds, networks, and devices to deliver the promised IoT functionalities. Therefore, the main objective of this chapter is to provide a conceptual model of SLA for the IoT as well as rich vocabularies to describe the QoS and domain-specific configuration parameters of the IoT on an end-to-end basis. We first propose a conceptual model that identifies the main concepts that play a role in specifying end-to-end SLAs. Then, we identify some of the most common QoS metrics and configuration parameters related to each concept. We evaluated the proposed conceptual model using a goal-oriented approach, and the participants in the study reported a high level of satisfaction regarding the proposed conceptual model and its ability to capture main concepts in a general way.</description>

      <title>IoT Monitoring with Blockchain: Generating Smart Contracts from Service Level Agreements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a commitment between a client and provider that assures the quality of service (QoS) a client can expect to receive when purchasing a service. However, evidence of SLA violations in Internet of Things (IoT) service monitoring data can be manipulated by the provider or consumer, resulting in an issue of trust between contracted parties. The following research aims to explore the use of blockchain technology in monitoring IoT systems using smart contracts so that SLA violations captured are irrefutable amongst service providers and clients. The research focuses on the development of a Java library that is capable of generating a smart contract from a given SLA. A smart contract generated by this library is validated through a mock scenario presented in the form of a Remote Patient Monitoring IoT system. In this scenario, the findings demonstrate a 100 percent success rate in capturing all emulated violations.</description>

      <title>European Quantum Ecosystems -- Preparing the Industry for the Quantum Security and Communications Revolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is mounting evidence that a second quantum revolution based on the technological capabilities to detect and manipulate single quantum particles (e.g., electrons, photons, ions, etc), a feat not achieved during the first quantum revolution, is progressing fast. It is expected that in less than 10 years, this second quantum revolution shall have a significant impact over numerous industries, including finance, medicine, energy, transportation, etc. Quantum computers threaten the status quo of cybersecurity, due to known quantum algorithms that can break asymmetric encryption, which is what gives us the ability to communicate securely using a public channel. Considering the world's dependence on digital communication through data exchange and processing, retaining the ability to communicate securely even once quantum computers come into play, cannot be stressed enough. Two solutions are available: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC); which, we emphasise, are not mutually exclusive. The EuroQCI initiative, of which EQUO is a part of, focuses on QKD and aims to build a network whereby EU countries can communicate securely through QKD. To this aim, the DEP (Digital Europe Programme) project aims to bring technological matureness to QKD by deploying a QKD test network and, through this exercise, understand what is lacking from an operator's point of view when the time to integrate QKD in their network comes.</description>

      <title>Brain Inspired Probabilistic Occupancy Grid Mapping with Hyperdimensional Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09066v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-time robotic systems require advanced perception, computation, and action capability. However, the main bottleneck in current autonomous systems is the trade-off between computational capability, energy efficiency and model determinism. World modeling, a key objective of many robotic systems, commonly uses occupancy grid mapping (OGM) as the first step towards building an end-to-end robotic system with perception, planning, autonomous maneuvering, and decision making capabilities. OGM divides the environment into discrete cells and assigns probability values to attributes such as occupancy and traversability. Existing methods fall into two categories: traditional methods and neural methods. Traditional methods rely on dense statistical calculations, while neural methods employ deep learning for probabilistic information processing. Recent works formulate a deterministic theory of neural computation at the intersection of cognitive science and vector symbolic architectures. In this study, we propose a Fourier-based hyperdimensional OGM system, VSA-OGM, combined with a novel application of Shannon entropy that retains the interpretability and stability of traditional methods along with the improved computational efficiency of neural methods. Our approach, validated across multiple datasets, achieves similar accuracy to covariant traditional methods while approximately reducing latency by 200x and memory by 1000x. Compared to invariant traditional methods, we see similar accuracy values while reducing latency by 3.7x. Moreover, we achieve 1.5x latency reductions compared to neural methods while eliminating the need for domain-specific model training.</description>
