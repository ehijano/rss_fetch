      <title>Effects of prestress in the coating of an elastic disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An elastic disk is coated with an elastic rod, uniformly prestressed with a tensile or compressive axial force. The prestress state is assumed to be induced by three different models of external radial load or by 'shrink-fit' forcing the coating onto the disk. The prestressed coating/disk system, when loaded with an additional and arbitrary incremental external load, experiences incremental displacement, strain, and stress, which are solved via complex potentials. The analysis incorporates models for both perfect and imperfect bonding at the coating/disk interface. The derived solution highlights the significant influence not only of the prestress but also of the method employed to generate it. These two factors lead, in different ways, to a loss or an increase in incremental stiffness for compressive or tensile prestress. The first bifurcation load of the structure (which differs for different prestress generations) is determined in a perturbative way. The results emphasize the importance of modelling the load and may find applications in flexible electronics and robot arms subject to pressure or uniformly-distributed radial forces.</description>

      <title>Universal Deformations and Inhomogeneities in Isotropic Cauchy Elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a given class of materials, \emph{universal deformations} are those deformations that can be maintained in the absence of body forces and by applying solely boundary tractions. For inhomogeneous bodies, in addition to the universality constraints that determine the universal deformations, there are extra constraints on the form of the material inhomogeneities -- \emph{universal inhomogeneity constraints}. Those inhomogeneities compatible with the universal inhomogeneity constraints are called \emph{universal inhomogeneities}. In a Cauchy elastic solid, stress at a given point and at an instance of time is a function of strain at that point and that exact moment in time, without any dependence on prior history. A Cauchy elastic solid does not necessarily have an energy function, i.e., Cauchy elastic solids are, in general, non-hyperelastic (or non-Green elastic). In this paper we characterize universal deformations in both compressible and incompressible inhomogeneous isotropic Cauchy elasticity. As Cauchy elasticity includes hyperelasticity, one expects the universal deformations of Cauchy elasticity to be a subset of those of hyperelasticity both in the compressible and incompressible cases. It is also expected that the universal inhomogeneity constraints to be more strict than those of hyperelasticity, and hence, the set of universal inhomogeneities to be smaller than that of hyperelasticity. We prove the unexpected result that the sets of universal deformations of isotropic Cauchy elasticity and isotropic hyperelasticity are identical, in both the compressible and incompressible cases. We also prove that their corresponding universal inhomogeneities are identical as well.</description>

      <title>Size selection of crack front defects: Multiple fracture-plane interactions and intrinsic lengthscales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Material failure is mediated by the propagation of cracks, which in realistic 3D materials typically involve multiple coexisting fracture planes. Multiple fracture-plane interactions create poorly understood out-of-plane crack structures, such as step defects on tensile fracture surfaces. Steps form once a slowly moving, distorted crack front segments into disconnected overlapping fracture planes separated by a stabilizing distance $h_{\rm max}$. Our experiments on numerous brittle hydrogels reveal that $h_{\rm max}$ varies linearly with both a nonlinear elastic length $\Gamma(v)/\mu$ and a dissipation length $\xi$. Here, $\Gamma(v)$ is the measured crack velocity $v$-dependent fracture energy and $\mu$ is the shear modulus. These intrinsic lengthscales point the way to a fundamental understanding of multiple-crack interactions in 3D that lead to the formation of stable out-of-plane fracture structures.</description>
