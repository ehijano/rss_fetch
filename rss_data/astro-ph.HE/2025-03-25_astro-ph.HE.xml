      <title>Every Nearby Energetic Pulsar Is Surrounded by a Region of Inhibited Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The H.E.S.S. telescope has recently detected the total electron-plus-positron ($e^+e^-$) flux up to 40 TeV, finding it to be a featureless and steeply-falling power-law above 1 TeV. This result is in stark tension with standard one-zone models of pulsar $e^+e^-$ injection and diffusion, which predict a hard-spectrum signal above $\sim$10 TeV. We model the local pulsar population, and find 20 sources that would each $individually$ overproduce the H.E.S.S. $e^+e^-$ flux in a one-zone diffusion model. We conclude that $every$ energetic pulsar younger than $\sim$500 kyr must be surrounded by a region of inhibited diffusion ($e.g.$, a supernova remnant, pulsar wind nebula, or TeV halo) that prevents the transport of these $e^+e^-$ to Earth. Because the high-electron density in these regions produces bright synchrotron and inverse-Compton emission, we conclude that all nearby pulsars are detectable as (potentially unassociated) radio, x-ray or $\gamma$-ray sources.</description>

      <title>$^{56}$Ni production in long-lived binary neutron star merger remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nucleosynthesis and kilonova emission based on numerical-relativity binary neutron star merger simulations that incorporate a two-moment neutrino-transport scheme. Unlike in previous works with simpler neutrino treatments, a massive, fast (up to $v=0.3c$), proton-rich neutrino-driven wind develops in the post-merger phase of the simulations as long as the merger remnant does not collapse to a black hole. We evolve the ejecta for 100 days after the merger using 2D ray-by-ray radiation-hydrodynamics simulations coupled in-situ to a complete nuclear network. The most abundant nucleosynthesis products are He, $^{56}$Ni, and $^{56}$Co. We find a total yield of $\sim 10^{-3} M_\odot$ of $^{56}$Ni for all mergers that produce massive neutron star remnants, independently of the mass ratio and equation of state. After a few days, the decay of $^{56}$Ni and later $^{56}$Co becomes the primary source of heating in the matter expanding above the remnant. As a result, the kilonova light curve flattens on timescales of days for polar observation angles. The observation of this effect could serve as smoking gun for the presence of a long-lived neutron star remnant in future kilonova observations.</description>

      <title>Embers of Active Galactic Nuclei: Tidal Disruption Events and Quasi-periodic Eruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations have confirmed the direct association between tidal disruption events (TDEs) and quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs). In addition, TDE hosts and QPE hosts are statistically found to be similar in their morphological properties and in the strong overrepresentation of post-starburst galaxies. Particularly, both of them show an intriguing preference for extending emission line regions (EELRs), which are indicative of recently faded active galactic nuclei (AGNs). This further suggests that QPEs might be produced following TDEs involving supermassive black holes at a particular stage, when the AGN activity has recently ceased. Moreover, in the framework of "QPEs=EMRI+accretion disk" model, a large fraction of QPE EMRIs are inferred to be quasi-circular from the QPE timing, indicating that they are wet EMRIs that were formed in the AGN disk during a previous AGN phase. Based on these facts, we propose a unified scenario that connects these three phenomena: AGN activities boost both the TDE rate and the formation rate of low-eccentricity EMRIs, consequently TDEs are preferentially found in recently faded AGNs instead of in on-going AGNs due to selection effects, and QPEs are also preferentially found in recently faded AGNs where TDEs frequently feed a misaligned accretion disk to the EMRI.</description>

      <title>Probing thermonuclear bursts and X-ray reflection features in Aql X-1 during 2024 outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the broadband timing and spectral properties of the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary Aql X-1 during the 2024 outburst with NICER, NuSTAR, and Swift observatories. We detected six thermonuclear X-ray bursts during the NICER and NuSTAR observations, with the observed X-ray burst profiles exhibiting a strong energy dependence. The time-resolved burst spectra indicate the presence of soft excess during the burst, which can be modeled by using a variable persistent emission method ($f_a$ method), or the relxillNS reflection model. We found that the reflection model can contribute $\sim$20% of total emission as observed during the NICER burst. The reflection and blackbody component fluxes are strongly correlated as observed during a burst. The excess emission is possible due to the enhanced mass accretion rate to the neutron star due to the Poynting-Rodertson drag and a fraction of burst emission may be reflected from the disk. The bursts did not show photospheric radius expansion during the peak. Moreover, we examined the burst-free accretion emission in the broadband range with NuSTAR, NICER, and Swift at two epochs of the outburst. The persistent emission showed X-ray reflection feature, which can be well modeled with the relativistic reflection model relxillCp. The inner disk radius (R$_{in}$) is found to be nearly 22 and 10 times $\rm R_{g}$ for two observations, respectively. Assuming that the inner disk is truncated at the magnetospheric radius, the magnetic field strength at the poles of the neutron star is estimated to be $(0.6-1.9) \times 10^9$ G.</description>

      <title>Spreading and multi-wavelength emissions of an ultra-narrow relativistic jet from GRB 221009A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The long-term evolution of relativistic jets in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), particularly from days to months post-burst, remains a fundamental puzzle in astrophysics. Here, we report our very long baseline interferometry observation of the brightest GRB 221009A from 5 to 26 days post-burst. Combined with released data, we uncover a remarkable two-stage evolution of the jet lateral size. The jet size initially grew slowly but later expanded rapidly, challenging conventional scenarios. The slow-evolving stage provides a robust lower limit on the jet opening angle and direct evidence of jet propagation in the uniform interstellar medium at this period. The synergy analysis of the whole jet size evolution and multi-wavelength emissions uncovers that GRB 221009A harbors an ultra-narrow jet (with a half-opening angle $\simeq$ 0.01-0.03~radian) that propagates through a wind-like medium before encountering the interstellar medium, which finally undergoes lateral spreading after significant deceleration. These findings provide crucial new insights into relativistic jet dynamics and establish GRB 221009A as a unique case study for understanding the complex physics of GRB outflows.</description>

      <title>GRB timing: decoding the hidden slow jets in GRB 060729</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are luminous stellar explosions characterized by the ejection of relativistic jets. This work proposes a novel paradigm to study these GRB jets. By analyzing the timing information of prompt pulses and X-ray flares, in conjunction with the multi-wavelength afterglow observations, we identify three distinct jets in the extraordinary GRB 060729, with initial bulk Lorentz factors ranging from approximately 40 to 80, smaller than typical values of $&gt; 100$. These three jets undergo two successive collisions, producing the observed pair of X-ray flares. Following these interactions, the system evolves into a fast, narrow jet and a slower, hollow jet that continues to propagate in the circumburst medium, evidenced by the notable twin bumps observed in the X-ray and optical afterglow of GRB 060729. Our findings demonstrate that the timing of the early emission enables us to measure the velocities of the GRB jets. The proposed paradigm enhances our understanding of jet dynamics and shock interactions and serves as a powerful tool for probing the physics of the central engine with the expanded sample in the current golden era of GRB research.</description>

      <title>Gamma-ray Burst Empirical Correlation between Peak Luminosity and Peak Energy in The ICMART Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Internal-Collision-induced Magnetic Reconnection and Turbulence (ICMART) model is a widely accepted model for explaining how high-magnetization jets produce gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt emissions.
  In previous works, we show that this model can produce:
  1) light curves with a superposition of fast and slow components;
  2) a Band-shaped spectrum whose parameters could follow the typical distribution of GRB observations;
  3) both ``hard to soft" and ``intensity tracking" patterns of spectral evolution.
  In this work, through simulations of a large sample with methods established in previous work, we show that the ICMART model can also explain the observed empirical relationships (here we focus on the Yonetoku and Liang relations), as long as the magnetic field strength in the magnetic reconnection radiation region is proportional to the mass of the bulk shell, and inversely proportional to the initial magnetization factor of the bulk shell.
  Our results suggest that during extreme relativistic magnetic reconnection events, an increase in magnetic field strength leads to more intense dissipation, ultimately resulting in a weaker residual magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Non-orbital particle trapping in binary black holes through dynamic stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an interdisciplinary comparison between binary black hole systems and Radio Frequency (RF) Paul Traps, modeling the gravitational binary system as a rotating saddle near its center. This analogy connects these seemingly unrelated systems through the concept of dynamic stability. The rotating saddle potential is analytically tractable, allowing us to prove the existence of bounded charged particle trajectories under certain conditions. By focusing on stellar-mass black holes with a weak electric charge-a feature consistent with specific astrophysical conditions that leaves the spacetime metric largely unaffected but can influence nearby particle interactions-we can neglect complicating factors such as magnetic fields from large accretion disks of heavier black holes or stellar winds. Our simulation results demonstrate that charged particles can exhibit stable, non-orbital trajectories near the center of a binary system with charged stellar-mass black holes, providing unique three-dimensional trapping primarily through gravity. This system is distinctive in the literature for its non-orbital trapping mechanism. While theoretically intriguing, this trapping relies on specific conditions, including nearly identical black hole masses. These types of non-orbital trapping mechanisms could potentially allow for longer-lived plasma configurations, enhancing our ability to detect electromagnetic signatures from these systems. The significance of this work lies in the novel comparison between a laboratory-scale quantum system and a larger astrophysical one, opening new avenues for exploring parallels between microscopic and cosmic phenomena across fourteen orders of magnitude in distance.</description>

      <title>Possible binary neutron star merger history of the primary of GW230529</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black holes (BHs) with masses between $\sim 3-5M_{\odot}$, produced by a binary neutron star (BNS) merger, can further pair up with a neutron star or BH and merge again within a Hubble time. However, the astrophysical environments in which this can happen and the rate of such mergers are open questions in astrophysics. Gravitational waves may play an important role in answering these questions. In this context, we discuss the possibility that the primary of the recent LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA binary GW230529_181500 (GW230529, in short) is the product of a previous BNS merger. Invoking numerical relativity (NR)-based fitting formulas that map the binary constituents' masses and tidal deformabilities to the mass, spin, and kick velocity of the remnant BH, we investigate the potential parents of GW230529's primary. Our calculations using NR fits based on BNS simulations reveal that the remnant of a high-mass BNS merger similar to GW190425 is consistent with the primary of GW230529. This argument is further strengthened by the gravitational wave-based merger rate estimation of GW190425-like and GW230529-like populations. We show that around 18% (median) of the GW190425-like remnants could become the primary component in GW230529-like mergers. The dimensionless tidal deformability parameter of the heavier neutron star in the parent binary is constrained to $67^{+163}_{-61}$ at 90% credibility. Using estimates of the gravitational-wave kick imparted to the remnant, we also discuss the astrophysical environments in which these types of mergers can take place and the implications for their future observations.</description>

      <title>Linear Analysis and Simulations of the Cosmic-Ray Streaming Instability: the Importance of Oblique Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic-ray (CR) streaming instability (CRSI) is believed to play an important role in CR transport and CR feedback to galaxies. It drives the growth of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves that scatter CRs, and leads to energy/momentum exchange between CRs and interstellar medium. Despite extensive research on CRSI, its dependence on the thermodynamic state of the gas and its multidimensional effects have not been systematically studied. In this study, we derive the dispersion relation of the CRSI for three types of MHD waves including their dependence on propagation direction and plasma $\beta$ (the ratio of thermal pressure to magnetic pressure). We verify the analytical dispersion relation with one-dimensional and two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic particle-in-cell simulations. Furthermore, we use 2D simulations to investigate the role of oblique MHD waves in scattering CRs, and find that these waves are important in helping low-energy particles overcome the 90-degree pitch angle barrier. While magnetosonic waves tend to be damped by transit time damping under typical conditions, oblique Alfv\'en waves likely play an important role in low-$\beta$ plasmas.</description>

      <title>Decoding FRB energetics and frequency features hidden by observational incompleteness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are fierce radio flashes lasting for a few milliseconds from the sky. Although their connection to strongly magnetized neutron stars has been strongly indicated, the exact triggering process and radiation mechanism are still unknown and highly debated. Due to their extremely short duration, the observation of FRBs has long been a difficult task even for large radio telescopes. The difficulty results from the fact that the information obtained in observations is always incomplete, since the telescope always has a limited flux sensitivity and finite operating frequency band. A pressing challenge is to decode the intrinsic features of FRBs from the incomplete observations. Here we establish an efficient methodology to overcome this problem, aiming at effectively correcting for the fluence and frequency cutoffs. Using this method, inverse modeling is performed on a large number of repeating bursts from FRB 20121102A to recover their intrinsic features. It is found that strong bursts intrinsically tend to concentrate their energy in a narrow band, while the spectral range of weak bursts can be either narrow or wide. However, when a weak burst has a broad spectrum, the wing of the spectrum can easily go undetected, resulting in a very narrow spectrum being observed. The narrow spectrum features observed in repeating FRBs are thus an observational selection effect. Underestimation of the burst energy caused by observational cutoffs is also corrected for, and the intrinsic burst energy distribution is re-constructed. It is also found that the bandwidth increases with the increasing central frequency in the Arecibo sample (1.15-1.73 GHz), but such a correlation is not observed in the FAST (1-1.5 GHz) and GBT (4-8 GHz) sample. It indicates the emission pattern of the FRB source might vary across different active periods and frequency bands.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic states of fast neutrino-flavor conversions in the three-flavor framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been growing evidence that mu and tau neutrinos are noticeably different due to the emergence of muons in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and binary neutron star mergers (BNSMs). Recent theoretical studies also suggest that all flavors of neutrinos and antineutrinos inevitably experience some flavor mixing instabilities including fast neutrino flavor conversions (FFC), which corresponds to one of the collective neutrino oscillations powered by neutrino self-interactions. This represents a need for quantum kinetic treatment in the numerical modeling of neutrino dynamics, which is, however, a formidable computational challenge. In this paper, we present an approximate method to predict asymptotic states of FFC without solving a quantum kinetic equation under a three-flavor framework, in which mu and tau neutrino distributions are not necessarily identical to each other. The approximate method is developed based on a Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) relaxation time prescription, capable of capturing essential features of mixing competitions among three different flavor-coherent states. Our proposed scheme is computationally inexpensive and easy to implement in any classical neutrino transport scheme.</description>

      <title>The Compton-Getting origin of the large-scale anisotropy of Galactic cosmic rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have proposed that the anisotropy of cosmic rays' arrival directions is conducive to unveiling the local acceleration sites and propagation environment. We built a unified scenario to describe the available observations of the energy spectra and the large-scale anisotropy. In this work, we further investigate the impact of the Sun's motion relative to the local plasma frame on the large-scale anisotropy, i.e. so-called Compton-Getting effect. We find that when considering this effect, the dipole amplitude decreases and the phase slightly deviates from the direction of the local regular magnetic field at tens of TeV energies. At lower energies, when the anisotropy from the density gradient of cosmic rays is small, the influence of the relative motion of the Sun becomes evident. Less than $\sim 200$ GeV, the dipole amplitude rises again and approaches the value of the Compton-Getting effect. Moreover, at several hundreds of GeV, the dipole phase has a flip, which points to the direction of the Compton-Getting effect. In the future, the measurements of anisotropy from $100$ GeV to TeV could testify to this effect.</description>

      <title>New Tests on Lorentz Invariance Violation Using Energy-Resolved Polarimetry of Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the manifestations of Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) is vacuum birefringence, which leads to an energy-dependent rotation of the polarization plane of linearly polarized photons arising from an astrophysical source. Here we use the energy-resolved polarization measurements in the prompt $\gamma$-ray emission of five bright gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) to constrain this vacuum birefringent effect. Our results show that at the 95\% confidence level, the birefringent parameter $\eta$ characterizing the broken degree of Lorentz invariance can be constrained to be $|\eta|&lt;\mathcal{O}(10^{-15}-10^{-16})$, which represent an improvement of at least eight orders of magnitude over existing limits from multi-band optical polarization observations. Moreover, our constraints are competitive with previous best bounds from the single $\gamma$-ray polarimetry of other GRBs. We emphasize that, thanks to the adoption of the energy-resolved polarimetric data set, our results on $\eta$ are statistically more robust. Future polarization measurements of GRBs at higher energies and larger distances would further improve LIV limits through the birefringent effect.</description>

      <title>Search for interpulses in a complete sample of pulsars at a frequency of 111 MHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An interpulse search was carried out in a sample of 96 pulsars observed on the Large Phased Array (LPA) radio telescope in the Pushchino Multibeams Pulsar Search (PUMPS). The pulsar sample is complete for pulsars having a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) in the main pulse ($MP$) greater than 40. To search for weak interpulses ($IP$), the addition of average profiles over an interval of up to 10 years was used. Interpulses were detected in 12 pulsars (12.5\% of the sample), of which 7 pulsars have an interpulse located near the $180^o$ phase relative to the main pulse (probable orthogonal rotators), and 5 have phases far from $180^o$ (probable coaxial rotators). The amplitude ratios of $IP/MP$ are in the range of 0.004-0.023, the median value is 0.01. Estimates of the observed number of coaxial and orthogonal rotators with $IP/MP \ge 0.01$ do not contradict the model according to which, during evolution, the magnetic axis and the axis of rotation become orthogonal.</description>

      <title>How do recollimation-induced instabilities shape the propagation of hydrodynamic relativistic jets?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recollimation is a phenomenon of particular importance in the dynamic evolution of jets and in the emission of high-energy radiation. Additionally, the full comprehension of this phenomenon provides insights into fundamental properties of jets in the vicinity of the Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN). Three-dimensional (magneto-)hydrodynamic simulations revealed that the jet conditions at recollimation favor the growth of strong instabilities, challenging the traditional view-supported from two-dimensional simulations-of confined jets undergoing a series of recollimation and reflection shocks. To investigate the stability of relativistic jets in AGNs at recollimation sites, we perform a set of long duration three-dimensional relativistic hydrodynamic simulations with the state-of-the-art PLUTO code, to focus on the development of hydrodynamical instabilities. We explore the non-linear growth of the instabilities and their effects on the physical jet properties as a function of the initial jet parameters: jet Lorentz factor, temperature, opening angle and jet-environment density-contrast. The parameter space is designed to describe low-power, weakly magnetized jets at small distances from the core (around the parsec scale). All collimating jets we simulated develop instabilities. Recollimation instabilities decelerate the jet, heat it, entrain external material, and move the recollimation point to shorter distances from the core. This is true for both conical and cylindrical jets. The instabilities, that are first triggered by the centrifugal instability, appear to be less disruptive in the case of narrower, denser, more relativistic, and warmer jets. These results provide valuable insights into the complex processes governing AGN jets and could be used to model the properties of low-power, weakly magnetized jetted AGNs.</description>

      <title>Multifrequency simultaneous VLBA view of the radio source 3C 111</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic jets originating at the center of AGN are embedded in extreme environments with strong magnetic fields and high particle densities, which makes them a fundamental tool for studying the physics of magnetized plasmas. We aim to investigate the magnetic field structure and the pc/sub-pc properties of the relativistic jet in the radio galaxy 3C111. Rotation Measure (RM) studies of nearby radio galaxies, such as this one, provide a valuable tool to investigate transversal magnetic field properties of the synchrotron emission. We model the brightness distribution of the source with multiple 2D Gaussian components to characterize individual emission features. After determining the core shift, we compute the spectral index maps for all the frequency pairs and find different distributions for the core region and the jet with an unusual optically thick/flat feature at 1-2 pc from the core. Using modelfit, we find a total of 56 components at different frequencies. By putting constraints on the size and position, we identify 22 components at different frequencies for which we compute the equipartition magnetic field. We compute the RM at two different triplets of frequencies. At 15.2-21.9-43.8 GHz, we discover high values of RM in the same region where the optically thick/flat feature was found. This can be associated with high electron density at 1-2 pc from the core that we interpreted as originating in a cloud of the clumpy torus. At 5-8.4-15.2 GHz, we find a distribution of the EVPAs and significant RM transverse gradient that provide strong evidence of a helical configuration of the magnetic field, as found in simulations.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Accretion on FRB Radiation Mechanisms in Binary Systems: Constraints and Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are intense, millisecond-duration radio transients that have recently been proposed to arise from coherent radiation mechanisms within the magnetosphere of neutron stars. Observations of repeating FRBs, including periodic activity and large variations in Faraday rotation measures, suggest that these bursts may have binary system origins, with massive companion. In this work, we investigate how accretion from a massive companion influences the FRB radiation within the magnetosphere of the neutron star. Focusing on two widely accepted pulsar-like coherent radiation mechanisms, we establish the parameter space for neutron stars that allows FRB generation, even in the presence of accreted matter. Our analysis shows that coherent curvature radiation is only viable within a narrow range of parameters, while the magnetic reconnection mechanism operates across a broader range. In both cases, the neutron star must possess a strong magnetic field with strength $\gtrsim 10^{13}$ G. These findings at least indicate that the central engines responsible for producing observable FRBs in binary systems are indeed magnetars.</description>

      <title>Limiting on ALP-photon Coupling through GRB221009A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the constraints on ALPs parameters through the photon-ALP oscillation model, based on the high-energy photon propagation characteristics of the gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A. We briefly describe the Primakoff process and use it to derive the oscillation probability. Numerical simulations incorporate the GMF, IGMF, and EBL, utilizing the open-source code gammaALPs to simulate photon propagation from the source to Earth. By employing the chi2 statistical method and segmented spectral fitting of low-energy and high-energy observational data from HXMT-GECAM, the dependence of photon survival probability on ALP mass (ma) and coupling strength (ga) is analyzed. Results show that for the ALP mass range 10^-7 &lt; ma &lt; 10^2 neV, the upper limit on the coupling strength is ga &lt; 0.27 * 10^-11 GeV^-1, improving constraints by one order of magnitude compared to the CAST experiment (6.6 * 10^-11 GeV^-1). Notably, high-energy data exhibit significantly stronger constraining power. This work provides a novel theoretical framework and observational basis for indirectly probing ALPs through extreme astrophysical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Cosmic rays, gas and dust in the Central Molecular Zone I -- $X_{CO}$ factors, cosmic-ray densities and dust opacities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our goal is to estimate the total gas mass in the direction of the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ), quantify the various uncertainties associated, and discuss the implications for the estimates of CR energy densities and dust opacities. The $H_{\rm{I}}$ 21 cm line and the carbon monoxide isotopes ($^{12}\rm{CO}$, $^{13}\rm{CO}$ and $\rm{C}^{18}\rm{O}$) line emission maps are used to derive the total gas column density. The gas in the CMZ is separated from the disk contribution in position and velocity thanks to its different properties in term of velocity dispersion and brightness ratio of CO isotopes. The variations of the $X_{\rm{CO}}$ factors are modelled relying on both theoretical trends from simulations and empirical corrections. We use the new gas column density estimated together with gamma-ray and dust emission measurements to derive the CR energy density and dust opacities, respectively. The $X_{\rm{CO}}$ values in the CMZ range from $(0.32 - 1.37) \ \times$ $10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ km$^{-1}$ s, with a distribution that is highly asymmetric and skewed. The median value is $ \rm{\overline{X}_{CO}^{CMZ}} = 0.39 \ \times$ $10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ km$^{-1}$ s. The total gas mass in the CMZ is estimated to be $2.3_{-0.3}^{+0.3}\times10^{7} \; \rm{M_{\odot}}$ with $\sim 10 \%$ contribution from the atomic phase. Without removing the disk contamination the total mass is about twice higher, and the atomic gas fraction increases to $\sim30\%$. The cosmic-ray (CR) energy density in the CMZ, assuming a 1/r profile, is higher by a factor of two compared to the previous calculations at TeV energies. Using molecular gas tracers which probes only the densest molecular cores leads to an overestimation of the CR energy density, while ignoring the foreground/background contribution leads to an underestimation of the CR energy density in the CMZ.</description>

      <title>Probing the general axion-nucleon interaction in water Cherenkov experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an axion flux on Earth consistent with emission from the Supernova explosion SN 1987A. Using Chiral Perturbation Theory augmented with an axion, we calculate the energy spectrum of $a + N \to N + \gamma$ as well as $a + N \to N + \pi^0$, where $N$ denotes a nucleon in a water tank, such as the one planned for the Hyper-Kamiokande neutrino detection facility. Our calculations assume the most general axion-quark interactions, with couplings constrained either solely by experimental data, or by specific theory scenarios.
  We find that even for the QCD axion -- whose interaction strength with matter is at its weakest as compared with axion-like particles -- the expected \v{C}herenkov-light spectrum from neutrino-nucleon interactions is modified in a potentially detectable way. Furthermore, detectability appears significantly more promising for the $N + \pi^0$ final state, as its spectrum peaks an order of magnitude higher and at energies twice as large compared to the $N + \gamma$ counterpart. Given the rarity of SN events where both the neutrino and the hypothetical axion burst are detectable, we emphasize the importance of identifying additional mechanisms that could enhance such signals.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Monopoles and Exotic States in $SU(4)_c \times SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the Pati-Salam gauge symmetry $SU(4)_c \times SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$ (4-2-2, for short), the observed quarks and leptons of each family reside in the bi-fundamental representations $(4,2,1)$ and $({\bar 4},1,2)$. There exist, however, the fundamental representations $(4,1,1)$, $(1,2,1)$ and $(1,1,2)$ and their hermitian conjugates, which show the presence, in principle, of yet to be discovered color triplets that carry electric charge $\pm{e/6}$, and color singlet particles with charges of $\pm{e/2}$. These Standard Model charges are in full accord with the fact that the 4-2-2 model predicts the presence of a topologically stable finite energy magnetic monopole that carries two quanta of Dirac magnetic charge, i.e., $4 \pi/e$, as well as color magnetic charge that is screened beyond the quark confinement scale. The 4-2-2 model therefore predicts the existence of exotic baryons, mesons and leptons that carry fractional ($\pm{e/2}$) electric charges. Since their origin lies in the fundamental representations of 4-2-2, these exotic particles may turn out to be relatively light, in the TeV mass range or so. The 4-2-2 magnetic monopole mass depends on the 4-2-2 symmetry breaking scale which may be as low as a few TeV.</description>

      <title>Environmental Effects on Hubble Constant Measurements from Gravitational Wave Observations: A Case Study of the GW190514-GW190521 Hierarchical Triple Merger inside AGN J124942.3+344929</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of environmental effects on the measurement of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) from gravitational wave (GW) observations of binary black hole mergers residing in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) near the central supermassive black hole. Using the potential hierarchical triple merger candidate GW190514-GW190521 in AGN J124942.3+344929 with its electromagnetic counterpart ZTF19abanrhr as a multimessenger case study, we demonstrate that environmental effects can be negligible for mergers at approximately tens to hundreds of Schwarzschild radii from the supermassive black hole. We find $H_0=40.9_{-8.9}^{+19.3}\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$ (median and 68\% credible interval) under a flat prior and flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Incorporating GW170817 prior information improves constraints to $H_0=68.8_{-6.0}^{+7.7}\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$. We suggest that in general, AGN environments could serve as viable laboratories for cosmological studies from GW observations where environmental effects remain below detection thresholds.</description>

      <title>Future Collider Measurements for Cosmic Ray Induced Air Shower Modelling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The identification of gamma-ray induced air showers with Cherenkov telescopes suffers from contamination with a specific class of cosmic ray induced air showers. The predictions for this background show strong discrepancies between the available event generators. In this study, we identify collision events of cosmic rays with atmospheric nuclei in which a large fraction of the original beam energy is transmitted to the electromagnetic part of the shower as the main source for this background. Consequently, we define a pseudorapidity region of interest for hadron collider experiments that corresponds to this background, taking into account the center-of-mass energy. This region of interest is compared with the available datasets and the pseudorapidity coverage of the detectors that recorded it. We find that the LHCf and RHICf detectors are the only ones covering substantial parts of this region of interest and suggest a measurement of the energy spectra of reconstructed neutral pions to be made with this data. Such results could serve as valuable constraints for a future parameter tuning of the event generators to improve the background estimation uncertainties for gamma-ray induced air shower identification.</description>

      <title>Fast Radio Bursts and Electromagnetic Transition Radiation on Gravitational Shockwaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When a gravitational shockwave hits a magnetar it creates perturbations of the magnetar magnetic field in a form of a transition radiation. We argue that this radiation can be a novel candidate to explain the origin of fast radio bursts (FRB). A unique feature of the transition radiation on the shockwaves is that normal components of its Maxwell strength `remember' only the spatial `profile' of the shock, not the form of the signal. This fact allows us to determine completely a characteristic initial problem for the perturbations with Cauchy data defined on a null hypersurface just behind the shockwave front. The computations are carried by modeling magnetar as a magnetic dipole. As an illustration we consider shockwaves created by ultrarelativistic objects of two types, by compact sources or by cosmic strings. In the both cases the duration of the engine pulse is determined by an impact distance between the magnetar and the source. We present the angular distribution of the transition radiation flux and show that it is consistent with properties of the FRB engine.</description>

      <title>Superheavy Supersymmetric Dark Matter for the origin of KM3NeT Ultra-High Energy signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an explanation for the recently reported ultra-high-energy neutrino signal at KM3NeT, which lacks an identifiable astrophysical source. While decaying dark matter in the Galactic Center is a natural candidate, the observed arrival direction strongly suggests an extragalactic origin. We introduce a multicomponent dark matter scenario in which the components are part of a supermultiplet, with supersymmetry ensuring a nearly degenerate mass spectrum among the fields. This setup allows a heavy component to decay into a lighter one, producing a boosted neutrino spectrum with energy $E_\nu \sim 100$ PeV, determined by the mass difference. The heavy-to-light decay occurs at a cosmological redshift of $z \sim \text{a few}$ or higher, leading to an isotropic directional distribution of the signal.</description>

      <title>Generalized relativistic second-order dissipative hydrodynamics: coupling different rank tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we extend the formalism of second-order relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics, developed previously using Zubarev's non-equilibrium statistical operator formalism. By employing a second-order expansion of the statistical operator in terms of hydrodynamic gradients, we demonstrate that new second-order terms emerge due to the coupling of two-point quantum correlators between tensors of differing ranks, evaluated at distinct space-time points. Such terms arise because the presence of the acceleration vector in the system allows Curie's theorem, which governs symmetry constraints, to be extended for constructing invariants from tensors of different ranks evaluated at distinct space-time points. The new terms are identified in the context of a complete set of second-order equations governing the shear-stress tensor, bulk-viscous pressure, and charge-diffusion currents for a generic quantum system characterized by the energy-momentum tensor and multiple conserved charges. Additionally, we identify the transport coefficients associated with these new terms and derive the Kubo formulas expressing the second-order transport coefficients through two- and three-point correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Systematic bias in dark siren statistical methods and its impact on Hubble constant measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of the multimessenger cosmology marked by the detection of GW170817, gravitational waves from compact objects at cosmological distances demonstrated Standard Sirens as a relevant cosmological probe. In the absence of an electromagnetic counterpart identification, GWs carry valuable information through the dark siren approach, where the source redshift is estimated using galaxy catalogs of potential hosts within the localization volume. However, the dark siren analysis can be affected by galaxy catalog incompleteness at the limits of gravitational-wave detectability, potentially introducing biases in the constraints on cosmological parameters. Focusing on GWs from binary black holes detected by the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA collaboration, we explore the possible systematic biases in the measurement of the Hubble constant. These biases may arise from 1) the incompleteness of catalogs due to the apparent magnitude thresholds of optical telescope sensitivity, and 2) the use of incorrect weighting schemes (using star formation or stellar mass as tracers of the host galaxy) for each potential host. We found that an unbiased estimate of $H_0$ can be obtained when the corrected weighting scheme is applied to a complete or volume-limited catalog. The results using stellar mass as a tracer indicate that a percent-level measurement of $H_0$, with a precision of approximately 3%, can be achieved with 100 binary black hole detections by the LVK at O4 and O5 sensitivity. The O5 run provides a slight improvement, reducing the $H_0$ uncertainty by 0.07 km/s/Mpc compared to the O4-like configuration. This precision is achievable by using a complete galaxy catalog that covers the 90% of the localisation probability for each GW detection, with A$_{90\%}$&lt;10 deg$^2$. The $H_0$ precision increases to approximately 6% when it is assumed that every galaxy has an equal probability of being the host.</description>

      <title>Role of the $\delta$ Meson in the Equation of State an Direct Urca Cooling of Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The direct Urca (dUrca) process is a key mechanism driving rapid neutrino cooling in neutron stars, with its baryon density activation threshold determined by the microscopic model for nuclear matter. Understanding how nuclear interactions shape the dUrca threshold is essential for interpreting neutron star thermal evolution, particularly in light of recent studies on exceptionally cold objects. We investigate the impact of incorporating the scalar isovector $\delta$ meson into the neutron star equation of state, which alters the internal proton fraction and consequently affects the dUrca cooling threshold. Since proton superfluidity is known to suppress dUrca rates, we also examine the interplay between the nuclear interaction mediated by the $\delta$ meson and the $^1S_0$ proton pairing gap. We perform a Bayesian analysis using models built within a relativistic mean-field approximation, incorporating constraints from astrophysical observations, nuclear experiments, and known results of \textit{ab initio} calculations of pure neutron matter. We then impose a constraint on the dUrca threshold based on studies of fast-cooling neutron stars. The inclusion of $\delta$ meson expands the range of possible internal compositions, directly influencing the stellar mass required for the central density to reach the dUrca threshold. Furthermore, we observe that the observation of relatively young and cold neutron stars provides insights into $^1S_0$ proton superfluidity in the core of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Multimodality in the search for new physics in pulsar timing data and the case of kination-amplified gravitational-wave background from inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the kination-amplified inflationary gravitational-wave background (GWB) interpretation of the signal recently reported by various pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments. Kination is a post-inflationary phase in the expansion history dominated by the kinetic energy of some scalar field, characterized by a stiff equation of state $w=1$. Within the inflationary GWB model, we identify two modes which can fit the current data sets (NANOGrav and EPTA) with equal likelihood: the kination-amplification (KA) mode and the ordinary, non-kination-amplification (no-KA) mode. The multimodality of the likelihood motivates a Bayesian analysis with nested sampling. We analyze the free spectra of current PTA data and mock free spectra constructed with higher signal-to-noise ratios, using nested sampling. The analysis of the mock spectrum designed to be consistent with the best fit to the NANOGrav 15 yr (NG15) data successfully reveals the expected bimodal posterior for the first time while excluding the reheating mode that appears in the fit to the current NG15 data, making a case for our correct treatment of potential multimodal posteriors arising from future PTA data sets. The resultant Bayes factor is $B\equiv Z_\mathrm{no-KA}/Z_\mathrm{KA}=2.9\pm1.9$, indicating comparable statistical significance between the two modes. Given the theoretical model-building challenges of producing highly blue-tilted primordial tensor spectra, the KA mode has the advantage of requiring a less blue primordial spectrum, compared with the no-KA mode. The synergy between future cosmic microwave background polarization, pulsar timing and laser interferometer measurements of gravitational waves will help resolve the ambiguity implied by the multimodal posterior in PTA-only searches.</description>

      <title>Probing Hadron-quark Transition Through Binary Neutron Star Merger</title>

Abstract: The cores of massive neutron stars offer a unique environment for the nuclear matter at intermediate density in the universe. The global characteristics of a neutron star, as well as the gravitational waves emitted from the mergers of two neutron stars, offer valuable insights into dense nuclear matter. In this paper, we comprehensively investigate the effect of the potential hadron-quark transition on the properties of neutron stars and the signals of the gravitational waves stemming from the merger of binary neutron stars, including waveforms, frequency evolutions as well as the spectrum curves, utilizing the equations of state constructed from the Maxwell ansatz, Gibbs ansatz and, the crossover scenario. We explicitly construct the equations of state in such a way that they converge at low and high densities therefore the differences are only from the scenarios of the transitions and the locations -- or the parameters in the equation of state. Using such constructed equations of state, we simulate the signals of the gravitational wave (GW) and analyze their differences due to locations of the transition, the scenarios of the transition, and the masses of the component stars. We find that (1) in both the Maxwell ansatz and Gibbs ansatz, GW signals are sensitive to the location and the latent heat of the phase transition, (2) in the post-merger phase, the frequency of GW increases with the evolution in Maxwell type transition but is stable in the other two types of transitions and, (3) the amount of radiated energy is the biggest in Gibbs construction (GC) type transition and the smallest in the crossover construction (CC) type transition. By combining our findings with the expected detection of gravitational waves around $(2$-$4)$ kHz from binary neutron star mergers and their associated electromagnetic signals, we expect to uncover some key characteristics of dense nuclear matter.</description>

      <title>First Search for High-Energy Neutrino Emission from Galaxy Mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exact sources of high-energy neutrinos detected by the IceCube neutrino observatory still remain a mystery. For the first time, this work explores the hypothesis that galaxy mergers may serve as sources for these high-energy neutrinos. Galaxy mergers can host very high-energy hadronic and photohadronic processes, which may produce very high-energy neutrinos. We perform an unbinned maximum-likelihood-ratio analysis utilizing the galaxy merger data from six catalogs and 10 years of public IceCube muon-track data to quantify any correlation between these mergers and neutrino events. First, we perform the single source search analysis, which reveals that none of the considered galaxy mergers exhibit a statistically significant correlation with high-energy neutrino events detected by IceCube. Furthermore, we conduct a stacking analysis with three different weighting schemes to understand if these galaxy mergers can contribute significantly to the diffuse flux of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos detected by IceCube. We find that upper limits (at $95\%$ CL) of the all flavor high-energy neutrino flux, associated with galaxy mergers considered in this study, at $100$ TeV with spectral index $\Gamma=-2$ are $1.11\times 10^{-18}$, $3.69 \times 10^{-19}$ and $1.02 \times 10^{-18}$ $\rm GeV^{-1}\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}\,sr^{-1}$ for the three weighting schemes. This work shows that these selected galaxy mergers do not contribute significantly to the IceCube detected high energy neutrino flux. We hope that in the near future with more data, the search for neutrinos from galaxy mergers can either discover their neutrino production or impose more stringent constraints on the production mechanism of high-energy neutrinos within galaxy mergers.</description>

      <title>High-energy Neutrino Source Cross-correlations with Nearest-neighbor Distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The astrophysical origins of the majority of the IceCube neutrinos remain unknown. Effectively characterizing the spatial distribution of the neutrino samples and associating the events with astrophysical source catalogs can be challenging given the large atmospheric neutrino background and underlying non-Gaussian spatial features in the neutrino and source samples. In this paper, we investigate a framework for identifying and statistically evaluating the cross-correlations between IceCube data and an astrophysical source catalog based on the $k$-nearest-neighbor cumulative distribution functions ($k$NN-CDFs). We propose a maximum likelihood estimation procedure for inferring the true proportions of astrophysical neutrinos in the point-source data. We conduct a statistical power analysis of an associated likelihood ratio test with estimations of its sensitivity and discovery potential with synthetic neutrino data samples and a WISE-2MASS galaxy sample. We apply the method to IceCube's public ten-year point-source data and find no statistically significant evidence for spatial cross-correlations with the selected galaxy sample. We discuss possible extensions to the current method and explore the method's potential to identify the cross-correlation signals in data sets with different sample sizes.</description>

      <title>XTE J1814-338: A potential hybrid star candidate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18498v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent analysis on the properties of the XTE J1814-338 pulsar yielded a small radius value around ~ 7 km. Notably, this estimation is significantly lower compared to the currently inferred values for the radius of neutron stars (as they are derived from both theoretical calculations and corresponding observations). In this paper, we focus on the construction of hybrid equations of state (EOSs) for the possible reconciliation of the exotic XTE J1814-338 properties. Our analysis indicates that an equation of state involving a sufficiently strong phase transition could potentially lead to the explanation of the size and mass of such a compact object. By examining the sign of the $dM/dP_c$ slope, we found that stellar configurations compatible to XTE J1814-338 are only stable for a "stiff" low density phase. For a "soft" hadronic EOS selection the stability of the resulting configurations may not be satisfied in terms of the turning point criterion. However, a complementary analysis, for the radial oscillations of the aforementioned configurations, indicated their stability when a slow phase conversion is considered.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Vera C. Rubin Observatory Cadence Selections on Kilonova Detectability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of the optical/infra-red counterpart (AT2017gfo) to the binary neutron star gravitational-wave detection (GW170817), which was followed by a short gamma-ray burst (GRB170817), marked a groundbreaking moment in multi-messenger astronomy. To date, it remains the only confirmed joint detection of its kind. However, many experiments are actively searching for similar fast-fading electromagnetic counterparts, known as kilonovae. Fortunately, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) provides excellent prospects for identifying kilonova candidates either from, or independent of, gravitational-wave and gamma-ray burst triggers. Cadence choices for LSST surveys are especially important for maximising the likelihood of kilonovae detections. In this work, we explore the possibility of optimizing Rubin Observatory's ability to detect kilonovae by implementing a fast transient metric shown to be successful with an existing wide field survey, e.g. the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). We study existing LSST cadences, how detection rates are affected by filter selections, the return timescales for visits of the same area in the sky, and other relevant factors. Through our analysis, we have found that employing baseline cadences and utilizing triplet families like presto gap produced the highest likelihood of kilonova detection.</description>

Abstract: We perform fully relativistic simulations of the head-on collisions between intermediate-mass black holes and very massive stars. Such collisions are expected to occur in dense stellar clusters and may play an important role in growing the mass of the seed black hole. For the cases considered here, for which the masses of the black holes and stars are comparable, the vast majority of the stellar material is accreted onto the black hole within a stellar dynamical timescale, as expected from analytical estimates, and leads to a rapid growth of the black hole. A small amount of mass, which is shock-heated in the wake of the black hole, is ejected from the collision and will contribute to the interstellar material in the cluster.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14471v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the KM3NeT Collaboration announced the detection of a 220 PeV neutrino from the celestial coordinates RA=94.3\degree~ and Dec=-7.8\degree~ on 13 February 2023 at 01:16:47 UTC \cite{KM3NeT:2025npi}. The source for this extra-ordinary cosmic neutrino, designated KM3-230213A, is not identified yet but there has been speculation that it might be associated with a gamma-ray burst GRB~090401B \cite{Amelino-Camelia:2025lqn}. The purpose of this report is to search the association of this 220 PeV neutrino with potential GRB sources from a more general consideration of Lorentz invariance violation (LV) without predefined LV scale. We try to associate this extra-ordinary neutrino with potential GRBs within angular separation of 1\degree, 3\degree~ and 5\degree~ respectively and the results are listed in Table 1. We find the constraints $E_{\rm{LV}}\leq 5.3\times 10^{18}$~GeV for subluminal LV violation and $E_{\rm{LV}}\leq 5.6\times 10^{19}$~GeV for superluminal LV violation if KM3-230213A is a GRB neutrino.</description>

Abstract: Electromagnetic fields surrounding pulsars may source coherent ultralight axion signals at the known rotational frequencies of the neutron stars, which can be detected by laboratory experiments (e.g., pulsarscopes). As a promising case study, we model axion emission from the well-studied Crab pulsar, which would yield a prominent signal at $f \approx 29.6$ Hz regardless of whether the axion contributes to the dark matter abundance. We estimate the relevant sensitivity of future axion dark matter detection experiments such as DMRadio-GUT, Dark SRF, and CASPEr, assuming different magnetosphere models to bracket the uncertainty in astrophysical modeling. For example, depending on final experimental parameters, the Dark SRF experiment could probe axions with any mass $m_a \ll 10^{-13}$ eV down to $g_{a\gamma\gamma} \sim 3 \times 10^{-13}$ GeV$^{-1}$ with one year of data and assuming the vacuum magnetosphere model. These projected sensitivities may be degraded depending on the extent to which the magnetosphere is screened by charge-filled plasma. The promise of pulsar-sourced axions as a clean target for direct detection experiments motivates dedicated simulations of axion production in pulsar magnetospheres.</description>

      <title>Validating Prior-informed Fisher-matrix Analyses against GWTC Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16103v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fisher-matrix methods are widely used to predict how accurately parameters can be estimated. Being computationally efficient, this approach is prompted by the large number of signals simulated in forecast studies for future gravitational-wave (GW) detectors, for which adequate analysis tools and computational resources are still unavailable to the scientific community. However, approximating the full likelihood function with a Gaussian may lead to inaccuracies, which we investigate in this work. To assess the accuracy of the Fisher approximation, we compare the results of the Fisher code GWFish against real data from the Gravitational Wave Transient Catalogs (GWTCs) provided by the Virgo/LIGO Bayesian analyses. Additionally, we present a sampling algorithm to include priors in GWFish, not only to ensure a fair comparison between GWFish results and the Virgo/LIGO posteriors but also to investigate the role of prior information and to assess the need to include it in standard Fisher analyses. We find that the impact of priors depends mostly on the level of signal-dependent degeneracy of the waveform parameterization, and priors are generally more important when the level of degeneracy is high. Our findings imply that Fisher-matrix methods are a valid tool for ET science-case studies.</description>

      <title>Efficient Massive Black Hole Binary parameter estimation for LISA using Sequential Neural Likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00565v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inspiral, merger, and ringdown of Massive Black Hole Binaries (MBHBs) is one the main sources of Gravitational Waves (GWs) for the future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), an ESA-led mission in the implementation phase. It is expected that LISA will detect these systems throughout the entire observable universe. Robust and efficient data analysis algorithms are necessary to detect and estimate physical parameters for these systems. In this work, we explore the application of Sequential Neural Likelihood, a simulation-based inference algorithm, to detect and characterize MBHB GW signals in synthetic LISA data. We describe in detail the different elements of the method, their performance and possible alternatives that can be used to enhance the performance. Instead of sampling from the conventional likelihood function, which requires a forward simulation for each evaluation, this method constructs a surrogate likelihood that is ultimately described by a neural network trained from a dataset of simulations of the MBHB signals and noise. One important advantage of this method is that, given that the likelihood is independent of the priors, we can iteratively train models that target specific observations in a fraction of the time and computational cost that other traditional and machine learning-based strategies would require. Because of the iterative nature of the method, we are able to train models to obtain qualitatively similar posteriors with less than 2\% of the simulator calls that Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods would require. We compare these posteriors with those obtained from Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques and discuss the differences that appear, in particular in relation with the important role that data compression has in the modular implementation of the method that we present. We also discuss different strategies to improve the performance of the algorithms.</description>

      <title>New high-precision measurement system for electron-positron pairs from sub-GeV/GeV gamma-rays in the emulsion telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The GRAINE project observes cosmic gamma-rays, using a balloon-borne emulsion-film-based telescope in the sub-GeV/GeV energy band. We reported in our previous balloon experiment in 2018, GRAINE2018, the detection of the known brightest source, Vela pulsar, with the highest angular resolution ever reported in an energy range of $&gt;$80 MeV. However, the emulsion scanning system used in the experiment was designed to achieve a high-speed scanning, and it was not accurate enough to ensure the optimum spacial resolution of the emulsion film and limited the performance. Here, we report a new high-precision scanning system that can be used to greatly improve the observation result of GRAINE2018 and also be employed in future experiments. The system involves a new algorithm that recognizes each silver grain on an emulsion film and is capable of measuring tracks with a positional resolution for the passing points of tracks of almost the same as the intrinsic resolution of nuclear emulsion film ($\sim$70 nm). This resolution is approximately one order of magnitude smaller than that obtained with the high-speed scanning system. With this system, an angular resolution for gamma-rays of 0.1$^\circ$ at 1 GeV is expected to be achieved. Furthermore, we successfully combine the new high-precision system with the existing high-speed system, establishing the system to make a high-speed and high-precision measurement. Employing these systems, we reanalyze the gamma-ray events detected previously by only the high-speed system in GRAINE2018 and obtain an about three times higher angular resolution (0.22$^\circ$) in 500--700 MeV than the original value. The high-resolution observation may bring new insights into the gamma-ray emission from the Galactic center region and may realize polarization measurements of high-energy cosmic gamma-rays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08308v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider trajectories of massless particles in the presence of charged black holes in asymptotically AdS spacetimes in arbitrary dimensions. We study the properties of the photon ring in the (near-)extremal limit and show that the photon ring can probe the near-horizon region in two different scenarios: in high enough number of spacetime dimensions or when the massless particle carries an electric charge. We propose a simple $\mathrm{i} \epsilon$-prescription for implementing the JWKB approximation and show its utility in various contexts. We calculate the quasi-normal modes for charged fields in the eikonal limit and show the emergence of a new time-scale of relaxation in the dual field theory side. In the near-extremal limit, we show generally that the time-scale of decay of the perturbations is governed by the chemical potential. We also verify our analytical results numerically. The $\mathrm{i} \epsilon$-prescription allows us to study the superradiant modes and the associated instabilities in the eikonal limit easily. We comment on some related aspects regarding near-extremal black holes.</description>

      <title>Multicomponent Fermi systems at low densities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate, to second order in the scattering length between two fermions, the Landau quasiparticle interaction for a low-density mixture of two fermion species with unequal densities at temperature zero. From the Landau parameters we evaluate the energy density and find agreement with the result of Kanno, Prog. Theor. Phys. 44, 813 (1970). The calculations are then extended to the case of two fermion components with different total densities, each with two spin components, a situation of interest in nuclear physics and astrophysics, where the species are neutrons and protons. An interesting finding is that, for low proton concentrations, $x \ll 1$, the leading term in the energy density, beyond the $x^{5/3}$ contribution from the kinetic energy and the $x^2$ one due to the two-body interaction in the mean-field approximation, varies as $x^{7/3} \ln x$. This is to be contrasted with the higher powers of $x$ implicit in many phenomenological energy-density functionals employed in nuclear physics, such as those of the Skyrme type.</description>

      <title>Resonance Locking of Anharmonic $g$-Modes in Coalescing Neutron Star Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars in coalescing binaries deform due to the tidal gravitational fields generated by their companions. During the inspiral phase, the tidal deformation is dominated by the fundamental oscillation ($f$-) mode of the stars. The tide also has sub-dominant gravity ($g$-) modes that are resonantly excited when the linear tidal forcing sweeps through their eigenfrequencies. Beyond the linear order in perturbed fluid displacement, the $g$-modes are anharmonic, i.e., their oscillation frequencies depend on the mode energy. For the lowest-order $g$-mode, we show that when the tidal forcing reaches its linear eigenfrequency, the mode starts to dynamically adjust its energy so that its nonlinearly shifted oscillation frequency always matches that of the driving field. This phenomenon, which we term `resonance locking', persists through the rest of the inspiral, and hence, the mode grows to substantially larger energies than in the linear theory. Using a $1.4$--$1.4\, M_{\odot}$ binary neutron star system with the SLy4 equation of state, we find this results in an extra correction to the frequency-domain gravitational wave (GW) phase of $|\Delta \Psi|\approx 3\,{\rm rad}$ accumulated from the onset of resonance locking at the GW frequency of $94\,{\rm Hz}$ to the merger at $1.05\,{\rm kHz}$. This effect probes details of the internal structure of merging neutron stars beyond their bulk properties such as tidal deformability.</description>

      <title>CP violation in cold dense quark matter and axion effects on the non-radial oscillations of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17828v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Charge-conjugation and parity violation in strong interaction for cold dense quark matter is studied with axions of quantum chromodynamic within the three flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model that includes the coupling of axions to quarks. We first calculate the effective potential for axions at finite baryon density and zero temperature including the effects of a first order chiral phase transition. Using the equation of state for quark matter with axions and a hadronic matter equation of state in the ambit of a relativistic mean field theory in quantum hadrodynamics, we discuss the hadron-quark phase transition. Inclusion of axions reduces the critical density for chiral transition. We use a Gibbs construct for the hadron-quark phase transition satisfying the constraints of beta equilibrium and charge neutrality as appropriate for the neutron star matter. The equation of state so obtained is used to investigate the structure of hybrid neutron stars. It is found that with the presence of axions, it is possible to have stable hybrid neutron stars having an inner core of quark matter both in pure quark matter phase as well as in a mixed phase with hyperonic matter along with a outer core of hyperonic matter and is in agreement with modern astrophysical constraints. We also discuss the properties of non-radial oscillations of such hybrid neutron stars. It is observed that the quadrupolar fundamental modes ($f$-modes) for such hybrid neutron stars get substantial enhancements both due to a larger quark core in the presence of axions and from the hyperons as compared to a canonical nucleonic neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Decoding Long-duration Gravitational Waves from Binary Neutron Stars with Machine Learning: Parameter Estimation and Equations of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) from binary neutron stars (BNSs) offer valuable understanding of the nature of compact objects and hadronic matter. However, their analysis requires substantial computational resources due to the challenges in Bayesian stochastic sampling. The third-generation (3G) GW detectors are expected to detect BNS signals with significantly increased signal duration, detection rates, and signal strength, leading to a major computational burden in the 3G era. We demonstrate a machine learning-based workflow capable of producing source parameter estimation and constraints on equations of state (EOSs) for hours-long BNS signals in seconds with minimal hardware costs. We employ efficient compressions on the GW data and EOS using neural networks, based on which we build normalizing flows for inferences. Given that full Bayesian analysis is prohibitively time-intensive, we validate our model against (semi-)analytical predictions. Additionally, we estimate the computational demands of BNS signal analysis in the 3G era, showing that the machine learning methods will be crucial for future catalog-level analysis.</description>

      <title>Cherenkov emission by a fast-moving uncharged Schwarzschild black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02811v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that in the presence of an external magnetic field, an uncharged classical Schwarzschild black hole moving superluminally in a dielectric with permittivity $\epsilon &gt; 1$ produces Cherenkov emission. This is a new physical effect: classical (non-quantum) emission of electromagnetic waves by a completely charge-neutral ``particle''. The governing equations (involving General Relativity, electromagnetism, and the physics of continuous media) have no external electromagnetic source - it is the distortion of the initial electromagnetic fields by the gravity of the black hole that plays the role of a superluminally moving source. The effect relies on nonzero values of both the magnetic field and the gravitational radius, as well as on the usual Cherenkov condition on the velocity, $v/c &gt; 1/\sqrt{\epsilon}$. Unlike Cherenkov emission by a point charge, the effective source in this case is spatially distributed, with emission generated along the single Cherenkov emission cone. The emitted spectrum is red-dominated, with power $\propto dk_z /|k_z|$ for wave numbers $|k_z| \leq 1/R_G$, where $R_G$ is the Schwarzschild radius. We comment on possible observability of this process during black hole -- neutron star mergers.</description>

      <title>Cryoscope: A Cryogenic Infrared Survey Telescope in Antarctica</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Cryoscope--a new 50 deg$^2$ field-of-view, 1.2 m aperture, $K_{dark}$ survey telescope to be located at Dome C, Antarctica. Cryoscope has an innovative optical-thermal design wherein the entire telescope is cryogenically cooled. Cryoscope also explores new detector technology to cost-effectively tile the full focal plane. Leveraging the dark Antarctic sky and minimizing telescope thermal emission, Cryoscope achieves unprecedented deep, wide, fast and red observations, matching and exceeding volumetric survey speeds from the Ultraviolet Explorer, Vera Rubin Observatory, Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, SPHEREx, and NEO Surveyor. By providing coverage beyond wavelengths of 2 $\mu$m, we aim to create the most comprehensive dynamic movie of the most obscured reaches of the Universe. Cryoscope will be a dedicated discovery engine for electromagnetic emission from coalescing compact binaries, Earth-like exoplanets orbiting cold stars, and multiple facets of time-domain, stellar and solar system science. In this paper, we describe the scientific drivers and technical innovations for this new discovery engine operating in the $K_{dark}$ passband, why we choose to deploy it in Antarctica, and the status of a fifth-scale prototype designed as a Pathfinder to retire technological risks prior to full-scale implementation. We plan to deploy the Cryoscope Pathfinder to Dome C in December 2026 and the full-scale telescope by 2030.</description>
