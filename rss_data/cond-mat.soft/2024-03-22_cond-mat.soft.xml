      <title>Experimental Investigation of an Incremental Contact Model for Hyperelastic Solids Using In-Situ Optical Interferometric Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hyperelastic materials would contribute to the intricacies of rough surface contact, primarily due to the heightened nonlinearity caused by stress concentration. In our previous research, an incremental contact model tailored for hyperelastic materials is proposed and validated by finite element (FEM) simulations. From an experimental perspective, this study employs an in-situ optical interferometric technique to precisely document the actual contact zone between hyperelastic solids and quartz glass. Simultaneously, the contact force is meticulously recorded in sync by a force sensor positioned beneath the hyperelastic samples. Comparing with the predictions of incremental contact model for hyperelastic materials, a significant agreement becomes evident, almost in a range of nearly complete contact. Its significance extends to practical domains such as sealing mechanisms, leakage prevention, and structural integrity, offering valuable insights for these applications.</description>

      <title>Complex Dynamics of an Acoustically Levitated Fluid Droplet Captured by a Low-Order Immersed Boundary Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel immersed boundary method that implements acoustic perturbation theory to model an acoustically levitated droplet. Instead of resolving sound waves numerically, our hybrid method solves acoustic scattering semi-analytically and models the corresponding time-averaged acoustic forces on the droplet. This framework allows the droplet to be simulated on inertial timescales of interest, and thereby admit a much larger time resolution than traditional compressible flow solvers. To benchmark this technique and demonstrate its utility, we implement the hybrid IBM for a single droplet in a standing wave. Simulated droplet shape deformations and streaming profile agree with theoretical predictions. Our simulations also yield new insights on the streaming profiles for elliptical droplets, for which a comprehensive analytic solution does not exist.</description>

      <title>Temperature dependence of micelle shape transitions in copolymer solutions: the role of inter-block incompatibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of the transition between worm-like and spherical micelles in block copolymer dispersions varies between systems. In some formulations, heating drives a transition from worms to spheres, while in other systems the same transition is induced by cooling. In addition, a sphere-worm interconversion can be accompanied either by an increase or a decrease in the solvation of the core, even if the direction of the temperature dependence is the same. Here, self-consistent field theory is used to provide a potential explanation of this range of behaviour. Specifically, we show that, within this model, the dependence of the transition on the incompatibility $\chi_{BS}$ of the solvophobic block B and the solvent S (the parameter most closely related to the temperature) is strongly influenced by the incompatibility $\chi_{AB}$ between B and the solvophilic block A. When $\chi_{AB}$ is small ($\chi_{AB}\le 0.1$), it is found that increasing $\chi_{BS}$ produces a transition from worm-like micelles to spheres (or, more generally, from less curved to more curved structures). When $\chi_{AB}$ is above 0.1, increasing $\chi_{BS}$ drives the system from spheres to worm-like micelles. Whether a transition is observed within a realistic range of $\chi_{BS}$ is also found to depend on the fraction of solvophilic material in the copolymer. The relevance of our calculations to experimental results is discussed, and we suggest that the direction of the temperature dependence may be controlled not only by the solution behaviour of the solvophobic block (upper critical solution temperature versus lower critical solution temperature) but also by $\chi_{AB}$.</description>

      <title>Tilt or twist-competing synclinic and anticlinic interactions in SmC phases of bent-core mesogens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent liquid-crystalline (LC) research is focused on structurally new molecular systems distinct from simple nematic or smectic phases. Sophisticated molecular shape may reveal structural complexity, combining helicity and polarity. Achiral symmetry-breaking in bent-core molecules leads to propensity for synclinic and anticlinic molecular structures within consecutive smectic layers. Moreover, despite their achiral character, dimers readily adopt helical phases. In our study, we investigated a hybrid molecular structure incorporating both characteristics, namely a rigid-bent core and an attached bulky polar group via a flexible spacer. To perform phase identification, we enriched the standard experimental methods with the sophisticated resonant soft x-ray scattering. Notably, we have observed a distinct preference for specific phase types depending on the length of the homologue. Longer homologues exhibit a predisposition towards the formation of tilted smectic phases, characterized by complex sequences of synclinic and anticlinic interfaces. Conversely, shorter homologues manifest a propensity for helical smectic structures. For intermediate homologues, the frustration is alleviated through the formation of several modulated smectic phases. Based on the presented research, we describe the preconditions for high level structures in relation with conflicting constraints.</description>

      <title>Healing Regimes for Microscopic Wounds in the Vertex Model of Cell Tissues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wounds in epithelial tissues compromise their vital role in homeostasis. A rapid and efficient wound healing encompasses different mechanisms, which includes the formation of a contractile actin-myosin cable around its edge, known as the purse-string mechanism. We combine mean-field calculations and numerical simulations of the Vertex model to study the interplay between tissue properties and the purse-string mechanism and its impact on the healing process. We find different regimes, where the wound opens, closes partially or completely. We also derive an analytic expression for the closure time which is validated by numerical simulations. This study establishes under which conditions the purse-string mechanism suffices for closure, providing an analytical mean-field expression for the respective thresholds.</description>

      <title>Triboelectrically mediated self-assembly and manipulation of drops at an interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fluid-fluid interface is a complex environment for a floating object where the statics and dynamics may be governed by capillarity, gravity, inertia, and other external body forces. Yet, the alignment of these forces in intricate ways might result in beautiful pattern formation and self-assembly of these objects, as in the case of bubble rafts or colloidal particles. While interfacial self-assembly has been explored widely, controlled manipulation of floating objects, e.g. drops, at the fluid-fluid interface still remains a challenge largely unexplored. In this work, we reveal the self-assembly and manipulation of water drops floating at an oil-air interface. We show that the assembly occurs due to electrostatic interactions between the drops and their environment. We highlight the role of the boundary surrounding the system by showing that even drops with a net zero electric charge can self-assemble under certain conditions. Using experiments and theory, we show that the depth of the oil bath plays an important role in setting the distance between the self-assembled drops. Furthermore, we demonstrate ways to manipulate the drops actively and passively at the interface.</description>

      <title>A two-dimensional vertex model for curvy cell-cell interfaces at the subcellular scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-sections of cell shapes in a tissue monolayer typically resemble a tiling of convex polygons. Yet, examples exist where the polygons are not convex with curved cell-cell interfaces, as seen in the adaxial epidermis. To date, two-dimensional vertex models predicting the structure and mechanics of cell monolayers have been mostly limited to convex polygons. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a framework to study curvy cell-cell interfaces at the subcellular scale within vertex models by using a parameterized curve between vertices that is expanded in a Fourier series and whose coefficients represent additional degrees of freedom. This extension to non-convex polygons allows for cells with same shape index, or dimensionless perimeter, to be, for example, either elongated or globular with lobes. In the presence of applied, anisotropic stresses, we find that local, subcellular curvature, or buckling, can be energetically more favorable than larger scale deformations involving groups of cells. Inspired by recent experiments, we also find that local, subcellular curvature at cell-cell interfaces emerges in a group of cells in response to the swelling of additional cells surrounding the group. Our framework, therefore, can account for a wider array of multi-cellular responses to constraints in the tissue environment.</description>

      <title>Local vs. Cooperative: Unraveling Glass Transition Mechanisms with SEER</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.05150v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Which phenomenon slows down the dynamics in super-cooled liquids and turns them into glasses is a long-standing question of condensed-matter. Most popular theories posit that as the temperature decreases, many events must occur in a coordinated fashion on a growing length scale for relaxation to occur. Instead, other approaches consider that local barriers associated with the elementary rearrangement of a few particles or `excitations' govern the dynamics. To resolve this conundrum, our central result is to introduce an algorithm, SEER, which can systematically extract hundreds of excitations and their energy from any given configuration. We also provide a novel measurement of the activation energy, characterizing the liquid dynamics, based on fast quenching and reheating. We use these two methods in a popular liquid model of polydisperse particles. Such polydisperse models are known to capture the hallmarks of the glass transition and can be equilibrated efficiently up to millisecond time scales. The analysis reveals that cooperative effects do not control the fragility of such liquids: the change of energy of local barriers determines the change of activation energy. More generally, these methods can now be used to measure the degree of cooperativity of any liquid model.</description>

      <title>Timed material self-assembly controlled by circadian clock proteins</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.00779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active biological molecules present a powerful, yet largely untapped, opportunity to impart autonomous regulation to materials. Because these systems can function robustly to regulate when and where chemical reactions occur, they have the ability to bring complex, life-like behavior to synthetic materials. Here, we achieve this design feat by using functionalized circadian clock proteins, KaiB and KaiC, to engineer time-dependent crosslinking of colloids. The resulting material self-assembles with programmable kinetics, producing macroscopic changes in material properties, via molecular assembly of KaiB-KaiC complexes. We show that colloid crosslinking depends strictly on the phosphorylation state of KaiC, with kinetics that are synced with KaiB-KaiC complexing. Our microscopic image analyses and computational models indicate that the stability of colloidal super-structures depends sensitively on the number of Kai complexes per colloid connection. Consistent with our model predictions, a high concentration stabilizes the material against dissolution after a robust self-assembly phase, while a low concentration allows circadian oscillation of material structure. This work introduces the concept of harnessing biological timers to control synthetic materials; and, more generally, opens the door to using protein-based reaction networks to endow synthetic systems with life-like functional properties.</description>

      <title>A smart granular intruder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been recently reported that irregular objects sink irregularly when released in a granular medium: a subtle lack of symmetry in the density or shape of a macroscopic object may produce a large tilting and deviation from the vertical path when released from the free surface of a granular bed. This can be inconvenient -- even catastrophic -- in scenarios ranging from buildings to space rovers. Here, we take advantage of the high sensitivity of granular intruders to shape asymmetry: we introduce a granular intruder equipped with an inflatable bladder that protrudes from the intruder's surface as an autonomous response to an unwanted tilting. So, the intruder's symmetry is only slightly manipulated, resulting in the rectification of the undesired tilting. Our smart intruder is even able to rectify its settling path when perturbed by an external element, like a vertical wall. The general concept introduced here can be potentially expanded to real-life scenarios, such as ``smart foundations'' to mitigate the inclination of constructions on a partially fluidized soil.</description>

      <title>Statistical modeling of equilibrium phase transition in confined fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The phase transition of confined fluids in mesoporous materials deviates from that of bulk fluids due to the interactions with the surrounding heterogeneous structure. For example, adsorbed fluids in metal-organic-frameworks (MOFs) have atypical phase characteristics such as capillary condensation and higher-order phase transitions due to a strong heterogeneous field. Considering a many-body problem in the presence of a nonuniform external field, we model the host-guest and guest-guest interactions in MOFs. To solve the three-dimensional Ising model, we use the mean-field theory to approximate the guest-guest interactions and Mayer's f-functions to describe the host-guest interactions in a unit cell. Later, using Hill's theory of nanothermodynamics, we define differential thermodynamic functions to understand the distribution of intensive properties and integral thermodynamic functions to explain the phase transition in confined fluids. The investigation reveals a distinct behavior where fluids confined in larger pores undergo a discontinuous (first-order) phase transition, whereas those confined in smaller pores experience a continuous (higher-order) phase transition. Furthermore, the results indicate that the free-energy barrier for phase transitions is lower in confined fluids than in bulk fluids giving rise to a lower condensation pressure relative to the bulk saturation pressure. Finally, the integral thermodynamic functions are succinctly presented in the form of a phase diagram, marking an initial step toward a more practical approach for understanding the phase behavior of confined fluids.</description>

      <title>Pulsed interactions unify reaction-diffusion and spatial nonlocal models for biological pattern formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of a spatially-organized population distribution depends on the dynamics of the population and mediators of interaction (activators and inhibitors). Two broad classes of models have been used to investigate when and how self-organization is triggered, namely, reaction-diffusion and spatially nonlocal models. Nevertheless, these models implicitly assume smooth propagation scenarios, neglecting that individuals many times interact by exchanging short and abrupt pulses of the mediating substance. A recently proposed framework advances in the direction of properly accounting for these short-scale fluctuations by applying a coarse-graining procedure on the pulse dynamics. In this paper, we generalize the coarse-graining procedure and apply the extended formalism to new scenarios in which mediators influence individuals' reproductive success or their motility. We show that, in the slow- and fast-mediator limits, pulsed interactions recover, respectively, the reaction-diffusion and nonlocal models, providing a mechanistic connection between them. Furthermore, at each limit, the spatial stability condition is qualitatively different, leading to a timescale-induced transition where spatial patterns emerge as mediator dynamics becomes sufficiently fast.</description>
