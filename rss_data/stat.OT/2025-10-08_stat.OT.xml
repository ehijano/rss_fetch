      <title>Bridging the Gap Between Methodological Research and Statistical Practice: Toward "Translational Simulation Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulations are valuable tools for empirically evaluating the properties of statistical methods and are primarily employed in methodological research to draw general conclusions about methods. In addition, they can often be useful to applied statisticians, who may rely on published simulation results to select an appropriate statistical method for their application. However, on the one hand, applying published simulation results directly to practical settings is frequently challenging, as the scenarios considered in methodological studies rarely align closely enough with the characteristics of specific real-world applications to be truly informative. Applied statisticians, on the other hand, may struggle to construct their own simulations or to adapt methodological research to better reflect their specific data due to time constraints and limited programming expertise. We propose bridging this gap between methodological research and statistical practice through a translational approach by developing dedicated software along with simulation studies, which should abstract away the coding-intensive aspects of running simulations while still offering sufficient flexibility in parameter selection to meet the needs of applied statisticians. We demonstrate this approach using two practical examples, illustrating that the concept of translational simulation can be implemented in practice in different ways. In the first example - simulation-based evaluation of power in two-arm randomized clinical trials with an ordinal endpoint - the solution we discuss is a Shiny web application providing a graphical user interface for running informative simulations in this context. For the second example - assessing the impact of measurement error in multivariable regression - a less labor-intensive approach is suggested, involving the provision of user-friendly, well-structured, and modular analysis code.</description>

      <title>Missing Data Imputation in the Context of Propensity Score Analysis: A Systematic Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Missing data is a common challenge in observational studies. Another challenge stems from the observational nature of the study itself. Here, propensity score analysis can be used as a technique to replicate conditions similar to those found in clinical trials. With regard to the missing data, a majority of studies only analyze the complete cases, but this has several pitfalls. In this review, we investigate which methods are used for the handling of missing data in the context of propensity score analyses. Therefore, we searched PubMed for the keywords propensity score and missing data, restricting our search to the time between January 2010 and February 2024. The PRISMA statement was followed in this review. A total of 147 articles were included in the analyses. A major finding of this study is that although the usage of multiple imputation (MI) has risen over time, only a limited number of studies describe the mechanism of missing data and the details of the MI algorithm.
