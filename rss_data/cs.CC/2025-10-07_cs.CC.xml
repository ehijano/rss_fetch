      <title>Finding a HIST: Chordality, Structural Parameters, and Diameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A homeomorphically irreducible spanning tree (HIST) is a spanning tree with no degree-2 vertices, serving as a structurally minimal backbone of a graph. While the existence of HISTs has been widely studied from a structural perspective, the algorithmic complexity of finding them remains less understood. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive investigation of the HIST problem from both structural and algorithmic viewpoints. We present a simple characterization that precisely describes which chordal graphs of diameter at most~3 admit a HIST, leading to a polynomial-time decision procedure for this class. In contrast, we show that the problem is NP-complete for strongly chordal graphs of diameter~4. From the perspective of parameterized complexity, we establish that the HIST problem is W[1]-hard when parameterized by clique-width, indicating that the problem is unlikely to be efficiently solvable in general dense graphs. On the other hand, we present fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithms when parameterized by treewidth, modular-width, or cluster vertex deletion number. Specifically, we develop an $O^*(4^{k})$-time algorithm parameterized by modular-width~$k$, and an FPT algorithm parameterized by the cluster vertex deletion number based on kernelization techniques that bound clique sizes while preserving the existence of a HIST. These results together provide a clearer understanding of the structural and computational boundaries of the HIST problem.</description>

      <title>Counting Triangulations of Fixed Cardinal Degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fixed set of vertices in the plane may have multiple planar straight-line triangulations in which the degree of each vertex is the same. As such, the degree information does not completely determine the triangulation. We show that even if we know, for each vertex, the number of neighbors in each of the four cardinal directions, the triangulation is not completely determined. In fact, we show that counting such triangulations is #P-hard via a reduction from #3-regular bipartite planar vertex cover.</description>

      <title>A Subquadratic Two-Party Communication Protocol for Minimum Cost Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the maximum flow problem in the two-party communication model, where two parties, each holding a subset of edges on a common vertex set, aim to compute the maximum flow of the union graph with minimal communication. We show that this can be solved with $\tilde{O}(n^{1.5})$ bits of communication, improving upon the trivial $\tilde{O}(n^2)$ bound.
  To achieve this, we derive two additional, more general results:
  1. We present a randomized algorithm for linear programs with two-sided constraints that requires $\tilde{O}(n^{1.5}k)$ bits of communication when each constraint has at most $k$ non-zeros. This result improves upon the prior work by [Ghadiri, Lee, Padmanabhan, Swartworth, Woodruff, Ye, STOC'24], which achieves a complexity of $\tilde{O}(n^2)$ bits for LPs with one-sided constraints. Upon more precise analysis, their algorithm can reach a bit complexity of $\tilde{O}(n^{1.5} + nk)$ for one-sided constraint LPs. Nevertheless, for sparse matrices, our approach matches this complexity while extending the scope to two-sided constraints.
  2. Leveraging this result, we demonstrate that the minimum cost flow problem, as a special case of solving linear programs with two-sided constraints and as a general case of maximum flow problem, can also be solved with a communication complexity of $\tilde{O}(n^{1.5})$ bits.
  These results are achieved by adapting an interior-point method (IPM)-based algorithm for solving LPs with two-sided constraints in the sequential setting by [van den Brand, Lee, Liu, Saranurak, Sidford, Song, Wang, STOC'21] to the two-party communication model. This adaptation utilizes techniques developed by [Ghadiri, Lee, Padmanabhan, Swartworth, Woodruff, Ye, STOC'24] for distributed convex optimization.</description>

      <title>The power of quantum circuits in sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give new evidence that quantum circuits are substantially more powerful than classical circuits. We show, relative to a random oracle, that polynomial-size quantum circuits can sample distributions that subexponential-size classical circuits cannot approximate even to TV distance $1-o(1)$. Prior work of Aaronson and Arkhipov (2011) showed such a separation for the case of exact sampling (i.e. TV distance $0$), but separations for approximate sampling were only known for uniform algorithms.
  A key ingredient in our proof is a new hardness amplification lemma for the classical query complexity of the Yamakawa-Zhandry (2022) search problem. We show that the probability that any family of query algorithms collectively finds $k$ distinct solutions decays exponentially in $k$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G=F\ast_\varphi t$ be an HNN extension of a free group $F$ with two equal associated normal subgroups $H_1 = H_2$ of finite index. We prove that the word problem in $G$ is decidable in polynomial time. This result extends to the case where the subgroups $H_1=H_2$ are not normal, provided that the isomorphism $\varphi:H_1\to H_2$ satisfies an additional condition described in Section 5.</description>

      <title>Proofs of quantum memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advances in quantum computer architectures and the emerging prospect of large-scale quantum memory, it is becoming essential to classically verify that remote devices genuinely allocate the promised quantum memory with specified number of qubits and coherence time. In this paper, we introduce a new concept, proofs of quantum memory (PoQM). A PoQM is an interactive protocol between a classical probabilistic polynomial-time (PPT) verifier and a quantum polynomial-time (QPT) prover over a classical channel where the verifier can verify that the prover has possessed a quantum memory with a certain number of qubits during a specified period of time. PoQM generalize the notion of proofs of quantumness (PoQ) [Brakerski, Christiano, Mahadev, Vazirani, and Vidick, JACM 2021]. Our main contributions are a formal definition of PoQM and its constructions based on hardness of LWE. Specifically, we give two constructions of PoQM. The first is of a four-round and has negligible soundness error under subexponential-hardness of LWE. The second is of a polynomial-round and has inverse-polynomial soundness error under polynomial-hardness of LWE. As a lowerbound of PoQM, we also show that PoQM imply one-way puzzles. Moreover, a certain restricted version of PoQM implies quantum computation classical communication (QCCC) key exchange.</description>

      <title>Multiplicative Turing Ensembles, Pareto's Law, and Creativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study integer-valued multiplicative dynamics driven by i.i.d. prime multipliers and connect their macroscopic statistics to universal codelengths. We introduce the Multiplicative Turing Ensemble (MTE) and show how it arises naturally - though not uniquely - from ensembles of probabilistic Turing machines. Our modeling principle is variational: taking Elias' Omega codelength as an energy and imposing maximum entropy constraints yields a canonical Gibbs prior on integers and, by restriction, on primes. Under mild tail assumptions, this prior induces exponential tails for log-multipliers (up to slowly varying corrections), which in turn generate Pareto tails for additive gaps. We also prove time-average laws for the Omega codelength along MTE trajectories. Empirically, on Debian and PyPI package size datasets, a scaled Omega prior achieves the lowest KL divergence against codelength histograms. Taken together, the theory-data comparison suggests a qualitative split: machine-adapted regimes (Gibbs-aligned, finite first moment) exhibit clean averaging behavior, whereas human-generated complexity appears to sit beyond this regime, with tails heavy enough to produce an unbounded first moment, and therefore no averaging of the same kind.</description>

      <title>Quantum precomputation: parallelizing cascade circuits and the Moore-Nilsson conjecture is false</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parallelization is a major challenge in quantum algorithms due to physical constraints like no-cloning. This is vividly illustrated by the conjecture of Moore and Nilsson from their seminal work on quantum circuit complexity [MN01, announced 1998]: unitaries of a deceptively simple form--controlled-unitary "staircases"--require circuits of minimum depth $\Omega(n)$. If true, this lower bound would represent a major break from classical parallelism and prove a quantum-native analogue of the famous NC $\neq$ P conjecture.
  In this work we settle the Moore-Nilsson conjecture in the negative by compressing all circuits in the class to depth $O(\log n)$, which is the best possible. The parallelizations are exact, ancilla-free, and can be computed in poly($n$) time. We also consider circuits restricted to 2D connectivity, for which we derive compressions of optimal depth $O(\sqrt{n})$.
  More generally, we make progress on the project of quantum parallelization by introducing a quantum blockwise precomputation technique somewhat analogous to the method of Arlazarov, Dini\v{c}, Kronrod, and Farad\v{z}ev [Arl+70] in classical dynamic programming, often called the "Four-Russians method." We apply this technique to more-general "cascade" circuits as well, obtaining for example polynomial depth reductions for staircases of controlled $\log(n)$-qubit unitaries.</description>

      <title>Quantum Cryptography and Hardness of Non-Collapsing Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One-way puzzles (OWPuzzs) introduced by Khurana and Tomer [STOC 2024] are a natural quantum analogue of one-way functions (OWFs), and one of the most fundamental primitives in ''Microcrypt'' where OWFs do not exist but quantum cryptography is possible. OWPuzzs are implied by almost all quantum cryptographic primitives, and imply several important applications such as non-interactive commitments and multi-party computations. A significant goal in the field of quantum cryptography is to base OWPuzzs on plausible assumptions that will not imply OWFs. In this paper, we base OWPuzzs on hardness of non-collapsing measurements. To that end, we introduce a new complexity class, $\mathbf{SampPDQP}$, which is a sampling version of the decision class $\mathbf{PDQP}$ introduced in [Aaronson, Bouland, Fitzsimons, and Lee, ITCS 2016]. We show that if $\mathbf{SampPDQP}$ is hard on average for quantum polynomial time, then OWPuzzs exist. $\mathbf{SampPDQP}$ is the class of sampling problems that can be solved by a classical polynomial-time algorithm that can make a single query to a non-collapsing measurement oracle, which is a ''magical'' oracle that can sample measurement results on quantum states without collapsing the states. Such non-collapsing measurements are highly unphysical operations that should be hard to realize in quantum polynomial-time. We also study upperbounds of the hardness of $\mathbf{SampPDQP}$. We introduce a new primitive, distributional collision-resistant puzzles (dCRPuzzs), which are a natural quantum analogue of distributional collision-resistant hashing [Dubrov and Ishai, STOC 2006]. We show that dCRPuzzs imply average-case hardness of $\mathbf{SampPDQP}$ (and therefore OWPuzzs as well). We also show that two-message honest-statistically-hiding commitments with classical communication and one-shot signatures [Amos, Georgiou, Kiayias, Zhandry, STOC 2020] imply dCRPuzzs.</description>

      <title>Curved Boolean Logic: A Contextual Generalization of Propositional Logic with Algorithmic Consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Curved Boolean Logic (CBL) generalizes propositional logic by allowing local truth assignments that do not extend to a single global valuation, analogous to curvature in geometry. We give equivalent sheaf and exclusivity-graph semantics and a context-aware proof calculus that is conservative in the flat limit. We formalize CBL-SAT and basic complexity (NP-complete in general) and present operational operators (CBL-AC and CBL-CONS) that prune contradictions earlier on classical hardware. We model noise with iid, AR(1)-correlated, and adversarial bounded perturbations and provide permutation-based significance with Benjamini-Hochberg FDR control. A Colab-ready notebook (ancillary files) regenerates all figures and statistics. We position CBL relative to KCBS, CSW, and sheaf frameworks and outline links to SAT/CSP and robustness/adapter stability in large language models.</description>

      <title>Quantum Subgradient Estimation for Conditional Value-at-Risk Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) is a leading tail-risk measure in finance, central to both regulatory and portfolio optimization frameworks. Classical estimation of CVaR and its gradients relies on Monte Carlo simulation, incurring $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ sample complexity to achieve $\epsilon$-accuracy. In this work, we design and analyze a quantum subgradient oracle for CVaR minimization based on amplitude estimation. Via a tripartite proposition, we show that CVaR subgradients can be estimated with $O(1/\epsilon)$ quantum queries, even when the Value-at-Risk (VaR) threshold itself must be estimated. We further quantify the propagation of estimation error from the VaR stage to CVaR gradients and derive convergence rates of stochastic projected subgradient descent using this oracle. Our analysis establishes a near-quadratic improvement in query complexity over classical Monte Carlo. Numerical experiments with simulated quantum circuits confirm the theoretical rates and illustrate robustness to threshold estimation noise. This constitutes the first rigorous complexity analysis of quantum subgradient methods for tail-risk minimization.</description>

      <title>On the Hardness of Learning Regular Expressions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the theoretical significance and wide practical use of regular expressions, the computational complexity of learning them has been largely unexplored. We study the computational hardness of improperly learning regular expressions in the PAC model and with membership queries. We show that PAC learning is hard even under the uniform distribution on the hypercube, and also prove hardness of distribution-free learning with membership queries. Furthermore, if regular expressions are extended with complement or intersection, we establish hardness of learning with membership queries even under the uniform distribution. We emphasize that these results do not follow from existing hardness results for learning DFAs or NFAs, since the descriptive complexity of regular languages can differ exponentially between DFAs, NFAs, and regular expressions.</description>

      <title>A Polynomial Space Lower Bound for Diameter Estimation in Dynamic Streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the space complexity of estimating the diameter of a subset of points in an arbitrary metric space in the dynamic (turnstile) streaming model. The input is given as a stream of updates to a frequency vector $x \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}^n$, where the support of $x$ defines a multiset of points in a fixed metric space $M = ([n], \mathsf{d})$. The goal is to estimate the diameter of this multiset, defined as $\max\{\mathsf{d}(i,j) : x_i, x_j &gt; 0\}$, to a specified approximation factor while using as little space as possible.
  In insertion-only streams, a simple $O(\log n)$-space algorithm achieves a 2-approximation. In sharp contrast to this, we show that in the dynamic streaming model, any algorithm achieving a constant-factor approximation to diameter requires polynomial space. Specifically, we prove that a $c$-approximation to the diameter requires $n^{\Omega(1/c)}$ space. Our lower bound relies on two conceptual contributions: (1) a new connection between dynamic streaming algorithms and linear sketches for {\em scale-invariant} functions, a class that includes diameter estimation, and (2) a connection between linear sketches for diameter and the {\em minrank} of graphs, a notion previously studied in index coding. We complement our lower bound with a nearly matching upper bound, which gives a $c$-approximation to the diameter in general metrics using $n^{O(1/c)}$ space.</description>

      <title>Efficient Quantum Hermite Transform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new primitive for quantum algorithms that implements a discrete Hermite transform efficiently, in time that depends logarithmically in both the dimension and the inverse of the allowable error. This transform, which maps basis states to states whose amplitudes are proportional to the Hermite functions, can be interpreted as the Gaussian analogue of the Fourier transform. Our algorithm is based on a method to exponentially fast forward the evolution of the quantum harmonic oscillator, which significantly improves over prior art. We apply this Hermite transform to give examples of provable quantum query advantage in property testing and learning. In particular, we show how to efficiently test the property of being close to a low- degree in the Hermite basis when inputs are sampled from the Gaussian distribution, and how to solve a Gaussian analogue of the Goldreich-Levin learning task efficiently. We also comment on other potential uses of this transform to simulating time dynamics of quantum systems in the continuum.</description>

      <title>The NPA hierarchy does not always attain the commuting operator value</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that it is undecidable to determine whether the commuting operator value of a nonlocal game is strictly greater than 1/2. As a corollary, there is a boolean constraint system (BCS) game for which the value of the Navascu\'es-Pironio-Ac\'in (NPA) hierarchy does not attain the commuting operator value at any finite level. Our contribution involves establishing a computable mapping from Turing machines to BCS nonlocal games in which the halting property of the machine is encoded as a decision problem for the commuting operator value of the game. Our techniques are algebraic and distinct from those used to establish MIP*=RE.</description>

      <title>Quantum walks through generalized graph composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we generalize the recently-introduced graph composition framework to the non-boolean setting. A quantum algorithm in this framework is represented by a hypergraph, where each hyperedge is adjacent to multiple vertices. The input and output to the quantum algorithm is represented by a set of boundary vertices, and the hyperedges act like switches, connecting the input vertex to the output that the algorithm computes.
  Apart from generalizing the graph composition framework, our new proposed framework unifies the quantum divide and conquer framework, the decision-tree framework, and the unified quantum walk search framework. For the decision trees, we additionally construct a quantum algorithm from an improved weighting scheme in the non-boolean case. For quantum walk search, we show how our techniques naturally allow for amortization of the subroutines' costs. Previous work showed how one can speed up ``detection'' of marked vertices by amortizing the costs of the quantum walk. In this work, we extend these results to the setting of ``finding'' such marked vertices, albeit in some restricted settings.
  Along the way, we provide a novel analysis of irreducible, reversible Markov processes, by linear-algebraically connecting its effective resistance to the random walk operator. This significantly simplifies the algorithmic implementation of the quantum walk search algorithm, achieves an amortization speed-up for quantum walks over Johnson graphs, avoids the need for quantum fast-forwarding, and removes the log-factors from the query complexity statements.</description>

      <title>On Cryptography and Distribution Verification, with Applications to Quantum Advantage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most fundamental problems in the field of hypothesis testing is the identity testing problem: whether samples from some unknown distribution $\mathcal{G}$ are actually from some explicit distribution $\mathcal{D}$. It is known that when the distribution $\mathcal{D}$ has support $[N]$, the optimal sample complexity for the identity testing problem is roughly $O(\sqrt{N})$. However, many distributions of interest, including those which can be sampled efficiently, have exponential support size, and therefore the optimal identity tester also requires exponential samples. In this paper, we bypass this lower bound by considering restricted settings. The above $O(\sqrt{N})$ sample complexity identity tester is constructed so that it is not fooled by any (even inefficiently-sampled) distributions. However, in most applications, the distributions under consideration are efficiently sampleable, and therefore it is enough to consider only identity testers that are not fooled by efficiently-sampled distributions. In that case, we can focus on efficient verification with efficient identity testers. We investigate relations between efficient verifications of classical/quantum distributions and classical/quantum cryptography, and show the following results: (i) Every quantumly samplable distribution is verifiable with a $\mathbf{P^{PP}}$ algorithm. (ii) If one-way functions exist, then no sufficiently random classically samplable distribution is efficiently verifiable. (iii) If one-way functions do not exist, then every classically samplable distribution is efficiently verifiable. (iv) If QEFID pairs exist, then there exists a quantumly samplable distribution which is not efficiently verifiable. (v) If one-way puzzles do not exist, then it is possible to verify sampling-based quantum advantage with a efficient quantum computer.</description>

      <title>$\rm P$ has polynomial-time finite-state verifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09542v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interactive proof systems whose verifiers are constant-space machines have interesting features that do not have counterparts in the better studied case where the verifiers operate under reasonably large space bounds. The language verification power of finite-state verifiers is known to be sensitive to the difference between private and public randomization. These machines also lack the capability of imposing worst-case superlinear bounds on their own runtime, and long interactions with untrustable provers can involve the risk of being fooled to loop forever. We analyze such verifiers under different bounds on the numbers of private and public random bits that they are allowed to use. This separate accounting for the private and public coin budgets as resource functions of the input length provides interesting characterizations of the collections of the associated languages. When the randomness bound is constant, the verifiable class is $\rm NL$ for private-coin machines, but equals just the regular languages when one uses public coins. Increasing the public coin budget while keeping the number of private coins constant augments the power: We show that the set of languages that are verifiable by such machines in expected polynomial time (with an arbitrarily small positive probability of looping) equals the complexity class $\rm P$. This hints that allowing a minuscule probability of looping may add significant power to polynomial-time finite-state automata, since it is still not known whether those machines can verify all of $\rm P$ when required to halt with probability 1, even with no bound on their private coin usage. We also show that logarithmic-space machines which hide a constant number of their coins are limited to verifying the languages in $\rm P$.</description>

      <title>IPS Lower Bounds for Formulas and Sum of ROABPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give new lower bounds for the fragments of the Ideal Proof System (IPS) introduced by Grochow and Pitassi (JACM 2018). The Ideal Proof System is a central topic in algebraic proof complexity developed in the context of Nullstellensatz refutation (Beame, Impagliazzo, Krajicek, Pitassi, Pudlak, FOCS 1994) and simulates Extended Frege efficiently. Our main results are as follows.
  1. mult-IPS_{Lin'}: We prove nearly quadratic-size formula lower bound for multilinear refutation (over the Boolean hypercube) of a variant of the subset-sum axiom polynomial. Extending this, we obtain a nearly matching qualitative statement for a constant degree target polynomial.
  2. IPS_{Lin'}: Over the fields of characteristic zero, we prove exponential-size sum-of-ROABPs lower bound for the refutation of a variant of the subset-sum axiom polynomial. The result also extends over the fields of positive characteristics when the target polynomial is suitably modified. The modification is inspired by the recent results (Hakoniemi, Limaye, Tzameret, STOC 2024 and Behera, Limaye, Ramanathan, Srinivasan, ICALP 2025).
  The mult-IPS_{Lin'} lower bound result is obtained by combining the quadratic-size formula lower bound technique of Kalorkoti (SICOMP 1985) with some additional ideas. The proof technique of IPS_{Lin'} lower bound result is inspired by the recent lower bound result of Chatterjee, Kush, Saraf and Shpilka (CCC 2024).</description>

      <title>Intersection and Union Hierarchies of Deterministic Context-Free Languages and Pumping Lemmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.09383v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the computational complexity of finite intersections and finite unions of deterministic context-free (dcf) languages. Earlier, Wotschke [J. Comput. System Sci. 16 (1978) 456--461] demonstrated that intersections of $(d+1)$ dcf languages are in general more powerful than intersections of $d$ dcf languages for any positive integer $d$ based on the separation result of the intersection hierarchy of Liu and Weiner [Math. Systems Theory 7 (1973) 185--192]. The argument of Liu and Weiner, however, works only on bounded languages of particular forms, and therefore Wotschke's result is not directly extendable to other non-bounded languages. To deal with a wide range of languages for the non-membership to the intersection hierarchy, we circumvent the specialization of their proof technics and devise a new and practical technical tool: two pumping lemmas for finite unions of dcf languages. Since the family of dcf languages is closed under complementation and also under intersection with regular languages, these pumping lemmas help us establish the non-membership relation of languages formed by finite intersections of target languages. We also concern ourselves with a relationship to deterministic limited automata of Hibbard [Inf. Control 11 (1967) 196--238] in this regard.</description>

      <title>Network Satisfaction Problems Solved by k-Consistency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.12871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the problem of deciding for a given finite relation algebra A whether the network satisfaction problem for A can be solved by the k-consistency procedure, for some natural number k, is undecidable. For the important class of finite relation algebras A with a normal representation, however, the decidability of this problem remains open. We show that if A is symmetric and has a flexible atom, then the question whether NSP(A) can be solved by k-consistency, for some natural number k, is decidable (even in polynomial time in the number of atoms of A). This result follows from a more general sufficient condition for the correctness of the k-consistency procedure for finite symmetric relation algebras. In our proof we make use of a result of Alexandr Kazda about finite binary conservative structures.</description>

      <title>Finding d-Cuts in Graphs of Bounded Diameter, Graphs of Bounded Radius and H-Free Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11389v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The d-Cut problem is to decide if a graph has an edge cut such that each vertex has at most d neighbours at the opposite side of the cut. If $d=1$, we obtain the intensively studied Matching Cut problem. The d-Cut problem has been studied as well, but a systematic study for special graph classes was lacking. We initiate such a study and consider classes of bounded diameter, bounded radius and $H$-free graphs. We prove that for all $d\geq 2$, d-Cut is polynomial-time solvable for graphs of diameter 2, $(P_3+P_4)$-free graphs and $P_5$-free graphs. These results extend known results for $d=1$. However, we also prove several NP-hardness results for d-Cut that contrast known polynomial-time results for $d=1$. Our results lead to full dichotomies for bounded diameter and bounded radius and to almost-complete dichotomies for H-free graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a systematic study of "symmetric quantum circuits", a new restricted model of quantum computation that preserves the symmetries of the problems it solves. This model is well-adapted for studying the role of symmetry in quantum speedups, extending a central notion of symmetric computation studied in the classical setting.
  Our results establish that symmetric quantum circuits are fundamentally more powerful than their classical counterparts. First, we give efficient symmetric circuits for key quantum techniques such as amplitude amplification, phase estimation and linear combination of unitaries. In addition, we show how the task of symmetric state preparation can be performed efficiently in several natural cases. Finally, we demonstrate an exponential separation in the symmetric setting for the problem XOR-SAT, which requires exponential-size symmetric classical circuits but can be solved by polynomial-size symmetric quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Reinforced Generation of Combinatorial Structures: Applications to Complexity Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18057v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore whether techniques from AI can help discover new combinatorial structures that improve on known limits on efficient algorithms. Specifically, we use AlphaEvolve (an LLM coding agent) to study two settings:
  a) Average-case hardness for MAX-CUT and MAX-Independent Set: We improve a recent result of Kunisky and Yu to obtain near-optimal upper and (conditional) lower bounds on certification algorithms for MAX-CUT and MAX-Independent Set on random 3- and 4-regular graphs. Our improved lower bounds are obtained by constructing nearly extremal Ramanujan graphs on as many as $163$ nodes, using AlphaEvolve. Additionally, via analytical arguments we strengthen the upper bounds to settle the computational hardness of these questions up to an error in the third decimal place.
  b) Worst-case Hardness of Approximation for MAX-k-CUT: We obtain new inapproximability results, proving that it is NP-hard to approximate MAX-4-CUT and MAX-3-CUT within factors of $0.987$ and $0.9649$ respectively, using AlphaEvolve to discover new gadget reductions. Our MAX-4-CUT result improves upon the SOTA of $0.9883$, and our MAX-3-CUT result improves on the current best gadget-based inapproximability result of $0.9853$, but falls short of improving the SOTA of $16/17$ that relies on a custom PCP, rather than a gadget reduction from "standard" H{\aa}stad-style PCPs.
  A key technical challenge we faced: verifying a candidate construction produced by AlphaEvolve is costly (often requiring exponential time). In both settings above, our results were enabled by using AlphaEvolve itself to evolve the verification procedure to be faster (sometimes by $10,000\times$). We conclude with a discussion of norms by which to assess the assistance from AI in developing proofs.</description>

      <title>Cubic incompleteness: Hilbert's tenth problem begins at degree three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a preliminary result addressing a long-standing open question: Are cubic Diophantine equations undecidable?} We answer in the affirmative. By encoding G\"odel's first incompleteness theorem via a Fibonacc-based G\"oodel numbering and the Zeckendorf representation, we reduce the arithmetic complexity sufficiently to construct an explicit \emph{cubic Diophantine equation} whose solvability is independent of a model provided by \emph{Peano axioms}. We present three results. First, a commonsense argument that relies on an unjustified generalization by necessity. Second, a constructive procedure that, given any Turing machine $M$, produces a cubic polynomial $Q_M(\vec{u}) \in \mathbb{Z}[\vec{u}]$ of total degree at most $3$, such that the equation $Q_M(\vec{u}) = 0$ has a solution in $\mathbb{N}^k$ if and only if $M$ halts on empty input. Third, we formalize a thesis concerning bounds.</description>
