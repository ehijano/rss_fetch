      <title>A scattering theory construction of dynamical solitons in 3d</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the energy critical wave equation in 3 dimensions around a single soliton. We obtain energy boundedness (modulo unstable modes) for the linearised problem. We use this to construct scattering solutions in a neighbourhood of timelike infinity ($i_+$), provided the data on null infinity ($\scri$) decay polynomially. Moreover, the solutions we construct are conormal on a blow-up of Minkowski space. The methods of proof also extend to some energy supercritical modifications of the equation.</description>

      <title>$L^p$-bounds in Safarov pseudo-differential calculus on manifolds with bounded geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a smooth complete Riemannian manifold with bounded geometry $(M,g)$ and a linear connection $\nabla$ on it (not necessarily a metric one), we prove the $L^p$-boundedness of operators belonging to the global pseudo-differential classes $\Psi_{\rho, \delta}^m\left(\Omega^\kappa, \nabla, \tau\right)$ constructed by Safarov. Our result recovers classical Fefferman's theorem, and extends it to the following two situations: $\rho&gt;1/3$ and $\nabla$ symmetric; and $\nabla$ flat with any values of $\rho$ and $\delta$. Moreover, as a consequence of our main result, we obtain boundedness on Sobolev and Besov spaces and some $L^p-L^q$ boundedness. Different examples and applications are presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the direct approach to the semiclassical asymptotics for Bergman projections, developed by Deleporte--Hitrik--Sj\"ostrand for real analytic exponential weights and Hitrik--Stone for smooth exponential weights, to the case of Gevrey weights. We prove that the amplitude of the asymptotic Bergman projection forms a Gevrey symbol whose asymptotic coefficients obey certain Gevrey-type growth rate, and it is constructed by an asymptotic inversion of an explicit Fourier integral operator up to a Gevrey-type small remainder.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inthispaper,werevisitasymptoticstabilityforthetwo-dimensionalincompressibleporous media equation and the Stokes transport system in a periodic channel. It is well-known that a stratified density, which strictly decreases in the vertical direction, is asymptotically stable under sufficiently small and smooth perturbations. We provide improvements in the regularity assumptions on the perturbation and in the convergence rate. Unlike the standard approach for stability analysis relying on linearized equations, we directly address the nonlinear problem by exploiting the energy structure of each system. While it is widely known that the potential energy is a Lyapunov functional in both systems, our key observation is that the second derivative of the potential energy reveals a (degenerate) coercive structure, which arises from the fact that the solution converges to the minimizer of the energy.</description>

      <title>Continuous dependence on data for linear evolution PDEs on the quarter-plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we announce a systematic analysis of continuous dependence on the data in classical spaces for the initial-boundary-value problem of the diffusion equation on the half-line, with data that are not necessarily compatible at the quadrant corner. This is based on a recent approach to rigorously analyzing integral representations derived via the unified transform method of Fokas. No exotic phenomena were discovered in this case, yet our findings appear to be new in the pertinent literature. These results supplement our previous investigations on existence and (non)uniqueness within the framework of well-posedness. The present detailed exposition elucidates the subtleties involved while also demonstrating a generic technique. Applications of the latter to several other IBVPs and PDEs will be reported elsewhere.</description>

      <title>Linearized Boltzmann collision operator for a mixture of monatomic and polyatomic chemically reacting species</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At higher altitudes, for high temperature gases, for instance near space shuttles moving at hypersonic speed, not only mechanical collisions are affecting the gas flow, but also chemical reactions have an impact on such hypersonic flows. In this work we insert chemical reactions, in form of dissociations and recombinations (associations), in an existing model for a mixture of mono- and polyatomic (non-reacting) species. More general chemical reactions, e.g., bimolecular ones, can be obtained by instant combinations of associations and dissociations. The polyatomicity is modelled by a continuous internal energy variable and the evolution of the gas is described by a Boltzmann equation.
  In, e.g., the Chapman-Enskog process - and related half-space problems - the linearized Boltzmann collision operator plays a central role. Here we extend some important properties of the linearized Boltzmann collision operator to the introduced model with chemical reactions. A compactness result, stating that the linearized operator can be decomposed into a sum of a positive multiplication operator - the collision frequency - and a compact integral operator, is proven under reasonable assumptions on the collision kernel. The strategy is to show that the terms of the integral operator are (at least) uniform limits of Hilbert-Schmidt integral operators and therefore also compact operators. Self-adjointness of the linearized operator is a direct consequences. Moreover, bounds on - including coercivity of - the collision frequency are obtained for hard sphere like, as well as hard potentials with cutoff like models. As consequence, Fredholmness, as well as, the domain, of the linearized collision operator are obtained</description>

      <title>Global Solutions to the 3D Half-Wave Maps Equation with Angular Regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The half-wave maps equation is a nonlocal geometric equation arising in the continuum dynamics of Haldane-Shashtry and Calogero-Moser spin systems. In high dimensions $n\geq4$, global wellposedness for data which is small in the critical Besov space $\dot{B}^{n/2}_{2,1}$ is known since the works of Krieger, Sire and Kiesenhofer [13,9]. There is a major obstruction in extending these results to three dimensions due to the loss of the crucial $L^2_tL^\infty_x$ Strichartz estimate. In this work, we make progress on this case by proving that the equation is "weakly" globally well-posed (in the sense of Tao [28]) for initial data which is not only small in $\dot{B}^{3/2}_{2,1}$ but also possesses some angular regularity and weighted decay of derivatives. We use Sterbenz's improved Strichartz estimates in conjunction with certain commuting vector fields to develop trilinear estimates in weighted Strichartz spaces which avoid the use of the $L^2_tL^\infty_x$ endpoint.</description>

      <title>Spectral Analysis of Lattice Schr\"{o}dinger-Type Operators Associated with the Nonstationary Anderson Model and Intermittency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The research explores a high irregularity, commonly referred to as intermittency, of the solution to the non-stationary parabolic Anderson problem: \begin{equation*}
  \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \varkappa \mathcal{L}u(t,x) + \xi_{t}(x)u(t,x) \end{equation*} with the initial condition \(u(0,x) \equiv 1\), where \((t,x) \in [0,\infty)\times \mathbb{Z}^d\). Here, \(\varkappa \mathcal{L}\) denotes a non-local Laplacian, and \(\xi_{t}(x)\) is a correlated white noise potential. The observed irregularity is intricately linked to the upper part of the spectrum of the multiparticle Schr\"{o}dinger equations for the moment functions \(m_p(t,x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_p) = \langle u(t,x_1)u(t,x_2)\cdots u(t,x_p)\rangle\).
  In the first half of the paper, a weak form of intermittency is expressed through moment functions of order $p\geq 3$ and established for a wide class of operators $\varkappa \mathcal{L}$ with a positive-definite correlator $B=B(x))$ of the white noise. In the second half of the paper, the strong intermittency is studied. It relates to the existence of a positive eigenvalue for the lattice Schr\"odinger type operator with the potential $B$. This operator is associated with the second moment $m_2$. Now $B$ is not necessarily positive-definite, but $\sum B(x)\geq 0$.</description>

      <title>A Geometric flow towards hamiltonian stationary submanifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a geometric flow for Lagrangian submanifolds in a K\"ahler manifold that stays in its initial Hamiltonian isotopy class and is a gradient flow for volume. The stationary solutions are the Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangian submanifolds. The flow is not strictly parabolic but it corresponds to a fourth order strictly parabolic scalar equation in the cotangent bundle of the submanifold via Weinstein's Lagrangian neighborhood theorem. For any compact initial Lagrangian immersion, we establish short-time existence, uniqueness, and higher order estimates when the second fundamental forms are uniformly bounded up to time $T$.</description>

      <title>Generalized multiscale finite element method for a nonlinear elastic strain-limiting Cosserat model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For nonlinear Cosserat elasticity, we consider multiscale methods in this paper. In particular, we explore the generalized multiscale finite element method (GMsFEM) to solve an isotropic Cosserat problem with strain-limiting property (ensuring bounded linearized strains even under high stresses). Such strain-limiting Cosserat model can find potential applications in solids and biological fibers. However, Cosserat media with naturally rotational degrees of freedom, nonlinear constitutive relations, high contrast, and heterogeneities may produce challenging multiscale characteristics in the solution, and upscaling by multiscale methods is necessary. Therefore, we utilize the offline and residual-based online (adaptive or uniform) GMsFEM in this context while handling the nonlinearity by Picard iteration. Through various two-dimensional experiments (for perforated, composite, and stochastically heterogeneous media with small and big strain-limiting parameters), our numerical results show the approaches' convergence, efficiency, and robustness. In addition, these results demonstrate that such approaches provide good accuracy, the online GMsFEM gives more accurate solutions than the offline one, and the online adaptive strategy has similar accuracy to the uniform one but with fewer degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Event-triggered Boundary Control of Mixed-autonomy Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Control problems of mixed-autonomy traffic system consisting of both Human-driven Vehicles (HV) and Autonomous Vehicles (AV) have gained increasing attention. This paper is focused on suppressing traffic oscillations of the mixed-autonomy traffic system using boundary control design. The mixed traffic dynamics are described by a 4 x 4 hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDE) which governs propagation of four properties in traffic including density of HV, density of AV, friction between two classes of vehicles from driving interactions, and averaged velocity. We propose event-triggered boundary control design since control signal of traffic light on ramp or varying speed limit cannot be updated in a continuous time fashion. We apply event-triggered mechanism for a PDE backstepping controller and obtain dynamic triggering condition. Lyapunov analysis is conducted to prove the exponential stability of the closed loop system with the event-triggered controller. Numerical simulation demonstrates how car-following spacing of AV affects event-triggering mechanism of control input in mixed-autonomy traffic.</description>

Abstract: We survey Bernstein-type theorems of graphical surfaces in the Euclidean space and the Lorentz-Minkowski space. More specifically, we explain several proofs of the Bernstein theorem for minimal graphs in the Euclidean 3-space. Furthermore, we show the Heinz-type mean curvature estimates for graphs in the Euclidean 3-space and space-like graphs in the Lorentz-Minkowski 3-space. As an application of these estimates, we give Bernstein-type theorems for constant mean curvature graphs in the Euclidean 3-space and constant mean curvature space-like graphs in the Lorentz-Minkowski 3-space, respectively. We also study Bernstein-type results for minimal graphs in the Euclidean 4-space and the Calabi-Bernstein theorem in the Lorentz-Minkowski 3-space.</description>

      <title>Quarklet Characterizations for bivariate Bessel-Potential Spaces on the Unit Square via Tensor Products</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we deduce new characterizations for bivariate Bessel-Potential spaces defined on the unit square via B-spline quarklets. For that purpose in a first step we use univariate boundary adapted quarklets to describe univariate Bessel-Potential spaces on intervals. To obtain the bivariate characterizations a recent result of Hansen and Sickel is applied. It yields that each bivariate Bessel-Potential space on a square can be written as an intersection of function spaces which have a tensor product structure. Hence our main result is a characterization of bivariate Bessel-Potential spaces on squares in terms of quarklets that are tensor products of univariate quarklets on intervals.</description>

Abstract: We improve the classical results by Brenner and Thom\'ee on rational approximations of operator semigroups. In the setting of Hilbert spaces, we introduce a finer regularity scale for initial data, provide sharper stability estimates, and obtain optimal approximation rates. Moreover, we strengthen a result due to Egert-Rozendaal on subdiagonal Pad\'e approximations of operator semigroups. Our approach is direct and based on the theory of the $\mathcal B$- functional calculus developed recently. On the way, we elaborate a new and simple approach to construction of the $\mathcal B$-calculus thus making the paper essentially self-contai</description>

      <title>Breaking consensus in kinetic opinion formation models on graphons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we propose and investigate a strategy to prevent consensus in kinetic models for opinion formation. We consider a large interacting agent system, and assume that agent interactions are driven by compromise as well as self-thinking dynamics and also modulated by an underlying static social network. This network structure is included using so-called graphons, which modulate the interaction frequency in the corresponding kinetic formulation. We then derive the corresponding limiting Fokker Planck equation, and analyze its large time behavior. This microscopic setting serves as a starting point for the proposed control strategy, which steers agents away from mean opinion and is characterised by a suitable penalization depending on the properties of the graphon. We show that this minimalist approach is very effective by analyzing the quasi-stationary solutions mean-field model in a plurality of graphon structures. Several numerical experiments are also provided the show the effectiveness of the approach in preventing the formation of consensus steering the system towards a declustered state.</description>

      <title>On the minimization of the Willmore energy under a constraint on total mean curvature and area</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by a model for lipid bilayer cell membranes, we study the minimization of the Willmore functional in the class of oriented closed surfaces with prescribed total mean curvature, prescribed area, and prescribed genus. Adapting methods previously developed by Keller-Mondino-Rivi\`ere, Bauer-Kuwert, and Ndiaye-Sch\"atzle, we prove existence of smooth minimizers for a large class of constraints. Moreover, we analyze the asymptotic behaviour of the energy profile close to the unit sphere and consider the total mean curvature of axisymmetric surfaces.</description>

      <title>The defocusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with step-like oscillatory initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.03714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.03714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Cauchy problem for the defocusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) equation under the assumption that the solution vanishes as $x \to + \infty$ and approaches an oscillatory plane wave as $x \to -\infty$. We first develop an inverse scattering transform formalism for solutions satisfying such step-like boundary conditions. Using this formalism, we prove that there exists a global solution of the corresponding Cauchy problem and establish a representation for this solution in terms of the solution of a Riemann-Hilbert problem. By performing a steepest descent analysis of this Riemann-Hilbert problem, we identify three asymptotic sectors in the half-plane $t \geq 0$ of the $xt$-plane and derive asymptotic formulas for the solution in each of these sectors. Finally, by restricting the constructed solutions to the half-line $x \geq 0$, we find a class of solutions with asymptotically time-periodic boundary values previously sought for in the context of the NLS half-line problem.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic stability of sharp fronts. I One bound state implies stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.04700v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic stability of the traveling front solutions to nonlinear dispersive equations of Burgers type. Our main example is the Korteweg-de Vries-Burgers (KdVB) equation although the result holds much more generally. Exploiting a modulation of the translation parameter and making an energy estimate we establish our stability criterion that a Schr\"odinger equation in one dimension have exactly one negative eigenvalue so that a rank-one perturbation of the operator can be made positive semi-definite. Counting the number of bound states of the Schr\"odinger equation in one dimension, we find a sufficient condition for stability in terms of Bargmann's integral, which can be interpreted as the distance between the monotonization of the front and a corresponding ideal shock. For the KdVB equation we analytically verify that our stability criterion is met in an open interval of the relative dispersion parameter which includes all monotone fronts. Numerical experiments suggest stability for a larger interval.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of ground states to fractional nonlinear elliptic equations with harmonic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.12068v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the uniqueness of ground states to the following fractional nonlinear elliptic equation with harmonic potential, $$ (-\Delta)^s u+ \left(\omega+|x|^2\right) u=|u|^{p-2}u \quad \mbox{in}\,\, \R^n, $$ where $n \geq 1$, $0&lt;s&lt;1$, $\omega&gt;-\lambda_{1,s}$, $2&lt;p&lt;\frac{2n}{(n-2s)^+}$, $\lambda_{1,s}&gt;0$ is the lowest eigenvalue of $(-\Delta)^s + |x|^2$. The fractional Laplacian $(-\Delta)^s$ is characterized as $\mathcal{F}((-\Delta)^{s}u)(\xi)=|\xi|^{2s} \mathcal{F}(u)(\xi)$ for $\xi \in \R^n$, where $\mathcal{F}$ denotes the Fourier transform. This solves an open question in \cite{SS} concerning the uniqueness of ground states.</description>

      <title>The two-phase problem for harmonic measure in VMO and the chord-arc condition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.14346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Omega^+\subset\mathbb R^{n+1}$ be a bounded $\delta$-Reifenberg flat domain, with $\delta&gt;0$ small enough, possibly with locally infinite surface measure. Assume also that $\Omega^-= \mathbb R^{n+1}\setminus \overline{\Omega^+}$ is an NTA domain as well and denote by $\omega^+$ and $\omega^-$ the respective harmonic measures of $\Omega^+$ and $\Omega^-$ with poles $p^\pm\in\Omega^\pm$. In this paper we show that the condition that $\log\dfrac{d\omega^-}{d\omega^+} \in VMO(\omega^+)$ is equivalent to $\Omega^+$ being a chord-arc domain with inner normal belonging to $VMO(H^n|_{\partial\Omega^+})$.</description>

      <title>Nonuniqueness of generalised weak solutions to the primitive and Prandtl equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.14505v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a convex integration scheme for constructing nonunique weak solutions to the hydrostatic Euler equations (also known as the inviscid primitive equations of oceanic and atmospheric dynamics) in both two and three dimensions. We also develop such a scheme for the construction of nonunique weak solutions to the three-dimensional viscous primitive equations, as well as the two-dimensional Prandtl equations.
  While in [D.W. Boutros, S. Markfelder and E.S. Titi, Calc. Var. Partial Differential Equations, 62 (2023), 219] the classical notion of weak solution to the hydrostatic Euler equations was generalised, we introduce here a further generalisation. For such generalised weak solutions we show the existence and nonuniqueness for a large class of initial data. Moreover, we construct infinitely many examples of generalised weak solutions which do not conserve energy. The barotropic and baroclinic modes of solutions to the hydrostatic Euler equations (which are the average and the fluctuation of the horizontal velocity in the $z$-coordinate, respectively) that are constructed have different regularities.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity and symmetry breaking for supercritical elliptic problems in exterior domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We deal with the following semilinear equation in exterior domains \[-\Delta u + u = a(x)|u|^{p-2}u,\qquad u\in H^1_0({A_R}), \] where ${A_R} := \{x\in\mathbb{R}^N:\, |x|&gt;{R}\}$, $N\ge 3$, $R&gt;0$. Assuming that the weight $a$ is positive and satisfies some symmetry and monotonicity properties, we exhibit a positive solution having the same features as $a$, for values of $p&gt;2$ in a suitable range that includes exponents greater than the standard Sobolev critical one. In the special case of radial weight $a$, our existence result ensures multiplicity of nonradial solutions. We also provide an existence result for supercritical $p$ in nonradial exterior domains.</description>

      <title>On the Dirichlet-to-Neumann Map for the $p$-Laplacian on a Metric Measure Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we construct a Dirichlet-to-Neumann map, from a Besov space of functions, to the dual of this class. The Besov spaces are of functions on the boundary of a bounded, locally compact uniform domain equipped with a doubling measure supporting a $p$-Poincar\'e inequality so that this boundary is also equipped with a Radon measure that has a codimensional relationship with the measure on the domain. We construct this map via the following recipe. We show first that solutions to Dirichlet problem for the $p$-Laplacian on the domain with prescribed boundary data in the Besov space induce an operator that lives in the dual of the Besov space. Conversely, we show that there is a solution, in the homogeneous Newton-Sobolev space, to the Neumann problem for the $p$-Laplacian with the Neumann boundary data given by a continuous linear functional belonging to the dual of the Besov space. We also obtain bounds on its operator norm in terms of the norms of trace and extension operators that relate Newton-Sobolev functions on the domain to Besov functions on the boundary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.07896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The sphere is well-known as the only generic compact shrinker for mean curvature flow (MCF). In this paper, we characterize the generic dynamics of MCFs with a spherical singularity. In terms of the level set flow formulation of MCF, we establish that generically the arrival time function of level set flow with spherical singularity has at most $C^2$ regularity.</description>

      <title>On the effective dynamics of Bose-Fermi mixtures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we describe the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate interacting with a degenerate Fermi gas, at zero temperature. First, we analyze the mean-field approximation of the many-body Schr\"odinger dynamics and prove emergence of a coupled Hartree-type system of equations. We obtain rigorous error control that yields a non-trivial scaling window in which the approximation is meaningful. Second, starting from this Hartree system, we identify a novel scaling regime in which the fermion distribution behaves semi-clasically, but the boson field remains quantum-mechanical; this is one of the main contributions of the present article. In this regime, the bosons are much lighter and more numerous than the fermions. We then prove convergence to a coupled Vlasov-Hartee system of equations with an explicit convergence rate.</description>
