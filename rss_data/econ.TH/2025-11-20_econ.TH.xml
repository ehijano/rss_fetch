      <title>Decisions of Public Goods Game Through the lens of Game Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines public goods and evaluates the mechanism through the game theory. Public goods are characterized by nonexclusivity and nonrivalry and this creates fundamental challenges for allocation. We analyze why competitive markets undersupply public goods by deriving the inefficiency formally through Nash equilibrium. The paper evaluates theoretical solutions including Lindahl pricing, Clarke-Groves mechanisms, and voting schemes. The paper will cover their efficiency properties and practical limitations. We show how strategic interaction leads to free-riding behavior using roommates dilemma and other examples. We also cover why a large household lives in messy conditions not because individuals are lazy, but because they are rational players in a Nash equilibrium. We also examine voting mechanisms, the median voter theorem, and recent developments in truth-revealing mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Good Data and Bad Data: The Welfare Effects of Price Discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how a monopolist's use of consumer data for price discrimination affects welfare. To answer this question, we develop a model of market segmentation subject to residual uncertainty. We fully characterize when data usage monotonically increases or decreases welfare or when the effect is non-monotone. The characterization reduces the problem to one with only two demand curves, and gives a condition for the two-demand-curves case that highlights that information affects welfare in three distinct ways. In the non-monotone case, we provide tight bounds on the welfare effects of information and identify the best local direction for providing additional information.</description>

      <title>Self-Equivalent Voting Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15310v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, I introduce a novel stability axiom for stochastic voting rules, called self-equivalence, by which a society considering whether to replace its voting rule using itself will choose not to do so. I then show that under the unrestricted strict preference domain, a voting rule satisfying the democratic principles of anonymity, optimality, monotonicity, and neutrality is self-equivalent if and only if it assigns to every voter equal probability of being a dictator (i.e., uniform random dictatorship). Thus, any society that desires stability and adheres to the aforementioned democratic principles is bound to either employ the uniform random dictatorship or decide whether to change its voting rule using a voting rule other than itself.</description>

      <title>A Note on Qualified Majority Voting Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19823v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This note characterizes every qualified majority voting rule in environments with just two alternatives through anonymity, responsiveness, and q-neutrality. Crucially, the latter imposes independence of the labels of the alternatives if and only if some alternative is strictly top-ranked by at least q voters. Thus, this note generalizes May's (1952, Theorem, p. 682) characterization of the simple majority voting rule to qualified majority voting rules. In doing so, it shows that qualified majority voting rules are distinguished by their degree of neutrality.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Mediation and Moral Hazard: From Private To Public Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I study how a firm uses mediated communication with a worker and its clients to maximize worker performance over time. I find that optimal mediation initially prescribes private communication and eventually transitions to public communication: it involves occasional randomizations early on, known to the worker but kept secret from clients, between two continuations. In one, the worker cuts corner and then retains his current continuation utility. In the other, the worker exerts effort and then receives the highest continuation equilibrium utility less a minimal penalty for underperformance. These randomizations eventually disappear, replaced by canonical carrot-and-stick incentives.</description>

      <title>Voting power in the Council of the European Union: A comprehensive sensitivity analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16878v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Council of the European Union (EU) is one of the main decision-making bodies of the EU. A number of decisions require a qualified majority, the support of 55% of the member states (currently 15) that represent at least 65% of the total population. We investigate how the power distribution based on the Shapley--Shubik index and the proportion of winning coalitions change if these criteria are modified within reasonable bounds. The power of the two countries with approximately 4% of the total population each is found to be almost flat. The decisiveness index decreases if the population criterion is above 68% or the states criterion is at least 17. Some quota combinations contradict the principles of double majority. The proportion of winning coalitions can be increased from 13.2% to 20.8% (30.1%) such that the maximal relative change in the Shapley--Shubik indices remains below 3.5% (5.5%). Our results are indispensable for evaluating any proposal to reform the qualified majority voting system.</description>

      <title>Stochastically Structured Reservoir Computers for Financial and Economic System Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17115v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a methodology for identifying and simulating financial and economic systems using stochastically structured reservoir computers (SSRCs). The framework combines structure-preserving embeddings with graph-informed coupling matrices to model inter-agent dynamics while enhancing interpretability. A constrained optimization scheme guarantees compliance with both stochastic and structural constraints. Two empirical case studies, a nonlinear stochastic dynamic model and regional inflation network dynamics, demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in capturing complex nonlinear patterns and enabling interpretable predictive analysis under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>The Statistical Fairness-Accuracy Frontier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models must balance accuracy and fairness, but these goals often conflict, particularly when data come from multiple demographic groups. A useful tool for understanding this trade-off is the fairness-accuracy (FA) frontier, which characterizes the set of models that cannot be simultaneously improved in both fairness and accuracy. Prior analyses of the FA frontier provide a full characterization under the assumption of complete knowledge of population distributions -- an unrealistic ideal. We study the FA frontier in the finite-sample regime, showing how it deviates from its population counterpart and quantifying the worst-case gap between them. In particular, we derive minimax-optimal estimators that depend on the designer's knowledge of the covariate distribution. For each estimator, we characterize how finite-sample effects asymmetrically impact each group's risk, and identify optimal sample allocation strategies. Our results transform the FA frontier from a theoretical construct into a practical tool for policymakers and practitioners who must often design algorithms with limited data.</description>
