      <title>Multiple gaps and some finitizations of club and CH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue the development of the theory of capturing schemes over $\omega_1$ by analyzing the relation between the capturing construction schemes (whose existence is implied by Jensen's $\Diamond$-principle) and both the Continuum Hypothesis and Ostaszewski's $\clubsuit$-principle. Formally, we show that the property of being capturing can be viewed as the conjunction of two properties, one of which is implied by $\clubsuit$ and the other one by CH. We apply these principles to construct multiple gaps, entangled sets and metric spaces without uncountable monotone subspaces.</description>

      <title>The $\lambda$-PSP at $\lambda$-coanalytic sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a strong limit cardinal $\lambda$ of countable cofinality, we show that if every $\lambda$-coanalytic subset of the generalised Cantor space ${}^{\lambda}2$ has the $\lambda$-$\mathsf{PSP}$, then there is an inner model with $\lambda$-many measurable cardinals. The paper, a contribution to the ongoing research on generalised regularity properties in generalised descriptive set theory at singular cardinals of countable cofinality, is aimed at descriptive set theorists, and so it presents the main result in small steps, slowly increasing the consistency strength lower bound from the existence of an inner model with a measurable cardinal up to the already mentioned one. For this, the inner model theory and covering properties of the Dodd-Jensen core model, $L[U]$ and Koepke's canonical model are used. By giving as much detail as needed at any step, we intend to provide the community with the necessary tools to deal with consistency strength arguments at the corresponding levels.</description>

      <title>The Schr\"oder-Bernstein property for operators on Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20140v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish that the complete theory of a Hilbert space equipped with a normal operator has the Schr\"oder-Bernstein property. This answers a question of Argoty, Berenstein, and the first-named author. We also prove an analogous statement for unbounded self-adjoint operators.</description>

      <title>A note on one-variable theorems for NSOP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12746v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an example of an SOP theory $T$, such that any $L(M)$-formula $\varphi(x,y)$ with $|y|=1$ is NSOP. We show that any such $T$ must have the independence property. We also give a simplified proof of Lachlan's theorem that if every $L$-formula $\varphi(x,y)$ with $|x|=1$ is NSOP, then $T$ is NSOP.</description>

      <title>Connectedness through decidable quotients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16355v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By looking at decidable quotients, a sufficient condition is provided to guarantee that (1) the full subcategory of decidable objects of a topos is an exponential ideal and that (2) the classical notion of connectedness for an object $X$ coincides with $\Pi X=1$, where $\Pi$ is the left-adjoint functor of the inclusion of the decidable objects.
  The addition of this condition to McLarty's axiomatic set up for Synthetic Differential Geometry makes any topos that satisfies it precohesive over the topos of its decidable objects. A converse is also provided.</description>

      <title>Semantical Analysis of Intuitionistic Modal Logics between CK and IK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00262v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The intuitionistic modal logics considered between Constructive K (CK) and Intuitionistic K (IK) differ in their treatment of the possibility (diamond) connective. It was recently rediscovered that some logics between CK and IK also disagree on their diamond-free fragments, with only some remaining conservative over the standard axiomatisation of intuitionistic modal logic with necessity (box) alone. We show that relational Kripke semantics for CK can be extended with frame conditions for all axioms in the standard axiomatisation of IK, as well as other axioms previously studied. This allows us to answer open questions about the (non-)conservativity of such logics over intuitionistic modal logic without diamond. Our results are formalised using the Coq Proof Assistant.</description>

      <title>Hilbert's tenth problem via additive combinatorics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For all infinite rings $R$ that are finitely generated over $\mathbb{Z}$, we show that Hilbert's tenth problem has a negative answer. This is accomplished by constructing elliptic curves $E$ without rank growth in certain quadratic extensions $L/K$. To achieve such a result unconditionally, our key innovation is to use elliptic curves $E$ with full rational $2$-torsion which allows us to combine techniques from additive combinatorics with $2$-descent.</description>

      <title>Weihrauch problems as containers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We note that Weihrauch problems can be regarded as containers over the category of projective represented spaces and that Weihrauch reductions correspond exactly to container morphisms. We also show that Bauer's extended Weihrauch degrees and the posetal reflection of containers over partition assemblies are equivalent. Using this characterization, we show how a number of operators over Weihrauch degrees, such as the composition product, also arise naturally from the abstract theory of polynomial functors.</description>
