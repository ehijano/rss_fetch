      <title>IR fixed point and low-momentum gluon propagator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assuming the gluon propagator to be finite at $ \alpha_{s} /4\pi \equiv \alpha \rightarrow \alpha_{\ast} $, where $ \alpha_{\ast} = \alpha (0) $, we derive its low-momentum asymptotics. Self-consistency leads to some constraints for the $ \beta $-function and the anomalous dimension of the gluon field.</description>

      <title>Radiative Symmetry Breaking with a Scale Invariant Seesaw</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a scale invariant inverse seesaw model that radiatively generates the electroweak scale, the Standard Model (SM) neutrino masses, and stabilizes the electroweak vacuum. Previous studies have noted that the SM Higgs potential and the electroweak scale can be radiatively generated via the minimal seesaw mechanism. This scenario, called the ``Neutrino Option'', was UV-completed by a scale invariant framework. However, these models predict singlet neutrino and scalar masses at $10^7-10^9$ GeV, beyond any experimental reach and leave the electroweak vacuum meta/un-stable at high energies. In this work, we propose modifications to this framework that lower the singlet neutrino masses to experimentally accessible scales through an inverse seesaw mechanism, while fully stabilizing the electroweak vacuum with an additional singlet scalar. The possibility of generating the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe via leptogenesis is also explored.</description>

      <title>Darkness in the Crust: Searching for the truly "Dark" Subhalos with Paleo-detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-mass dark matter (DM) subhalos are pivotal in understanding the small-scale structure of the universe, thereby offering a sensitive method to discriminate between different cosmological models. In this study, we estimate the local number density of cold DM subhalos in the solar neighborhood, and demonstrate that their sparse distribution makes their detection via direct detection experiments highly improbable. However, it is plausible to expect that an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ number of subhalos could be detected by Paleo-detectors, a proposed new technique to look for DM by reading out damage tracks left by past DM interactions in minerals, due to their extended exposure times. Hence, we explore how Paleo-detectors can serve as effective probes for the properties of low-mass subhalos, $\mathcal{O}(10^{-5}-10^8) M_{\odot}$. We find that Paleo-detectors might be able to constrain certain regions of the subhalo mass-concentration relation (for subhalo masses of $10-10^4 M_\odot$ if DM has a mass of $\sim5$GeV). This is a new and complementary type of study that seeks to combine information from the particle nature of DM to that of small scale structures.</description>

      <title>Weakly supervised anomaly detection with event-level variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new topology for weakly supervised anomaly detection searches, di-object plus~X. In this topology, one looks for a resonance decaying to two standard model particles produced in association with other anomalous event activity (X). This additional activity is used for classification. We demonstrate how anomaly detection techniques which have been developed for di-jet searches focusing on jet substructure anomalies can be applied to event-level anomaly detection in this topology. To robustly capture event-level features of multi-particle kinematics, we employ new physically motivated variables derived from the geometric structure of a collision's phase space manifold. As a proof of concept, we explore the application of this approach to several benchmark signals in the di-$\tau$ plus~X final state. We demonstrate that our anomaly detection approach can reach discovery-level significances for signals that would be missed in a conventional bump-hunt approach.</description>

      <title>The $\beta$-decay spectrum of Tritiated graphene: combining nuclear quantum mechanics with Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of a multi-methodological study aimed at investigating the interaction between graphene and Tritium during its $\beta$-decay to Helium, under different levels of loading and geometrical configurations. We combine Density Functional Theory (DFT), to evaluate the interaction potentials, with calculations of the decay rate, in order to study the consequences that the presence of the substrate has on the $\beta$-decay spectrum of Tritium. We determine the shape of the event rate, accounting for the effects of (part of) the corresponding condensed matter degrees of freedom. In the context of future neutrino experiments, our results provide important information aimed at the optimization of hosting material, as well as the determination of the physics reach. Furthermore, our work outlines a novel theoretical and computational scheme to address a question at the boundary between high and low energy physics. This requires non-conventional declinations of DFT combined with full quantum treatments of the nuclear configuration involved in the decay process.</description>

      <title>Generalized Parton Distributions from Symbolic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI/ML informed Symbolic Regression is the next stage of scientific modeling. We utilize a highly customizable symbolic regression package "PySR" to model the x and t dependence of the flavor isovector combination $H_{u-d}(x,t,\zeta,Q^2)$ at $\zeta=0$ and $Q^2$= 4 GeV$^2$. These PySR models were trained on GPD pseudodata provided by both Lattice QCD and phenomenological sources GGL, GK, and VGG. We demonstrate, for the first time, the consistency and systematic convergence of Symbolic Regression by quantifying the disparate models through their Taylor expansion coefficients. In addition to PySR penalizing models with higher complexity and mean-squared error, we implement schemes that test specific physics hypotheses, including FF$x$ and $t$ dependence and Regge behavior in PySR GPDs. We show that PySR can identify factorizing GPD sources based on their response to the Force-Factorized model. Knowing the precise behavior of the GPDs, and their uncertainties in in a wide range in $x$ and $t$, crucially impacts our ability to concretely and quantitatively predict hadronic spatial distributions and their derived quantities.</description>

      <title>Heavy Quark mass effects in charged-current Deep-Inelastic Scattering at NNLO in the ACOT scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The approximate SACOT-$\chi$ scheme for heavy quark production in deep-inelastic scattering was initially formulated for the neutral current structure functions $F_2$ and $F_L$. We extend this approach to the charged current case (also including $F_3$), and thereby complete the definitions for the most relevant inclusive structure functions. Furthermore, we implement these structure functions in the open-source code $\texttt{APFEL++}$ which provides fast numerical evaluations over a wide kinematic range; this addition to the $\texttt{APFEL++}$ code is publicly available, with details provided in the appendix. This SACOT-$\chi$ implementation enables, for the first time, detailed numerical insights on the mass dependence of the structure functions and cross sections in the $(x,Q^2)$-plane for both neutral and charged current processes. We consider kinematic regions relevant for the experimental measurements from fixed-target $\nu$DIS experiments (NuTeV, CCFR and Chorus) and HERA, and also projections for the upcoming EIC. In particular, the $\nu$DIS experiments reveal a surprisingly strong dependence on the mass effects, offering valuable insights that may help resolve long-standing challenges in accurately describing these datasets.</description>

      <title>Connecting Pre-Thermal and Hydrodynamizing Attractors With Adiabatic Hydrodynamization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The far-from equilibrium dynamics of the pre-hydrodynamic quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formed in heavy ion collisions can be characterized by distinct stages, during each of which the system loses some memory of its initial condition, until only the hydrodynamic modes remain. However, even though it has been repeatedly observed, finding intuitive physical explanations of how and why attractor behavior occurs has remained a challenge. The Adiabatic Hydrodynamization (AH) framework provides exactly such an explanation, showing that the attractor solution can be thought of as the ground state of an analog to quantum mechanical adiabatic evolution, provided we identify appropriate coordinate rescalings. Using the example of a simplified QCD kinetic theory in the small-angle scattering limit, we show how AH can explain both the early pre-hydrodynamic attractor and the later hydrodynamizing attractor in a longitudinally expanding gluon gas in a unified framework. By doing this, we provide a unified description of, and intuition for, all the stages of what in QCD would be bottom-up thermalization, starting from a pre-hydrodynamic attractor and ending with hydrodynamization.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reader surely knows what particles physics is about: finding building blocks of nature that appear elementary at a given time and study their interactions - so why in the world this essay? The problem is how to arrive at a fundamental theory, and maybe even more important, what is the theory supposed to do? I follow here a simple but profound prescription of Feynman for a true, self-contained theory, and then show how the Standard Model beautifully illustrates this prescription. That the issue is not trivial, is clear from the fact that we had theories dominate our field for decades, in spite of completely failing Feynman's requirements and offering no clear predictions whatsoever. I next critically review two unique candidates for a Beyond Standard Model theory: the Left-Right Symmetric theory of electro-weak interactions and the minimal grand unified theory based on SU(5) gauge symmetry. I also comment on some generic aspects of grand unification, and what hope we may have in testing it.</description>

      <title>The Unitarity-Limit Expansion for Two Nucleons with Perturbative Pions: Digest and Ideas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Unitarity Limit, the NN S-wave binding energies are zero, the scattering lengths infinite, Physics is universal, i.e. insensitive to details of the interactions, and observables display richer symmetries, namely invariance under both scaling and Wigner's combined SU(4) transformation of spin and isospin. This presentation is a digest of the first quantitative exploration of corrections to this picture when pions are included [1] (see there for a more comprehensive list of references). Since the pion mass and decay constant introduce dimensionful scales in the NN system, they explicitly break the symmetries of the Unitarity fixed point. In $\chi$EFT, these symmetries must therefore be classified as emergent. This text focuses on the $\chi$EFT variant with Perturbative ("KSW") Pions at next-to-next-to leading order (N2LO). This leads to the Hypothesis that both scale invariance and Wigner-SU(4) symmetry in the Unitarity Expansion show persistence, i.e. the footprint of both combined dominates even for $k\gtrsim m_\pi$ and is more relevant than chiral symmetry, so that the tensor/Wigner-SU(4) symmetry-breaking part of OPE is suppressed and does not enter before N3LO. Included are also ideas about underlying mechanisms and LO results of $\chi$EFT with Nonperturbative Pions in the expansion about Unitarity.</description>

      <title>An analysis on doubly bottom molecular tetraquarks composed of $H_{(s)}$ and $T_{(s)}$ doublets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13431v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the doubly bottom $H_{(s)}\bar{T}_{(s)}$ and $H_{(s)}T_{(s)}$ systems by adopting the one-boson-exchange model, where $H_{(s)}$ and $T_{(s)}$ represent $S$-wave $B^{(*)}_{(s)}$ and $P$-wave $B^{(*)}_{(s)1,2}$ doublets, respectively. For the $H\bar{T}$ systems, we predict some loosely bound states in the $I(J^{PC})=0(1^{-\pm})$ $B\bar{B}_{1}$, $I(J^{PC})=0(2^{--})$ $B\bar{B}_{2}^{*}$, $I(J^{PC})=0(1^{-\pm})$ $B^*\bar{B}_{1}$ and $I(J^{PC})=0(2^{-\pm})$ $B^*\bar{B}_{2}^{*}$ channels, which are the most promising hidden bottom molecular tetraquarks. For the $HT$ systems, the $I(J^{P})=0(1^{-})$ $B^*B_1$ and $I(J^{P})=0(2^{-})$ $B^{*}B^{*}_2$ channels are also likely to form molecular tetraquarks. In contrast, no molecular candidates have been identified in the bottom-strange sectors. One can hope that our predictions will provide valuable insights to the LHCb and Belle II Collaborations as they continue to explore this fascinating field through experimental research.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the electromagnetic structure and intrinsic dynamics of spin-$\frac{3}{2}$ hidden-charm pentaquarks: A comprehensive QCD analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the internal structure of hadrons remains a fundamental challenge in experimental and theoretical hadron physics. This pursuit is crucial for advancing our comprehension of QCD and for refining the models that describe the strong interaction. The discovery of exotic states, such as hidden-charm pentaquarks, has further emphasized the complexity of hadronic systems and the need to uncover the fundamental mechanisms governing their formation and behavior. Addressing these challenges not only deepens our understanding of QCD but also tests the limits of existing theoretical frameworks, paving the way for new insights into the nature of matter. Motivated by these challenges, the present study investigates the electromagnetic properties$-$ specifically, the magnetic dipole, electric quadrupole, and magnetic octupole moments$-$ of six hidden-charm pentaquark states: $[u u][d c] \bar c$, $[dd][u c] \bar c$, $[u u][s c] \bar c$, $[dd] [s c] \bar c$, $[s s][u c] \bar c$, and $[s s][d c] \bar c$. Employing the framework of QCD light-cone sum rules and utilizing two distinct diquark-diquark-antiquark interpolating currents, we focus on pentaquark configurations with spin-parity quantum numbers $\mathrm{J^P =\frac{3}{2}^-}$. From the numerical results, we observe significant deviations between the magnetic dipole moment predictions obtained using different diquark-diquark-antidiquark structures. These results suggest that multiple pentaquark states with identical quantum numbers and quark constituents may exhibit distinct magnetic dipole moments, depending on their internal quark configurations. The obtained electromagnetic moments, particularly the variations in magnetic dipole moments, may provide insights into the internal structure of hidden-charm pentaquark states.</description>

      <title>Q-balls Under Spontaneously Broken U(1) Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the evolution of Q-balls under a spontaneously broken global $U(1)$ symmetry. Q-balls are stabilized by the conservation of $U(1)$ charge, but when the symmetry is spontaneously broken, the resulting Nambu-Goldstone (NG) boson can carry charge away from the Q-ball, potentially leading to charge leakage. To study this process in a controlled setting, we consider a scenario where Q-balls first form under an unbroken $U(1)$ symmetry, which is then spontaneously broken. We introduce two complex scalar fields: one responsible for forming the Q-ball, and the other for spontaneously breaking the $U(1)$ symmetry, allowing us to clearly separate the formation and symmetry-breaking phases. Using numerical simulations in a spherically symmetric system, we find that the evolution of Q-balls depends sensitively on the structure of the interaction between the two fields and the magnitude of symmetry breaking. Depending on parameters, Q-balls can completely decay, evaporate into smaller, stable Q-balls, or transition into oscillons/I-balls. In particular, we find that stable, localized remnants often survive the evolution over long timescales, especially when the symmetry-breaking scale is small. These results demonstrate that, even though spontaneous $U(1)$ breaking can lead to significant energy and charge loss from Q-balls, stable localized objects with reduced or no charge can frequently survive and potentially contribute to cosmological relics.</description>

      <title>Decay rate of PQ-ball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Q-balls are non-topological solitons that arise in theories with a complex scalar field possessing a conserved global U(1) charge. Their stability is ensured by this charge, making them potentially significant in cosmology. In this paper, we investigate Q-ball-like objects in scenarios where the scalar field acquires a finite vacuum expectation value, spontaneously breaking the global U(1) symmetry. A well-motivated example is the Peccei-Quinn field, where the U(1) symmetry is identified as the Peccei-Quinn symmetry, and hence we refer to such objects as PQ-balls. We first discuss the existence of stable PQ-ball solutions in a finite-density plasma and argue that they become unstable in vacuum. Using detailed numerical simulations under spherical symmetry, we confirm their formation, compute their decay rate, and derive an analytical formula for it. Our results have important implications for axion cosmology, particularly in the context of the kinetic misalignment mechanism.</description>

      <title>Towards automatizing Higgs decays in BSM models at one-loop in the decoupling renormalization scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the use of a decoupling renormalization scheme in the calculation of NLO corrections to SM-like Higgs boson decays in the Beyond the Standard Model models. The advantage of this particular scheme is its decoupling property in the presence of a heavy BSM physics and the possibility to directly include known higher order Standard Model corrections. We illustrate the use of this scheme by analysing the $h \to \mu^+ \mu^-$ decay in a simple Standard Model extension by a $S_1$ leptoquark.</description>

      <title>The light-by-light contribution to the muon g-2 within the nonlocal chiral quark model with vector and axial-vector mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hadronic light-by-light contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment is calculated in the framework of a nonlocal quark model with scalar-pseudoscalar and vector-axial-vector channels. The effect of the dressing of internal photons by vector mesons is found to be tiny. As a result, the contribution from the non-strange quark loop is a_{\mu}^{HLbL,Loop}=( 96+-15.4)x10^{-11}. The total value, including meson exchanges and the contribution of strange particles, is a_{\mu}^{HLbL}=( 157+-10.6)x10^{-11}.</description>

      <title>Twist-3 generalized parton distributions of sea quarks at zero skewness in the light-cone quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of twist-3 generalized parton distributions (GPDs) for $\bar{u}$ and $\bar{d}$ sea quarks in the proton at zero skewness ($\xi=0$) using the light-cone formalism with overlap representation. The proton wave functions are derived from a meson-baryon fluctuation model that incorporates $|q\bar{q}B\rangle$ Fock states, providing a natural framework for investigating sea quark contributions. Within this approach, we compute the complete set of twist-3 GPDs and present the numerical results, including both chiral-odd ($H_2$, $E_2$, $\widetilde{E}_2$, $\widetilde{H}_2^\prime$) and chiral-even ($\widetilde{E}_{2T}$, $H_{2T}^\prime$, $E_{2T}^\prime$, $\widetilde{H}_{2T}^\prime$) distributions for $\bar{u}$ and $\bar{d}$ quarks at zero skewness. By taking the forward limit, we also calculate the corresponding twist-3 parton distribution functions $e(x)$ of $\bar{u}$ and $\bar{d}$ quarks. The kinetic orbital angular momenta of sea quarks deduced from the twist-3 GPDs are studied and compared to those from the twist-2 GPDs.</description>

      <title>Next-to-leading-order QCD calculations of $B \to A$ form factors with higher-twist corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Applying the light-cone sum rules (LCSR) approach, the next-to-leading-order (NLO) corrections to $B \to A$ form factors are calculated with the twist-two and twist-three $B$ meson light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) at leading power in $\Lambda / m_b$. At one-loop level, the vacuum-to-$B$-meson correlation functions defined with interpolating currents for the $p$-wave axial-vector meson are factorized into short-distance coefficients and the distribution amplitudes (DAs) of the $B$ meson, among which the hard coefficients for A0-type currents and $\mu$ dependent jet functions entering correlation functions $\Pi_{\mu,\|}^{(T+\tilde{T})}$, $\Pi_{\delta\mu,\perp}^{(V-A)}$ and $\Pi_{\delta\mu,\perp}^{(T+\tilde{T})}$ are identical to the corresponding ones of $B \to V$ in SCET. In addition, $\Pi_{\mu,\|}^{(V-A)}$ and $\Pi_{\mu,\|}^{(T+\tilde{T})}$ coincide with the results of $B\to \pi,K$ under the limit $m_q \to 0$ up to one-loop accuracy. Then the subleading power corrections to $B \to A$ form factors are computed with the higher-twist $B$ meson LCDAs at tree level up to the twist-six accuracy. Furthermore, we predict the $q^2$ dependence of $B \to A$ form factors via the Bourrely-Caprini-Lellouch (BCL) $z$-series expanding parameterization to compute several physical observables including branching ratios of semileptonic $B\to A \ell \bar{\nu}_{\ell} $ and $B\to A \nu_{\ell} \bar{\nu}_{\ell} $ processes, transverse asymmetries, forward-backward asymmetries and lepton flavor universality observables employing the given mixing angles $\theta_K=-34^\circ$, $\theta_{1_{P_1}}=28^\circ$, $\theta_{3_{P_1}}=23^\circ$. We also compare our theory calculations with the results from other methods.</description>

      <title>The experimental observation of $a_0(1710)$: Long awaited from Regge approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the BABAR (in 2021), BESIII (in 2022), and LHCb (in 2023) Collaborations reported the observation of the $a_0(1710)$ resonance. This has sparked a lively debate in the literature about the nature of this possible isospin partner of $f_0(1710)$, since the latter has long been regarded as the main candidate for the lightest glueball. We highlight the clear prediction of $a_0(1710)$ in 2007 within the Regge approach using the observed hydrogen-like degeneracy in the spectrum of light mesons. Our reanalysis of the data used shows that the prediction was reliable and thus indicates that $a_0(1710)$ and $f_0(1710)$ are conventional quark-antiquark states.</description>

      <title>Bubble wall velocity from Kadanoff-Baym equations: fluid dynamics and microscopic interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a first principles, systematic framework for determining the bubble wall velocity during a first order cosmological phase transition. This framework, based on non-local Kadanoff-Baym equations, incorporates both macroscopic fluid dynamics and microscopic interactions between the bubble wall and particles in the plasma. Previous studies have generally focused on one of these two sources of friction pressure that govern the wall velocity. As a precursor, we utilize background field quantum field theory to obtain the relevant local Boltzmann equations, from which we derive the forces associated with variation of particle masses across the bubble wall and the microscopic wall-particle interactions. We subsequently show how these equations emerge from the Kadanoff-Baym framework under various approximations. We apply this framework in the ballistic regime to compute the new friction force arising from the $2\rightarrow 2$ scattering processes in scalar field theory. We obtain a linear relationship between this force and the Lorentz factor $\gamma_w$ that would preclude runaway bubbles with such effects.</description>

      <title>Bubble wall dynamics from nonequilibrium quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the coupled dynamics between the bubble wall and the plasma from first principles using nonequilibrium quantum field theory. The commonly used equation of motion of the bubble wall in the kinetic approach is shown to be incomplete. In the language of the two-particle-irreducible effective action, the conventional equation misses higher-loop terms generated by the condensate-particle type vertices (e.g.,~$\varphi\phi\chi^2$, where $\varphi$ is the background field describing the bubble wall, $\phi$ the corresponding particle excitation and $\chi$ another particle species in the plasma). From the missing terms, we identify an additional dissipative friction which is contributed by particle production processes from the condensate-particle type vertices. We also show how other transmission processes beyond the 1-to-1 elementary transmission studied in the literature for ultrarelativistic bubble walls, e.g., 1-to-1 mixing and 1-to-2 transition radiation, can be understood from the kinetic approach.</description>

      <title>Expected statistical uncertainties at future $e^+e^-$ colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In future colliders, the frontiers of luminosity and energy are extended to explore the physics of elementary particles at extremely high precision, and to discover new phenomena suggested from current experimental anomalies. In this letter, we present a simple method to estimate the expected statistical uncertainties of scattering cross sections at future colliders using their conceptual design reports. In particular, the expected statistical uncertainties of muon pair production cross section at the Future Circular Collider (FCC-ee) and the Circular Electron-Positron Collider (CEPC) are calculated. The results can be used to set a goal for systematic uncertainty improvement, to determine the standard model parameters accurately, and to identify the viable parameter space of new physics models.</description>

      <title>Data-based form factor corrections between the two-pion $\tau$ and $e^+e^-$ spectral functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\tau$ spectral functions are an alternative to $e^+e^-$ cross-sections, where different measurements are not consistent, for computing the hadronic vacuum contribution to the muon magnetic anomaly $a_\mu$. This requires a control of isospin-breaking effects which have to be corrected for. So far these corrections have been evaluated using theoretical models. In this letter, a new approach based only on data is presented for the determination of the most critical correction relating the $e^+e^-$ and $\tau$ pion form factors. An updated evaluation of the total isospin-breaking correction is given and its impact is discussed in the context of $e^+e^-$-based $a_\mu$ predictions and of the direct measurement.</description>

      <title>Extracting the chiral anomaly from $e^+e^-\to 3\pi$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strength of the interaction of three pions and a photon, $F_{3\pi}$ is predicted by the axial anomaly in terms of the pion decay constant, a relation that is frequently used to constrain low-energy radiative processes involving pions, but only tested experimentally at the $10\%$ level. Here, we present a new avenue to test this prediction, via a fit of a dispersive description of the $\gamma^*\to3\pi$ amplitude to data for $e^+e^-\to 3\pi$. From the global fit to SND, CMD-2, and BaBar data we obtain $F_{3\pi}=33.1(1.7)\,\text{GeV}^{-3}$, in agreement with the chiral prediction at the level of $5\%$. We also consider dispersive fits to the recent data by Belle II, in which case we observe tensions with the dispersive constraints, the width parameters of $\omega$ and $\phi$, and the chiral anomaly.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Longitudinal Development of Electromagnetic Air Showers: Analytical Improvements to the Greisen Formalism with Zenith Angle Dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new analytical approach to the longitudinal development of electromagnetic air showers, offering improvements to the classical Greisen formalism. We introduce a novel profile for the slope function $\lambda_1(s)$ that achieves an agreement less than $0.75\%$ with the original $\lambda_1$ for shower age parameter $s$ between $0.3 &lt; s &lt; 1.4$, where $s$ represents the stage of shower development. Our new formalism provides an improved representation of shower evolution, particularly near and beyond the shower maximum. In addition, we derive a complete expression for the number of particles $N(t)$. Our implementation includes the zenithal angle dependence on the number of particles at the detector level at high altitudes, making it particularly useful for high-altitude observatories. This expression is suitable for implementing air shower simulation tool fitting procedures over a wide range of energies and geometries. Our analysis suggests that the proposed new formalism may provide better agreement with the expected evolution of particle numbers compared to the traditional Greisen formulation.</description>

Abstract: In this contribution, we evaluate the sensitivity for particles with charges much smaller than the electron charge with a dedicated scintillator-based detector in the far forward region at the CERN LHC, FORMOSA. This contribution will outline the scientific case for this detector, its design and potential locations, and the sensitivity that can be achieved. The ongoing efforts to prove the feasibility of the detector with the FORMOSA demonstrator will be discussed. Finally, possible upgrades to the detector through the use of high-performance scintillator will be discussed.</description>

      <title>A Model of Realistic Flavour Symmetry: Origin of Fermion Mass, Flavour Mixing and Leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I proposed a unified model of particle physic and cosmology in \cite {1}, which can successfully account for many things of the inflation, dark energy, dark matter, neutrino mass and baryogenesis. Based on the model, I here focus on the fermion flavour issues. I introduce a realistic flavour symmetry to generate the fermion mass and mixing. From the model Lagrangian I derive a neutrino mass matrix with a special structure form and fewer parameters, its numerical solutions are precisely fitting to all the data of the neutrino mass spectrum and lepton mixing, and clearly show a stronger predicting power. In addition, I put forward to a new scenario of the leptogenesis, which is implemented through the two CP-asymmetric decay modes of a superheavy neutral Dirac-fermion, and also I establish its relationship with the neutrino mass and mixing. This mechanism can simply and elegantly account for the baryon asymmetry. In short, the model can address many issues of the fermion flavours, and it is very realistic, believable and measurable instead of an illusory theory, therefore we expect the ongoing and future experiments to test the model.</description>

      <title>Light Scalar Fields Foster Production of Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalar fields are ubiquitous in theories of high-energy physics. In the context of cosmic inflation, this suggests the existence of spectator fields, which provide a subdominant source of energy density. We show that spectator fields boost the inflationary production of primordial black holes, with single-field ultra-slow roll evolution supplanted by a phase of evolution along the spectator direction, and primordial perturbations amplified by the resulting multifield dynamics. This generic mechanism is largely free from the severe fine-tuning that afflicts single-field inflationary PBH models.</description>

      <title>Superheavy Dark Matter from the String Theory Axiverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose heavy axions as a natural superheavy dark matter candidate in string theory, with the relic density of dark matter originating in quantum fluctuations during cosmic inflation. String Theory is well known for the possibility of having tens to hundreds of axion-like particles -- the axiverse. Moduli stabilization generates high-scale masses for many of these, placing them naturally in the superheavy regime of particle physics. We consider moduli stabilization in the KKLT framework, featuring a single volume modulus and $C_4$ axion, and a fiducial inflation model minimally coupled to the volume modulus. We demonstrate that both the volume modulus and the axion can be abundantly produced through gravitational particle production. The former is unstable and readily decays to Standard Model particles while the latter (the axion) can be stable and survives to constitute the present day dark matter.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel way in which effective field theory (EFT) can break down in cosmological string backgrounds depending on the behavior of the quantum gravity cutoff in infinite distance limits, known as the species scale $\Lambda_s$. Namely, EFT can break down if the species scale $\Lambda_s$ falls off so rapidly as the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) scale factor grows from some initial value $a_i$ to some final value $a_f$ that the physical momentum of an initial Hubble-sized perturbation $\sim H_i^{-1}$ grows to exceed the species scale. For EFT to remain valid, a new condition $H_i \frac{a_i}{a_f} \ll \Lambda_{s,f}$ must hold, which is distinct from Trans-Planckian conditions discussed in the literature. Using the universal relation $\frac{\nabla m}{m} \cdot \frac{\nabla \Lambda_s}{\Lambda_s} = \frac{1}{d-2}$ in the infinite distance limits of moduli space where $m$ is the mass scale of the lightest tower and $\nabla$ measures variations with respect to the canonical metric on moduli space, we show that spatially flat FRW solutions in the string landscape violate this condition or at best marginally satisfy it. However, we find that sufficiently large negative spatial curvature always avoids a breakdown. To avoid EFT breakdown, we derive an upper bound on the duration of quasi-de Sitter expansion that classically evolves to decelerated expansion. Our bound is proportional to the Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture (TCC) bound, with the advantage that it applies to any FRW solution in the string landscape. Finally, we distinguish EFT breakdown from TCC violation, the latter being a quantum gravity constraint rather than an EFT limitation. Perhaps our most surprising finding is that in any flat FRW solution that develops a weakly coupled string at future infinity the EFT inevitably breaks down.</description>

      <title>Productions of $^3_{\Lambda}$H, $^4_{\Lambda}$H and $^4_{\Lambda}$He in different coalescence channels in Au-Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=3$ GeV</title>

Abstract: We study the productions of $\Lambda$-hypernuclei $^3_{\Lambda}$H, $^4_{\Lambda}$H and $^4_{\Lambda}$He in the coalescence mechanism in Au-Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=3$ GeV. Considering the abundance and great importance of baryons and light (hyper-)nuclei on the collision dynamics, we include not only nucleon$+\Lambda$ coalescence but also nucleus+nucleon($\Lambda$) coalescence. We present contributions from different coalescence channels for $^3_{\Lambda}$H, $^4_{\Lambda}$H and $^4_{\Lambda}$He in their productions. We predict the production asymmetry between $^4_{\Lambda}$H and $^4_{\Lambda}$He, characterized by yield ratios $^4_{\Lambda}\text{He}/^4_{\Lambda}\text{H}$ and $(^4_{\Lambda}\text{H}-^4_{\Lambda}\text{He})/(^4_{\Lambda}\text{H}+^4_{\Lambda}\text{He})$, which can shed light on the existence constraints of the possible neutron-$\Lambda$ bound states $^2_{\Lambda}n~(n\Lambda)$ and $^3_{\Lambda}n~(nn\Lambda)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11904v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that placing a radioactive source such as ${}^{51}$Cr near a liquid xenon detector may allow to detect the contribution induced by the anapole moment to neutrino-electron scattering in the Standard Model at the 1-2 $\sigma$ level. Although the anapole moment of neutrinos induces a scattering rate with the same spectral shape as the neutral and charged current contributions, exposures of $\sim$ 60 tonne $\times$ source run at XENONnT or XLZD may be enough to accumulate sufficient statistics for a detection. We also discuss a simple model where the anapole moment of neutrinos is enhanced or decreased with respect to the SM expectation, further demonstrating how a potential measurement of the anapole moment of neutrinos would allow to constrain new physics.</description>

Abstract: We show that various nucleon "radii" that appear in the literature, e.g."charge", "gravitational", "mass" or "mechanical, do not have a direct geometric meaning and do not give an idea of the physical size of the nucleon.
  In the framework of the Gribov parton scheme we also show that at high enough energy a gluon cloud appears beyond the valence core of the nucleon and begins to determine the region of interaction of elastic nucleon-nucleon scattering and the growth of its cross-section.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00957v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the connection of baryogenesis at temperatures below the electroweak scale and signals for long-lived particles at the LHC. The model features new SM singlets, with a long-lived fermion decaying to quarks to generate the baryon asymmetry. The model avoids strong flavor physics bounds while predicting a rich diquark phenomenology, monojet signals, and displaced vertices. We show how the displaced vertex signals can be probed at the HL-LHC. The large transverse production makes a strong physics case for constructing far detector experiments such as MATHUSLA, ANUBIS, and CODEX-b, complementary to the central and forward long-lived particle program.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous breaking of baryon number, baryogenesis and the bajoron</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00964v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the spontaneous breaking of global baryon number for baryogenesis. We introduce a model with three majorana fermions and a complex scalar carrying baryon number charge. After symmetry breaking, the baryon asymmetry is generated below the electroweak scale via the decays of one of the majorana fermions. The main focus of the paper is the phenomenology of the Nambu--Goldstone boson of $U(1)_B$, which we call the bajoron. With small sources of explicit baryon number violation, the bajoron acquires a small mass and is generally very long-lived. The model avoids proton decay, satisfies cosmological constraints, and offers interesting collider phenomenology for the Large Hadron Collider. These long-lived particles tied to baryogenesis strongly support the development of far-detector experiments such as MATHUSLA, FASER, SHiP, and others.</description>

      <title>Speed of sound and trace anomaly in a unified treatment of the two-color diquark superfluid, the pion-condensed high-isospin matter, and the 2SC quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a unified perturbative treatment from the high-density side, we compute the speed of sound and the trace anomaly as functions of the chemical potential $\mu$ for the two-color diquark superfluid, the pion-condensed high-isospin matter, and the 2SC quark matter. We find that the corrections induced by the gap energy $\Delta$ involve nontrivial interplay between the dimensionless magnitude $|\Delta/\mu|$ and the derivative $|\partial\Delta/\partial\mu|$. Even though the gap equation has a common structure for these phases of our interest, different numerical constants cause drastic changes in the speed of sound corrections. As long as $|\Delta/\mu|$ is dominant over the derivative, the gap effects increase the speed of sound, which is consistent with the expected behavior of exhibiting a peak at intermediate density. We then discuss the trace anomaly which is pushed down generally by the gap effects and turns out to be negative widely in the high density regime. For demonstration of non-perturbative enhancement, we take account of the instanton-induced interaction. We confirm a further increase in the speed of sound for the two-color diquark superfluid and the pion-condensed high-isospin matter, while the speed of sound for the 2SC quark matter deviates far below the conformal limit due to the derivative contribution.</description>

      <title>What happens when supercooling is terminated by curvature flipping of the effective potential?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the nature of a certain type of supercooled phase transition, where the supercooling is guaranteed to end due to the curvature of the finite-temperature effective potential at the origin experiencing a sign flip at some temperature. In such models the potential barrier trapping the scalar field at the meta-stable origin is quickly vanishing at the temperature scale of the phase transition. It is therefore not immediately clear if critical bubbles are able to form, or whether the field will simply transition over the barrier and smoothly roll down to the true minimum. To address this question, we perform lattice simulations of a scalar potential exhibiting supercooling, with a small barrier around the origin, and qualitatively determine the fate of the phase transition. Our simulations indicate that, owing to the required flatness of the potential, the scalar field remains trapped around the origin such that the phase transition generically proceeds via the nucleation and expansion of true-vacuum bubbles. We comment on the possible gravitational wave signals one might expect in a concrete toy model and discuss the parameter space in which bubble percolation is and isn't expected.

Abstract: We study the coupling selection rules associated with non-group symmetries, i.e., $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauging of $\mathbb{Z}_M$ symmetries. We clarify which Yukawa textures can be derived by our selection rules for $M=3, 4$, and 5, and obtain various textures including the the nearest neighbor interaction type and its extension. Some of them cannot be realized by a conventional group-like symmetry. They lead to interesting phenomenology such as a solution to the strong CP problem without axion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the $SO(5) \times U(1) \times SU(3)$ gauge-Higgs unification in the Randall-Sundrum warped space the mixing in the $W$ couplings in the quark sector is induced by masses of $SO(5)$ singlet fermions which are responsible for splitting masses of down-type quarks from those of up-type quarks in each generation. We show that the observed Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix in the $W$ couplings is reproduced within experimental errors. Further flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNCs) in the quark sector are shown to be naturally suppressed.</description>

      <title>Self Consistent Thermal Resummation: A Case Study of the Phase Transition in 2HDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An accurate description of the scalar potential at finite temperature is crucial for studying cosmological first-order phase transitions (FOPT) in the early Universe. At finite temperatures, a precise treatment of thermal resummations is essential, as bosonic fields encounter significant infrared issues that can compromise standard perturbative approaches. The Partial Dressing (or the tadpole resummation) method provides a self consistent resummation of higher order corrections, allowing the computation of thermal masses and the effective potential including the proper Boltzmann suppression factors and without relying on any high-temperature approximation. We systematically compare the Partial dressing resummation scheme results with the Parwani and Arnold Espinosa (AE) ones to investigate the thermal phase transition dynamics in the Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM). Our findings reveal that different resummation prescriptions can significantly alter the nature of the phase transition within the same region of parameter space, confirming the differences that have already been noticed between the Parwani and AE schemes. Notably, the more refined resummation prescription, the Partial Dressing scheme, does not support symmetry non-restoration in 2HDM at high temperatures observed using the AE prescription. Furthermore, we quantify the uncertainties in the stochastic gravitational wave (GW) spectrum from an FOPT due to variations in resummation methods, illustrating their role in shaping theoretical predictions for upcoming GW experiments. Finally, we discuss the capability of the High-Luminosity LHC and proposed GW experiments to probe the FOEWPT-favored region of the parameter space.</description>

      <title>Probing Long-Range Forces in Neutrino Oscillations at the ESSnuSB Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrino oscillations constitute an excellent tool to probe physics beyond the Standard Model. In this paper, we investigate the potential of the ESSnuSB experiment to constrain the effects of flavour-dependent long-range forces (LRFs) in neutrino oscillations, which may arise due to the extension of the Standard Model gauge group by introducing new $U(1)$ symmetries. Focusing on three specific $U(1)$ symmetries -- $L_e - L_\mu$, $L_e - L_\tau$, and $L_\mu - L_\tau$, we demonstrate that ESSnuSB offers a favourable environment to search for LRF effects. Our analyses reveal that ESSnuSB can set $90\%$ confidence level bounds of $V_{e\mu} &lt; 2.99 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{eV}$, $V_{e\tau} &lt; 2.05 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{eV}$, and $V_{\mu\tau} &lt; 1.81 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{eV}$, which are competitive to the upcoming Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE). It is also observed that reducing the systematic uncertainties from $5\%$ to $2\%$ improves the \ess limits on $V_{\alpha\beta}$. Interestingly, we find limited correlations between LRF parameters and the less constrained lepton mixing parameters $\theta_{23}$ and $\delta_{\text{CP}}$, preserving the robustness of ESSnuSB's sensitivity to CP violation. Even under extreme LRF potentials ($V_{\alpha\beta} \gg 10^{-13} \, \text{eV}$), the CP-violation sensitivity and $\delta_{\text{CP}}$ precision remain largely unaffected. These results establish ESSnuSB as a competitive experimental setup for probing LRF effects, complementing constraints from other neutrino sources and offering critical insights into the physics of long-range forces.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel approach for loop integral reduction in the Feynman parametrization using intersection theory and relative cohomology. In this framework, Feynman integrals correspond to boundary-supported differential forms in the language of relative cohomology. The integral reduction can then be achieved by computing intersection numbers. We apply our method in several examples to demonstrate its correctness, and discuss the subtleties in certain degenerate limits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent DESI DR2 observations indicate that dark energy has crossed from phantom to quintessence regime, a behavior known as the quintom-B realization. In this work we constrain dynamical dark energy and modified gravity using the swampland Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture (TCC), which forbids eternal acceleration since in this case any trans-Planckian quantum fluctuation would eventually stretch beyond the Hubble radius, breaking the applicability of any effective field theory and cosmological techniques. By combining DESI DR2 data with the TCC criterion, we impose tight constraints on the dark energy equation of state and its parameter space in scenarios such as the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder, Barboza-Alcaniz, Jassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan, EXP and LOG parameterizations, significantly constraining the quintom-A behavior. Also we examine models within the framework of $f(T)$ and $f(Q)$ modified gravity theories, demonstrating that TCC is very powerful to constrain or exclude them, a result that indicates the necessity to consider infrared modifications on General Relativity apart from the usual ultraviolet ones. Our findings imply that viable dynamical dark energy scenarios must asymptotically transit to deceleration, shedding light on new physics consistent with both cosmological observations and quantum gravity principles.</description>
