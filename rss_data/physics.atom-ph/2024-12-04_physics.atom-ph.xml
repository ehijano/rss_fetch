      <title>Analytical and numerical studies of periodic superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct a theoretical study to understand the periodic superradiance observed in an Er:YSO crystal. First, we construct a model based on the Maxwell-Bloch equations for a reduced level system, a pair of superradiance states and a population reservoir state. We then derive two-variable equations consisting of the coherence and population difference between the two superradiance states, which contain the essential feature of the periodic superradiance. The two-variable equations clarify a mathematical structure of this periodic phenomenon and give analytical forms of the period, pulse duration, and number of emitted photons. Furthermore, analysis of the eigenvalues of the linearized differential equations shows that periodic superradiance can be realized only for certain parameters. Our model successfully reproduces the periodic behavior, but the actual experimental parameters are found to be outside the parameter region for the periodic superradiance. This result implies that some other mechanism(s) is required. As one example, assuming that the field decay rate varies with the electric field, the periodic superradiance can be reproduced even under the actual experimental condition.</description>

      <title>Sensitive Low-Recoil VUV 1+1$'$ REMPI Detection of ND$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In molecular beam scattering experiments, an important technique for measuring product energy and angular distributions is velocity map imaging following photoionization. For studies with cold molecular beams, the resolution is often limited by the product detection process. When state-selective ionization detection is used, excess photon energy can transfer to kinetic energy in the molecular ion-electron pair, resulting in measurable cation recoil. With advanced molecular beam technology, velocity spreads as small as a few m/s are possible. Thus, a suitable product detection scheme must be not only sensitive, state-selective, and background-free, it must also produce less cation recoil than the velocity spread of the molecular beams. To date this has only been possible with the NO molecule. Our goal here is to extend this low-recoil capability to fully deuterated ammonia, ND$_3$. We present a resonance-enhanced multi-photon ionization (REMPI) detection scheme for ND$_3$, that imparts sufficiently low ion recoil, allowing, for the first time, high-resolution imaging of ND$_3$ products in a cold ND$_3$-HD scattering experiment. The first step of the 1+1$'$ REMPI scheme requires vacuum ultra-violet (VUV) photons of ~160 nm, which are generated through four-wave-mixing in Xe. We varied the wavelength of the second, ionization step between 434 and 458 nm, exciting ND$_3$ to a wide range of autoionizing neutral states. By velocity mapping the resulting photoelectrons, it was possible to fully chart the ion recoil across this range with vibrational resolution for the final ionic states. Additionally, rotational resolution in the photoionization dynamics was achieved for selected excitation energies near one of the vibrational thresholds. Many of the peaks in the spectrum of autoionizing Rydberg states are assigned to specific Rydberg series using a simple Rydberg formula model.</description>

      <title>Measurements and simulations of rate coefficients for the deuterated forms of the H2 + + H2 and H3 + + H2 reactive systems at low temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rate coefficients of various isotopic variations of the H2+ + H2 and H3+ + H2 reactions in the 10-250 K temperature range were measured using a cryogenic 22 pole radio frequency ion trap. The processes involving diatomic ions were found to behave close to the Langevin rate, whereas temperature-dependent rate coefficients were obtained for the four isotopic exchange processes with triatomic ions. Fitting the experimental data using a chemical code allowed us in specific cases to constrain rate coefficients that were not directly measured in the ion trap. The reported rate coefficients suggest a more efficient hydrogenation of deuterated H3+ forms than usually assumed in astrochemical models, which might affect deuteration rates in warmer environments.</description>

      <title>Single-atom resolved collective spectroscopy of a one-dimensional atomic array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ordered atomic arrays feature an enhanced collective optical response compared to random atomic ensembles due to constructive interference in resonant dipole-dipole interactions. One consequence is the existence of a large shift of the transition with respect to the bare atomic frequency. In the linear optics regime (low light intensity), one observes a spectroscopic shift of the Lorentzian atomic line often called the collective Lamb shift. For stronger driving, many excitations are present in the system rendering the calculation of this shift theoretically challenging, but its understanding is important for instance when performing Ramsey spectroscopy in optical clocks. Here we report on the study of the collective optical response of a one-dimensional array of 30 dysprosium atoms. We drive the atoms on the narrow intercombination transition isolating a 2-level system, and measure the atomic state with single-shot state readout using a broad transition. In the linear optics regime, we measure the shift of the resonance in steady state due to dipole interactions, and measure how this shift depends on the interatomic distance. We further resolve at the single atom level how the excitation is distributed over the array. Then, on the same transition we perform Ramsey spectroscopy \emph{i.\,e.}~away from the linear regime. We observe a time-dependent shift, that allows us to draw the connection between the collective Lamb shift observed in the linear optics regime and in the large-excitation case.</description>

      <title>Electron Beam Characterization via Quantum Coherent Optical Magnetometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a quantum optics-based detection method for determining the position and current of an electron beam. As electrons pass through a dilute vapor of rubidium atoms, their magnetic field perturb the atomic spin's quantum state and causes polarization rotation of a laser resonant with an optical transition of the atoms. By measuring the polarization rotation angle across the laser beam, we recreate a 2D projection of the magnetic field and use it to determine the e-beam position, size and total current. We tested this method for an e-beam with currents ranging from 30 to 110 {\mu}A. Our approach is insensitive to electron kinetic energy, and we confirmed that experimentally between 10 to 20 keV. This technique offers a unique platform for non-invasive characterization of charged particle beams used in accelerators for particle and nuclear physics research.</description>

      <title>Collisions of Spin-polarized YO Molecules for Single Partial Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient sub-Doppler laser cooling and optical trapping of YO molecules offer new opportunities to study collisional dynamics in the quantum regime. Confined in a crossed optical dipole trap, we achieve the highest phase-space density of $2.5 \times 10^{-5}$ for a bulk laser-cooled molecular sample. This sets the stage to study YO--YO collisions in the microkelvin temperature regime, and reveal state-dependent, single-partial-wave two-body collisional loss rates. We determine the partial-wave contributions to loss of specific rotational states (first excited $N=1$ and ground $N=0$) following two strategies. First, we measure the change of the collision rate in a spin mixture of $N=1$ by tuning the kinetic energy with respect to the p- and d-wave centrifugal barriers. Second, we compare loss rates between a spin mixture and a spin-polarized state in $N=0$. Using quantum defect theory with a partially absorbing boundary condition at short range, we show that the dependence on temperature for $N=1$ can be reproduced in the presence of a d-wave or f-wave resonance, and the dependence on a spin mixture for $N=0$ with a p-wave resonance.</description>

      <title>Fermi polaron in atom-ion hybrid systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atom-ion hybrid systems are promising platforms for the quantum simulation of polaron physics in certain quantum materials. Here, we investigate the ionic Fermi polaron, a charged impurity in a polarized Fermi bath, at zero temperature using quantum Monte Carlo techniques. We compute the energy spectrum, residue, effective mass, and structural properties. Significant deviations from field-theory prediction occur in the strong coupling regime due to large density inhomogeneities around the ion. We observe a smooth polaron-molecule transition in contrast with the neutral case. This study provides insights into solid-state systems like Fermi exciton polarons in thin semiconductors and quantum technologies based on atom-ion platforms.</description>

      <title>Universal bound states and resonances with Coulomb plus short-range potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06011v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study charged particles in three dimensions interacting via a short-range potential in addition to the Coulomb potential. When the Bohr radius and the scattering length are much larger than the potential range, low-energy physics of the system becomes independent from details of the short-range potential. We develop the zero-range theory to describe such universal physics in terms of the Bohr radius and the scattering length by generalizing the Bethe-Peierls boundary condition, which is then applied to two charged particles to reveal their bound states and resonances. Infinite resonances are found for a repulsive Coulomb potential, one of which turns into a bound state with increasing inverse scattering length, whereas infinite bound states exist for an attractive Coulomb potential with no resonances at any scattering length. The zero-range theory is also applied to three equally charged particles at infinite scattering length under the variational Born-Oppenheimer approximation. We find that the effective potential between two heavy particles induced by a light particle is an inverse-square attraction at distances shorter than the Bohr radius, leading to infinite deep bound states, whereas shallow ones successively turn into resonances with increasing Coulomb repulsion.</description>
