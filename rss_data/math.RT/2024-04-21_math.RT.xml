      <title>A note on Combinatorial Invariance of Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concepts of an amazing hypercube decomposition and a double shortcut for it, and use these new ideas to formulate a conjecture implying the Combinatorial Invariance Conjecture of the Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials for the symmetric group. This conjecture has the advantage of being combinatorial in nature.</description>

      <title>Torsors on moduli spaces of principal $G$-bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a semisimple complex algebraic group with a simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, and let $\mathcal{M}^0_{G}$ denote the moduli stack of topologically trivial stable $G$-bundles on a smooth projective curve $C$. Fix a theta characteristic $\kappa$ on $C$ which is even in case $\dim{\mathfrak{g}}$ is odd. We show that there is a nonempty Zariski open substack ${\mathcal U}_\kappa$ of $\mathcal{M}^0_{G}$ such that $H^i(C,\, \text{ad}(E_G)\otimes\kappa) \,=\, 0$, $i\,=\, 1,\, 2$, for all $E_G\,\in\, {\mathcal U}_\kappa$. It is shown that any such $E_G$ has a canonical connection. It is also shown that the tangent bundle $T{U}_\kappa$ has a natural splitting, where $U_{\kappa}$ is the restriction of $\mathcal{U}_{\kappa}$ to the semi-stable locus. We also produce an isomorphism between two naturally occurring $\Omega^1_{{M}^{rs}_{G}}$--torsors on the moduli space of regularly stable ${M}^{rs}_{G}$.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Auslander-Reiten duality and Morita theorem for singularity categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.14090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a Morita theorem to construct triangle equivalences between the singularity categories of (commutative and non-commutative) Gorenstein rings and the cluster categories of finite dimensional algebras over fields, and more strongly, quasi-equivalences between their canonical dg enhancements. More precisely, we prove that such an equivalence exists as soon as we find a quasi-equivalence between the graded dg singularity category of a Gorenstein ring and the derived category of a finite dimensional algebra which can be done by finding a single tilting object.
  Our result is based on two key theorems on dg enhancements of cluster categories and of singularity categories, which are of independent interest. First we give a Morita-type theorem which realizes certain $\mathbb{Z}$-graded dg categories as dg orbit categories. Secondly, we show that the canonical dg enhancements of the singularity categories of symmetric orders have the bimodule Calabi-Yau property, which lifts the classical Auslander-Reiten duality on singularity categories.
  We apply our results to such classes of rings as Gorenstein rings of dimension at most $1$, quotient singularities, and Geigle-Lenzing complete intersections, including finite or infinite Grassmannian cluster categories, to realize their singularity categories as cluster categories of finite dimensional algebras.</description>

      <title>Limit shape for regularisation of large partitions under the Plancherel measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.07115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A celebrated result of Kerov-Vershik and Logan-Shepp gives an asymptotic shape for large partitions under the Plancherel measure. We prove that when we consider $e$-regularisations of such partitions we still have a convex limit shape, which is given by a shaking of the Kerov-Vershik-Logan-Shepp curve. We deduce an explicit form for the first asymptotics of the length of the first rows and the first columns for the $e$-regularisation.</description>

      <title>Modular Representations of Truncated current Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the structure and representation theory of truncated current algebras $\mathfrak{g}_m = \mathfrak{g}[t]/(t^{m+1})$ associated to the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ of a standard reductive group over a field of positive characteristic. We classify semisimple and nilpotent elements and describe their associated support varieties. Next, we prove various Morita equivalences for reduced enveloping algebras, including a reduction to nilpotent $p$-characters, analogous to a famous theorem of Friedlander--Parshall.
  We go on to give precise upper bounds for the dimensions of simple modules for all $p$-characters, and give lower bounds on these dimensions for homogeneous $p$-characters. We then develop the theory of baby Verma modules for homogeneous $p$-characters and, whenever the $p$-character has standard Levi type, we give a full classification of the simple modules. In particular we classify all simple modules with homogeneous $p$-characters for $\mathfrak{g}_m$ when $\mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{gl}_n$. Finally, we compute the Cartan invariants for the restricted enveloping algebra $U_0(\mathfrak{g}_m)$ and show that they can be described by precise formulae depending on decomposition numbers for $U_0(\mathfrak{g})$.</description>

      <title>The lowest discriminant ideal of central extensions of Abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a previous joint paper with Wu and Yakimov, we gave an explicit description of the lowest discriminant ideal in a Cayley-Hamilton Hopf algebra (H,C,tr) of degree d over an algebraically closed field k, char k $\notin[1, d]$ with basic identity fiber, i.e. all irreducible representations over the kernel of the counit of the central Hopf subalgebra C are one-dimensional. Using results developed in that paper, we compute relevant quantities associated with irreducible representations to explicitly describe the zero set of the lowest discriminant ideal in the group algebra of a central extension of the product of two arbitrary finitely generated Abelian groups by any finite Abelian group under some conditions. Over a fixed maximal ideal of C the representations are tensor products of representations each corresponding to a central extension of a subgroup isomorphic to the product of two cyclic groups of the same order. A description of the orbit of the identity, i.e. the kernel of the counit of C, under winding automorphisms is also given.</description>

      <title>Compatibility of the Fargues--Scholze correspondence for unitary groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.13193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.13193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study unramified unitary and unitary similitude groups in an odd number of variables. Using work of the first and third named authors on the Kottwitz Conjecture for the similitude groups, we show that the Fargues--Scholze local Langlands correspondence agrees with the semi-simplification of the local Langlands correspondences constructed by Mok for the groups we consider. This compatibility result is then combined with the spectral action constructed by Fargues--Scholze, to verify their categorical form of the local Langlands conjecture for supercuspidal $\ell$-parameters. We deduce Fargues' eigensheaf conjecture and prove the strongest form of Kottwitz's conjecture for the groups we consider, even in the case of non minuscule $\mu$.</description>

      <title>Zeta-polynomials, superpolynomials, DAHA and plane curve singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.02200v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We begin with modular form periods, a focal point of several Yuri Manin's works. The similarity is discussed between the corresponding zeta-polynomials and superpolynomials of algebraic links, closely related to Khovanov-Rozansky polynomials. We focus on DAHA superpolynomials and motivic ones, defined via compactified Jacobians of plane curve singularities and their counterparts in arbitrary ranks; the non-unibranch construction is new. They conjecturally coincide with the corresponding generalizations of L-functions and satisfy the Riemann Hypothesis in some sectors of the parameters. Presumably, the motivic ones an be interpreted as certain partition functions of Landau-Ginzburg models associated with plane curve singularities; RH for them is remarkably similar to the Lee-Yang circle theorem for Ising models. A q,t-deformation of the Witten index is obtained as an application. General perspectives of the motivic theory of isolated curve and surface singularities are discussed, including possible implications in number theory. Also, we introduce super-analogs of $\rho_{ab}$-invariants and discuss super-deformations of the Riemann's zeta. Among other topics: Verlinde algebras, and the topological vertex.</description>
