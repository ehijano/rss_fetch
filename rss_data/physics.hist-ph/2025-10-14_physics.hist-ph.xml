      <title>Relative Information, Relative Facts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We offer a fresh perspective on the relational interpretation of quantum mechanics as a way of thinking about the world described by quantum theory based on quantifiable notions of information. This allows us to provide a definition of a relative fact, with no addition to orthodox quantum theory and no fundamentally special role for observers. By associating perspectives with commutative observables rather than entire quantum systems, several previous problems with the interpretation are dissolved. As a side result, we show how a quantum measurement, properly described, is a continuous process.</description>

      <title>French on London and Bauer, and QBism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article I compare two interpretations of quantum mechanics (QM) that draw inspiration from phenomenology: the London-Bauer-French interpretation (hereafter LBF) as articulated by Steven French, and QBism. I give special attention to certain disagreements between QBism and LBF identified French's work, as well as French's related claims that QBism may be at odds with key ideas in phenomenology. My main finding is that QBism does not fare so badly with phenomenology as French makes out; in particular it can be made compatible with Zahavi's correlationism and Husserl's notion of intersubjectivity, both of which strongly inform LBF. Nevertheless, I concur with French's argument that QBism is incompatible with the conception of quantum measurement in LBF, hence also with that of Merleau-Ponty, as the latter based his own analysis on that of London and Bauer. I explain why I find QBism's account preferable in this case.</description>

      <title>Prigogine's temporalization of physics: two agnostic attitudes of physicists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02825v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, I aim to clarify the unconscious ideologies and attitudes held by physicists through Prigogine's work. Prigogine was an outstanding chemist and physicist who made significant contributions to the development of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. At the same time, he extended his ideas beyond physics into the humanities, engaging in an interdisciplinary exploration of scientific and philosophical thought. Due to his unique career, Prigogine's reception has been deeply divided. This study highlights his intellectual endeavors to formulate two distinct agnostic attitudes -- one held by dynamicists and the other by Prigogine himself. Building on this formulation, I examine how physics has been spatialized, drawing on the philosophy of Bergson. Finally, I explore an alternative path that Prigogine might have envisioned -- the temporalization of physics -- in a broader context to extend and revitalize his philosophy.</description>

      <title>What is emergence, after all?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04951v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The term emergence is increasingly used across scientific disciplines to describe phenomena that arise from interactions among a system's components but cannot be readily inferred by examining those components in isolation. While often invoked to explain higher-level behaviors, such as flocking, synchronization, or collective intelligence, the term is frequently used without precision, sometimes giving rise to ambiguity or even mystique. In this perspective paper, we clarify the scientific meaning of emergence as a measurable and physically grounded phenomenon. Through concrete examples, such as temperature, magnetism, and herd immunity in social networks, we review how collective behavior can arise from local interactions that are constrained by global boundaries. By refining the concept of emergence, we gain a clearer and more grounded understanding of complex systems. Our goal is to show that emergence, when properly framed, offers not mysticism but insight.</description>
