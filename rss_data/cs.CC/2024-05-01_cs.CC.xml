      <title>Solvable Initial Value Problems Ruled by Discontinuous Ordinary Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study initial value problems having dynamics ruled by discontinuous ordinary differential equations with the property of possessing a unique solution. We identify a precise class of such systems that we call \emph{solvable intitial value problems} and we prove that for this class of problems the unique solution can always be obtained analytically via transfinite recursion. We present several examples including a nontrivial one whose solution yields, at an integer time, a real encoding of the halting set for Turing machines; therefore showcasing that the behavior of solvable systems is related to ordinal Turing computations.</description>

      <title>A Smoothed Analysis of the Space Complexity of Computing a Chaotic Sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is motivated by a question whether it is possible to calculate a chaotic sequence efficiently, e.g., is it possible to get the $n$-th bit of a bit sequence generated by a chaotic map, such as $\beta$-expansion, tent map and logistic map in $\mathrm{o}(n)$ time/space? This paper gives an affirmative answer to the question about the space complexity of a tent map. We show that the decision problem of whether a given bit sequence is a valid tent code is solved in $\mathrm{O}(\log^{2} n)$ space in a sense of the smoothed complexity.</description>

      <title>A quantum neural network framework for scalable quantum circuit approximation of unitary matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a Lie group theoretic approach for parametric representation of unitary matrices. This leads to develop a quantum neural network framework for quantum circuit approximation of multi-qubit unitary gates. Layers of the neural networks are defined by product of exponential of certain elements of the Standard Recursive Block Basis, which we introduce as an alternative to Pauli string basis for matrix algebra of complex matrices of order $2^n$. The recursive construction of the neural networks implies that the quantum circuit approximation is scalable i.e. quantum circuit for an $(n+1)$-qubit unitary can be constructed from the circuit of $n$-qubit system by adding a few CNOT gates and single-qubit gates.</description>

      <title>From Linear to Linearizable Optimization: A Novel Framework with Applications to Stationary and Non-stationary DR-submodular Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the notion of upper linearizable/quadratizable functions, a class that extends concavity and DR-submodularity in various settings, including monotone and non-monotone cases over different convex sets. A general meta-algorithm is devised to convert algorithms for linear/quadratic maximization into ones that optimize upper quadratizable functions, offering a unified approach to tackling concave and DR-submodular optimization problems. The paper extends these results to multiple feedback settings, facilitating conversions between semi-bandit/first-order feedback and bandit/zeroth-order feedback, as well as between first/zeroth-order feedback and semi-bandit/bandit feedback. Leveraging this framework, new projection-free algorithms are derived using Follow The Perturbed Leader (FTPL) and other algorithms as base algorithms for linear/convex optimization, improving upon state-of-the-art results in various cases. Dynamic and adaptive regret guarantees are obtained for DR-submodular maximization, marking the first algorithms to achieve such guarantees in these settings. Notably, the paper achieves these advancements with fewer assumptions compared to existing state-of-the-art results, underscoring its broad applicability and theoretical contributions to non-convex optimization.</description>

      <title>Finding Diverse Strings and Longest Common Subsequences in a Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study for the first time the Diverse Longest Common Subsequences (LCSs) problem under Hamming distance. Given a set of a constant number of input strings, the problem asks to decide if there exists some subset $\mathcal X$ of $K$ longest common subsequences whose diversity is no less than a specified threshold $\Delta$, where we consider two types of diversities of a set $\mathcal X$ of strings of equal length: the Sum diversity and the Min diversity defined as the sum and the minimum of the pairwise Hamming distance between any two strings in $\mathcal X$, respectively. We analyze the computational complexity of the respective problems with Sum- and Min-diversity measures, called the Max-Sum and Max-Min Diverse LCSs, respectively, considering both approximation algorithms and parameterized complexity. Our results are summarized as follows. When $K$ is bounded, both problems are polynomial time solvable. In contrast, when $K$ is unbounded, both problems become NP-hard, while Max-Sum Diverse LCSs problem admits a PTAS. Furthermore, we analyze the parameterized complexity of both problems with combinations of parameters $K$ and $r$, where $r$ is the length of the candidate strings to be selected. Importantly, all positive results above are proven in a more general setting, where an input is an edge-labeled directed acyclic graph (DAG) that succinctly represents a set of strings of the same length. Negative results are proven in the setting where an input is explicitly given as a set of strings. The latter results are equipped with an encoding such a set as the longest common subsequences of a specific input string set.</description>

      <title>Real Stability and Log Concavity are coNP-Complete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-stable, Lorentzian, and log-concave polynomials are well-studied classes of polynomials, and have been powerful tools in resolving several conjectures. We show that the problems of deciding whether a polynomial of fixed degree is real stable or log concave are coNP-complete. On the other hand, while all homogeneous real-stable polynomials are Lorentzian and all Lorentzian polynomials are log concave on the positive orthant, the problem of deciding whether a polynomial of fixed degree is Lorentzian can be solved in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Realizing temporal graphs from fastest travel times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.08860v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we initiate the study of the temporal graph realization problem with respect to the fastest path durations among its vertices, while we focus on periodic temporal graphs. Given an $n \times n$ matrix $D$ and a $\Delta \in \mathbb{N}$, the goal is to construct a $\Delta$-periodic temporal graph with $n$ vertices such that the duration of a fastest path from $v_i$ to $v_j$ is equal to $D_{i,j}$, or to decide that such a temporal graph does not exist. The variations of the problem on static graphs have been well studied and understood since the 1960's (e.g. [Erd\H{o}s and Gallai, 1960], [Hakimi and Yau, 1965]).
  As it turns out, the periodic temporal graph realization problem has a very different computational complexity behavior than its static (i.e. non-temporal) counterpart. First, we show that the problem is NP-hard in general, but polynomial-time solvable if the so-called underlying graph is a tree. Building upon those results, we investigate its parameterized computational complexity with respect to structural parameters of the underlying static graph which measure the ``tree-likeness''. We prove a tight classification between such parameters that allow fixed-parameter tractability (FPT) and those which imply W[1]-hardness. We show that our problem is W[1]-hard when parameterized by the feedback vertex number (and therefore also any smaller parameter such as treewidth, degeneracy, and cliquewidth) of the underlying graph, while we show that it is in FPT when parameterized by the feedback edge number (and therefore also any larger parameter such as maximum leaf number) of the underlying graph.</description>
