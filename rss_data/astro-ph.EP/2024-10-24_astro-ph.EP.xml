      <title>Architecture of TOI-561 planetary system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new observations from CHEOPS and TESS to clarify the architecture of the planetary system hosted by the old Galactic thick disk star TOI-561. Our global analysis, which also includes previously published photometric and radial velocity data, incontrovertibly proves that TOI-561 is hosting at least four transiting planets with periods of 0.44 days (TOI-561 b), 10.8 days (TOI-561 c), 25.7 days (TOI-561 d), and 77.1 days (TOI-561 e) and a fifth non-transiting candidate, TOI-561f with a period of 433 days. The precise characterisation of TOI-561's orbital architecture is interesting since old and metal-poor thick disk stars are less likely to host ultra-short period Super-Earths like TOI-561 b. The new period of planet -e is consistent with the value obtained using radial velocity alone and is now known to be $77.14399\pm0.00025$ days, thanks to the new CHEOPS and TESS transits. The new data allowed us to improve its radius ($R_p = 2.517 \pm 0.045 R_{\oplus}$ from 5$\%$ to 2$\%$ precision) and mass ($M_p = 12.4 \pm 1.4 M_{\oplus}$) estimates, implying a density of $\rho_p = 0.778 \pm 0.097 \rho_{\oplus}$. Thanks to recent TESS observations and the focused CHEOPS visit of the transit of TOI-561 e, a good candidate for exomoon searches, the planet's period is finally constrained, allowing us to predict transit times through 2030 with 20-minute accuracy. We present an updated version of the internal structure of the four transiting planets. We finally performed a detailed stability analysis, which confirmed the long-term stability of the outer planet TOI-561 f.</description>

      <title>Orbit of a Possible Planet X</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The plausibility of an unseen planet in the outer solar system, and the expected orbit and mass of such a planet, have long been a topic of inquiry and debate. We calculate the long-term orbital stability of distant trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs), which allows us to expand the sample of objects that would carry dynamical information about a hypothetical unseen planet in the outer solar system. Using this expanded sample, we find statistically significant clustering at the $\sim 3 \sigma$ level for TNOs with semimajor axes $&gt;170\mbox{\;AU}$, in longitude of perihelion ($\varpi$), but not in inclination ($i$), argument of perihelion ($\omega$) or longitude of node ($\Omega$). Since a natural explanation for clustering in $\varpi$ is an unseen planet, we run 300 $n$-body simulations with the giant planets, a disk of test particles representing Kuiper belt objects, and an additional planet with varied initial conditions for its mass, semimajor axis, eccentricity, and inclination. Based on the distribution of test particles after 1--2 Gyr, we compute relative likelihoods given the actual distribution of $\varpi$ as a function of semimajor axis for distant TNOs on stable orbits using a significantly larger sample ($N = 51$) than previous work ($N = 11$). We find that the unseen planet parameters that best fit the data are a mass of $m_p = 4.4 \pm 1.1 \mathrm{\; M_{\oplus}}$, a semimajor axis of $a_p = 290 \pm 30 \mathrm{\; AU}$, an eccentricity of $e_p = 0.29 \pm 0.13$, and an inclination of $i_p = 6.8 \pm 5.0^{\circ}$ (all error bars are 1$\sigma$). Only $0.06\%$ of the Brown &amp; Batygin (2021) reference population produce probabilities within $1\sigma$ of the maximum within our quadrivariate model, indicating that our work identifies a distinct preferred region of parameter space for an unseen planet in the solar system. If such an unseen planet exists, it is likely to be discovered by LSST.</description>

      <title>CRIRES+ and ESPRESSO reveal an atmosphere enriched in volatiles relative to refractories on the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-121b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the outstanding goals of the planetary science community is to measure the present-day atmospheric composition of planets and link this back to formation. As giant planets are formed by accreting gas, ices, and rocks, constraining the relative amounts of these components is critical to understand their formation and evolution. For most known planets, including the Solar System giants, this is difficult as they reside in a temperature regime where only volatile elements (e.g., C, O) can be measured, while refractories (e.g., Fe, Ni) are condensed to deep layers of the atmosphere where they cannot be remotely probed. With temperatures allowing for even rock-forming elements to be in the gas phase, ultra-hot Jupiter atmospheres provide a unique opportunity to simultaneously probe the volatile and refractory content of giant planets. Here we directly measure and obtain bounded constraints on the abundances of volatile C and O as well as refractory Fe and Ni on the ultra-hot giant exoplanet WASP-121b. We find that ice-forming elements are comparatively enriched relative to rock-forming elements, potentially indicating that WASP-121b formed in a volatile-rich environment much farther away from the star than where it is currently located. The simultaneous constraint of ice and rock elements in the atmosphere of WASP-121b provides insights into the composition of giant planets otherwise unattainable from Solar System observations.</description>

      <title>JWST/MIRI detection of a carbon-rich chemistry in a solar nebula analog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been proposed, and confirmed by multiple observations, that disks around low mass stars display a molecule-rich emission and carbon-rich disk chemistry as compared to their hotter, more massive solar counterparts. In this work, we present JWST Disk Infrared Spectral Chemistry Survey (JDISCS) MIRI-MRS observations of the solar-mass star DoAr 33, a low-accretion rate T Tauri star showing an exceptional carbon-rich inner disk. We report detections of H$_2$O, OH, and CO$_2$, as well as the more complex hydrocarbons, C$_2$H$_2$ and C$_4$H$_2$. Through the use of thermochemical models, we explore different spatial distributions of carbon and oxygen across the inner disk and compare the column densities and temperatures obtained from LTE slab model retrievals. We find a best match to the observed column densities with models that have carbon enrichment, and the retrieved emitting temperature and area of C$_2$H$_2$ with models that have C/O $=$ 2$-$4 inside the 500 K carbon-rich dust sublimation line. This suggests that the origin of the carbon-rich chemistry is likely due to the sublimation of carbon rich grains near the soot line. This would be consistent with the presence of dust processing as indicated by the detection of crystalline silicates. We propose that this long-lived hydrocarbon rich chemistry observed around a solar-mass star is a consequence of the unusually low M-star-like accretion rate of the central star, which lengthens the radial mixing timescale of the inner disk allowing the chemistry powered by carbon grain destruction to linger.</description>

      <title>ExoMol line lists -- LXIV: Empirical rovibronic spectra of phosphorous mononitride (PN) covering the IR and UV regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new phosphorous mononitride (${}^{31}$P${}^{14}$N, ${}^{31}$P${}^{15}$N) line list PaiN covering infrared, visible and ultraviolet regions is presented. The PaiN line list extending to the $A\,{}^{1}\Pi$ -- $X\,{}^{1}\Sigma^{+}$ vibronic band system, replaces the previous YYLT ExoMol line list for PN. A thorough analysis of high resolution experimental spectra from the literature involving the $X\,{}^{1}\Sigma^{+}$ and $A\,{}^{1}\Pi$ states is conducted, and many perturbations to the $A\,{}^{1}\Pi$ energies are considered as part of a comprehensive MARVEL study. Ab initio potential energy and coupling curves from the previous work [Semenov et al., Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 23, 22057 (2021)] are refined by fitting their analytical representations to 1224 empirical energy levels determined using the MARVEL procedure. The PaiN line list is compared to previously observed spectra, recorded and calculated lifetimes, and previously calculated partition functions. The ab initio transition dipole moment curve for the $A$--$X$ band is scaled to match experimentally measured lifetimes. The line list is suitable for temperatures up to 5000 K and wavelengths longer than 121 nm. PaiN is available from www.exomol.com.</description>

      <title>Determination of commensurabilities in the dynamics of the Pluto-Charon's satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Pluto-Charon system is a binary system, characterised by its high mass ratio and its tidally locked synchronous orbit. Surrounding the central binary, four satellites - Styx, Nix, Kerberos and Hydra - follow near-circular and near equatorial orbits. Mutual tidal forces have probably a great influence on their long term dynamics. Several studies have pointed out some commensurabilities, sometimes using the fast Fourier transform technique. We intend to precisely identify the commensurabilities between the Pluto-Charon satellites, using the tool of fine frequency analysis, not only to investigate known commensurabilities but also to explore new ones. We used a combination of analytical and numerical approaches. The epicyclic theory of Lee and Peale served as an initial description of the motions and a comparative benchmark for numerical integrations. These integrations were performed using the IAS15 integrator within the N-body orbital integrator, REBOUND, considering both 3-body with the central binary and a single moon, and complete 6-body models. Additionally, we applied Frequency Map Analysis to determine precisely the numerical values of the system's fundamental frequencies. Our fine frequency analysis successfully identified all fundamental frequencies of the system, along with a detailed examination of the associated uncertainties. The findings, obtained with both 3-body and 6-body numerical models, align well with predictions from the epicyclic analytical theory. Notably, we highlight commensurabilities previously reported and introduce novel ones. Furthermore, we demonstrate how smooth alterations of the initial conditions can lead to the observation of libration in specific arguments, providing insights into the dynamical behavior of such a complex system.</description>

      <title>Low-resolution Transit Spectroscopy of Three Hot Jupiters Using the 2m Himalayan Chandra Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we present the low-resolution transmission spectroscopy of three giant planets using the Himalayan Faint Object Spectrograph Camera (HFOSC) on the 2m Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT) in Hanle, India. It is the first application of transmission spectroscopy with HCT. This study presents results from a single transit, each for three planets: HAT-P-1b, KELT- 18b and WASP-127b. The selection of suitable reference stars assisted in accurately tracking slit losses for the long cadence observations that are needed to achieve the required Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). We employ the Common Mode Correction (CMC) technique, utilizing a white light transit curve to minimize time dependent systematic errors. The observed spectra for WASP-127b and HAT-P-1b agree with previous low-resolution transit spectroscopic observations using other observing facilities. We confirm the presence of Rayleigh scattering in the atmosphere of WASP-127b. In addition, we provide the first low-resolution transmission spectrum for KELT-18b. Modeling the exoplanet atmosphere with HFOSC and available IR observations from HST and SPITZER for WASP-127b and HAT-P-1b shows that HFOSC can be an alternative optical instrument to use in conjunction with IR observations to constrain the atmospheric parameters better.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of a Fall: Stationary and super-Keplerian spiral arms generated by accretion streamers in protostellar discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Late-stage infall onto evolved protoplanetary discs is an important source of material and angular momentum replenishment, and disc substructures. In this paper we used 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations to model streamer-disc interactions for a prograde streamer. The initially parabolic streamer interacts with the disc material to excite disc eccentricity, which can last on the order of $10^5$ years. We found that the spiral arms the streamer excited in the disc can have a variety of pattern speeds, ranging from stationary to super-Keplerian. Spiral arms with various pattern speeds can exist simultaneously, providing a way to diagnose them in observations. Streamer induced spirals appear similar to those generated by a massive outer companion, where the pitch angle of the spiral increases towards the source of the perturbation. Additionally, the spirals arms can show large and sudden pitch angle changes. Streamer induced spirals are long-lived, lasting approximately $3-4\times$ longer than the initial streamer infall timescale ($\sim$$10^4$ years). After the initial interaction with the disc, a long lasting low $m$ azimuthal mode persists in the disc.</description>

      <title>Sulfur in the Moon and Mercury</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter presents a comprehensive overview of the abundances and distribution of S, and the processes that control the behavior of S on the Earth's Moon and on Mercury. The two planetary bodies share notable similarities, such as lacking substantial atmospheres and featuring surfaces with high numbers of impact craters. Both objects are at variably low oxygen fugacities (fO2), where S occurs only in its reduced state as S2-, and forms sulfides. For the Moon, we present a compilation of 55 years of lunar sample analysis, from Apollo 11 to Chang'e 5, including S concentrations and isotopic compositional data. We discuss processes from S in the lunar interior to volcanic degassing from mare basalts and in pyroclastic eruptions. At the beginning of a lunar science renaissance, we highlight where future research into S on the Moon might lead. The knowledge of S on Mercury is almost entirely based on observations by the NASA MESSENGER mission, operational from 2011 to 2014. MESSENGER observed very high S abundances on Mercury with concentrations of up to 4 wt.%. We discuss proposed mechanisms that lead to the high S abundance on Mercury's surface and discuss implications for the planet's interior. Finally, we provide an outlook on how the upcoming ESA/JAXA BepiColombo will advance our understanding of Mercury and the processes controlling S on the planet.</description>

      <title>Reliable Transmission Spectrum Extraction with a Three-Parameter Limb Darkening Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar limb darkening must be properly accounted for to accurately determine the radii of exoplanets at various wavelengths. The standard approach to address limb darkening involves either using laws with coefficients from modelled stellar spectra or determining the coefficients empirically during light curve fitting of the data. Here, we test how accurately three common laws -- quadratic, power, and a three-parameter law -- can reproduce stellar limb darkening at different wavelengths and across a broad range of stars. We show that using a quadratic limb darkening law, which is most frequently employed by the community, leads to wavelength-dependent offsets in retrieved transmission spectra. For planets with high impact parameters ($b$ larger than about 0.5) the amplitude of these offsets can reach 1\% of the transit depth which is some cases is comparable to and can even exceed the expected signals from the planetary atmosphere. Furthermore, the quadratic law causes an offset in the value of the impact parameter when it is determined by fitting the broadband transit light curves. In contrast, using the Kipping--Sing three-parameter law leads to robust retrievals. We advocate the use of this law in retrievals, especially for transits with large impact parameters.</description>

      <title>Detection of faculae in the transit and transmission spectrum of WASP-69b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Transmission spectroscopy is a powerful tool for understanding exoplanet atmospheres. At optical wavelengths, it makes it possible to infer the composition and the presence of aerosols in the atmosphere. However, unocculted stellar activity can result in contamination of atmospheric transmission spectra by introducing spurious slopes and molecular signals.
  Aims: We aim to characterise the atmosphere of the transiting exoplanet WASP-69b, a hot Jupiter orbiting an active K star, and characterise the host star's activity levels. Methods: We obtained three nights of spectrophotometric data with the FORS2 instrument on the VLT, covering a wavelength range of 340-1100 nm. We performed retrievals on the full spectrum with combined stellar activity and planet atmosphere models.
  Results: We directly detect a facula in the form of a hot spot crossing event in one of the transits and indirectly detect unocculted faculae through an apparently decreasing radius towards the blue end of the transmission spectrum. We determine a facula temperature of $\Delta T=+644^{+427}_{-263}$ K for the former and a stellar coverage fraction of around 30% with a temperature of $\Delta T=+231\pm72$ K for the latter. The planetary atmosphere is best fit with a high-altitude cloud deck at 1.4 mbar that mutes atomic and molecular features. We find indications of water and ammonia with $log(H_2O)=-2.01^{+0.54}_{-0.86}$ and $log(NH_3)=-3.4^{+0.96}_{-5.20} respectively and place 3$\sigma$ upper limits on TiO ($10^{-7.65}$) and K ($10^{-7}$). Conclusions. The simultaneous multi-wavelength observations allow us to break the size-contrast degeneracy for facula-crossings, meaning we can obtain temperatures for both the directly and indirectly detected faculae, which are consistent with each other.</description>

      <title>Building a Planet Atmosphere: Fundamental Physics and Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter provides an overview of the basic concepts foundational to atmospheric physics and chemistry. We discuss the retention of atmospheres against thermal evaporation and the global energy balance of planets. We present simple derivations of the vertical profile of an atmosphere, which may be shaped by convective and radiative transport. We then briefly touch upon the three-dimensional atmospheric structure, as shaped by circulation patterns. We describe how the abundances of chemical species in the atmosphere are determined, starting with the assumption of chemical equilibrium and then expanding to various disequilibrium effects. We introduce the particles that can be important components of atmospheres (clouds and hazes) and sketch out some of their complexity. Finally, we review some of the differences between atmospheres of terrestrial and gaseous worlds.</description>

      <title>POSEIDON: A Multidimensional Atmospheric Retrieval Code for Exoplanet Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectroscopic observations of exoplanet atmospheres can reveal the chemical composition, temperature, cloud properties, and (potentially) the habitability of these distant worlds. The inference of such properties is generally enabled by Bayesian atmospheric retrieval algorithms. However, until recently, many retrieval codes have not been publicly available. Here, we describe the open source release of the POSEIDON exoplanet radiative transfer and retrieval code. POSEIDON is a Python package for the 1D, 2D, or 3D modelling and analysis of exoplanet spectra, which is frequently used to interpret Hubble and JWST observations of exoplanet atmospheres. We provide extensive tutorials on both forward modelling and retrievals in POSEIDON's online documentation, which we hope will serve as a helpful resource for the exoplanet atmosphere community.</description>

      <title>ExoMol Line Lists -- LXII: Ro-Vibrational Energy Levels and Line-Strengths for the Propadienediylidene (C3) in its Ground Electronic State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Improved opacities are needed for modelling the atmospheres and evolution of cool carbon-rich stars and extra-solar planets; in particular, contributions made by the astrophysically important propadienediylidene (C$_3$) molecule need, at a minimum, to be determined using a line list which includes all significant transitions in the energy range of interest. We report variational calculations giving ro-vibrational energy levels and corresponding line-strengths for $^{12}$C$_3$, $^{12}$C$^{13}$C$^{12}$C and $^{12}$C$^{12}$C$^{13}$C. In the $^{12}$C$_3$ case we obtain 2166503 ro-vibrational state energies $\le$ 20000 cm$^{-1}$ for the electronic $\tilde{X}^1 \Sigma_g^+$ ground-state. Comparison with experiment indicates a maximum error of +/- 0.03 cm$^{-1}$ in calculated positions of lines involving an upper state energy $\lesssim$ 4000 cm$^{-1}$. For lines with upper state energies $\gtrsim$ 4000 cm$^{-1}$ to have comparable line-position accuracies, conical intersections would need to be accounted for in an adopted potential energy surface. Line lists and associated opacities are provided in the ExoMol Database http://www.exomol.com ).</description>

      <title>Convective mixing in gas giant planets with primordial composition gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09341v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linking atmospheric measurements to the bulk planetary composition and ultimately the planetary origin is a key objective in planetary science. In this work we identify the cases in which the atmospheric composition represents the bulk composition. We simulate the evolution of giant planets considering a wide range of planetary masses ($0.3-2~M_\mathrm{J}$), initial entropies ($8-11~k_\mathrm{B} m_\mathrm{u}^{-1}$), and primordial heavy-element profiles. We find that convective mixing is most efficient at early times (ages $\lesssim 10^7$ years) and that primordial composition gradients can be eroded. In several cases, however, the atmospheric composition can differ widely from the planetary bulk composition, with the exact outcome depending on the details. We show that the efficiency of convection is primarily controlled by the underlying entropy profile: for low primordial entropies of $8-9~k_\mathrm{B} m_\mathrm{u}^{-1}$ convective mixing can be inhibited and composition gradients can persist over billions of years. The scaling of mixing efficiency with mass is governed by the primordial entropy. For the same primordial entropy, low-mass planets mix more efficiently than high mass planets. If the primordial internal entropy would increase with mass, however, this trend could reverse. We also present a new analytical model that predicts convective mixing under the existence of composition (and entropy) gradients. Our results emphasize the complexity in the interpretation of atmospheric abundance measurements and show the great need to better understand the planetary formation process as it plays a key role in determining the planetary evolution and final structure.</description>
