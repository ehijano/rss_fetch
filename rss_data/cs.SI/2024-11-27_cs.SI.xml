      <title>Characterizing the Fragmentation of the Social Media Ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The entertainment-driven dynamics of social media platforms encourage users to engage with like-minded individuals and consume content aligned with their beliefs. These dynamics may amplify polarization by reinforcing shared perspectives and reducing exposure to diverse viewpoints. Simultaneously, users migrate from one platform to another, either forced by moderation policies, such as de-platforming, or spontaneously seeking environments more aligned with their preferences. These migrations foster the specialization and differentiation of the social media ecosystem, with platforms increasingly organized around specific user communities and shared content preferences. This shift marks an evolution from echo chambers enclosed within platforms to "echo platforms", i.e., entire platforms functioning as ideologically homogeneous niches. This study introduces an operational framework to systematically analyze these dynamics, by examining three key dimensions: platform centrality (central vs. peripheral), news consumption (reliable vs questionable), and user base composition (uniform vs diverse). To this aim, we leverage a dataset of 126M URLs posted by nearly 6M users on nine social media platforms, namely Facebook, Reddit, Twitter (now X), YouTube, BitChute, Gab, Parler, Scored, and Voat. We find a clear separation between mainstream and alt-tech platforms, with the second category being characterized by a peripheral role in the social media ecosystem, a greater prevalence of unreliable content, and a heightened ideological uniformity. These findings outline the main dimensions defining the fragmentation and polarization of the social media ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Correlation-Aware Graph Convolutional Networks for Multi-Label Node Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-label node classification is an important yet under-explored domain in graph mining as many real-world nodes belong to multiple categories rather than just a single one. Although a few efforts have been made by utilizing Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs) to learn node representations and model correlations between multiple labels in the embedding space, they still suffer from the ambiguous feature and ambiguous topology induced by multiple labels, which reduces the credibility of the messages delivered in graphs and overlooks the label correlations on graph data. Therefore, it is crucial to reduce the ambiguity and empower the GCNs for accurate classification. However, this is quite challenging due to the requirement of retaining the distinctiveness of each label while fully harnessing the correlation between labels simultaneously. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a Correlation-aware Graph Convolutional Network (CorGCN) for multi-label node classification. By introducing a novel Correlation-Aware Graph Decomposition module, CorGCN can learn a graph that contains rich label-correlated information for each label. It then employs a Correlation-Enhanced Graph Convolution to model the relationships between labels during message passing to further bolster the classification process. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed CorGCN.</description>

      <title>A Graph Neural Network deep-dive into successful counterattacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A counterattack in soccer is a high speed, high intensity direct attack that can occur when a team transitions from a defensive state to an attacking state after regaining possession of the ball. The aim is to create a goal-scoring opportunity by convering a lot of ground with minimal passes before the opposing team can recover their defensive shape. The purpose of this research is to build gender-specific Graph Neural Networks to model the likelihood of a counterattack being successful and uncover what factors make them successful in professional soccer. These models are trained on a total of 20863 frames of synchronized on-ball event and spatiotemporal (broadcast) tracking data. This dataset is derived from 632 games of MLS (2022), NWSL (2022) and international soccer (2020-2022). With this data we demonstrate that gender-specific Graph Neural Networks outperform architecturally identical gender-ambiguous models in predicting the successful outcome of counterattacks. We show, using Permutation Feature Importance, that byline to byline speed, angle to the goal, angle to the ball and sideline to sideline speed are the node features with the highest impact on model performance.
  Additionally, we offer some illustrative examples on how to navigate the infinite solution search space to aid in identifying improvements for player decision making.
  This research is accompanied by an open-source repository containing all data and code, and it is also accompanied by an open-source Python package which simplifies converting spatiotemporal data into graphs. This package also facilitates testing, validation, training and prediction with this data. This should allow the reader to replicate and improve upon our research more easily.</description>

      <title>From Fairness to Infinity: Outcome-Indistinguishable (Omni)Prediction in Evolving Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Professional networks provide invaluable entree to opportunity through referrals and introductions. A rich literature shows they also serve to entrench and even exacerbate a status quo of privilege and disadvantage. Hiring platforms, equipped with the ability to nudge link formation, provide a tantalizing opening for beneficial structural change. We anticipate that key to this prospect will be the ability to estimate the likelihood of edge formation in an evolving graph. Outcome-indistinguishable prediction algorithms ensure that the modeled world is indistinguishable from the real world by a family of statistical tests. Omnipredictors ensure that predictions can be post-processed to yield loss minimization competitive with respect to a benchmark class of predictors for many losses simultaneously, with appropriate post-processing. We begin by observing that, by combining a slightly modified form of the online K29 star algorithm of Vovk (2007) with basic facts from the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, one can derive simple and efficient online algorithms satisfying outcome indistinguishability and omniprediction, with guarantees that improve upon, or are complementary to, those currently known. This is of independent interest. We apply these techniques to evolving graphs, obtaining online outcome-indistinguishable omnipredictors for rich -- possibly infinite -- sets of distinguishers that capture properties of pairs of nodes, and their neighborhoods. This yields, inter alia, multicalibrated predictions of edge formation with respect to pairs of demographic groups, and the ability to simultaneously optimize loss as measured by a variety of social welfare functions.</description>

      <title>Influencers' Reposts and Viral Diffusion: Prestige Bias in Online Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cultural evolution theory suggests that prestige bias (whereby individuals preferentially learn from prestigious figures) has played a key role in human ecological success. However, its impact within online environments remains unclear, particularly regarding whether reposts by prestigious individuals amplify diffusion more effectively than reposts by non-influential users. Here, we analyzed over 55 million posts and 520 million reposts on Twitter (currently X) to examine whether users with high influence scores (hg-index) more effectively amplified the reach of others' content. Our findings indicate that posts shared by influencers were more likely to be further shared compared to those shared by non-influencers. This effect persisted over time, especially in viral posts. Moreover, a small group of highly influential users accounted for approximately half of the information flow within repost cascades. These findings demonstrate a prestige bias in information diffusion within digital society, suggesting that cognitive biases shape content spread through reposting.</description>

      <title>A Network Formation Model Based on Subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07658</link>
      <description>arXiv:1611.07658v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a new class of random graph models for the statistical estimation of network formation -- subgraph generated models (SUGMs). Various subgraphs -- e.g., links, triangles, cliques, stars -- are generated and their union results in a network. We show that SUGMs are identified and establish the consistency and asymptotic distribution of parameter estimators in empirically relevant cases. We show that a simple four-parameter SUGM matches basic patterns in empirical networks more closely than four standard models (with many more dimensions): (i) stochastic block models; (ii) models with node-level unobserved heterogeneity; (iii) latent space models; (iv) exponential random graphs. We illustrate the framework's value via several applications using networks from rural India. We study whether network structure helps enforce risk-sharing and whether cross-caste interactions are more likely to be private. We also develop a new central limit theorem for correlated random variables, which is required to prove our results and is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning Discovers Efficient Decentralized Graph Path Search Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph path search is a classic computer science problem that has been recently approached with Reinforcement Learning (RL) due to its potential to outperform prior methods. Existing RL techniques typically assume a global view of the network, which is not suitable for large-scale, dynamic, and privacy-sensitive settings. An area of particular interest is search in social networks due to its numerous applications. Inspired by seminal work in experimental sociology, which showed that decentralized yet efficient search is possible in social networks, we frame the problem as a collaborative task between multiple agents equipped with a limited local view of the network. We propose a multi-agent approach for graph path search that successfully leverages both homophily and structural heterogeneity. Our experiments, carried out over synthetic and real-world social networks, demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms learned and heuristic baselines. Furthermore, our results show that meaningful embeddings for graph navigation can be constructed using reward-driven learning.</description>
