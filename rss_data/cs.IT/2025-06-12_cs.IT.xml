      <title>Rejection-Sampled Linear Codes for Lossy Compression and Channel Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a linear code combined with rejection sampling can give a capacity-achieving scheme for simulating channels with additive noises with exchangeable distributions. Hence, it can be used in lossy source coding to achieve the rate-distortion function. Interestingly, unlike conventional linear covering codes for lossy compression which concerns the trade-off between the rate and the covering radius, our construction only requires the linear code to have a large distance (not a large covering radius), and is not sensitive to the rate of the linear code. Experiments reveal that our construction can outperform conventional covering codes for lossy source coding with Hamming distortion for a certain range of distortion levels, and performs well even when the blocklength is small (e.g., 24).</description>

      <title>Spectral Efficiency Maximization for DMA-enabled Multiuser MISO with Statistical CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs) offer the potential to achieve large-scale antenna arrays with low power consumption and reduced hardware costs, making them a promising technology for future communication systems. This paper investigates the spectral efficiency (SE) of DMA-enabled multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems in both uplink and downlink transmissions, using only statistical channel state information (CSI) to maximize the ergodic sum rate of multiple users. For the uplink system, we consider two decoding rules: minimum mean square error (MMSE) with and without successive interference cancellation (SIC). For both decoders, we derive closed-form surrogates to substitute the original expressions of ergodic sum rate and formulate tractable optimization problems for designing DMA weights. Then, a weighted MMSE (WMMSE)-based algorithm is proposed to maximize the ergodic sum rate. For the downlink system, we derive an approximate expression for the ergodic sum rate and formulate a hybrid analog/digital beamforming optimization problem that jointly optimizes the digital precoder and DMA weights. A penalty dual decomposition (PDD)-based algorithm is proposed by leveraging the fractional programming framework. Numerical results validate the accuracy of the derived surrogates and highlight the superiority of the proposed algorithms over baseline schemes. It is shown that these algorithms are effective across various DMA settings and are particularly well-suited for system design in fast time-varying channels.</description>

      <title>On the Ding and Helleseth's 8th open problem about optimal ternary cyclic codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cyclic code is a subclass of linear codes and has applications in consumer electronics, data storage systems and communication systems due to the efficient encoding and decoding algorithms. In 2013, Ding, et al. presented nine open problems about optimal ternary cyclic codes. Till now, the 1st, 2nd, 6th and 7th problems were completely solved, the 3rd, 8th and 9th problems were incompletely solved. In this manuscript, we focus on the 8th problem. By determining the root set of some special polynomials over finite fields, we present a counterexample and a sufficient condition for the ternary cyclic code $\mathcal{C}_{(1, e)}$ optimal. Furthermore, basing on the properties of finite fields, we construct a class of optimal ternary cyclic codes with respect to the Sphere Packing Bound, and show that these codes are not equivalent to any known codes.</description>

      <title>BF-Max: an Efficient Bit Flipping Decoder with Predictable Decoding Failure Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Bit-Flipping (BF) decoder, thanks to its very low computational complexity, is widely employed in post-quantum cryptographic schemes based on Moderate Density Parity Check codes in which, ultimately, decryption boils down to syndrome decoding. In such a setting, for security concerns, one must guarantee that the Decoding Failure Rate (DFR) is negligible. Such a condition, however, is very difficult to guarantee, because simulations are of little help and the decoder performance is difficult to model theoretically. In this paper, we introduce a new version of the BF decoder, that we call BF-Max, characterized by the fact that in each iteration only one bit (the least reliable) is flipped. When the number of iterations is equal to the number of errors to be corrected, we are able to develop a theoretical characterization of the DFR that tightly matches with numerical simulations. We also show how BF-Max can be implemented efficiently, achieving low complexity and making it inherently constant time. With our modeling, we are able to accurately predict values of DFR that are remarkably lower than those estimated by applying other approaches.</description>

      <title>Faster-than-Nyquist Signaling is Good for Single-Carrier ISAC: An Analytical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide an analytical study of single-carrier faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). Our derivations show that FTN is advantageous for ISAC, and reveal new insights that these advantages come from the fact that FTN signaling can effectively avoid the spectral aliasing due to the mismatch between the symbol rate and the bandwidth of the shaping pulse. Specifically, the communication spectral efficiency advantages of FTN signaling over time-invariant multipath channels are analytically shown, where both upper- and lower-bounds on the spectral efficiency are derived. We show that the gap between these two bounds corresponds to the potential signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) variation due to the presence of multipath delay and spectral aliasing, which diminishes as the symbol rate grows higher. Particularly, in the limiting case, this SNR variation disappears while the degree of freedom (DoF) of the system attain the maximum. Furthermore, the sensing advantages for FTN signals are verified in terms of the expected normalized squared ambiguity function. We show that FTN signals generally enjoy a more robust ranging performance. More importantly, we prove that FTN signaling can effectively avoid the undesired peaks in the considered ambiguity function along the Doppler dimension, thereby reducing the ambiguities in velocity estimation. All these conclusions are explicitly verified by numerical results.</description>

      <title>Variational Inference Optimized Using the Curved Geometry of Coupled Free Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an optimization framework for variational inference based on the coupled free energy, extending variational inference techniques to account for the curved geometry of the coupled exponential family. This family includes important heavy-tailed distributions such as the generalized Pareto and the Student's t. By leveraging the coupled free energy, which is equal to the coupled evidence lower bound (ELBO) of the inverted probabilities, we improve the accuracy and robustness of the learned model. The coupled generalization of Fisher Information metric and the affine connection. The method is applied to the design of a coupled variational autoencoder (CVAE). By using the coupling for both the distributions and cost functions, the reconstruction metric is derived to still be the mean-square average loss with modified constants. The novelty comes from sampling the heavy-tailed latent distribution with its associated coupled probability, which has faster decaying tails. The result is the ability to train a model with high penalties in the tails, while assuring that the training samples have a reduced number of outliers. The Wasserstein-2 or Fr\'echet Inception Distance of the reconstructed CelebA images shows the CVAE has a 3\% improvement over the VAE after 5 epochs of training.</description>

      <title>Learning Obfuscations Of LLM Embedding Sequences: Stained Glass Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The high cost of ownership of AI compute infrastructure and challenges of robust serving of large language models (LLMs) has led to a surge in managed Model-as-a-service deployments. Even when enterprises choose on-premises deployments, the compute infrastructure is typically shared across many teams in order to maximize the return on investment. In both scenarios the deployed models operate only on plaintext data, and so enterprise data owners must allow their data to appear in plaintext on a shared or multi-tenant compute infrastructure. This results in data owners with private or sensitive data being hesitant or restricted in what data they use with these types of deployments. In this work we introduce the Stained Glass Transform, a learned, stochastic, and sequence dependent transformation of the word embeddings of an LLM which information theoretically provides privacy to the input of the LLM while preserving the utility of model. We theoretically connect a particular class of Stained Glass Transforms to the theory of mutual information of Gaussian Mixture Models. We then calculate a-postiori privacy estimates, based on mutual information, and verify the privacy and utility of instances of transformed embeddings through token level metrics of privacy and standard LLM performance benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Modeling Probabilistic Reduction using Information Theory and Naive Discriminative Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study compares probabilistic predictors based on information theory with Naive Discriminative Learning (NDL) predictors in modeling acoustic word duration, focusing on probabilistic reduction. We examine three models using the Buckeye corpus: one with NDL-derived predictors using information-theoretic formulas, one with traditional NDL predictors, and one with N-gram probabilistic predictors. Results show that the N-gram model outperforms both NDL models, challenging the assumption that NDL is more effective due to its cognitive motivation. However, incorporating information-theoretic formulas into NDL improves model performance over the traditional model. This research highlights a) the need to incorporate not only frequency and contextual predictability but also average contextual predictability, and b) the importance of combining information-theoretic metrics of predictability and information derived from discriminative learning in modeling acoustic reduction.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Dynamic Metasurface Antenna Wireless System: Prototype, Opportunities, and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs) are a promising hybrid analog/digital beamforming technology to realize next-generation wireless systems with low cost, footprint, and power consumption. The research on DMA-empowered wireless systems is still at an early stage, mostly limited to theoretical studies under simplifying assumptions on the one hand and a few antenna-level experiments on the other hand. Substantial knowledge gaps arise from the lack of complete end-to-end DMA-empowered wireless system prototypes. In addition, recently unveiled benefits of strong inter-element mutual coupling (MC) in DMAs remain untapped. Here, we demonstrate a K-band prototype of an end-to-end wireless system based on a DMA with strong inter-element MC. To showcase the flexible control over the DMA's radiation pattern, we present an experimental case study of simultaneously steering a beam to a desired transmitter and a null to an undesired jammer, achieving up to 43~dB discrimination. Using software-defined radios, we transmit and receive QPSK OFDM waveforms to evaluate the bit error rate. We also discuss algorithmic and technological challenges associated with envisioned future evolutions of our end-to-end testbed and real-life DMA-based wireless systems.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Supervised Contrastive learning: A Projection Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (SSCL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for representation learning and has been studied from multiple perspectives, including mutual information and geometric viewpoints. However, supervised contrastive (SupCon) approaches have received comparatively little attention in this context: for instance, while InfoNCE used in SSCL is known to form a lower bound on mutual information (MI), the relationship between SupCon and MI remains unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce ProjNCE, a generalization of the InfoNCE loss that unifies supervised and self-supervised contrastive objectives by incorporating projection functions and an adjustment term for negative pairs. We prove that ProjNCE constitutes a valid MI bound and affords greater flexibility in selecting projection strategies for class embeddings. Building on this flexibility, we further explore the centroid-based class embeddings in SupCon by exploring a variety of projection methods. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and settings demonstrate that ProjNCE consistently outperforms both SupCon and standard cross-entropy training. Our work thus refines SupCon along two complementary perspective--mutual information interpretation and projection design--and offers broadly applicable improvements whenever SupCon serves as the foundational contrastive objective.</description>

      <title>Private Aggregation for Byzantine-Resilient Heterogeneous Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring resilience to Byzantine clients while maintaining the privacy of the clients' data is a fundamental challenge in federated learning (FL). When the clients' data is homogeneous, suitable countermeasures were studied from an information-theoretic perspective utilizing secure aggregation techniques while ensuring robust aggregation of the clients' gradients. However, the countermeasures used fail when the clients' data is heterogeneous. Suitable pre-processing techniques, such as nearest neighbor mixing, were recently shown to enhance the performance of those countermeasures in the heterogeneous setting. Nevertheless, those pre-processing techniques cannot be applied with the introduced privacy-preserving mechanisms.
  We propose a multi-stage method encompassing a careful co-design of verifiable secret sharing, secure aggregation, and a tailored symmetric private information retrieval scheme to achieve information-theoretic privacy guarantees and Byzantine resilience under data heterogeneity. We evaluate the effectiveness of our scheme on a variety of attacks and show how it outperforms the previously known techniques. Since the communication overhead of secure aggregation is non-negligible, we investigate the interplay with zero-order estimation methods that reduce the communication cost in state-of-the-art FL tasks and thereby make private aggregation scalable.</description>

      <title>Corrections to Friis noise factor formulas for cascade networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The signal-to-noise ratio of a multistage cascade network is often estimated using the well-known Friis' formulas for noise factors (or the noise figures in decibels). However, this article addresses the major errors in Friis' noise factor formulas for higher stages. Additionally, we re-derive the correct formulas to calculate the stage-wise noise factors for cascade networks from the basic definition of noise factors. We then present a comparison of our derived formulas with Friis' noise factor formulas. Contrary to Friis' formula, we define the total noise factor of an n-stage cascade network as the product of its stage-wise noise factors. We further validate our derived formulas for a cascade network by correlating them with the expressions for a staircase avalanche photodiode.</description>

      <title>Entropy Functions on Two-Dimensional Faces of Polymatroidal Region of Degree Four: Part I: Problem Formulation and Graph-Coloring Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Characterization of entropy functions is of fundamental importance in information theory. By imposing constraints on their Shannon outer bound, i.e., the polymatroidal region, one obtains the faces of the region and entropy functions on them with special
  structures. In this series of two papers, we characterize entropy functions on the 2-dimensional faces of the polymatroidal region of degree 4. In Part I, we formulate the problem, enumerate all 59 types of 2-dimensional faces of the region by an algorithm, and fully characterize entropy functions on 49 types of them. Among them, those non-trivial cases are mainly characterized by the graph-coloring technique. The entropy functions on the remaining 10 types of faces will be characterized in Part II, among which 8 types are fully characterized, and 2 types are partially characterized.</description>

      <title>On the Complete Monotonicity of R\'enyi Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01819v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the complete monotonicity of R\'enyi entropy along the heat flow. We confirm this property for the order of derivative up to $4$, when the order of R\'enyi entropy is in certain regimes. We also investigate concavity of R\'enyi entropy power and the complete monotonicity of Tsallis entropy. We recover and slightly extend Hung's result on the fourth-order derivative of the Tsallis entropy, and observe that the complete monotonicity holds for Tsallis entropy of order $2$, which is equivalent to that the noise stability with respect to the heat semigroup is completely monotone. Based on this observation, we conjecture that the complete monotonicity holds for Tsallis entropy of all orders $\alpha\in(1,2)$. Our proofs in this paper are based on the techniques of integration-by-parts, sum-of-squares, and curve-fitting.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12590v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a precoding framework for frequency division duplex (FDD) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems with multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO). Specifically, we aim to maximize ergodic sum spectral efficiency (SE) while satisfying a sensing beam pattern constraint defined by the mean squared error (MSE). Our method reconstructs downlink (DL) channel state information (CSI) from uplink (UL) training signals using partial reciprocity, eliminating the need for CSI feedback. To obtain the error covariance matrix of the reconstructed DL CSI, we devise an observed Fisher information-based estimation technique. Leveraging this, to mitigate interference caused by imperfect DL CSI reconstruction and sensing operations, we propose a rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) aided precoder optimization method. This method jointly updates the precoding vector and Lagrange multipliers by solving the nonlinear eigenvalue problem with eigenvector dependency to maximize SE. The numerical results show that the proposed design achieves precise beam pattern control, maximizes SE, and significantly improves the sensing-communication trade-off compared to the state-of-the-art methods in FDD ISAC scenarios.</description>

      <title>Discrete Layered Entropy, Conditional Compression and a Tighter Strong Functional Representation Lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a quantity called discrete layered entropy, which approximates the Shannon entropy within a logarithmic gap. Compared to the Shannon entropy, the discrete layered entropy is piecewise linear, approximates the expected length of the optimal one-to-one non-prefix code, and satisfies an elegant conditioning property. These properties make it useful for approximating the Shannon entropy in linear programming and maximum entropy problems, studying the optimal length of conditional encoding, and bounding the entropy of monotonic mixture distributions. In particular, it can give a bound $I(X;Y)+\log(I(X;Y)+3.4)+1$ for the strong functional representation lemma that significantly improves upon the best known bound.</description>

      <title>Coxeter codes: Extending the Reed-Muller family</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Binary Reed-Muller (RM) codes are defined via evaluations of Boolean-valued functions on $\mathbb{Z}_2^m$. We introduce a class of binary linear codes that generalizes the RM family by replacing the domain $\mathbb{Z}_2^m$ with an arbitrary finite Coxeter group. Like RM codes, this class is closed under duality, forms a nested code sequence, satisfies a multiplication property, and has asymptotic rate determined by a Gaussian distribution. Coxeter codes also give rise to a family of quantum codes for which transversal diagonal $Z$ rotations can perform non-trivial logic.</description>

      <title>Entropic Isoperimetric and Cram\'er--Rao Inequalities for R\'enyi--Fisher Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The de Bruijn identity states that Fisher information is equal to a half of the time-derivative of Shannon differential entropy along heat flow. In the same spirit, a generalized version of Fisher information, which we term the R\'enyi--Fisher information, is defined as a half of the time-derivative of R\'enyi differential entropy along heat flow. Based on this R\'enyi--Fisher information, we establish several sharp R\'enyi-entropic isoperimetric inequalities, which generalize the classic entropic isoperimetric inequality to the R\'enyi setting. Utilizing these isoperimetric inequalities, we extend the classical Cram\'er--Rao inequality from Fisher information to R\'enyi--Fisher information. We then use these generalized Cram\'er--Rao inequalities to determine the signs of derivatives of R\'enyi entropy along heat flow, strengthening existing results on the complete monotonicity of R\'enyi entropy. We lastly explore the implications of our R\'enyi-entropic isoperimetric inequalities for entropy power inequalities. We demonstrate that, unlike in the Shannon entropy case, the classic entropy power inequality does not admit a direct extension to R\'enyi entropy without introducing additional exponents or scaling factors. Furthermore, we establish a sharp R\'enyi entropy power inequality involving a scaling factor under the assumption that one of two independent random vectors is Gaussian.</description>

      <title>Lower Bounds for Learning Quantum States with Single-Copy Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.14438v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problems of quantum tomography and shadow tomography using measurements performed on individual, identical copies of an unknown $d$-dimensional state. We first revisit a known lower bound due to Haah et al. (2017) on quantum tomography with accuracy $\epsilon$ in trace distance, when the measurements choices are independent of previously observed outcomes (i.e., they are nonadaptive). We give a succinct proof of this result. This leads to stronger lower bounds when the learner uses measurements with a constant number of outcomes. In particular, this rigorously establishes the optimality of the folklore ``Pauli tomography" algorithm in terms of its sample complexity. We also derive novel bounds of $\Omega(r^2 d/\epsilon^2)$ and $\Omega(r^2 d^2/\epsilon^2)$ for learning rank $r$ states using arbitrary and constant-outcome measurements, respectively, in the nonadaptive case.
  In addition to the sample complexity, a resource of practical significance for learning quantum states is the number of different measurements used by an algorithm. We extend our lower bounds to the case where the learner performs possibly adaptive measurements from a fixed set of $\exp(O(d))$ measurements. This implies in particular that adaptivity does not give us any advantage using single-copy measurements that are efficiently implementable. We also obtain a similar bound in the case where the goal is to predict the expectation values of a given sequence of observables, a task known as shadow tomography. Finally, in the case of adaptive, single-copy measurements implementable with polynomial-size circuits, we prove that a straightforward strategy based on computing sample means of the given observables is optimal.</description>

      <title>Metric-Entropy Limits on the Approximation of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with fundamental limits on the approximation of nonlinear dynamical systems. Specifically, we show that recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can approximate nonlinear systems -- that satisfy a Lipschitz property and forget past inputs fast enough -- in metric-entropy-optimal manner. As the sets of sequence-to-sequence mappings realized by the dynamical systems we consider are significantly more massive than function classes generally analyzed in approximation theory, a refined metric-entropy characterization is needed, namely in terms of order, type, and generalized dimension. We compute these quantities for the classes of exponentially- and polynomially Lipschitz fading-memory systems and show that RNNs can achieve them.</description>

      <title>UAV-Enabled Data Collection for IoT Networks via Rainbow Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) enabled Internet of things (IoT) systems have become an important part of future wireless communications. To achieve higher communication rate, the joint design of UAV trajectory and resource allocation is crucial. In this paper, a multi-antenna UAV is dispatched to simultaneously collect data from multiple ground IoT nodes (GNs) within a time interval. To improve the sum data collection (SDC) volume from the GNs, the UAV trajectory, the UAV receive beamforming, the scheduling of the GNs, and the transmit power of the GNs are jointly optimized. Since the problem is non-convex and the variables are highly coupled, it is hard to be solved using traditional methods. To find a near-optimal solution, a double-loop structured optimization-driven deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, called rainbow learning based algorithm (RLA), and a fully DRL-based algorithm are proposed to solve the problem effectively. Specifically, the outer-loop of the RLA utilizes a fusion deep Q-network to optimize the UAV trajectory, GN scheduling, and power allocation, while the inner-loop optimizes receive beamforming by successive convex approximation. Simulation results verify that the proposed algorithms outperform two benchmarks with significant improvement in SDC volumes, energy efficiency, and fairness.</description>

      <title>The Causal Information Bottleneck and Optimal Causal Variable Abstractions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00535v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To effectively study complex causal systems, it is often useful to construct abstractions of parts of the system by discarding irrelevant details while preserving key features. The Information Bottleneck (IB) method is a widely used approach to construct variable abstractions by compressing random variables while retaining predictive power over a target variable. Traditional methods like IB are purely statistical and ignore underlying causal structures, making them ill-suited for causal tasks. We propose the Causal Information Bottleneck (CIB), a causal extension of the IB, which compresses a set of chosen variables while maintaining causal control over a target variable. This method produces abstractions of (sets of) variables which are causally interpretable, give us insight about the interactions between the abstracted variables and the target variable, and can be used when reasoning about interventions. We present experimental results demonstrating that the learned abstractions accurately capture causal relations as intended.</description>

      <title>Energy-and Spectral-Efficiency Trade-off in Distributed Massive-MIMO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01271v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a fundamental yet under-explored trade-off between energy efficiency (EE) and spectral efficiency (SE) in distributed massive MIMO (D-mMIMO) systems. Unlike conventional EE-SE trade-off studies that primarily focus on transmission power, D-mMIMO systems introduce new energy consumption factors including fronthaul signaling and distributed signal processing, which are heavily influenced by AP-UE association. This work highlights the critical need for a system-level EE-SE trade-off framework that accounts for these unique aspects of D-mMIMO. We formulate a joint optimization problem that maximizes EE while satisfying uplink sum-SE constraints, through the coordinated design of power allocation and AP-UE association strategies. By explicitly considering both transmission and infrastructure-related energy costs, our approach enables energy-aware network design without compromising throughput. Numerical simulations demonstrate the substantial impact of dynamic AP-UE association and power control on the EE-SE trade-off, providing actionable insights for an efficient deployment of large-scale distributed MIMO networks in next-generation wireless systems.</description>

      <title>NestQuant: Nested Lattice Quantization for Matrix Products and LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a critical technique for efficient deployment of large language models (LLMs). This work proposes NestQuant, a novel PTQ scheme for weights and activations that is based on self-similar nested lattices. Recent works have mathematically shown such quantizers to be information-theoretically optimal for low-precision matrix multiplication. We implement a practical low-complexity version of NestQuant based on Gosset lattice, making it a drop-in quantizer for any matrix multiplication step (e.g., in self-attention, MLP etc). For example, NestQuant quantizes weights, KV-cache, and activations of Llama-3-8B to 4 bits, achieving perplexity of 6.6 on wikitext2. This represents more than 55% reduction in perplexity gap with respect to unquantized model (perplexity of 6.14) compared to state-of-the-art Metas SpinQuant (perplexity 7.3), OstQuant (7.3) and QuaRot (8.2). Comparisons on bigger models (up to 70B) and on various LLM evaluation benchmarks confirm uniform superiority of NestQuant.</description>

Abstract: This article presents a formal model demonstrating that genuine autonomy, the ability of a system to self-regulate and pursue objectives, fundamentally implies computational unpredictability from an external perspective. we establish precise mathematical connections, proving that for any truly autonomous system, questions about its future behavior are fundamentally undecidable. this formal undecidability, rather than mere complexity, grounds a principled distinction between autonomous and non-autonomous systems. our framework integrates insights from computational theory and biology, particularly regarding emergent agency and computational irreducibility, to explain how novel information and purpose can arise within a physical universe. the findings have significant implications for artificial intelligence, biological modeling, and philosophical concepts like free will.</description>

      <title>An example showing that Schrijver's $\vartheta$-function need not upper bound the Shannon capacity of a graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This letter addresses an open question concerning a variant of the Lov\'{a}sz $\vartheta$ function, which was introduced by Schrijver and independently by McEliece et al. (1978). The question of whether this variant provides an upper bound on the Shannon capacity of a graph was explicitly stated by Bi and Tang (2019). This letter presents an explicit example of a Tanner graph on 32 vertices, which shows that, in contrast to the Lov\'{a}sz $\vartheta$ function, this variant does not necessarily upper bound the Shannon capacity of a graph. The example, previously outlined by the author in a recent paper (2024), is presented here in full detail, making it easy to follow and verify. By resolving this question, the note clarifies a subtle but significant distinction between these two closely related graph invariants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An $[[n,k,d]]$ quantum maximum-distance-separable code maps $k$ source qudits to $n$ coded qudits such that any $n-(d-1)$ coded qudits may recover all source qudits and $n = k + 2 (d-1)$. The entropy of the joint state of the reference system of $k$ qudits and the $n$ coded qudits is fully characterized - the joint state must be pure, i.e., has entropy zero; and any sub-system whose number of qudits is at most half of $k+n$, the total number of qudits in the joint state must be maximally mixed, i.e., has entropy equal to its size.</description>

      <title>Markov Blanket Density and Free Energy Minimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a continuous, information-theoretic extension of the Free Energy Principle through the concept of Markov blanket density, i.e., a scalar field that quantifies the degree of conditional independence between internal and external states at each point in space (ranging from 0 for full coupling to 1 for full separation). It demonstrates that active inference dynamics (including the minimization of variational and expected free energy) naturally emerge from spatial gradients in this density, making Markov blanket density a necessary foundation for the definability and coherence of the Free Energy Principle. These ideas are developed through a mathematically framework that links density gradients to precise and testable dynamics, offering a foundation for novel predictions and simulation paradigms.</description>
