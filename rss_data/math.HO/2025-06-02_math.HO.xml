      <title>Understanding the Monty Hall Problem Through a Quantum Measurement Analogy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle known for its counterintuitive solution, revealing fundamental discrepancies between mathematical reasoning and human intuition. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel explanatory framework inspired by quantum measurement theory. Specifically, we conceptualize the hosts' actions-opening doors to reveal non-prizes-as analogous to quantum measurements that cause asymmetric collapses of the probability distribution. This quantum-inspired interpretation not only clarifies why the intuitive misunderstanding arises but also provides generalized formulas consistent with standard Bayesian results. We further validate our analytical approach using Monte Carlo simulations across various problem settings, demonstrating precise agreement between theoretical predictions and empirical outcomes. Our quantum analogy thus offers a powerful pedagogical tool, enhancing intuitive understanding of conditional probability phenomena through the lens of probability redistribution and quantum-like measurement operations.</description>

      <title>Electrostatic Origins of the Dirichlet Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Dirichlet Principle is an approach to solving the Dirichlet problem by means of a Dirichlet energy integral. It is part of the folklore of mathematics that the genesis of this argument was motivated by physical analogy involving electrostatic fields. The story goes something like this: If an electrostatic potential is prescribed on the boundary of a region, it will extend to a potential in the interior of the region which is harmonic when the electric field is in stable equilibrium, and that electrostatic field has minimum Dirichlet energy. The details of this argument are seldom given and where they are, they are typically scant, redacted, and speculative while often omitting either physics details or mathematics details. The purpose of this article is to give a detailed reconstruction of the electrostatic argument by combining accounts in several contemporary and historical disparate sources. Particular attention is given to explaining the frequently omitted physics and mathematical details and how they fit together to give the physical motivation.</description>

      <title>An Anarchist Approach to the Undergraduate Mathematics Curriculum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contemporary anarchism centers around three tenets: (1) a constant challenge of and resistance to all forms of domination, (2) so-called "prefigurative politics", in which all decisions are made in a manner that is consistent with a set of non-hierarchical values such as equality, decentralization and voluntary cooperation, (3) a focus on diversity and open-endedness (Gordon, 2008). Within this philosophy the notion of end goals becomes moot; progress, then, is measured by process, in which the values of diversity, pluralism, cooperation, autonomy and experimentation are celebrated. In this perspective piece we propose anarchism as a philosophical framework to address the perceived cognitive dissonances of the current undergraduate mathematics curriculum. Are learning outcomes appropriate in an anarchist approach to education? How can we address the power dynamics of grading and assessment? How can assessment be done in the context of a process-based and horizontal approach that celebrates diversity and autonomy? Should grades be used, and if so, how could they be assigned non-hierarchically? At its core, anarchism aims at aligning thoughts and actions, and we argue that an anarchist viewpoint on undergraduate mathematics addresses the cognitive dissonances that currently plague our curriculum. We propose food for thought for individual instructors' practice, including ideas for incremental and large-scale changes.</description>

      <title>Sophomore's dream function: asymptotics, complex plane behavior and relation to the error function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10936v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sophomore's dream sum $S=\sum_{n=1}^\infty n^{-n}$ is extended to the function $f(t,a)=t\int_{0}^{1}(ax)^{-tx}dx$ with $f(1,1)=S$. Asymptotic behavior for a large $|t|$ is obtained, which is exponential for $t&gt;0$ and $t&lt;0,a&gt;1$, and inverse-logarithmic for $t&lt;0,a&lt;1$. An advanced approximation includes a half-derivative of the exponent and is expressed in terms of the error function. This approach provides excellent interpolation description in the complex plane. The function $f(t,a)$ demonstrates for $a&gt;1$ oscillating behavior along the imaginary axis with slowly increasing amplitude and the period of $2\pi iea$, modulation by high-frequency oscillations being present. Also, $f(t,a)$ has non-trivial zeros in the left complex half-plane with Im$t_n \simeq 2(n-1/8)\pi e/a$ for $a&gt;1$. The results obtained describe analytical integration of the function $x^{tx}$.</description>
