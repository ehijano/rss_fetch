      <title>Weak ferrimagnets of the YFe1-xCrxO3 type: negative magnetization and spin reorientation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present an analysis of magnetic properties of weak ferrimagnets of the YFe$_{1-x}$Cr$_x$O$_3$ type. Taking into account the main spin interactions - isotropic Heisenberg superexchange, antisymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya exchange, single-ion spin anisotropy - calculations of the free energy, concentration and temperature dependences of magnetization were carried out within a framework of a molecular field model. In particular, the model demonstrates the phenomena of temperature compensation and negative magnetization, as well as spin reorientation. The compensation temperature reaches room temperature T = 300 K in a composition with x = 0.45. The existence of magnetic structures of the $G_{xyz}$ type with the spatial orientation of the Neel vector is predicted.</description>

      <title>Zero Energy States for Commensurate Hopping Modulation of a Generalized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Chain in the Presence of a Domain Wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect of domain wall (DW) on zero-energy states (ZESs) in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain. The chain features two fractional ZESs in the presence of such DW, one of which is localized at the edge and the other bound at the location of DW. This zero-energy DW state exhibits interesting modifications when hopping modulation is tuned periodically. We studied the energy spectra for commensurate frequencies $\theta=\pi,\pi/2,\pi/3$ and $\pi/4$. Following the recent study by the author of this paper [S. Mandal, S. Kar, Phys. Rev. B 109, 195124 (2024)], we showed numerically, along with physical intuition, that one ZES can bound at the DW position only for commensurate frequency $\theta=\frac{\pi}{2s+1}$ for zero or an integer $s$ values, while for $\theta=\frac{\pi}{2s}$ with nonzero or an integer $s$ value they appear only at the edges of the chain. We verify our numerical results by using exact analytical techniques. Both analyses indicate the realization of the Jackiw-Rebbi modes for our model only with $\theta=\frac{\pi}{2s+1}$. Moreover, the localization of zero-energy edge and DW states are investigated which reveals their localized (extended) nature for smaller (larger) $\Delta_{0}$ (amplitude of DW). The localization of topological DW states is suppressed as the width of DW ($\xi$) increases (typically scaled as $\sim 1/\xi$) while the edge state shows an extended behavior only for the large $\xi$ limit.</description>

      <title>Topological dipoles of quantum skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are spatially localized whirls of spin moments in two dimension, featuring a nontrivial topological charge and a well-defined topological charge density. We demonstrate that the quantum dynamics of magnetic skyrmions is governed by a dipole conservation law associated with the topological charge, akin to that in fracton theories of excitations with constrained mobility. The dipole conservation law enables a natural definition of the collective coordinate to specify the skymion's position, which ultimately leads to a greatly simplified equation of motion in the form of the Thiele equation. In this formulation, the skyrmion mass, whose existence is often debated, actually vanishes. As a result, an isolated skyrmion is intrinsically pinned to be immobile and cannot move at a constant velocity. In a spin-wave theory, we show that such dynamics corresponds to a precise cancellation between a highly nontrivial motion of the quasi-classical skyrmion spin texture and a cloud of quantum fluctuations in the form of spin waves. Given this quenched kinetic energy of quantum skyrmions, we identify close analogies to the bosonic quantum Hall problem. In particular, the topological charge density is shown to obey the Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman algebra that describes neutral modes of the lowest Landau level in the fractional quantum Hall problem. Consequently, the conservation of the topological dipole suggests that magnetic skyrmion materials offer a promising platform for exploring fractonic phenomena with close analogies to fractional quantum Hall states.</description>

      <title>Berry Phase and Quantum Oscillation from Multi-orbital Coadjoint-orbit Bosonization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an effective field theory for a multi-orbital fermionic system using the method of coadjoint orbits for higher-dimensional bosonization. The dynamical bosonic fields are single-particle distribution functions defined on the phase space. We show that when projecting to a single band, Berry phase effects naturally emerge. In particular, we consider the de Haas-van Alphen effect of a 2d Fermi surface, and show that the oscillation of orbital magnetization in an external field is offset by the Berry phase accumulated by the cyclotron around the Fermi surface. Beyond previously known results, we show that this phase shift holds even for interacting systems, in which the single-particle Berry phase is replaced by the static anomalous Hall conductance. Furthermore, we obtain the correction to the amplitudes of de Haas-van Alphen oscillations due to Berry curvature effects.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism in modified Lieb lattice Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16421v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the emergence of altermagnetism from repulsive interactions for electrons on the Lieb lattice as a model of quasi-2D oxychalcogenides with the so-called "anti-CuO$_{2}$" lattice structure. A comprehensive study of the Lieb lattice Hubbard model, using unrestricted Hartree-Fock and exact diagonalization techniques, establishes the presence of spin-${1\over 2}$ altermagnetic Mott insulating ground state for average electron densities of 2 and 4 per unit cell. Both phases show the characteristic spin splitting in the electron bands as well as in the magnon bands, as indicated by solutions of an effective spin-${1\over 2}$ Heisenberg model that we construct. We also provide evidence for altermagnetic metal formation in the electron- and hole-doped Mott state, giving rise to Fermi surfaces with $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave spin splitting and quasi-one-dimensional characteristics.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Anisotropies and Skyrmion Lattice Related to Magnetic Quadrupole Interactions of the RKKY Mechanism in Frustrated Spin-Trimer System Gd$_{3}$Ru$_{4}$Al$_{12}$ with a Breathing Kagome Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of the magnetic quadrupole (MQ) interactions in Gd$_{3}$Ru$_{4}$Al$_{12}$ which is known as a frustrated spin system and as a host material of skyrmion with a sentrosymmetric crystal structure are discussed. The MQ interactions between ferromagnetic (FM) spin trimers with imperfect FM directivity are deduced from synthesis of dipole Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interactions. The Hamiltonian which includes both the MQ interactions and dipole interactions is proposed, and magnetic anisotropies, magnetic phase transitions and contribution of the MQ interactions to stabilize the skyrmion lattice (SkL) are discussed based on this Hamiltonian. Degrees of MQ freedom carried by the trimers contribute to stabilizing SkL which appears at finite temperatures.</description>

      <title>Non-Invertible Symmetries as Condensation Defects in Finite-Group Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent work, we developed a method to construct invertible and non-invertible symmetries of finite-group gauge theories as topological domain walls on the lattice. In the present work, we consider abelian and non-abelian finite-group gauge theories in general spacetime dimension, and demonstrate how to realize these symmetries as condensation defects, i.e., as suitable insertions of lower dimensional topological operators. We then compute the fusion rules and action of these symmetries using their condensation expression and the algebraic properties of the lower dimensional objects that make them. We illustrate the discussion in $\mathbb{Z}_N$ gauge theory, where we derive the correspondence between domain walls, labeled by subgroups and actions for the doubled gauge group, and higher gauging condensation defects, labeled by subalgebras of the global symmetry. As a primary application, we obtain the condensation expression for the invertible symmetries of abelian gauge theories defined by outer automorphisms of the gauge group. We also show how to use these ideas to derive the action for certain non-abelian groups. For instance, one can obtain the action for the Dihedral group $\mathbb{D}_4$ by gauging a swap symmetry of $\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory.</description>

      <title>Observation of Orbital-Selective Band Reconstruction in an Anisotropic Antiferromagnetic Kagome Metal TbTi3Bi4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbital selectivity is pivotal in dictating the phase diagrams of multiorbital systems, with prominent examples including the orbital-selective Mott phase and superconductivity, etc. The intercalation of anisotropic layers represents an effective method for enhancing orbital selectivity and, thereby shaping the low-energy physics of multiorbital systems. Despite its potential, related experimental studies remain limited. In this work, we systematically examine the interplay between orbital selectivity and magnetism in the newly discovered anisotropic kagome TbTi3Bi4 single crystal, and report a unidirectional, orbital-selective band reconstruction within the antiferromagnetic (AFM) state. By combining soft X-ray and vacuum ultraviolet angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements with orbital-resolved density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we identify that the band reconstruction is a manifestation of the AFM order, driven by a 1/3 nesting instability of the intercalated Tb 5dxz orbitals. Such an orbital-selective modulation leads the unusual momentum-dependent band folding and the emergence of symmetry-protected Dirac cones only at the M1 point. More importantly, the discovery of orbital-selective 3 x 1 AFM order offers crucial insights into the underlying mechanism of the fractional magnetization plateau in this Kagome AFM metal. Our findings not only underscore the essential role of both conducting and localized electrons in determining the magnetic orders of LnTi3Bi4 (Ln = Lanthanide) kagome metals but also offer a pathway for manipulating magnetism through selective control of anisotropic electronic structures.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism and Strain Induced Altermagnetic Transition in Cairo Pentagonal Monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism, a recently discovered class of magnetic order characterized by vanishing net magnetization and spin-splitting band structures, has garnered significant research attention. In this work, we introduce a novel two-dimensional system that exhibits $g$-wave altermagnetism and undergoes a strain-induced transition from $g$-wave to $d$-wave altermagnetism. This system can be realized in an unconventional monolayer Cairo pentagonal lattice, for which we present a realistic tight-binding model that incorporates both magnetic and non-magnetic sites. Furthermore, we demonstrate that non-trivial band topology can emerge in this system by breaking the symmetry that protects the spin-polarized nodal points. Finally, \emph{ab initio} calculations on several candidate materials, such as FeS$_2$ and Nb$_2$FeB$_2$, which exhibit symmetry consistent with the proposed tight-binding Hamiltonian, are also presented. These findings open new avenues for exploring spintronic devices based on altermagnetic systems.</description>

      <title>Magnetic structure of polar magnet GaV$_4$Se$_8$ with N\'eel-type skyrmion lattice probed by $^{51}$V NMR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the magnetization and the $^{51}$V NMR measurements in the polar magnet GaV$_4$Se$_8$ in which a magnetic skyrmion lattice appears in the structural domain with the polar axis parallel to the magnetic field. Although we successfully separate the $^{51}$V NMR signals in the domain from those in the other structural domains, only the high-frequency region of NMR spectrum is observed due to a significant increase of the spin-echo decay rate in the low-frequency region. In $B_{\rm{ext}}\parallel[111]$, we find the NMR signals from the supermagnetized cycloidal state in the parallel domains as well as from the conical state in domains where the polar axis is tilted from the magnetic field. No NMR signal from the skyrmion lattice state is observed, suggesting a significant increase of the decay rate by additional low-energy excitations caused by dynamics of the skyrmions. In $B_{\rm{ext}}\parallel[001]$, where all the structural domains are magnetically equivalent, multiple NMR peaks converge into one peak at the saturation magnetic field. This field dependence is explained by the closing of magnetic cones as approaching the forced-ferromagnetic state.</description>

      <title>Supercell Wannier Functions and Emergent Kondo Lattices in Topological Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional theories for Mott insulators involve well-localized electronic orbitals. This picture fails in the presence of topological obstructions in Chern bands which prevent the formation of exponentially localized orbitals and are instead often viewed by analogy to Landau levels. Here, we show that strong interactions in fractionally-filled topological bands realize a class of Mott insulating states on emergent topological Kondo lattices. These can be naturally described by a partial Wannier basis of N-1 exponentially-localized orbitals for an N-band manifold with net non-zero Chern number. Choosing a gauge which breaks translation symmetry, we construct a supercell basis which segregates an isolated topological band into well-localized supercell Wannier orbitals that can host the local moments of a Mott insulating state, as well as an itinerant power-law-localized orbital that retains the topological obstruction. Together, they constitute a spontaneous Kondo lattice. We study fractionally-filled interacting quantum spin Hall bands in the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model as well as twisted bilayers of MoTe2 at -1/3 filling. We demonstrate that strong short-ranged Coulomb interactions can stabilize a new class of topological Mott insulating states with broken translation symmetry and antiferromagnetic order, which compete with fractional Chern insulating states. Our results predict a new scenario for time-reversal-symmetric interacting topological bands in solids, beyond conventional Landau level paradigms for the fractional quantum Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Topological Semimetal KAlGe with Novel Electronic Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compounds with the anti-PbFCl structure exhibit a variety of electronic instabilities and intriguing physical properties. NaAlSi and NaAlGe are similar topological nodal-line semimetals, but they have distinct properties. NaAlSi is a superconductor at 6.8 K, whereas NaAlGe is an insulator with a pseudogap of approximately 100 K. Using the potassium-indium flux method, we succeeded in synthesizing a single crystal of KAlGe, a new anti-PbFCl compound. First principles electronic structure calculations reveal that KAlGe is isoelectronic with NaAlSi and NaAlGe. KAlGe undergoes a metal-to-metal transition at 89 K and exhibits no superconductivity above 1.8 K. The low temperature phase has significantly lower carrier density and extremely high mobility, similar to Dirac electron systems. Furthermore, X-ray diffraction experiments show a structural change that breaks the fourfold symmetry during the phase transition. Electron-phonon interactions may be responsible for superconductivity in NaAlSi, whereas excitonic electron-hole interactions are thought to play an important role in KAlGe and possibly NaAlGe. Our findings demonstrate that fascinating physics lies within the compound family.</description>

      <title>Tuning the order of a deconfined quantum critical point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model in the assisted hopping limit, where direct electron hopping is subdominant. At fixed electron-phonon coupling and in the absence of Coulomb interactions, the model shows a deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) between a $(\pi,0)$ valence bond solid in the adiabatic limit and a quantum antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase at high phonon frequencies. Here, we show that by adding terms to the model that reinforce the AFM phase, thereby lowering the critical phonon frequency, the quantum phase transition becomes strongly first order. Our results do not depend on the symmetry of the model. In fact, adding a Hubbard-$U$ term to the model lowers the O(4) symmetry of the model to SU(2) such that the DQCP we observe has the same symmetries as other models that account for similar quantum phase transitions.</description>

      <title>High temperature antiferromagnetism in ultrathin SrRu2O6 nanosheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quest for room-temperature nanoscale magnets remains a central challenge, driven by their promising applications in quantum technologies. Layered $4d$ and $5d$ transition metal oxides with high magnetic ordering temperatures offer significant potential in this context. We explore ultrathin \ce{SrRu2O6} nanosheets using first-principles calculations, complemented by the classical Heisenberg Monte Carlo simulations. Remarkably, these nanosheets exhibit robust antiferromagnetic ordering with N\'eel temperatures exceeding 430 K, despite the enhanced spin fluctuations characteristic of two-dimensional systems. Surface-termination-induced intrinsic charge doping introduces complexity to the magnetism, resulting in an insulator-to-metal transition and renormalized N\'eel temperatures in doped systems. A detailed microscopic analysis reveals distinct mechanisms underlying the magnetic behavior in electron- and hole-doped nanosheets. These findings provide a foundation for advancing theoretical and experimental studies in the largely unexplored realm of correlated oxides at the two-dimensional limit.</description>

      <title>Dynamical quantum typicality: A simple method for investigating transport properties applied to the Holstein model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the practical applicability of the so-called dynamical quantum typicality (QT) for the calculation of the frequency dependent mobility in electron-phonon systems. The QT approach relies on the insight that even a single, randomly chosen pure state within a high-dimensional Hilbert space can effectively represent the entire statistical ensemble. This significantly simplifies the calculation of the current-current correlation function, which in turn, within the linear response theory, is directly related to the frequency dependent mobility. The time evolution operator $e^{-iHt}$ and the Boltzmann factor $e^{-\beta H}$ are handled using the Runge-Kutta scheme. As a result, we achieve a simple, transparent method that is easy to implement, with computer memory requirements and computational effort scaling linearly with the Hilbert space dimension and the time grid length. Although this approach is quite general, we restrict our numerical results to the Holstein model for which several reliable benchmarks are available. We demonstrate that the QT effectively complements other currently employed methods by overcoming some of their inherent limitations.</description>

      <title>Interplay of Kitaev Interaction and Off-diagonal Exchanges: Exotic Phases and Quantum Phase Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aligning with the everlasting search for quantum spin liquids (QSLs), identifying the QSL in Kitaev magnets has garnered great research interest during the past decade and remains nevertheless an enormous challenge. One of the major difficulties lies in that Kitaev QSL is typically fragile against competing interactions like off-diagonal exchanges, which are ubiquitous in real materials due to spin-orbit coupling and crystal-field effect. This, in turn, gives rise to many intriguing field-induced novel phases and thermal Hall effect. In this review, we will focus on the interplay of Kitaev interaction and off-diagonal $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma'$ exchanges from a numerical perspective. This review discusses some representative exotic phases such as $\Gamma$ spin liquid, nematic ferromagnet, spin-flop phase, and distinct chiral-spin states with spontaneously time-reversal symmetry breaking. It also presents quantum phase diagrams of anisotropic Kitaev-$\Gamma$ chains that exhibit kaleidoscopes of both ordered and disordered phases.</description>

      <title>Infrared properties of two-dimensional $\mathrm{SU}(N)/H$ nonlinear $\sigma$ models at nonzero $\theta$ angles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A general strategy is proposed to explore the low-energy properties of two-dimensional nonlinear $\sigma$ models with $\theta$ terms. We demonstrate its application to nonlinear $\sigma$ models with the target space $\text{SU($N$)}$/H, which include $\mathbb{C}P^{N-1}$, complex Grassmannian manifolds as well as the flag $\text{SU($N$)}/\text{U(1)}^{N-1}$ and $\text{SU($N$)})/\text{SO($N$)}$ manifolds. By analyzing the symmetry and its anomaly content, we realize these nonlinear $\sigma$ models through perturbations added to the SU(N)$_1$ conformal field theory. For the flag-manifold $\text{SU($N$)}/\text{U(1)}^{N-1}$ and $\text{SU($N$)})/\text{SO($N$)}$ models, those perturbations are shown to correspond to the marginal current-current operator with the specific sign which leads to a massless renormalization group flow to the SU(N)$_1$ fixed point. In contrast, a massive regime with a two-fold ground-state degeneracy is found for the $\mathbb{C}P^{N-1}$ ($N &gt;2$) and Grassmannian nonlinear $\sigma$ models at $\theta=\pi$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Phase Diagram of the Bilayer Kitaev-Heisenberg Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the ground-state phase diagram of the spin-$1/2$ Kitaev-Heisenberg model on the bilayer honeycomb lattice with large-scale tensor network calculations based on the infinite projected entangled pair state technique as well as high-order series expansions. We find that beyond various magnetically ordered phases, including ferromagnetic, zigzag, antiferromagnetic (AFM) and stripy states, two extended quantum spin liquid phases arise in the proximity of the Kitaev limit. While these ordered phases also appear in the monolayer Kitaev-Heisenberg model, our results further show that a valence bond solid state emerges in a relatively narrow range of parameter space between the AFM and stripy phases, which can be adiabatically connected to isolated Heisenberg dimers. Our results highlight the importance of considering interlayer interactions on the emergence of novel quantum phases in the bilayer Kitaev materials.</description>

      <title>Pressure Evolution of Magnetic Structure and Quasiparticle Excitations in Anisotropic Frustrated Zigzag Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frustrated magnetic systems with anisotropic exchange interactions have been recognized as key platforms for discovering exotic quantum states and quasiparticles. In this study, we report the pressure evolution of magnetic structures and quasiparticle excitations in the frustrated semiconductor YbCuS2, characterized by Yb3+ zigzag chains with competing exchange interactions. At ambient pressure, YbCuS2 exhibits a magnetic transition at TN ~ 0.95 K, forming an incommensurate helical magnetic order. Under hydrostatic pressure of 1.6 GPa, TN increases to 1.17 K, and the magnetic structure changes to a commensurate one, which can be regarded as an odd-parity magnetic multipole order. Remarkably, pressure suppresses the gapless quasiparticle excitations. These findings suggest that pressure alters the exchange interactions between the Yb ions, affecting both the magnetic ground state and the quasiparticle excitations. Our results highlight the pivotal role of anisotropic interactions in one-dimensionality to stabilize the complex quantum phases, offering insights into the interplay among frustration, dimensionality, multipoles and emergent quasiparticles.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous achievement of record-breaking colossal magnetoresistance and angular magnetoresistance in an antiferromagnetic semiconductor EuSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetoresistance effect lays the foundation for spintronics, magnetic sensors and hard drives. The pursuit of magnetic materials with colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) and/or angular magnetoresistance (AMR) has attracted enduring research interest and extensive investigations over past decades. Here we report on the discovery of field-induced record-breaking CMR of ~ -10^14 % and AMR ~ 10^14% achieved simultaneously in an antiferromagnetic rare-earth dichalcogenide EuSe2. Such intriguing observations are attributed to strong magnetic anisotropy and magnetic-field induced antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic transition of the localized Eu2+ spins, which in turn closes the bandgap by lifting the degeneracy of Se-5p bands near Fermi level. Our DFT calculations perfectly replicate the experimental findings based on the Brillouin function and carries transport model. The present work provides a potential simple antiferromagnetic material for achieving angle-sensitive spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Deconfined classical criticality in the anisotropic quantum spin-1/2 XY model on the square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The anisotropic quantum spin-1/2 XY model on a linear chain was solved by Lieb, Schultz, and Mattis in 1961 and shown to display a continuous quantum phase transition at the O(2) symmetric point separating two gapped phases with competing Ising long-range order. For the square lattice, the following is known. The two competing Ising ordered phases extend to finite temperatures, up to a boundary where a transition to the paramagnetic phase occurs, and meet at the O(2) symmetric critical line along the temperature axis that ends at a tricritical point at the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature where the two competing phases meet the paramagnetic phase. We show that the first-order zero-temperature (quantum) phase transition that separates the competing phases as a function of the anisotropy parameter is smoothed by thermal fluctuations into deconfined classical criticality.</description>

      <title>Refining the Two-Band Model for Highly Compensated Semimetals Using Thermoelectric Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In studying compensated semimetals, the two-band model has proven extremely useful to capture electrical conductivities with intuitive parameters of densities and mobilities of electron-like and hole-like carriers, as well as to predict their magnetic field dependence. Yet, it rarely offers practical insight into magneto-thermoelectric properties. Here, we report the field dependence of thermoelectric (TE) coefficients in a highly compensated semimetal NbSb$_2$, where we find the Seebeck ($S_{xx}$) and Nernst ($S_{xy}$) coefficients increase quadratically and linearly with field, respectively. Such field dependences were predicted by the semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory and the Mott relation of the two-band system, and they are realized when two conditions are simultaneously met [1]: the multiple of cyclotron frequency ($\omega_c$) and relaxation time ($\tau$) is much larger than one, $\omega_c\tau \gg 1$ and the tangent of Hall angle ($\theta_H$) is much smaller than one, $\tan\theta_H \ll 1$. We use the relation between two carrier densities $n_e$ (electron-like) and $n_h$ (hole-like) derived from the field dependence of the TE coefficients, to refine the two-band model fittings. The compensation factor ($\frac{|\Delta n|}{n_e}$, where $\Delta n = n_e-n_h$) is found two orders of magnitude smaller than what was found in the unrestricted fitting and hence the larger saturation field scale for magnetoresistance. Within the framework of the semiclassical theory, we deduce that the thermoelectric Hall angle $\tan\theta_{\gamma} = \frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}}$ can be expressed $\big(\frac{|\Delta n|}{n_e}\times \omega_c\tau\big)^{-1}$. Our findings offer crucial insights not only for identifying the empirical conditions for the field-induced enhancement of the TE performance but also for engineering efficient thermoelectric devices based on semimetallic materials.</description>

      <title>Field-Induced Magnon Decay, Magnon Shadows, and Roton Excitations in the Honeycomb Antiferromagnet YbBr$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the search for quantum many-body phenomena in magnetic materials has a strong focus on highly frustrated systems, even unfrustrated quantum magnets show a multitude of unconventional phenomena in their spin excitation spectra. YbBr$_3$ is an excellent realization of the $S = 1/2$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice, and we have performed detailed spectroscopic experiments with both unpolarized and polarized neutrons at all applied magnetic fields up to saturation. We observe extensive excitation continua, which cause strong renormalization and the decay of single magnons at higher fields, while coherent features include field-induced ``shadows'' of the single magnons and the spectacular emergence of a roton-like excitation. To guide and interpret our experiments, we performed systematic calculations by the method of cylinder matrix-product states that provide quantitative agreement with the neutron scattering data and a qualitative benchmark for the spectral signatures of strong quantum fluctuations even in the absence of magnetic frustration.</description>

      <title>Precursors to Anderson Localization in the Holstein Model: Quantum and Quantum-Classical Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the frequency-dependent mobility of the Holstein polaron in one dimension near adiabatic limit using the method based on dynamical quantum tipicality, as well as the quantum-classical method. The agreement between fully quantum and quantum-classical solutions is very good. The most prominent feature is the appearance of a zero-frequency peak in the mobility, in addition to the displaced peak associated to the precursors of Anderson localization. The zero-frequency peak cannot be obtained within the phenomenological transient localization approach, which is often used in a semiquantitative description of charge transport in quasi-one-dimensional organic semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Thermal Quench Dynamics of Visons in Gapless Kitaev Spin Liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relaxation dynamics of the Kitaev honeycomb model under a thermal quench is dominated by the quasi-stochastic diffusion and pair annihilation of visions, which are gapped flux excitations of an emergent $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field of the Kitaev spin liquid. Both the diffusion energy barrier as well as the effective interactions between visons are mediated by the Majorana fermions which are fractionalized quasiparticles of the spin liquid. Through extensive kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the interplay between the thermal diffusion and nonlocal multi-vision interactions leads to a variety of temperature-dependent dynamical behaviors ranging from diffusion-limited and terminal-velocity-limited annihilation to dynamical arresting and freezing. Notably, we show that the freezing phenomenon is intimately related to the formation of metastable $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ vison crystals and a hidden coarsening of super-clusters associated with a broken $\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>Probing the magnetic origin of the pseudogap using a Fermi-Hubbard quantum simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In strongly correlated materials, interacting electrons are entangled and form collective quantum states, resulting in rich low-temperature phase diagrams. Notable examples include cuprate superconductors, in which superconductivity emerges at low doping out of an unusual ``pseudogap'' metallic state above the critical temperature. The Fermi-Hubbard model, describing a wide range of phenomena associated with strong electron correlations, still offers major computational challenges despite its simple formulation. In this context, ultracold atoms quantum simulators have provided invaluable insights into the microscopic nature of correlated quantum states. Here, we use a quantum gas microscope Fermi-Hubbard simulator to explore a wide range of doping levels and temperatures in a regime where a pseudogap is known to develop. By measuring multi-point correlation functions up to fifth order, we uncover a novel universal behaviour in magnetic and higher-order spin-charge correlations. This behaviour is characterized by a doping-dependent energy scale that governs the exponential growth of the magnetic correlation length upon cooling. Accurate comparisons with determinant Quantum Monte Carlo and Minimally Entangled Typical Thermal States simulations confirm that this energy scale agrees well with the pseudogap temperature $T^{*}$. Our findings establish a qualitative and quantitative understanding of the magnetic origin and physical nature of the pseudogap and pave the way towards the exploration of pairing and collective phenomena among charge carriers expected to emerge at lower temperatures.</description>

      <title>Multiple magnetic orders discovered in the superconducting state of EuFe$_{2}$(As$_{1-x}$P$_{x}$)$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between superconductivity and magnetism is an important subject in condensed matter physics. EuFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$-based iron pnictides could offer an interesting plateau to study their relationship that has attracted considerable attention. So far, two magnetic phase transitions were observed in EuFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$-based crystal, which were deemed to originate from the itinerant Fe moments ($\sim$ 190 K) and the localized Eu$^{2+}$ moments ($\sim$ 19 K), respectively. Here, we systematically studied the heat capacity for the EuFe$_{2}$(As$_{1-x}$P$_{x}$)$_{2}$ crystals with \textit{x} = 0.21 (optimally doped) and \textit{x} = 0.29 (overdoped). We have found two new magnetic orders in the superconducting state (ranging from 0.4 to 1.2 K) in the optimally doped crystal. As more P was introduced into the As site, one of the magnetic orders becomes absent in the overdoped crystal. Additionally, we observed strong field and orientation dependence in heat capacity. The present findings in EuFe$_{2}$(As$_{1-x}$P$_{x}$)$_{2}$ have detected the new low-temperature magnetic orders, which may originate from the localized Eu$^{2+}$ spins order or the spin reorientation.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic pinning of FeSe$_1$$_-$$_x$S$_x$ single crystals probed by torque magnetometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intrinsic pinning is caused by natural pinning centers that occur because of the modulation of the order parameter or weak superconducting layers. Early work has shown that intrinsic pinning generates a high pinning force and critical current density in some layered oxide superconductors. Studying the intrinsic pinning of superconductors is crucial for both fundamental studies and potential applications. Herein, we use torque magnetometry to study angle-resolved in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic torque for a series of high-quality FeSe$_1$$_-$$_x$S$_x$ single crystals. A fourfold torque signal was observed when the magnetic field was within the \textit{ab} plane. We interpret that this fourfold in-plane irreversible torque is from the intrinsic pinning due to combined effects of gap nodes/minimum and twin domains. Additionally, we attributed the observed out-of-plane torque peaks to intrinsic pinning due to the layered structure.</description>

      <title>Bulk and surface Dirac states accompanied by two superconducting domes in FeSe-based superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent investigations of FeSe-based superconductors have revealed the presence of two superconducting domes, and suggest possible distinct pairing mechanisms. Two superconducting domes are commonly found in unconventional superconductors and exhibit unique normal states and electronic structures. In this study, we conducted electromagnetic transport measurements to establish a complete phase diagram, successfully observing the two superconducting domes in FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$ (0 $\le x \le$ 0.25) and FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_x$ (0 $\le x \le$ 1) superconductors. The normal state resistivity on SC1 shows the strange metal state, with a power exponent approximately equal to 1 ($\rho (T)\propto T^n$ with $n\sim 1$), whereas the exponent on SC2 is less than 1. A bulk Dirac state observed on SC1, completely synchronized with the strange metal behavior, indicating a close relationship between them. While a topological surface Dirac state is witnessed on SC2, and undergoes a sign change near the pure nematic quantum critical point. The evolution of the Dirac states indicates that the appearance of the two superconducting domes may originate from the Fermi surface reconstruction. Our findings highlight distinct Dirac states and normal state resistivity across the two superconducting domes, providing convincing evidence for the existence of the two different pairing mechanisms in FeSe-based superconductors.</description>

      <title>Weak ergodicity breaking from supersymmetry in a fermionic kinetically constrained model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supersymmetry provides a natural playground for the construction of kinetically constrained lattice fermion models showing weak ergodicity breaking. The supersymmetric algebra naturally induces non-ergodic dynamics, as we illustrate here by introducing a fermionic equivalent of the PXP model with an adjustable chemical potential. This model is closely related to the $\mathcal{N} = 2$ supersymmetric $M_1$ model. Supersymmetry directly implies that the dynamics exhibit periodic revivals for specific initial states, including the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-ordered (every second site occupied) product state. These dynamics are reminiscent to those of the PXP model, a paradigmatic toy model in the field of quantum many-body scars. We draw a further parallel by uncovering quantum many-body scar-like eigenstates obeying sub-thermal entanglement scaling at energies given by (plus or minus) square roots of integers and relate these to special eigenstates of the $M_1$ model.</description>

      <title>Computation and properties of the Epstein zeta function with high-performance implementation in EpsteinLib</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Epstein zeta function generalizes the Riemann zeta function to oscillatory lattice sums in higher dimensions. Beyond its numerous applications in pure mathematics, it has recently been identified as a key component in simulating exotic quantum materials. This work establishes the Epstein zeta function as a powerful tool in numerical analysis by rigorously investigating its analytical properties and enabling its efficient computation. Specifically, we derive a compact and computationally efficient representation of the Epstein zeta function and thoroughly examine its analytical properties across all arguments. Furthermore, we introduce a superexponentially convergent algorithm, complete with error bounds, for computing the Epstein zeta function in arbitrary dimensions. We also show that the Epstein zeta function can be decomposed into a power law singularity and an analytic function in the first Brillouin zone. This decomposition facilitates the rapid evaluation of integrals involving the Epstein zeta function and allows for efficient precomputations through interpolation techniques. We present the first high-performance implementation of the Epstein zeta function and its regularisation for arbitrary real arguments in EpsteinLib, a C library with Python and Mathematica bindings, and rigorously benchmark its precision and performance against known formulas, achieving full precision across the entire parameter range. Finally, we apply our library to the computation of quantum dispersion relations of three-dimensional spin materials with long-range interactions and Casimir energies in multidimensional geometries, uncovering higher-order corrections to known asymptotic formulas for the arising forces.</description>

      <title>Fermi-Liquid $T^2$ Resistivity: Dynamical Mean-Field Theory Meets Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct-current resistivity is a key probe for the physical properties of materials. In metals, Fermi-liquid (FL) theory serves as the basis for understanding transport. A $T^2$ behavior of the resistivity is often taken as a signature of FL electron-electron scattering. However, the presence of impurity and phonon scattering as well as material-specific aspects such as Fermi surface geometry can complicate this interpretation. We demonstrate how density-functional theory combined with dynamical mean-field theory can be used to elucidate the FL regime. We take as examples SrVO$_{3}$ and SrMoO$_{3}$, two moderately correlated perovskite oxides, and establish a precise framework to analyze the FL behavior of the self-energy at low energy and temperature. Reviewing published low-temperature resistivity measurements, we find agreement between our calculations and experiments performed on samples with exceptionally low residual resistivity. This comparison emphasizes the need for further theoretical, synthesis, and characterization developments in these and other FL materials.</description>

      <title>Excitons under large pseudomagnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Excitons in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides (TMDs) acquire a spin-like quantum number, a pseudospin, originating from the crystal's discrete rotational symmetry. Here, we break this symmetry using a tunable uniaxial strain, effectively generating a pseudomagnetic field exceeding 40 Tesla. Under this large field, we demonstrate pseudospin analogs of spintronic phenomena such as the Zeeman effect and Larmor precession. Moreover, we determine previously inaccessible fundamental properties of TMDs, including the strength of the depolarizing field responsible for the loss of exciton coherence. Finally, we uncover the bosonic -- as opposed to fermionic -- nature of many-body excitonic species using the pseudomagnetic equivalent of the $g$-factor spectroscopy. Our work is the first step toward establishing this spectroscopy as a universal method for probing correlated many-body states and realizing pseudospin analogs of spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Optical Signature of Flat Bands in Topological Hourglass Semimetal Nb3SiTe6</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flat electronic bands in condensed matter provide a rich avenue for exploring novel quantum phenomena. Here, we report an optical spectroscopy study of a topological hourglass semimetal Nb3SiTe6 with the electric field of the incident light parallel to its crystalline ab-plane. The ab-plane optical conductivity spectra of Nb3SiTe6 single crystals exhibit a remarkable peak-like feature around 1.20 eV, which is mainly contributed by the direct optical transitions between the two ab-initio-calculation-derived flat bands along the momentum direction Z-U. Our results pave the way for investigating exotic quantum phenomena based on the flat bands in topological hourglass semimetals.</description>

      <title>A tensor network formulation of Lattice Gauge Theories based only on symmetric tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lattice Gauge Theory Hilbert space is divided into gauge-invariant sectors selected by the background charges. Such a projector can be directly embedded in a tensor network ansatz for gauge-invariant states as originally discussed in [Phys. Rev. B 83, 115127 (2011)] and in [Phys. Rev. X 4, 041024 (2014)] in the context of PEPS. The original ansatz is based on sparse tensors, though parts of them are not explicitly symmetric, and thus their actual implementation in numerical simulations has been hindered by the complexity of developing ad hoc libraries. Here we provide a new PEPS tensor network formulation of gauge-invariant theories purely based on symmetric elementary tensors. The new formulation can be implemented in numerical simulation using available state-of-the-art tensor network libraries but also holds interest from a purely theoretical perspective since it requires embedding the original gauge theory with gauge symmetry G into an enlarged globally symmetric theory with symmetry GxG. By revisiting the original ansatz in the modern landscape of i) duality transformations between gauge and spin systems, ii) finite depth quantum circuits followed by measurements that allow generating topologically ordered states, and iii) Clifford enhanced tensor networks, we show that such a new formulation provides a novel duality transformation between lattice gauge theories and specific sectors of globally invariant systems.</description>

      <title>Optical evidence of the band reconstruction during the charge-density wave transition in annealed Kagome magnet FeGe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Kagome magnet FeGe, the coexistence of electron correlation, charge-density wave (CDW), and magnetism renders it ideal to study their interactions. Here, we combined the optical spectroscopy and the first-principles calculations to investigate the band structures of FeGe annealed at different temperatures. Our observations reveal that the sample annealed at 320C experienced dramatic change in optical conductivity following the CDW transition. Specifically, a substantial portion of the spectral weight (SW) in the low-energy region ( &lt; 0.4 eV) was redistributed to the high-energy region (0.8 - 1.5 eV), suggesting a reconstruction of the band structure. The sample annealed at 560 C did not exhibit a CDW transition, but its SW transfer occurred progressively from 300 to 5 K. We noticed that: i) after the CDW transition, the sample annealed at 320 C showed similar tendency of SW transfer to that of the 560 C annealed sample; ii) the high-energy SW of both materials displayed a temperature dependence consistent with the magnetic roperties. Combining the first-principles calculations, we attribute the SW transfer to the band reconstruction triggered by the distortion of Ge1 atoms induced either by annealing at 560C or by the CDW transitions. This lattice distortion affects the energies of Fe 3d orbitals. Under the influence of Hund's rule coupling, the magnetic moment of Fe atoms is enhanced. Our findings elucidate the interactions among charge, lattice, and spin in FeGe, offering pivotal insights to modulate properties of this Kagome magnet.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a $1$D supersymmetric (SUSY) hard-core fermion model first proposed by Fendley, Schoutens, and de Boer [Phys. Rev. Lett. 90, 120402 (2003)]. We focus on the full Hilbert space instead of a restricted subspace. Exact diagonalization shows the degeneracy of zero-energy states scales exponentially with size of the system, with a recurrence relation between different system sizes. We solve the degeneracy problem by showing the ground states can be systematically constructed by inserting immobile walls of fermions into the chain. Mapping the counting problem to a combinatorial one and obtaining the exact generating function, we prove the recurrence relation on both open and periodic chains. We also provide an explicit mapping between ground states, giving a combinatorial explanation of the recurrence relation.</description>

      <title>The Fractional Hall hierarchy from duality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a modified version of Son's Dirac composite fermion theory proposed by Seiberg et al gives a candidate unified description of the gapped and gapless fractional quantum Hall states within a single Landau level. Our main tool is the successive application of three-dimensional dualities to partially filled Landau levels of composite fermions, which imply that this theory has a complicated landscape of gapped vacua and critical points. This construction is the Lagrangian, or effective field theory, analogue of the flux attachment procedure. The critical points exist at even denominator filling and are well-described by a Fermi surface for a weakly coupled composite fermion coupled to an abelian Chern-Simons theory. The gapped states include odd-denominator filling fraction states with an abelian Chern-Simons description which we show matches the one expected for hierarchy states, as well as non-abelian states at even-denominator filling that arise from pair instabilities of the composite fermion's Fermi surface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the important open problems in quantum black hole physics is a dual interpretation of holographic complexity proposals. To date the only quantitative match is the equality between the Krylov spread complexity in triple-scaled SYK at infinite temperature and the complexity = volume proposal in classical JT gravity. Our work utilizes the recent connection between double-scaled SYK and sine-dilaton gravity to show that the quantitative relation between Krylov spread complexity and complexity = volume extends to finite temperatures and to full quantum regime on the gravity side at disk level. From the latter we isolate the first quantum correction to the complexity = volume proposal and propose to view it as a complexity of quantum fields in the bulk. Finally, we comment on the switchback effect, whose presence would make the Krylov spread complexity a fully fledged holographic complexity at least in sine-dilaton gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.13507v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a prototypical example for a heterostructure combining a weakly and a strongly interacting quantum many-body system, we study the interface between a semiconductor and a Mott insulator. Via the hierarchy of correlations, we derive and match the propagating or evanescent (quasi) particle solutions on both sides and assume that the interactions among the electrons in the semiconducting regions can be absorbed by an effective potential. While the propagation is described by a band-like dispersion in both the weakly and the strongly interacting case, the inverse decay length across the interface follows a different dependence on the band gap in the Mott insulator and the semiconductor. As one consequence, tunnelling through a Mott insulating layer behaves quite differently from a semiconducting (or band insulating) layer. For example, we find a strong suppression of tunnelling for energies in the middle between the upper and lower Hubbard band of the Mott insulator.</description>

      <title>Phases and Exotic Phase Transitions of a Two-Dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.07613v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger electron-phonon model on a square lattice by means of auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The addition of a symmetry-allowed interaction permits analytical integration over the phonons at the expense of discrete Hubbard-Stratonovich fields with imaginary-time correlations. Using single-spin-flip and global updates, we investigate the phase diagram at the O(4)-symmetric point as a function of hopping $t$ and phonon frequency $\omega_0$. For $t=0$, where electron hopping is boson assisted, the model maps onto an unconstrained $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory. A key quantity is the emergent effective flux per plaquette, which equals $\pi$ in the assisted-hopping regime and vanishes for large $t$. Phases in the former regime can be understood in terms of instabilities of emergent Dirac fermions. Our results support a direct and continuous transition between a $(\pi,0)$ valence bond solid (VBS) and an antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase with increasing $\omega_0$. For large $t$ and small $\omega_0$, we find finite-temperature signatures, a disordered pseudogap phase, of a previously reported $(\pi,\pi)$ VBS ground state related to a nesting instability. With increasing $\omega_0$, AFM order again emerges.</description>

Abstract: An emerging concept for identification of different types of spin liquids is through the use of spontaneous spin noise. Here we develop spin noise spectroscopy for spin liquid studies by considering Ca$_{10}$Cr$_7$O$_{28}$, a material hypothesized to be either a quantum or a spiral spin liquid. By enhancing techniques introduced for magnetic monopole noise studies we measure the time and temperature dependence of spontaneous flux $\varPhi(t, T)$ and thus magnetization $M(t, T)$ of Ca$_{10}$Cr$_7$O$_{28}$ samples. The resulting power spectral density of magnetization noise $S_M(\omega,T)$ reveals intense spin fluctuations with $S_M(\omega,T) \propto \omega^{-\alpha(T)}$ and 0.84 &lt; $\alpha (T)$ &lt; 1.04 . Both the variance $\sigma_M^2(T)$ and the correlation function $C_M(t,T)$ of this spin noise undergo crossovers at a temperature $T^* \approx$ 450 mK. While predictions for quantum spin liquids are inconsistent with this phenomenology, those from Monte-Carlo simulations of a 2D spiral spin liquid state in Ca$_{10}$Cr$_7$O$_{28}$ yield overall quantitative correspondence with the measured frequency and temperature dependences of $S_M(\omega,T), C_M(t,T)$ and $\sigma _M^2(T)$, thus indicating that Ca$_{10}$Cr$_7$O$_{28}$ is a spiral spin liquid.</description>

      <title>Engineering Fractional Chern Insulators through Periodic Strain in Monolayer Graphene and Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>

Abstract: We propose the realization of interaction-driven insulators in periodically strained monolayer graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Through extensive many-body exact diagonalization, we provide compelling evidence for various fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) in both strained monolayer graphene and TMDs, including the Laughlin states, Halperin states, and FCIs with tunable topological orders in Chern number |C| = 2 bands. We also discuss the relationship among band geometry, band filling and spin polarization. Notably, by examining both the entanglement spectrum and many-body Chern number, we reveal a state with Laughlin-like topological order emerging in the |C| = 2 band, which challenges the existing theoretical understanding of high Chern number (high-C) FCIs. These findings suggest that periodically strained monolayer graphene and TMDs provide promising platforms for engineering fractional Chern insulators and underscore the need for further investigation into high-C FCIs.</description>

Abstract: In the past couple of decades, there have been significant advances in measuring quantum properties of light, such as quadratures of squeezed light and single-photon counting. Here, we explore whether such tools can be leveraged to probe electronic correlations in the many-body quantum regime. Specifically, we show that it is possible to probe certain spin, charge, and topological orders in an electronic system by measuring the correlation functions of scattered photons. We construct a mapping from the correlators of the scattered photons to those of a correlated insulator, particularly for Mott insulators described by a single-band Fermi-Hubbard model at half-filling. We show that frequency filtering before photodetection plays a crucial role in determining this mapping. We find that if the ground state of the insulator is a gapped spin liquid, a photon-pair correlation function, i.e., $G^{(2)}$, can detect the presence of anyonic excitations with fractional mutual statistics. Moreover, we show that correlations between electromagnetic quadratures can be used to detect expectation values of static spin chirality operators on both the kagome and triangular lattices, thus being useful in detecting chiral spin liquids. More generally, we show that a series of hitherto unmeasured spin-spin and spin-charge correlation functions of the material can be extracted from photonic correlations. This work opens up access to probe correlated materials, beyond the linear response paradigm, by detecting quantum properties of scattered light.</description>

Abstract: We present a theoretical study of the exchange interaction in a system of spatially disordered magnetic moments. A typical example of such a system is an impurity semiconductor, whose magnetic properties are associated with the exchange interaction of the impurity atoms. In this study, we consider the case of antiferromagnetic exchange interaction, which we describe by the Heisenberg Hamiltonian. To calculate the magnetic properties of the disordered system, we employ the density of states method. Our calculations demonstrate a good quantitative agreement with the dependence of the Si:P magnetic susceptibility on temperature in a wide range of impurity concentrations and temperatures.</description>

      <title>Topological phases of unitary dynamics: Classification in Clifford category</title>

Abstract: A quantum cellular automaton (QCA) or a causal unitary is by definition an automorphism of local operator algebra, by which local operators are mapped to local operators. Quantum circuits of small depth, local Hamiltonian evolutions for short time, and translations (shifts) are examples. A Clifford QCA is one that maps any Pauli operator to a finite tensor product of Pauli operators. Here, we obtain a complete table of groups $\mathfrak C(\mathsf d,p)$ of translation invariant Clifford QCA in any spatial dimension $\mathsf d \ge 0$ modulo Clifford quantum circuits and shifts over prime $p$-dimensional qudits, where the circuits and shifts are allowed to obey only coarser translation invariance. The group $\mathfrak C(\mathsf d,p)$ is nonzero only for $\mathsf d = 2k+3$ if $p=2$ and $\mathsf d = 4k+3$ if $p$ is odd where~$k \ge 0$ is any integer, in which case $\mathfrak C(\mathsf d,p) \cong \widetilde{\mathfrak W}(\mathbb F_p)$, the classical Witt group of nonsingular quadratic forms over the finite field $\mathbb F_p$. It is well known that $\widetilde{\mathfrak W}(\mathbb F_2) \cong \mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z$, $\widetilde{\mathfrak W}(\mathbb F_p) \cong \mathbb Z/4\mathbb Z$ if $p = 3 \bmod 4$, and $\widetilde{\mathfrak W}(\mathbb F_p)\cong \mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z \oplus \mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z$ if $p = 1 \bmod 4$. The classification is achieved by a dimensional descent, which is a reduction of Laurent extension theorems for algebraic $L$-groups of surgery theory in topology.</description>

      <title>Theory of Quantum Circuits with Abelian Symmetries</title>

Abstract: Quantum circuits with gates (local unitaries) respecting a global symmetry have broad applications in quantum information science and related fields, such as condensed matter theory and quantum thermodynamics. However, despite their widespread use, fundamental properties of such circuits are not well-understood. Recently, it was found that generic unitaries respecting a global symmetry cannot be realized, even approximately, using gates that respect the same symmetry. This observation raises important open questions: What unitary transformations can be realized with k-local gates that respect a global symmetry? In other words, in the presence of a global symmetry, how does the locality of interactions constrain the possible time evolution of a composite system? In this work, we address these questions for the case of Abelian (commutative) symmetries and develop constructive methods for synthesizing circuits with such symmetries. Remarkably, as a corollary, we find that, while the locality of interactions still imposes additional constraints on realizable unitaries, certain restrictions observed in the case of non-Abelian symmetries do not apply to circuits with Abelian symmetries. For instance, in circuits with a general non-Abelian symmetry such as SU($d$), the unitary realized in a subspace with one irreducible representation (charge) of the symmetry dictates the realized unitaries in multiple other sectors with inequivalent representations of the symmetry. Furthermore, in certain sectors, rather than all unitaries respecting the symmetry, the realizable unitaries are the symplectic or orthogonal subgroups of this group. We prove that none of these restrictions appears in the case of Abelian symmetries. This result suggests that global non-Abelian symmetries may affect the thermalization of quantum systems in ways not possible under Abelian symmetries.</description>

      <title>First-order phase transition between superconductivity and charge/spin-density wave as the reason of their coexistence in organic metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay between superconductivity (SC) and spin/charge density wave (DW) in organic metals shows many similarities to high-$T_c$ superconductors. It also contains many puzzles, for example, the anisotropic SC onset observed and the severalfold increase of the upper critical field $H_{c2}$ in the coexistence region, as well as the microscopic origin of SC/DW phase separation there. In this paper, by the direct calculation of the Landau expansion for DW free energy, we argue that the phase transition between DW and metallic/SC phase in organic superconductors goes by first order at low enough temperature, which explains the spatial segregation of DW and SC at large length scale, consistent with experimental observations. This first-order phase transition is not directly related to SC and happens even above the SC transition temperature.</description>

      <title>Thermalization slowing down of weakly nonintegrable quantum spin dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00786v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study thermalization slowing down of a quantum many-body spin system upon approach to two distinct integrability limits. Motivated by previous studies of classical systems, we identify two thermalization time scales: one quantum Lyapunov time scale is extracted by quantifying operator growth in time on an appropriately defined basis, while another ergodization time scale is related to the statistics of fluctuations of the time-evolved operator around its mean value based on the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Using a paradigmatic Quantum Ising chain we find that both timescales diverge upon approach to integrability. We investigate the relative strength of the divergence in the two limits and find that despite significant qualitative differences in the mechanism of integrability breaking, the timescales diverge in a similar fashion. This allows us to establish a universality of integrability breaking in quantum spin dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02704v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that rotation symmetry is not a necessary requirement for the existence of fractional corner charges in Cn-symmetric higher-order topological crystalline insulators. Instead, it is sufficient to have a latent rotation symmetry, which may be revealed upon performing an isospectral reduction on the system. We introduce the concept of a filling anomaly for latent crystalline symmetric systems, and propose modified topological invariants. The notion of higher-order topology in two dimensions protected by Cn symmetry is thus generalized to a protection by latent symmetry. Our claims are corroborated by concrete examples of models that show non-trivial corner charge in the absence of Cn-symmetry. This work extends the classification of topological crystalline insulators to include latent symmetries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Excitons drive the optoelectronic properties of organic semiconductors which underpin devices including solar cells and light-emitting diodes. We demonstrate that excitons can exhibit topologically non-trivial states protected by inversion symmetry and identify a family of organic semiconductors realising the predicted excitonic topological phases. We also show that the topological phase can be controlled through experimentally realisable strains and chemical functionalisation of the material. Appealing to quantum Riemannian geometry, we predict that topologically non-trivial excitons have a lower bound on their centre-of-mass spatial spread, which can significantly exceed the size of a unit cell. Furthermore, we show that the dielectric environment allows to control the excitonic quantum geometry. The discovery of excitonic topology and excitonic Riemannian geometry in organic materials brings together two mature fields and suggests many new possibilities for a range of future optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of topological phase transitions in interacting, symmetry-protected quantum matter at finite temperatures. Using a combined numerical and analytical approach, we study a one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with added Hubbard interactions, where no thermodynamic phase transition occurs at finite temperatures. The transition is signalled by a quantized, non-local bulk topological order parameter. It is driven by defects, which are enabled by the combination of interaction and thermal activation, with no counterpart in the non-interacting limit. The defects localize topological zero modes, which, when sufficiently abundant, cause the order parameter to vanish. This phenomenon, interpreted via bulk-boundary correspondence, reflects the loss of a topological edge mode at a well-defined critical temperature in the thermodynamic limit. Unlike zero-temperature topological transitions, these finite-temperature transitions lack thermodynamic signatures but remain observable in controlled quantum systems, such as ultracold fermionic atoms in optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Emergent Spacetime Supersymmetry with Rydberg Atom Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08194v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the zoo of emergent symmetries in quantum many-body physics, the previously unrealized emergent spacetime supersymmetry (SUSY) is particularly intriguing. Although it was known that spacetime SUSY could emerge at the (1+1)d tricritical Ising transition, an experimental realization is still absent. In this work, we propose to realize emergent spacetime SUSY using reconfigurable Rydberg atom arrays featuring two distinct sets of Rydberg excitations, tailored for implementation on dual-species platforms. In such systems, the spacetime SUSY manifests itself in the respective correlation functions of a bosonic mode and its fermionic partner. However, the correlation function of the fermionic mode inevitably involves a string operator, making direct measurement challenging in the conventional setting. Here, we leverage the hybrid analog-digital nature of the Rydberg atom arrays, which allows for the simulation of a physical Hamiltonian and the execution of a digital quantum circuit on the same platform. This hybrid protocol offers a new perspective for uncovering the hidden structure of emergent spacetime SUSY.</description>

      <title>Consecutive Flat Chern Bands and Correlated States in Monolayer ReAg$_2$Cl$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically propose that van der Waals monolayer ReAg$_2$Cl$_6$ have four consecutive flat Chern bands in the 120$^\circ$ spiral antiferromagnetic ground state. The nontrivial topology of these Chern bands emerges from the synergy between Re $t_{2g}$ band folding with non-collinear spin configuration and spin-orbit coupling. By constructing maximally localized Wannier functions directly from first-principles calculations, the tight-binding model is developed to describe the consecutive Chern bands. Interestingly, many-body exact diagonalization and entanglement spectrum analysis suggest that correlated states such as fractional Chern insulator and charge density wave may appear in these Chern bands with $1/3$ filling. Furthermore, the spin configurations and band topology of Chern bands are tunable by external magnetic field. The general physics from the $d$ orbitals here applies to a large class of materials such as ReAg$_2$Br$_6$, ReAu$_2$I$_6$ and ReCu$_2X_6$ ($X$=Cl, Br, I). These notable predictions in pristine 2D materials, if realized experimentally, could offer a new playground for exploring correlated topological states at elevated temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transporting and connecting quantum states are key capabilities for larger-scale quantum information processing. Concrete challenges are the coherent shuttling and the manipulation of distant quantum states in an optical lattice. Here, we create spin singlet pairs of two magnetic states of fermionic potassium-40 atoms in an optical lattice and use a bi-directional topological Thouless pump to transport, coherently split, and separate the pairs, as well as to demonstrate interaction between them via tuneable $($swap$)^\alpha$-gate operations. We achieve pair pumping with a single-shift fidelity of 99.78(3)% over 50 lattice sites and split the pairs within a decoherence-free subspace. Gates are implemented by superexchange interaction, allowing us to produce interwoven spin singlets. For read-out, we apply a magnetic field gradient, resulting in single- and multi-frequency singlet-triplet oscillations. Our work shows avenues to create complex patterns of entanglement and new approaches to quantum processing, sensing, and atom interferometry.</description>

      <title>Unconventional superconductivity in altermagnets with spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10712v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate some possible symmetries of the superconducting state that emerges in three-dimensional altermagnets in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. We demonstrate within a weak-coupling approach that these altermagnets, which naturally possess an order modulated by a vector form factor $\boldsymbol{g}_{\mathbf{k}}$, favor spin-triplet superconductivity described by gap functions given by $\boldsymbol{d}(\mathbf{k}) = \boldsymbol{u}(\mathbf{k}) \times \boldsymbol{g}_{\mathbf{k}}$, where $\boldsymbol{u}(\mathbf{k}) = - \boldsymbol{u}(-\mathbf{k})$. Consequently, this singles out $f$-wave spin-triplet superconductivity as the most favorable pairing state to appear in the vicinity of $d$-wave altermagnetism. Furthermore, we obtain that the combination of spin-singlet superconducting states with altermagnetism gives rise to Bogoliubov-Fermi surfaces, which are protected by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant. Using a Ginzburg-Landau analysis, we show that, for a class of spin-orbit coupled altermagnetic models, a superconducting phase is expected to appear at low temperatures as an intertwined $d + if$ state, thus breaking time-reversal symmetry spontaneously.</description>

      <title>Pair size and quantum geometry in a multiband Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the size of two-body bound states and Cooper pairs within a multiband Hubbard model that features time-reversal symmetry and uniform pairing on a generic lattice. Our analysis involves (i) an exact calculation of the localization tensor to determine the size of lowest-lying two-body bound state in vacuum, and (ii) an evaluation of the analogous tensor to estimate the average size of Cooper pairs within the mean-field BCS-BEC crossover theory at zero temperature. Beyond the conventional intraband contribution that depends on Bloch bands, we show that pair size also has a geometric contribution governed by the quantum-metric tensor of the Bloch states and their band-resolved quantum-metric tensors. As a concrete example, we investigate the pyrochlore-Hubbard model numerically and demonstrate that, while the pair size diverges in the weakly interacting BCS regime of dispersive bands, it remains finite and relatively small in the flat-band regime, even for infinitesimal interaction, perfectly matching the exact two-body result in the dilute limit.</description>

      <title>Topological edge states at Floquet quantum criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15395v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topologically protected edge states exactly at topological phase boundaries challenge the conventional belief that topological states must be associated with a bulk energy gap. Because periodically driven (Floquet) systems host unusually intricate topological phase boundaries, topological edge states can be prolific at such Floquet quantum criticality. Working on a class of chiral-symmetric, Floquet-driven Majorana fermion chains, we analytically and computationally show that the precise boundaries between different Floquet topological gapped phases can accommodate topological edge modes, including the so-called Majorana $\pi$ modes. We also identify a general bulk-edge correspondence formula to predict and understand the emergence of topological edge modes at Floquet quantum criticality. Of direct interest to quantum simulation experiments, our results break new grounds for studies of nonequilibrium topological phases of matter undergoing topological phase transitions.</description>
