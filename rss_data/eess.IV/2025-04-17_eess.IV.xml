      <title>3D Object Reconstruction with mmWave Radars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents RFconstruct, a framework that enables 3D shape reconstruction using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) mmWave radars for self-driving scenarios. RFconstruct overcomes radar limitations of low angular resolution, specularity, and sparsity in radar point clouds through a holistic system design that addresses hardware, data processing, and machine learning challenges. The first step is fusing data captured by two radar devices that image orthogonal planes, then performing odometry-aware temporal fusion to generate denser 3D point clouds. RFconstruct then reconstructs 3D shapes of objects using a customized encoder-decoder model that does not require prior knowledge of the object's bound box. The shape reconstruction performance of RFconstruct is compared against 3D models extracted from a depth camera equipped with a LiDAR. We show that RFconstruct can accurately generate 3D shapes of cars, bikes, and pedestrians.</description>

      <title>WaterFlow: Learning Fast &amp; Robust Watermarks using Stable Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to embed watermarks in images is a fundamental problem of interest for computer vision, and is exacerbated by the rapid rise of generated imagery in recent times. Current state-of-the-art techniques suffer from computational and statistical challenges such as the slow execution speed for practical deployments. In addition, other works trade off fast watermarking speeds but suffer greatly in their robustness or perceptual quality. In this work, we propose WaterFlow (WF), a fast and extremely robust approach for high fidelity visual watermarking based on a learned latent-dependent watermark. Our approach utilizes a pretrained latent diffusion model to encode an arbitrary image into a latent space and produces a learned watermark that is then planted into the Fourier Domain of the latent. The transformation is specified via invertible flow layers that enhance the expressivity of the latent space of the pre-trained model to better preserve image quality while permitting robust and tractable detection. Most notably, WaterFlow demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on general robustness and is the first method capable of effectively defending against difficult combination attacks. We validate our findings on three widely used real and generated datasets: MS-COCO, DiffusionDB, and WikiArt.</description>

      <title>Regist3R: Incremental Registration with Stereo Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-view 3D reconstruction has remained an essential yet challenging problem in the field of computer vision. While DUSt3R and its successors have achieved breakthroughs in 3D reconstruction from unposed images, these methods exhibit significant limitations when scaling to multi-view scenarios, including high computational cost and cumulative error induced by global alignment. To address these challenges, we propose Regist3R, a novel stereo foundation model tailored for efficient and scalable incremental reconstruction. Regist3R leverages an incremental reconstruction paradigm, enabling large-scale 3D reconstructions from unordered and many-view image collections. We evaluate Regist3R on public datasets for camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. Our experiments demonstrate that Regist3R achieves comparable performance with optimization-based methods while significantly improving computational efficiency, and outperforms existing multi-view reconstruction models. Furthermore, to assess its performance in real-world applications, we introduce a challenging oblique aerial dataset which has long spatial spans and hundreds of views. The results highlight the effectiveness of Regist3R. We also demonstrate the first attempt to reconstruct large-scale scenes encompassing over thousands of views through pointmap-based foundation models, showcasing its potential for practical applications in large-scale 3D reconstruction tasks, including urban modeling, aerial mapping, and beyond.</description>

      <title>GLUSE: Enhanced Channel-Wise Adaptive Gated Linear Units SE for Onboard Satellite Earth Observation Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces ResNet-GLUSE, a lightweight ResNet variant enhanced with Gated Linear Unit-enhanced Squeeze-and-Excitation (GLUSE), an adaptive channel-wise attention mechanism. By integrating dynamic gating into the traditional SE framework, GLUSE improves feature recalibration while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments on EuroSAT and PatternNet datasets confirm its effectiveness, achieving exceeding \textbf{94\% and 98\% accuracy}, respectively. While \textbf{MobileViT achieves 99\% accuracy}, ResNet-GLUSE offers \textbf{33x fewer parameters, 27x fewer FLOPs, 33x smaller model size (MB), $\approx$6x lower power consumption (W), and $\approx$3x faster inference time (s)}, making it significantly more efficient for onboard satellite deployment. Furthermore, due to its simplicity, ResNet-GLUSE can be easily mimicked for \textbf{neuromorphic computing}, enabling ultra-low power inference at just \textbf{852.30 mW} on Akida Brainchip. This balance between high accuracy and ultra-low resource consumption establishes ResNet-GLUSE as a practical solution for real-time Earth Observation (EO) tasks. Reproducible codes are available in our shared repository.</description>

      <title>TUMLS: Trustful Fully Unsupervised Multi-Level Segmentation for Whole Slide Images of Histology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital pathology, augmented by artificial intelligence (AI), holds significant promise for improving the workflow of pathologists. However, challenges such as the labor-intensive annotation of whole slide images (WSIs), high computational demands, and trust concerns arising from the absence of uncertainty estimation in predictions hinder the practical application of current AI methodologies in histopathology. To address these issues, we present a novel trustful fully unsupervised multi-level segmentation methodology (TUMLS) for WSIs. TUMLS adopts an autoencoder (AE) as a feature extractor to identify the different tissue types within low-resolution training data. It selects representative patches from each identified group based on an uncertainty measure and then does unsupervised nuclei segmentation in their respective higher-resolution space without using any ML algorithms. Crucially, this solution integrates seamlessly into clinicians workflows, transforming the examination of a whole WSI into a review of concise, interpretable cross-level insights. This integration significantly enhances and accelerates the workflow while ensuring transparency. We evaluated our approach using the UPENN-GBM dataset, where the AE achieved a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.0016. Additionally, nucleus segmentation is assessed on the MoNuSeg dataset, outperforming all unsupervised approaches with an F1 score of 77.46% and a Jaccard score of 63.35%. These results demonstrate the efficacy of TUMLS in advancing the field of digital pathology.</description>

      <title>Towards Cardiac MRI Foundation Models: Comprehensive Visual-Tabular Representations for Whole-Heart Assessment and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is the gold standard for non-invasive cardiac assessment, offering rich spatio-temporal views of the cardiac anatomy and physiology. Patient-level health factors, such as demographics, metabolic, and lifestyle, are known to substantially influence cardiovascular health and disease risk, yet remain uncaptured by CMR alone. To holistically understand cardiac health and to enable the best possible interpretation of an individual's disease risk, CMR and patient-level factors must be jointly exploited within an integrated framework. Recent multi-modal approaches have begun to bridge this gap, yet they often rely on limited spatio-temporal data and focus on isolated clinical tasks, thereby hindering the development of a comprehensive representation for cardiac health evaluation. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ViTa, a step toward foundation models that delivers a comprehensive representation of the heart and a precise interpretation of individual disease risk. Leveraging data from 42,000 UK Biobank participants, ViTa integrates 3D+T cine stacks from short-axis and long-axis views, enabling a complete capture of the cardiac cycle. These imaging data are then fused with detailed tabular patient-level factors, enabling context-aware insights. This multi-modal paradigm supports a wide spectrum of downstream tasks, including cardiac phenotype and physiological feature prediction, segmentation, and classification of cardiac and metabolic diseases within a single unified framework. By learning a shared latent representation that bridges rich imaging features and patient context, ViTa moves beyond traditional, task-specific models toward a universal, patient-specific understanding of cardiac health, highlighting its potential to advance clinical utility and scalability in cardiac analysis.</description>

      <title>NTIRE 2025 Challenge on Short-form UGC Video Quality Assessment and Enhancement: Methods and Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a review for the NTIRE 2025 Challenge on Short-form UGC Video Quality Assessment and Enhancement. The challenge comprises two tracks: (i) Efficient Video Quality Assessment (KVQ), and (ii) Diffusion-based Image Super-Resolution (KwaiSR). Track 1 aims to advance the development of lightweight and efficient video quality assessment (VQA) models, with an emphasis on eliminating reliance on model ensembles, redundant weights, and other computationally expensive components in the previous IQA/VQA competitions. Track 2 introduces a new short-form UGC dataset tailored for single image super-resolution, i.e., the KwaiSR dataset. It consists of 1,800 synthetically generated S-UGC image pairs and 1,900 real-world S-UGC images, which are split into training, validation, and test sets using a ratio of 8:1:1. The primary objective of the challenge is to drive research that benefits the user experience of short-form UGC platforms such as Kwai and TikTok. This challenge attracted 266 participants and received 18 valid final submissions with corresponding fact sheets, significantly contributing to the progress of short-form UGC VQA and image superresolution. The project is publicly available at https://github.com/lixinustc/KVQE- ChallengeCVPR-NTIRE2025.</description>

      <title>Prototype-Guided Diffusion for Digital Pathology: Achieving Foundation Model Performance with Minimal Clinical Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models in digital pathology use massive datasets to learn useful compact feature representations of complex histology images. However, there is limited transparency into what drives the correlation between dataset size and performance, raising the question of whether simply adding more data to increase performance is always necessary. In this study, we propose a prototype-guided diffusion model to generate high-fidelity synthetic pathology data at scale, enabling large-scale self-supervised learning and reducing reliance on real patient samples while preserving downstream performance. Using guidance from histological prototypes during sampling, our approach ensures biologically and diagnostically meaningful variations in the generated data. We demonstrate that self-supervised features trained on our synthetic dataset achieve competitive performance despite using ~60x-760x less data than models trained on large real-world datasets. Notably, models trained using our synthetic data showed statistically comparable or better performance across multiple evaluation metrics and tasks, even when compared to models trained on orders of magnitude larger datasets. Our hybrid approach, combining synthetic and real data, further enhanced performance, achieving top results in several evaluations. These findings underscore the potential of generative AI to create compelling training data for digital pathology, significantly reducing the reliance on extensive clinical datasets and highlighting the efficiency of our approach.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the MICCAI Brain Tumor Segmentation -- Metastases (BraTS-METS) 2025 Lighthouse Challenge: Brain Metastasis Segmentation on Pre- and Post-treatment MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite continuous advancements in cancer treatment, brain metastatic disease remains a significant complication of primary cancer and is associated with an unfavorable prognosis. One approach for improving diagnosis, management, and outcomes is to implement algorithms based on artificial intelligence for the automated segmentation of both pre- and post-treatment MRI brain images. Such algorithms rely on volumetric criteria for lesion identification and treatment response assessment, which are still not available in clinical practice. Therefore, it is critical to establish tools for rapid volumetric segmentations methods that can be translated to clinical practice and that are trained on high quality annotated data. The BraTS-METS 2025 Lighthouse Challenge aims to address this critical need by establishing inter-rater and intra-rater variability in dataset annotation by generating high quality annotated datasets from four individual instances of segmentation by neuroradiologists while being recorded on video (two instances doing "from scratch" and two instances after AI pre-segmentation). This high-quality annotated dataset will be used for testing phase in 2025 Lighthouse challenge and will be publicly released at the completion of the challenge. The 2025 Lighthouse challenge will also release the 2023 and 2024 segmented datasets that were annotated using an established pipeline of pre-segmentation, student annotation, two neuroradiologists checking, and one neuroradiologist finalizing the process. It builds upon its previous edition by including post-treatment cases in the dataset. Using these high-quality annotated datasets, the 2025 Lighthouse challenge plans to test benchmark algorithms for automated segmentation of pre-and post-treatment brain metastases (BM), trained on diverse and multi-institutional datasets of MRI images obtained from patients with brain metastases.</description>

Abstract: This paper reviews the NTIRE 2025 Challenge on Day and Night Raindrop Removal for Dual-Focused Images. This challenge received a wide range of impressive solutions, which are developed and evaluated using our collected real-world Raindrop Clarity dataset. Unlike existing deraining datasets, our Raindrop Clarity dataset is more diverse and challenging in degradation types and contents, which includes day raindrop-focused, day background-focused, night raindrop-focused, and night background-focused degradations. This dataset is divided into three subsets for competition: 14,139 images for training, 240 images for validation, and 731 images for testing. The primary objective of this challenge is to establish a new and powerful benchmark for the task of removing raindrops under varying lighting and focus conditions. There are a total of 361 participants in the competition, and 32 teams submitting valid solutions and fact sheets for the final testing phase. These submissions achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the Raindrop Clarity dataset. The project can be found at https://lixinustc.github.io/CVPR-NTIRE2025-RainDrop-Competition.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Efficient Chebyshev Reconstruction for the Anisotropic Equilibrium Model in Magnetic Particle Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) is a tomographic imaging modality capable of real-time, high-sensitivity mapping of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles. Model-based image reconstruction provides an alternative to conventional methods that rely on a measured system matrix, eliminating the need for laborious calibration measurements. Nevertheless, model-based approaches must account for the complexities of the imaging chain to maintain high image quality. A recently proposed direct reconstruction method leverages weighted Chebyshev polynomials in the frequency domain, removing the need for a simulated system matrix. However, the underlying model neglects key physical effects, such as nanoparticle anisotropy, leading to distortions in reconstructed images. To mitigate these artifacts, an adapted direct Chebyshev reconstruction (DCR) method incorporates a spatially variant deconvolution step, significantly improving reconstruction accuracy at the cost of increased computational demands. In this work, we evaluate the adapted DCR on six experimental phantoms, demonstrating enhanced reconstruction quality in real measurements and achieving image fidelity comparable to or exceeding that of simulated system matrix reconstruction. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient approximation for the spatially variable deconvolution, reducing both runtime and memory consumption while maintaining accuracy. This method achieves computational complexity of O(N log N ), making it particularly beneficial for high-resolution and three-dimensional imaging. Our results highlight the potential of the adapted DCR approach for improving model-based MPI reconstruction in practical applications.</description>

      <title>MCANet: Medical Image Segmentation with Multi-Scale Cross-Axis Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08866v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficiently capturing multi-scale information and building long-range dependencies among pixels are essential for medical image segmentation because of the various sizes and shapes of the lesion regions or organs. In this paper, we present Multi-scale Cross-axis Attention (MCA) to solve the above challenging issues based on the efficient axial attention. Instead of simply connecting axial attention along the horizontal and vertical directions sequentially, we propose to calculate dual cross attentions between two parallel axial attentions to capture global information better. To process the significant variations of lesion regions or organs in individual sizes and shapes, we also use multiple convolutions of strip-shape kernels with different kernel sizes in each axial attention path to improve the efficiency of the proposed MCA in encoding spatial information. We build the proposed MCA upon the MSCAN backbone, yielding our network, termed MCANet. Our MCANet with only 4M+ parameters performs even better than most previous works with heavy backbones (e.g., Swin Transformer) on four challenging tasks, including skin lesion segmentation, nuclei segmentation, abdominal multi-organ segmentation, and polyp segmentation.

      <title>C2GM: Cascading conditional generative cartography framework for multi-scale tile map generation with geographic feature constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-scale maps are essential representations of surveying and cartographic results, serving as fundamental components of geographic services. Current image generation networks can quickly produce map tiles from remote-sensing images. However, generative models designed for natural images often focus on texture features, neglecting the unique characteristics of remote-sensing features and the scale attributes of tile maps. This limitation in generative models impairs the accurate representation of geographic information, and the quality of tile map generation still needs improvement. Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in various image generation tasks, highlighting their potential to address this challenge. This paper presents C2GM, a novel framework for generating multi-scale tile maps through conditional guided diffusion and multi-scale cascade generation. Specifically, we implement a conditional feature fusion encoder to extract object priors from remote sensing images and cascade reference double branch input, ensuring an accurate representation of complex features. Low-level generated tiles act as constraints for high-level map generation, enhancing visual continuity. Moreover, we incorporate map scale modality information using CLIP to simulate the relationship between map scale and cartographic generalization in tile maps. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that C2GM consistently achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on all metrics, facilitating the rapid and effective generation of multi-scale large-format maps for emergency response and remote mapping applications.</description>

      <title>RGB-Phase Speckle: Cross-Scene Stereo 3D Reconstruction via Wrapped Pre-Normalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D reconstruction garners increasing attention alongside the advancement of high-level image applications, where dense stereo matching (DSM) serves as a pivotal technique. Previous studies often rely on publicly available datasets for training, focusing on modifying network architectures or incorporating specialized modules to extract domain-invariant features and thus improve model robustness. In contrast, inspired by single-frame structured-light phase-shifting encoding, this study introduces RGB-Speckle, a cross-scene 3D reconstruction framework based on an active stereo camera system, designed to enhance robustness. Specifically, we propose a novel phase pre-normalization encoding-decoding method: first, we randomly perturb phase-shift maps and embed them into the three RGB channels to generate color speckle patterns; subsequently, the camera captures phase-encoded images modulated by objects as input to a stereo matching network. This technique effectively mitigates external interference and ensures consistent input data for RGB-Speckle, thereby bolstering cross-domain 3D reconstruction stability. To validate the proposed method, we conduct complex experiments: (1) construct a color speckle dataset for complex scenarios based on the proposed encoding scheme; (2) evaluate the impact of the phase pre-normalization encoding-decoding technique on 3D reconstruction accuracy; and (3) further investigate its robustness across diverse conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RGB-Speckle model offers significant advantages in cross-domain and cross-scene 3D reconstruction tasks, enhancing model generalization and reinforcing robustness in challenging environments, thus providing a novel solution for robust 3D reconstruction research.</description>

      <title>Unified Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13254v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation (UDA-SS) aims to transfer the supervision from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. The majority of existing UDA-SS works typically consider images whilst recent attempts have extended further to tackle videos by modeling the temporal dimension. Although the two lines of research share the major challenges -- overcoming the underlying domain distribution shift, their studies are largely independent, resulting in fragmented insights, a lack of holistic understanding, and missed opportunities for cross-pollination of ideas. This fragmentation prevents the unification of methods, leading to redundant efforts and suboptimal knowledge transfer across image and video domains. Under this observation, we advocate unifying the study of UDA-SS across video and image scenarios, enabling a more comprehensive understanding, synergistic advancements, and efficient knowledge sharing. To that end, we explore the unified UDA-SS from a general data augmentation perspective, serving as a unifying conceptual framework, enabling improved generalization, and potential for cross-pollination of ideas, ultimately contributing to the overall progress and practical impact of this field of research. Specifically, we propose a Quad-directional Mixup (QuadMix) method, characterized by tackling distinct point attributes and feature inconsistencies through four-directional paths for intra- and inter-domain mixing in a feature space. To deal with temporal shifts with videos, we incorporate optical flow-guided feature aggregation across spatial and temporal dimensions for fine-grained domain alignment. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art works by large margins on four challenging UDA-SS benchmarks. Our source code and models will be released at https://github.com/ZHE-SAPI/UDASS.</description>

      <title>CDXLSTM: Boosting Remote Sensing Change Detection with Extended Long Short-Term Memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07863v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In complex scenes and varied conditions, effectively integrating spatial-temporal context is crucial for accurately identifying changes. However, current RS-CD methods lack a balanced consideration of performance and efficiency. CNNs lack global context, Transformers are computationally expensive, and Mambas face CUDA dependence and local correlation loss. In this paper, we propose CDXLSTM, with a core component that is a powerful XLSTM-based feature enhancement layer, integrating the advantages of linear computational complexity, global context perception, and strong interpret-ability. Specifically, we introduce a scale-specific Feature Enhancer layer, incorporating a Cross-Temporal Global Perceptron customized for semantic-accurate deep features, and a Cross-Temporal Spatial Refiner customized for detail-rich shallow features. Additionally, we propose a Cross-Scale Interactive Fusion module to progressively interact global change representations with spatial responses. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that CDXLSTM achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets, offering a compelling balance between efficiency and accuracy.

      <title>Impact of Data Duplication on Deep Neural Network-Based Image Classifiers: Robust vs. Standard Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accuracy and robustness of machine learning models against adversarial attacks are significantly influenced by factors such as training data quality, model architecture, the training process, and the deployment environment. In recent years, duplicated data in training sets, especially in language models, has attracted considerable attention. It has been shown that deduplication enhances both training performance and model accuracy in language models. While the importance of data quality in training image classifier Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is widely recognized, the impact of duplicated images in the training set on model generalization and performance has received little attention.
  In this paper, we address this gap and provide a comprehensive study on the effect of duplicates in image classification. Our analysis indicates that the presence of duplicated images in the training set not only negatively affects the efficiency of model training but also may result in lower accuracy of the image classifier. This negative impact of duplication on accuracy is particularly evident when duplicated data is non-uniform across classes or when duplication, whether uniform or non-uniform, occurs in the training set of an adversarially trained model. Even when duplicated samples are selected in a uniform way, increasing the amount of duplication does not lead to a significant improvement in accuracy.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Few-Shot Image Fusion: Granular Ball Priors Enable General-Purpose Deep Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In image fusion tasks, the absence of real fused images as priors presents a fundamental challenge. Most deep learning-based fusion methods rely on large-scale paired datasets to extract global weighting features from raw images, thereby generating fused outputs that approximate real fused images. In contrast to previous studies, this paper explores few-shot training of neural networks under the condition of having prior knowledge. We propose a novel fusion framework named GBFF, and a Granular Ball Significant Extraction algorithm specifically designed for the few-shot prior setting. All pixel pairs involved in the fusion process are initially modeled as a Coarse-Grained Granular Ball. At the local level, Fine-Grained Granular Balls are used to slide through the brightness space to extract Non-Salient Pixel Pairs, and perform splitting operations to obtain Salient Pixel Pairs. Pixel-wise weights are then computed to generate a pseudo-supervised image. At the global level, pixel pairs with significant contributions to the fusion process are categorized into the Positive Region, while those whose contributions cannot be accurately determined are assigned to the Boundary Region. The Granular Ball performs modality-aware adaptation based on the proportion of the positive region, thereby adjusting the neural network's loss function and enabling it to complement the information of the boundary region. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of both the proposed algorithm and the underlying theory. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, our approach shows strong competitiveness in terms of both fusion time and image expressiveness. Our code is publicly available at:</description>
