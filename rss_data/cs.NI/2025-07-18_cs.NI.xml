      <title>Energy-Efficient RSMA-enabled Low-altitude MEC Optimization Via Generative AI-enhanced Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing demand for low-latency computing in 6G is driving the use of UAV-based low-altitude mobile edge computing (MEC) systems. However, limited spectrum often leads to severe uplink interference among ground terminals (GTs). In this paper, we investigate a rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA)-enabled low-altitude MEC system, where a UAV-based edge server assists multiple GTs in concurrently offloading their tasks over a shared uplink. We formulate a joint optimization problem involving the UAV 3D trajectory, RSMA decoding order, task offloading decisions, and resource allocation, aiming to mitigate multi-user interference and maximize energy efficiency. Given the high dimensionality, non-convex nature, and dynamic characteristics of this optimization problem, we propose a generative AI-enhanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to solve it efficiently. Specifically, we embed a diffusion model into the actor network to generate high-quality action samples, improving exploration in hybrid action spaces and avoiding local optima. In addition, a priority-based RSMA decoding strategy is designed to facilitate efficient successive interference cancellation with low complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method for low-altitude MEC systems outperforms baseline methods, and that integrating GDM with RSMA can achieve significantly improved energy efficiency performance.</description>

      <title>RIDAS: A Multi-Agent Framework for AI-RAN with Representation- and Intention-Driven Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sixth generation (6G) networks demand tight integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into radio access networks (RANs) to meet stringent quality of service (QoS) and resource efficiency requirements. Existing solutions struggle to bridge the gap between high level user intents and the low level, parameterized configurations required for optimal performance. To address this challenge, we propose RIDAS, a multi agent framework composed of representation driven agents (RDAs) and an intention driven agent (IDA). RDAs expose open interface with tunable control parameters (rank and quantization bits, enabling explicit trade) offs between distortion and transmission rate. The IDA employs a two stage planning scheme (bandwidth pre allocation and reallocation) driven by a large language model (LLM) to map user intents and system state into optimal RDA configurations. Experiments demonstrate that RIDAS supports 44.71\% more users than WirelessAgent under equivalent QoS constraints. These results validate ability of RIDAS to capture user intent and allocate resources more efficiently in AI RAN environments.</description>

      <title>Predictability-Aware Motion Prediction for Edge XR via High-Order Error-State Kalman Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As 6G networks are developed and defined, offloading of XR applications is emerging as one of the strong new use cases. The reduced 6G latency coupled with edge processing infrastructure will for the first time provide a realistic offloading scenario in cellular networks where several computationally intensive functions, including rendering, can migrate from the user device and into the network. A key advantage of doing so is the lowering of the battery needs in the user devices and the possibility to design new devices with smaller form factors.</description>

      <title>Bidirectional Age of Incorrect Information: A Performance Metric for Status Updates in Virtual Dynamic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virtual dynamic environments (VDEs) such as the Metaverse and digital twins (DTs) require proper representation of the interacting entities to map their characteristics within the simulated or augmented space. Keeping these representations accurate and up-to-date is crucial for seamless interaction and system reliability. In this paper, we propose bidirectional age of incorrect information (BAoII) to address this aspect. BAoII quantifies the time-dependent penalty paid by an entity in a VDE due to incorrect or outdated knowledge about itself and the overall dynamically changing space. This extends the concept of age of incorrect information for a bidirectional information exchange, capturing that a VDE requires mutual awareness of the entity's own representation, measured in the virtual space, and what the other entities share about their representations. Using a continuous-time Markov chain model, we derive a closed-form expression for long-term BAoII and identify a transmission cost threshold for optimal update strategies. We describe a trade-off between communication cost and information freshness and validate our model through numerical simulations, demonstrating the impact of BAoII on evaluating system performance and highlighting its relevance for real-time collaboration in the Metaverse and DTs.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Interface for Semantic Communication with Bit Importance Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Joint source-channel coding (JSCC) is an effective approach for semantic communication. However, current JSCC methods are difficult to integrate with existing communication network architectures, where application and network providers are typically different entities. Recently, a novel paradigm termed Split DeepJSCC has been under consideration to address this challenge. Split DeepJSCC employs a bit-level interface that enables separate design of source and channel codes, ensuring compatibility with existing communication networks while preserving the advantages of JSCC in terms of semantic fidelity and channel adaptability. In this paper, we propose a learning-based interface design by treating its parameters as trainable, achieving improved end-to-end performance compared to Split DeepJSCC. In particular, the interface enables specification of bit-level importance at the output of the source code. Furthermore, we propose an Importance-Aware Net that utilizes the interface-derived bit importance information, enabling dynamical adaptation to diverse channel bandwidth ratios and time-varying channel conditions. Experimental results show that our method improves performance in wireless image transmission tasks. This work provides a potential solution for realizing semantic communications in existing wireless networks.</description>

      <title>XR Offloading Across Multiple Time Scales: The Roles of Power, Temperature, and Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extended reality (XR) devices, commonly known as wearables, must handle significant computational loads under tight latency constraints. To meet these demands, they rely on a combination of on-device processing and edge offloading. This letter focuses on offloading strategies for wearables by considering their impact across three time scales: instantaneous power consumption, short-term temperature fluctuations, and long-term battery duration. We introduce a comprehensive system model that captures these temporal dynamics, and propose a stochastic and stationary offloading strategy, called TAO (for temperature-aware offloading), designed to minimize the offloading cost while adhering to power, thermal, and energy constraints. Our performance evaluation, leveraging COMSOL models of real-world wearables, confirms that TAO reduces offloading cost by over 35% compared to state-of-the-art approaches, without violating the wearable operational limits.</description>

      <title>Comparing One- and Two-way Quantum Repeater Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06152v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum repeaters are an essential building block for realizing long-distance quantum communications. However, due to the fragile nature of quantum information, these repeaters suffer from loss and operational errors. Prior works have classified repeaters into three broad categories based on their use of probabilistic or near-deterministic methods to mitigate these errors. Besides differences in classical communication times, these approaches also vary in technological complexity, with near-deterministic methods requiring more advanced hardware. Recent increases in memory availability and advances in multiplexed entanglement generation motivate a fresh comparison of one-way and two-way repeater architectures.
  In this work, we present a two-way repeater protocol that combines multiplexing with application-aware distillation, designed for a setting where sufficient high-quality memory resources are available -- reflecting architectural assumptions expected in large-scale network deployments. We introduce a recursive formulation to track the full probability distribution of Bell pairs in multiplexed two-way repeater architectures, enabling the performance analysis of multiplexed repeater schemes which use probabilistic $n$-to-$k$ distillation. Using this framework, we compare the proposed two-way protocol with one-way schemes in parameter regimes previously believed to favour the latter, and find that the two-way architecture consistently outperforms one-way protocols while requiring lower technological and resource overheads.</description>
