      <title>A note on codimension $2$ spun embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that if a closed manifold $B$ is a connected component of the binding of an open book decomposition of a manifold $M$, then every open book decomposition of $B$ spun embeds in $M$. As an application, we prove that every open book decomposition of a simply connected spin $5$-manifold spun embeds in $S^7$ and every $3$-dimensional open book spun embeds in $S^5$. We also define a notion of spun embedding for Morse open books.</description>

      <title>Triple linking and rational homology cobordism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If a rational homology 3-sphere $M$ bounds a rational homology 4-ball $W$, then the kernel of the inclusion-induced homomorphism $H_1(M;\mathbb{Z})\to H_1(W;\mathbb{Z})$ is a Lagrangian for the $\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$-valued torsion linking form $\lambda_2$ on $H_1(M;\mathbb{Z})$. In this short paper, we prove that the Freedman-Krushkal triple torsion linking form $\lambda_3$ (arXiv:2506.11941v3) vanishes on this Lagrangian under the assumption that $H_2(W;\mathbb{Z})=0$. We then pose several questions about topological rational homology cobordism.</description>

      <title>Embedding Calculus, Goodwillie Calculus and Link Invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Goodwillie-Weiss embedding calculus through its relationship with Goodwillie's functor calculus. Specifically, building on a result of Tillmann and Weiss, we construct a functorial complement for \(T_{n}\)-embeddings that takes values in Heuts's categorical \(n\)-excisive approximation of pointed spaces. We also establish an analogue of Stallings' theorem for lower central series in the context of \(T_{n}\)-embeddings of \(P \times I\) into \(D^{d}\) for any compact manifold \(P\). As an application, we show that the embedding tower of string links detects Milnor invariants.</description>

      <title>On a lemma of Milnor and Schwarz, apr\`es Rosendal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perhaps the fundamental theorem of geometric group theory, the Milnor--Schwarz lemma gives conditions under which the orbit map relating the geometry of a geodesic metric space and the word metric on a group acting isometrically on the space is a quasi-isometry.
  Pioneering work of Rosendal makes these and other techniques of geometric group theory applicable to an arbitrary (topological) group. We give a succinct treatment of the Milnor--Schwarz lemma, setting it within this context. We derive some applications of this theory to non-Archimedean groups, which have plentiful continuous actions on graphs. In particular, we sharpen results of BarNatan and Verberne on actions of "big" mapping class groups on hyperbolic graphs and clarify a project begun by Mann and Rafi to classify these mapping class groups up to quasi-isometry, noting some extensions to the theory of mapping class groups of locally finite infinite graphs and homeomorphism groups of Stone spaces.</description>

      <title>On the Vietoris-Rips Complexes of Integer Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a metric space $X$ and $r \geq 0$, the Vietoris-Rips complex $\mathcal{VR}(X;r)$ is a simplicial complex whose simplices are finite subsets of $X$ with diameter at most $r$. Vietoris-Rips complexes have applications in various places, including data analysis, geometric group theory, sensor networks, etc. Consider the integer lattice $\mathbb{Z}^n$ as a metric space equipped with the $d_1$-metric (the Manhattan metric or standard word metric in the Cayley graph). Ziga Virk proved that if either $r \geq n^2(2n-1)$, or $1\leq n \leq 3$ and $r \geq n$, then the complex $\mathcal{VR}(\mathbb{Z}^n;r)$ is contractible, and posed a question if $\mathcal{VR}(\mathbb{Z}^n;r)$ is contractible for all $r \geq n$. Recently, Matthew Zaremsky improved Ziga's result and proved that $\mathcal{VR}(\mathbb{Z}^n;r)$ is contractible if $r \geq n^2+ n-1$. Further, he conjectured that $\mathcal{VR}(\mathbb{Z}^n;r)$ is contractible for all $r \geq n$. We prove Zaremsky's conjecture for $n \leq 5$, i.e., we prove that $\mathcal{VR}(\mathbb{Z}^n;r)$ is contractible if $n \leq 5$ and $r \geq n$. Further, we prove that $\mathcal{VR}(\mathbb{Z}^n;r)$ is contractible for $r \geq 10$.
  We determine the homotopy type of $\mathcal{VR}(\mathbb{Z}^n;2)$, and show that these complexes are homotopy equivalent to a wedge of countably infinite copies of $\mathbb{S}^3$. We also show that $\mathcal{VR}(\mathbb{Z}^n;r)$ is simply connected for $r \geq 2$.</description>

      <title>Twisted Knots and the Perturbed Alexander Invariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03754v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The perturbed Alexander invariant $\rho_1$, defined by Bar-Natan and van der Veen, is a powerful, easily computable polynomial knot invariant with deep connections to the Alexander and colored Jones polynomials. We study the behavior of $\rho_1$ for families of knots $\{K_t\}$ given by performing $t$ full twists on a set of coherently oriented strands in a knot $K_0 \subset S^3$. We prove that as $t \to \infty$ the coefficients of $\rho_1$ grow asymptotically linearly, and we show how to compute this growth rate for any such family. As an application we give the first theorem on the ability of $\rho_1$ to distinguish knots in infinite families, and we conjecture that $\rho_1$ obstructs knot positivity via a "perturbed Conway invariant." Along the way we expand on a model of random walks on knot diagrams defined by Lin, Tian and Wang.</description>

      <title>Disk patterns, quasi-duality and the uniform bounded diameter conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the diameter of the image of the skinning map on the deformation space of an acylindrical reflection group is bounded by a constant depending only on the topological complexity of the components of its boundary, answering a conjecture of Minsky in the reflection group setting. This result can be interpreted as a uniform rigidity theorem for disk patterns. Our method also establishes a connection between the diameter of the skinning image and certain discrete extremal width on the Coxeter graph of the reflection group.</description>

      <title>Codimension 2 transfer of signatures in L theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The signature of a closed manifold is an important geometric topology. Let $M$ be a closed manifold and $N$ be a codimension 2 submanifold of it. Given certain homotopy conditions, Higson, Xie and Schick proved an invariance theorem in codimension 2 for the $K$-theoretic signature. They asked for the $L$-theoretic counterpart of their result. In this note, we will answer their question and moreover, construct a tranfer map between the symmetric $L$-groups of the fundamental groups of $M$ and $N$, which carries the signature of $M$ to that of $N$ up to a torsion of order at most $4$.</description>

      <title>Uniform first order interpretation of the second order theory of countable groups of homeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16334v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the first order theory of the homeomorphism group of a compact manifold interprets the full second order theory of countable groups of homeomorphisms of the manifold. The interpretation is uniform across manifolds of bounded dimension. As a consequence, many classical problems in group theory and geometry (e.g.~the linearity of mapping classes of compact $2$--manifolds) are encoded as elementary properties of homeomorphism groups of manifolds. Furthermore, the homeomorphism group uniformly interprets the Borel and projective hierarchies of the homeomorphism group, which gives a characterization of definable subsets of the homeomorphism group. Finally, we prove analogues of Rice's Theorem from computability theory for homeomorphism groups of manifolds. As a consequence, it follows that the collection of sentences that isolate the homeomorphism group of a particular manifold, or that isolate the homeomorphism groups of manifolds in general, is not definable in second order arithmetic, and that membership of particular sentences in these collections cannot be proved in ZFC.</description>
