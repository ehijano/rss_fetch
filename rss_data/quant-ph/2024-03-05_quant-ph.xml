      <title>Quantum Bayesian Inference with Renormalization for Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in gravitational-wave interferometers, particularly the next generation, are poised to profoundly impact gravitational wave astronomy and multimessenger astrophysics. A hybrid quantum algorithm is proposed to carry out quantum inference of parameters from compact binary coalescences detected in gravitational-wave interferometers. It performs quantum Bayesian Inference with Renormalization and Downsampling (qBIRD). We choose binary black hole (BBH) mergers from LIGO observatories as the first case to test the algorithm, but its application can be extended to more general instances. The quantum algorithm is able to generate corner plots of relevant parameters such as chirp mass, mass ratio, spins, etc. by inference of simulated gravitational waves with known injected parameter values with zero noise, Gaussian noise and real data, thus recovering an accuracy equivalent to that of classical Markov Chain Monte Carlo inferences. The simulations are performed with sets of 2 and 4 parameters. These results enhance the possibilities to extend our capacity to track signals from coalescences over longer durations and at lower frequencies extending the accuracy and promptness of gravitational wave parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>Negative refraction without absorption via both coherent and incoherent fields in a four-level left-handed atomic system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper attempts a probe into negative refraction without absorption by means of an incoherent pump field and a strong coherent field coupling the dense four-level atomic system.With the application of the incoherent pump field to manipulate the populations in atomic levels and the variable strong coherent field to create quantum coherence, the constraint condition of two equal transition frequencies responding to the probe field in the atomic system isn't required.And these lead to the propagation transparency and strong magnetic response of the probe field,left-handedness with vanishing absorption in the atomic system.However,an excessive coherent field intensity would increase the absorption.</description>

      <title>Effect of spontaneously generated coherence on left-handedness in a degeneracy atomic system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A theoretical investigation is carried out into the effect of spontaneously generated coherence(SGC) on the left-handedness in a four-level Y-type atomic system with two highest nearly degenerate lying levels. It is found, with the spontaneously generated coherence intensity enhancing, the atomic system gradually displays left-handedness with simultaneous negative permittivity and permeability. And the refractive index enhances with the increasing intensity of SGC.However, the absorption is suppressed by the SGC effect when the SGC has a large intensity.When the probe field is near-resonant coupled to the atomic system, the appearance of SGC doesn't always change the permeability from positive to negative and allow for left-handed behavior,unless the SGC reaches a large intensity.</description>

      <title>Computational supremacy in quantum simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers hold the promise of solving certain problems that lie beyond the reach of conventional computers. Establishing this capability, especially for impactful and meaningful problems, remains a central challenge. One such problem is the simulation of nonequilibrium dynamics of a magnetic spin system quenched through a quantum phase transition. State-of-the-art classical simulations demand resources that grow exponentially with system size. Here we show that superconducting quantum annealing processors can rapidly generate samples in close agreement with solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation. We demonstrate area-law scaling of entanglement in the model quench in two-, three- and infinite-dimensional spin glasses, supporting the observed stretched-exponential scaling of effort for classical approaches. We assess approximate methods based on tensor networks and neural networks and conclude that no known approach can achieve the same accuracy as the quantum annealer within a reasonable timeframe. Thus quantum annealers can answer questions of practical importance that classical computers cannot.</description>

      <title>Retrieving non-stabilizerness with Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing's promise lies in its intrinsic complexity, with entanglement initially heralded as its hallmark. However, the quest for quantum advantage extends beyond entanglement, encompassing the realm of nonstabilizer (magic) states. Despite their significance, quantifying and characterizing these states pose formidable challenges. Here, we introduce a novel approach leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify quantum states based on their magic content. Without relying on a complete knowledge of the state, we utilize partial information acquired from measurement snapshots to train the CNN in distinguishing between stabilizer and nonstabilizer states. Importantly, our methodology circumvents the limitations of full state tomography, offering a practical solution for real-world quantum experiments. In addition, we unveil a theoretical connection between Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropies (SREs) and the expectation value of Pauli matrices for pure quantum states. Our findings pave the way for experimental applications, providing a robust and accessible tool for deciphering the intricate landscape of quantum resources.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration of scalable cross-entropy benchmarking to detect measurement-induced phase transitions on a superconducting quantum processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum systems subject to random unitary evolution and measurements at random points in spacetime exhibit entanglement phase transitions which depend on the frequency of these measurements. Past work has experimentally observed entanglement phase transitions on near-term quantum computers, but the characterization approach using entanglement entropy is not scalable due to exponential overhead of quantum state tomography and post selection. Recently, an alternative protocol to detect entanglement phase transitions using linear cross-entropy was proposed which eliminates both bottlenecks. Here, we report the demonstration of this protocol in systems with one-dimensional and all-to-all connectivities on IBM's quantum hardware on up to 22 qubits, a regime which is presently inaccessible if post-selection is required. We demonstrate a collapse of the data into a scale-invariant form with critical exponents agreeing with theory within uncertainty. Our demonstration paves the way for studies of measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions and associated critical phenomena on larger near-term quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Scalable Quantum Algorithms for Noisy Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing not only holds the potential to solve long-standing problems in quantum physics, but also to offer speed-ups across a broad spectrum of other fields. However, due to the noise and the limited scale of current quantum computers, may prominent quantum algorithms are currently infeasible to run for problem sizes of practical interest. This doctoral thesis develops two main techniques to reduce the quantum computational resource requirements, with the goal of scaling up application sizes on current quantum processors. The first approach is based on stochastic approximations of computationally costly quantities, such as quantum circuit gradients or the quantum geometric tensor (QGT). The second method takes a different perspective on the QGT, leading to a potentially more efficient description of time evolution on current quantum computers. While the main focus of application for our algorithms is the simulation of quantum systems, the developed subroutines can further be utilized in the fields of optimization or machine learning. Our algorithms are benchmarked on a range of representative models, such as Ising or Heisenberg spin models, both in numerical simulations and experiments on the hardware. In combination with error mitigation techniques, the latter is scaled up to 27 qubits; into a regime that variational quantum algorithms are challenging to scale to on noisy quantum computers without our algorithms.</description>

      <title>Optimal quantum circuit cuts with application to clustered Hamiltonian simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study methods to replace entangling operations with random local operations in a quantum computation, at the cost of increasing the number of required executions. First, we consider "space-like cuts" where an entangling unitary is replaced with random local unitaries. We propose an entanglement measure for quantum dynamics, the product extent, which bounds the cost in a procedure for this replacement based on two copies of the Hadamard test. In the terminology of prior work, this procedure yields a quasiprobability decomposition with minimal 1-norm in a number of cases, which addresses an open question of Piveteau and Sutter. As an application, we give dramatically improved bounds on clustered Hamiltonian simulation. Specifically we show that interactions can be removed at a cost exponential in the sum of their strengths times the evolution time.
  We also give an improved upper bound on the cost of replacing wires with measure-and-prepare channels using "time-like cuts". We prove a matching information-theoretic lower bound when estimating output probabilities.</description>

      <title>Abatement of Ionizing Radiation for Superconducting Quantum Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ionizing radiation has been shown to reduce the performance of superconducting quantum circuits. In this report, we evaluate the expected contributions of different sources of ambient radioactivity for typical superconducting qubit experiment platforms. Our assessment of radioactivity inside a typical cryostat highlights the importance of selecting appropriate materials for the experiment components nearest to qubit devices, such as packaging and electrical interconnects. We present a shallow underground facility (30-meter water equivalent) to reduce the flux of cosmic rays and a lead shielded cryostat to abate the naturally occurring radiogenic gamma-ray flux in the laboratory environment. We predict that superconducting qubit devices operated in this facility could experience a reduced rate of correlated multi-qubit errors by a factor of approximately 20 relative to the rate in a typical above-ground, unshielded facility. Finally, we outline overall design improvements that would be required to further reduce the residual ionizing radiation rate, down to the limit of current generation direct detection dark matter experiments.</description>

      <title>Requirements for building effective Hamiltonians using quantum-enhanced density matrix downfolding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density matrix downfolding (DMD) is a technique for regressing low-energy effective Hamiltonians from quantum many-body Hamiltonians. One limiting factor in the accuracy of classical implementations of DMD is the presence of difficult-to-quantify systematic errors attendant to sampling the observables of quantum many-body systems on an approximate low-energy subspace. We propose a hybrid quantum-classical protocol for circumventing this limitation, relying on the prospective ability of quantum computers to efficiently prepare and sample from states in well-defined low-energy subspaces with systematically improvable accuracy. We introduce three requirements for when this is possible, including a notion of compressibility that quantifies features of Hamiltonians and low-energy subspaces thereof for which quantum DMD might be efficient. Assuming that these requirements are met, we analyze design choices for our protocol and provide resource estimates for implementing quantum-enhanced DMD on both the doped 2-D Fermi-Hubbard model and an ab initio model of a cuprate superconductor.</description>

      <title>Single photon scattering from a chain of giant atoms coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate coherent single-photon transport in a waveguide quantum electrodynamics struc- ture containing multiple giant atoms. The single-photon scattering amplitudes are solved using a real-space method. The results give rise to a clear picture of the multi-channel scattering process. In the case of identical and equally-spaced giant atoms in a separate configuration, we also use the transfer-matrix method to express the scattering amplitudes in terms of compact analytical expres- sions, which allow us to conveniently analyze the properties of the scattering spectra. Based on these theoretical results, we find that the non-dipole effects of giant atoms, which are relevant to the design of the setup, can strongly manipulate several types of collective properties of the output fields, including the superradiant phenomenon, the multiple Fano interference, and the photonic band gap. This makes it possible to manipulate the photon transport in a more versatile way than with small atoms. We also make a proposal to probe the topological states of a chain of braided giant atoms by using photon scattering spectra, showing that waveguide quantum electrodynamics systems with giant atoms are ideal platforms to merge topological physics and on-chip quantum optics.</description>

      <title>Optomechanical cooling with simultaneous intracavity and extracavity squeezed light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel and experimentally feasible approach to achieve high-efficiency ground-state cooling of a mechanical oscillator in an optomechanical system under the deeply unresolved sideband condition with the assistance of both intracavity and extracavity squeezing. In the scheme, a degenerate optical parametric amplifier is placed inside the optical cavity, generating the intracavity squeezing; besides, the optical cavity is driven by externally generated squeezing light, namely the extracavity squeezing. The quantum interference effect generated by intracavity squeezing and extracavity squeezing can completely suppress the non-resonant Stokes heating process while greatly enhancing the anti-Stokes cooling process. Therefore, the joint-squeezing scheme is capable of cooling the mechanical oscillators to their quantum ground state in a regime far away from the resolved sideband condition. Compared with other traditional optomechanical cooling schemes, the single-photon cooling rate in this joint-squeezing scheme can be tremendously enlarged by nearly three orders of magnitude. At the same time, the coupling strength required to achieve ground-state cooling can be significantly reduced. This scheme is promising for cooling large-mass and low-frequency mechanical oscillators, which provides a prerequisite for preparing and manipulating non-classical states in macroscopic quantum systems and lays a significant foundation for quantum manipulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article combines the quantum Rubik's cube matrix with the BBH model, defines the matrix algorithm based on the reverse process of convolution, constructs the expression of quantum Rubik's cube matrix and Hamiltonian. Furthermore, in order to make the operation process of the quantum Rubik's cube matrix clearer, we used Joseph ring to draw a topology graph of the Rubik's cube expansion. This article uses a Quantum Rubik's cube to achieve energy level transitions of electrons, and its operation corresponds to path integration, obtaining the band dispersion. This work provides new ideas and methods for calculating Hamiltonian and studying energy level structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid progress in the design of scalable, robust quantum computing necessitates efficient quantum circuit implementation for algorithms with practical relevance. For several algorithms, arithmetic kernels, in particular, division plays an important role. In this manuscript, we focus on enhancing the performance of quantum slow dividers by exploring the design choices of its sub-blocks, such as, adders. Through comprehensive design space exploration of state-of-the-art quantum addition building blocks, our work have resulted in an impressive achievement: a reduction in Toffoli Depth of up to 94.06%, accompanied by substantial reductions in both Toffoli and Qubit Count of up to 91.98% and 99.37%, respectively. This paper offers crucial perspectives on efficient design of quantum dividers, and emphasizes the importance of adopting a systematic design space exploration approach.</description>

      <title>High-coherence superconducting qubits made using industry-standard, advanced semiconductor manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of superconducting qubit technology has shown great potential for the construction of practical quantum computers. As the complexity of quantum processors continues to grow, the need for stringent fabrication tolerances becomes increasingly critical. Utilizing advanced industrial fabrication processes could facilitate the necessary level of fabrication control to support the continued scaling of quantum processors. However, these industrial processes are currently not optimized to produce high coherence devices, nor are they a priori compatible with the commonly used approaches to make superconducting qubits. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time superconducting transmon qubits manufactured in a 300 mm CMOS pilot line, using industrial fabrication methods, with resulting relaxation and coherence times already exceeding 100 microseconds. We show across-wafer, large-scale statistics studies of coherence, yield, variability, and aging that confirm the validity of our approach. The presented industry-scale fabrication process, using exclusively optical lithography and reactive ion etching, shows performance and yield similar to the conventional laboratory-style techniques utilizing metal lift-off, angled evaporation, and electron-beam writing. Moreover, it offers potential for further upscaling by including three-dimensional integration and additional process optimization using advanced metrology and judicious choice of processing parameters and splits. This result marks the advent of more reliable, large-scale, truly CMOS-compatible fabrication of superconducting quantum computing processors.</description>

      <title>Spatially parallel decoding for multi-qubit lattice surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Running quantum algorithms protected by quantum error correction requires a real time, classical decoder. To prevent the accumulation of a backlog, this decoder must process syndromes from the quantum device at a faster rate than they are generated. Most prior work on real time decoding has focused on an isolated logical qubit encoded in the surface code. However, for surface code, quantum programs of utility will require multi-qubit interactions performed via lattice surgery. A large merged patch can arise during lattice surgery -- possibly as large as the entire device. This puts a significant strain on a real time decoder, which must decode errors on this merged patch and maintain the level of fault-tolerance that it achieves on isolated logical qubits.
  These requirements are relaxed by using spatially parallel decoding, which can be accomplished by dividing the physical qubits on the device into multiple overlapping groups and assigning a decoder module to each. We refer to this approach as spatially parallel windows. While previous work has explored similar ideas, none have addressed system-specific considerations pertinent to the task or the constraints from using hardware accelerators. In this work, we demonstrate how to configure spatially parallel windows, so that the scheme (1) is compatible with hardware accelerators, (2) supports general lattice surgery operations, (3) maintains the fidelity of the logical qubits, and (4) meets the throughput requirement for real time decoding. Furthermore, our results reveal the importance of optimally choosing the buffer width to achieve a balance between accuracy and throughput -- a decision that should be influenced by the device's physical noise.</description>

      <title>All-Pass Readout for Robust and Scalable Quantum Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust and scalable multiplexed qubit readout will be essential to the realization of a fault-tolerant quantum computer. To this end, we propose and demonstrate transmission-based dispersive readout of a superconducting qubit using an all-pass resonator that preferentially emits readout photons in one direction. This is in contrast to typical readout schemes, which intentionally mismatch the feedline at one end so that the readout signal preferentially decays toward the output. We show that this intentional mismatch creates scaling challenges, including larger spread of effective resonator linewidths due to non-ideal impedance environments and added infrastructure for impedance matching. Our proposed "all-pass readout" architecture avoids the need for intentional mismatch and aims to enable reliable, modular design of multiplexed qubit readout, thus improving the scaling prospects of quantum computers. We design and fabricate an all-pass readout resonator that demonstrates insertion loss below 1.17 dB at the readout frequency and a maximum insertion loss of 1.53 dB across its full bandwidth for the lowest three states of a transmon qubit. We demonstrate qubit readout with an average single-shot fidelity of 98.1% in 600 ns; to assess the effect of larger dispersive shift, we implement a shelving protocol and achieve a fidelity of 99.0% in 300 ns.</description>

      <title>Fault-tolerant Quantum Error Correction Using a Linear Array of Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a fault-tolerant quantum error correction architecture consisting of a linear array of emitters and delay lines. In our scheme, a resource state for fault-tolerant quantum computation is generated by letting the emitters interact with a stream of photons and their neighboring emitters. In the absence of delay line errors, our schemes have thresholds ranging between 0.32% and 0.39% against the standard circuit-level depolarizing error model. Depending on the number of emitters n_e, we study the effect of delay line errors in two regimes: when n_e is a small constant of order unity and when n_e scales with the code distance. Between these two regimes, the logical error rate steadily decreases as n_e increases, from an exponential decay in eta^{-1/2} to an exponential decay in eta^{-1}. We also carry out a detailed study of the break-even point and the fault-tolerance overhead. These studies suggest that the multi-emitter architecture, using the state-of-the-art delay lines, can be used to demonstrate error suppression, assuming other sources of errors are sufficiently small.</description>

      <title>Planar two-region multi-partite maximally entangled states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In entanglement theory, there are different methods to consider one state being more entangled than another. The "maximally" entangled states in a multipartite system can be defined from an axiomatic perspective. According to different criteria for selection, there are many specific types of quantum maximally entangled states, such as absolutely maximally entangled state, planar maximally entangled state and so on. In this paper we propose a new type of maximally entangled states, the planar two-region multipartite maximally entangled state. The requirement condition of this maximally entangled state is weak than that of the absolutely maximally entangled state and different from that of the planar maximally entangled state. We show that there are the two-region four-partite maximally entangled states in 4-qubit and 7-qubit planar systems, although there is no absolutely maximally entangled state in these systems. It is proved that there are the planar two-region four-partite maximally entangled states in both even particle quantum systems and odd particle quantum systems. Additionally, based on some planar two-region four-partite maximally entangled states, the new planar two-region four-partite maximally entangled states are generated. We also provide some important examples of the planar two-region multi-partite maximally entangled states.</description>

      <title>The incompatibility of quantum channels in general probabilistic theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum theory, there exist sets of operations that cannot be performed simultaneously. These sets of operations are referred to as incompatible. While this definition of incompatibility extends to general probabilistic theories, the dependency of the set of compatible sets on the definition of composite systems has not been thoroughly investigated. In the context of quantum channels, compatibility is defined using the tensor product of Hilbert spaces, employing the usual composite system. However, in the context of general probabilistic theories, composite systems are not uniquely determined, and the set of states can range from min tensor to max tensor, forming various convex sets. In this paper, in addition to quantum compatibility using the usual composite system, we introduce min-tensor-compatibility using the min-tensor on the composite system of effect spaces and investigate their relationship using noisy identity channels on qubits. As a result, we found that the set of min-tensor-compatible channel pairs is strictly broader than the set of quantum-compatible channel pairs. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of almost quantum compatible channel pairs from an operational perspective. This concept corresponds to cases where the correlation functions appearing in the verification of compatibility can be realized through a channel and local reinterpretation of effects. We demonstrate that the set of all almost quantum compatible channel pairs is strictly narrower than the set of all min-tensor-compatible channel pairs.</description>

      <title>Unification of energy concepts in generalised phase space theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider how to describe Hamiltonian mechanics in generalised probabilistic theories with the states represented as quasi-probability distributions. We give general operational definitions of energy-related concepts. We define generalised energy eigenstates as the purest stationary states. Planck's constant plays two different roles in the framework: the phase space volume taken up by a pure state and a dynamical factor. The Hamiltonian is a linear combination of generalised energy eigenstates. This allows for a generalised Liouville time-evolution equation that applies to quantum and classical Hamiltonian mechanics and more. The approach enables a unification of quantum and classical energy concepts and a route to discussing energy in a wider set of theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we contribute to the mathematical foundations of the recently established theory of Spectrum Broadcast Structures (SBS). These are multipartite quantum states, encoding an operational notion of objectivity and exhibiting a more advanced form of decoherence. We study SBS in the case of a central system interacting with N environments via the von Neumann-type measurement interactions, ubiquitous in the theory of open quantum systems. We state and prove a novel sufficient condition for SBS to arise dynamically for finite-dimensional systems. The condition is based on the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization rather than on the Knill-Barnum error estimation used before.</description>

      <title>Fabry-P\'{e}rot nanocavities controlled by Casimir forces in electrolyte solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a design for tuning the resonant spectra of Fabry-P\'{e}rot nanocavities mediated by the Casimir force. The system involves a suspended gold nanoplate approaching to a dielectric-coated gold substrate in a univalent electrolyte solution. The gold nanoplate can be stably suspended due to the delicate balance between repulsive and attractive components of the Casimir forces. In an electrolyte solution, the presence of ionic-charge fluctuations can partially or totally screen the thermal $n$=0 Matsubara term, resulting in strongly modified interactions. As a result, the separation between the gold nanoplate and the substrate experiences a significant modulation in response to variations in salt concentration. Under proper conditions, we find that the modulation of the Casimir force would strongly shift the resonances of Fabry-P\'{e}rot nanocavities at the optical frequencies, when the Debye length of the electrolyte decreases from 1000 nm to 10 nm. Finally, the temperature dependence of the thermal Casimir force would provide an additional modulation of Fabry-P\'{e}rot nanocavity resonances for their eventual fine tuning. These results open up a promising venue for general tuning of the optical resonances with potential applications in re-configurable microfluidic nanophotonics.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal recovery of electromagnetically induced transparency by wavenumber mismatch in hot atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For multi-level systems in hot atomic vapors the interplay between the Doppler shift due to atom velocity and the wavenubmer mismatch between driving laser fields strongly influences transmission and absorption properties of the atomic medium. In a three-level atomic ladder-system, Doppler broadening limits the visibility of electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT) when the probe and control fields are co-propagating, while EIT is recovered under the opposite condition of counter-propagating geometry and $k_{p} &lt; k_{c}$, with $k_{p}$ and $k_{c}$ being the wavenumbers of the probe and control fields, respectively. This effect has been studied and experimentally demonstrated as an efficient mechanism to realize non-reciprocal probe light transmission, opening promising avenues for example for realization of magnetic-field free optical isolators. In this tutorial we discuss the theoretical derivation of this effect and show the underlying mechanism to be an avoided crossing of the states dressed by the coupling laser as a function of atomic velocities when $k_{p}&lt;k_{c}$. We investigate how the non-reciprocity scales with wavelength mismatch and show how to experimentally demonstrate the effect in a simple Rydberg-EIT system using thermal Rubidium atoms.</description>

      <title>Una interpretacion de colapso objetivo para los problemas de la medida y la clasicalizacion donde no se conserva la informacion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work was researched the problems of classicalization and measurement unifying them in a single problem: the problem of collapse, for this purpose was developed a working program -- the classicalization's program -- in an interpretation of objective collapse that was proposed for this purpose, and which overcomes the limitations of the official interpretation. This program explain that the classicization arises by alternating the unitary evolution and the collapses, due to the redistribution of energy, so the classical mechanics emerges as a good approximation; however, was defined deep chaos as the regime where macrosystems are so sensitive to the initial conditions that are affected by the collapses and indeterminism of quantum mechanics, allowing the emergence of thermodynamics with its irreversibility; at this level the observation occurs because the measurement device (classic) extends their collapses at microsystem through quantum entanglement. In this work, was did an extension of the classicalization's program at the black holes, and was explained -- at a level still in development -- about the role of the collapses in its thermodynamic; in addition, the program of quantum decoherence was critized, and was presented a theory of physical information that was developing.</description>

      <title>Inverted-circuit zero-noise extrapolation for quantum gate error mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common approach to deal with gate errors in modern quantum-computing hardware is zero-noise extrapolation. By artificially amplifying errors and extrapolating the expectation values obtained with different error strengths towards the zero-error (zero-noise) limit, the technique aims at rectifying errors in noisy quantum computing systems. For an accurate extrapolation, it is essential to know the exact factors of the noise amplification. In this article, we propose a simple method for estimating the strength of errors occurring in a quantum circuit and demonstrate improved extrapolation results. The method determines the error strength for a circuit by appending to it the inverted circuit and measuring the probability of the initial state. The estimation of error strengths is easy to implement for arbitrary circuits and does not require a previous characterisation of noise properties. We compare this method with the conventional zero-noise extrapolation method and show that the novel method leads to a more accurate calculation of expectation values. Our method proves to be particularly effective on current hardware, showcasing its suitability for near-term quantum computing applications.</description>

      <title>Improved performance of the Bacon-Shor code with Steane's syndrome extraction method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare Steane's and Shor's syndrome extraction methods on the Bacon-Shor code. We propose a straightforward strategy based on post-selection to prepare the logical $|0\rangle_L$ and $|+\rangle_L$ states of the Bacon-Shor code by using flag-like qubits to verify their constituent Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states. We perform stabilizer simulations with a depolarizing Pauli error model and find that Steane's method significantly outperforms Shor's. Not only does Steane's method result in pseudo-thresholds that are about 1 order of magnitude higher than Shor's, but also its advantage increases monotonically as we go from a distance-3 to a distance-9 Bacon-Shor code. The advantage of Steane's method is the greatest in the regime where gate errors dominate over measurement errors. Some of the circuit constructions we propose for Steane's method are not formally fault-tolerant, yet outperform the formally fault-tolerant Shor's protocols for experimentally relevant physical error rates. This suggest that constructing formally fault-tolerant circuits that maintain the full code distance is not strictly necessary to guarantee the usefulness of a quantum error-correcting protocol. Despite relying on post-selection, we find that our methods can be efficient. These protocols would be naturally implementable on a platform with long-range qubit interactions like trapped ions or neutral atoms.</description>

      <title>Separation between Entanglement Criteria and Entanglement Detection Protocols</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement detection is one of the most fundamental tasks in quantum information science, playing vital roles in theoretical studies and quantum system benchmarking. Researchers have proposed many powerful entanglement criteria with high detection capabilities and small observable numbers. Nonetheless, entanglement criteria only represent mathematical rules deciding the existence of entanglement. The relationship between a good entanglement criterion and an effective experimental entanglement detection protocol (EDP) is poorly understood. In this study, we introduce postulates for EDPs about their detection capabilities and robustness and use them to show the difference between entanglement criteria and EDPs. Specifically, we design an entanglement detection task for unknown pure bipartite states and demonstrate that the sample complexity of any EDP and the number of observables for a good entanglement criterion can have exponential separation. Furthermore, we discover that the optimal EDP with the lowest sample complexity does not necessarily correspond to the optimal entanglement criterion with the fewest observables. Our results can be used to prove the exponential speedups achieved through quantum memory and be generalized to multipartite entanglement detection. By highlighting the significance and independence of EDP design, our work holds practical implications for entanglement detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Computing exact moments of local random quantum circuits via tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A basic primitive in quantum information is the computation of the moments $\mathbb{E}_U[{\rm Tr}[U\rho U^\dagger O]^t]$. These describe the distribution of expectation values obtained by sending a state $\rho$ through a random unitary $U$, sampled from some distribution, and measuring the observable $O$. While the exact calculation of these moments is generally hard, if $U$ is composed of local random gates, one can estimate $\mathbb{E}_U[{\rm Tr}[U\rho U^\dagger O]^t]$ by performing Monte Carlo simulations of a Markov chain-like process. However, this approach can require a prohibitively large number of samples, or suffer from the sign problem. In this work, we instead propose to estimate the moments via tensor networks, where the local gates moment operators are mapped to small dimensional tensors acting on their local commutant bases. By leveraging representation theoretical tools, we study the local tensor dimension and we provide bounds for the bond dimension of the matrix product states arising from deep circuits. We compare our techniques against Monte Carlo simulations, showing that we can significantly out-perform them. Then, we showcase how tensor networks can exactly compute the second moment when $U$ is a quantum neural network acting on thousands of qubits and having thousands of gates. To finish, we numerically study the anticoncentration phenomena of circuits with orthogonal random gates, a task which cannot be studied via Monte Carlo due to sign problems.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of a Generalized Dicke Model for Spin-1 Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dicke model is a staple of theoretical cavity Quantum Electrodynamics (cavity QED), describing the interaction between an ensemble of atoms and a single radiation mode of an optical cavity. It has been studied both quantum mechanically and semiclassically for two-level atoms, and demonstrates a rich variety of dynamics such as phase transitions, phase multistability, and chaos. In this work we explore an open, spin-1 Dicke model with independent co- and counter-rotating coupling terms as well as a quadratic Zeeman shift enabling control over the atomic energy-level structure. We investigate the stability of operator and moment equations under two approximations and show the system undergoes phase transitions. To compliment these results, we relax the aforementioned approximations and investigate the system semiclassically. We show evidence of phase transitions to steady-state and oscillatory superradiance in this semiclassical model, as well as the emergence of chaotic dynamics. The varied and complex behaviours admitted by the model highlights the need to more rigorously map its dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a general prototype of quantum computation based on the finding of many-body ground states. The scheme is inspired by cavity cooling, involving the emulation of a zero-temperature reservoir. Repeated discarding of ancilla reservoir qubits extracts the entropy of the system, driving the system towards its ground state. At the same time, measurement of the discarded qubits hints at the energy level structure of many-body systems. We show that quantum computation based on this Markovian process is equivalent in its computational power to the one based on quantum circuits. We exemplify the scheme with several illustrative use cases for combinatorial optimization problems, discussing the efficiency and the issue of local energy minima. We also discuss its application to the preparation of quantum many-body ground states for gapped systems.</description>

      <title>Contextuality, superlocality and supernoncontextuality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contextuality is a fundamental manifestation of nonclassicality, indicating that for certain quantum correlations, sets of jointly measurable variables cannot be pre-assigned values independently of the measurement context. In this work, we characterize nonclassical quantum correlation beyond contextuality, in terms of supernoncontextuality, namely the higher-than-quantum hidden-variable(HV) dimensionality required to reproduce the given noncontextual quantum correlations. Thus supernoncontextuality is the contextuality analogue of superlocality. Specifically, we study the quantum system of two-qubit states in a scenario composed of five contexts that demonstrate contextuality in a state-dependent fashion. For this purpose, we use the framework of boxes, whose behavior is described by a set of probabilities satisfying the no-disturbance conditions. We observe that superlocal states must have sufficiently a high HV dimension in order to lead to a contextual box. On the other hand, a noncontextual superlocal box can be supernoncontextual, but superlocality is not a necessary condition. For sublocal (i.e., not superlocal) boxes, supernoncontextuality arises owing to a different type of simultaneous correlation in two MUBs present in any nonproduct state and correlations due to nonlocal measurements. From an operational perspective, the superlocal states that can or cannot be used to demonstrate contextuality can be distinguished by quantum correlations in two and three mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) of the discordant correlations in the states.</description>

      <title>Quantum Dynamical Hamiltonian Monte Carlo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the open challenges in quantum computing is to find meaningful and practical methods to leverage quantum computation to accelerate classical machine learning workflows. A ubiquitous problem in machine learning workflows is sampling from probability distributions that we only have access to via their log probability. To this end, we extend the well-known Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) method for Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to leverage quantum computation in a hybrid manner as a proposal function. Our new algorithm, Quantum Dynamical Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (QD-HMC), replaces the classical symplectic integration proposal step with simulations of quantum-coherent continuous-space dynamics on digital or analogue quantum computers. We show that QD-HMC maintains key characteristics of HMC, such as maintaining the detailed balanced condition with momentum inversion, while also having the potential for polynomial speedups over its classical counterpart in certain scenarios. As sampling is a core subroutine in many forms of probabilistic inference, and MCMC in continuously-parameterized spaces covers a large-class of potential applications, this work widens the areas of applicability of quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Complete Interband Transitions for Non-Hermitian Spin-Orbit-Coupled Cold-Atom Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, synthetic spin-orbit coupling has been introduced into cold-atom systems for more flexible control of the Hamiltonian, which was further made time-varying through two-photon detuning to achieve dynamic control of the cold-atom state. While an intraband transition can be adiabatically obtained, a complete interband transition, rather than a superposition of different bands, obtained through fast sweeping is usually guaranteed by having the positions of the initial and final states be far away from any band gap in the quasimomentum space. Here, by introducing an additional non-Hermitian parameter through an atom-loss contrast together with two-photon detuning as two controllable external parameters, both intraband and complete interband transitions can be achieved independent of the positions of the initial and final states. In addition, a point-source diagram approach in the 2D external parameter space is developed to visualize and predict the locations of any nonadiabatic transitions. This control protocol can have potential applications in quantum state control and quantum simulations using cold-atom systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The photonic platform holds great promise for quantum computing. Nevertheless, the intrinsic probabilistic characteristics of its native fusion operations introduces substantial randomness into the computing process, posing significant challenges to achieving scalability and efficiency in program execution. In this paper, we introduce a randomness-aware compilation framework designed to concurrently achieve scalability and efficiency. Our approach leverages an innovative combination of offline and online optimization passes, with a novel intermediate representation serving as a crucial bridge between them. Through a comprehensive evaluation, we demonstrate that this framework significantly outperforms the most efficient baseline compiler in a scalable manner, opening up new possibilities for realizing scalable photonic quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of quantum observables and Born's rule in Bohmian Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper we study both ordered and chaotic Bohmian trajectories in the Born distribution of 2d quantum systems. We find theoretically and numerically the average values of the energy, momentum, angular momentum and position of 2d quantum systems. In particular, we consider realizations of the Born distribution of a system with a single nodal point and of two different cases with many nodal points, one with almost equal number of ordered and chaotic trajectories and one consisting of almost exclusively chaotic trajectories. The numerical average values agree with the theoretical values if the Born $P=|\Psi|^2$ rule is initially satisfied, but do not agree when $P_0\neq|\Psi_0|^2$. We study the role of ordered and chaotic trajectories in providing these average values.</description>

      <title>Quantum counterdiabatic driving with local control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppression of diabatic transitions in quantum adiabatic evolution stands as a significant challenge for ground state preparations. Counterdiabatic driving has been proposed to compensate for diabatic losses and achieve shortcut to adiabaticity. However, its implementation necessitates the generation of adiabatic gauge potential, which requires knowledge of the spectral gap of instantaneous Hamiltonians and involves highly non-local drivings in many-body systems. In this work, we consider local counterdiabatic (LCD) driving with approximate adiabatic gauge potential. Using transverse-field Ising model as an example, we present an in-depth study of the performance and optimization of LCD protocols. We then propose a novel two-step protocol based on LCD and simple local single-body control to further improve the performance. The optimization of these LCD-based protocols does not require knowledge of instantaneous Hamiltonians, and only additional local driving is involved. To benchmark the performance of LCD and the proposed local control-enhanced LCD technique, we experimentally implement digitized adiabatic quantum evolution in a trapped-ion system. We characterize the quality of the prepared states and explore the scaling behavior with system size up to 14 qubits. Our demonstration of quantum shortcut to adiabaticity opens a path towards preparing ground states of complex systems with accessible local controls.</description>

      <title>Wafer-scale uniformity improvement of Dolan-bridge Josephson junctions by optimization of shadow evaporation technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the practical limitations of solid-state quantum computer manufacturing is the low reproducibility of the superconducting qubits resonance frequency. It makes hard demands on the Josephson junction fabrication process, producing a nonlinear inductance of the qubit. In this work, we demonstrate for 100 mm wafer decreasing of the room temperature resistance variation coefficient to 6.0% for 150x170 nm2 Al/AlOx/Al Josephson junction area and to 4.0% for 150x670 nm2 Al/AlOx/Al Josephson junction area. These results were achieved by the development of the shadow evaporation process model considering the Josephson junction area variation on the wafer. Our model allows us to provide the junction area variation coefficient of about 1.0% for Josephson junction characteristic dimensions from 100 nm to 700 nm. In addition, we show the junction oxidation technic optimization. Our improvements can be scalable on the wafer with a large diameter, which allows to manufacturing of the quantum processor with high reproducibility of electrical parameters.</description>

      <title>Femtotesla Atomic Magnetometer for Zero- and Ultralow-field Nuclear Magnetic Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero- and ultralow-field nuclear magnetic resonance (ZULF NMR) has experienced rapid development and provides an excellent tool for diverse research fields ranging from materials science, quantum information processing to fundamental physics. The detection of ZULF NMR signals in samples with natural abundance remains a challenging endeavor, due to the limited sensitivity of NMR detectors and thermal polarization. In this work, we demonstrate a femtotesla potassium spin-exchange relaxation-free (SERF) magnetometer designed for ZULF NMR detection. A potassium vapor cell with high buffer gas pressure and high atomic number density is used in the magnetometer. With absorption spectroscopy and SERF effect, the key parameters of the vapor cell are characterized and applied to optimize the magnetometer sensitivity. To combine our SERF magnetometer and ZULF NMR detection, a custom-made vacuum chamber is employed to keep NMR sample close to the magnetometer cell and protect the sample from undesired heating effects. Gradiometric measurement is performed to greatly reduce the magnetic noise. With the phase calibration applied, the gradiometric measurement achieves 7-fold enhancement in magnetic-field sensitivity compared to the single channel and has a magnetic noise floor of 1.2 fT/Hz$^{1/2}$. Our SERF magnetometer exhibits high sensitivity and is promising to realize ZULF NMR detection of samples with natural abundance.</description>

      <title>Characterization of non-Markovianity with maximal extractable qubit-reservoir entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamical behavior of a qubit in a reservoir is critical to applications in quantum technological protocols, ranging from quantum computation to quantum metrology. The effect of the reservoir depends on reservoir's spectral structure, as well as on the qubit-reservoir coupling strength. We here propose a measure for quantifying the non-Markovian effect of a reservoir with a Lorentzian spectrum, based on the maximum qubit-reservoir quantum entanglement that can be extracted. Numerical simulation shows this entanglement exhibits a monotonous behavior in response to the variation of the coupling strength. We confirm the validity of this measure with an experiment, where a superconducting qubit is controllably coupled to a lossy resonator, which acts as a reservoir for the qubit. The experimental results illustrate the maximal extractable entanglement is progressively increased with the strengthening of the non-Markovianity.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new proposal for distinguishing heat from work based on a control-theoretic observability decomposition. We derive a Hermitian operator representing instantaneous dissipation of observable energy, and suggest a generalization of the von-Neumann entropy which can account for the model-uncertainty also present in pure states if the measured observables are informationally incomplete. In this view, the transition from a fundamental to a thermodynamic model consists in mapping the fundamental density matrix to an effective one, generally of lower dimension, encoding only what is observable given the constraints of our sensor and actuator capabilities. The generalized entropy captures the information loss incurred in this mapping. The theory is illustrated for the central spin model, where we show that the application of external controls can increase the size of thermal fluctuations and lower the entropy.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An open challenge in the context of quantum information processing and communication is improving the robustness of quantum information to environmental contributions of noise, a severe hindrance in real-world scenarios. Here we create quantum skyrmionic topologies across two degrees of freedom in two entangled photons and show that the topological invariant remains resilient even as the purity of the state decreases due to environmental noise, collapsing only once the state is maximally mixed. We discuss how such noise perturbations can be considered a smooth deformation of the state, and provide a full theoretical treatment to support the experimental findings. Our approach can be viewed as a digitization of quantum information, holding exciting promise for intrinsic quantum resilience through topology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiofrequency traps are used to confine charged particles but are only stable for a narrow range of charge-to-mass ratios. Here, we confine two particles -- a nanoparticle and an atomic ion -- in the same radiofrequency trap although their charge-to-mass ratios differ by six orders of magnitude. The confinement is enabled by a dual-frequency voltage applied to the trap electrodes. We introduce a robust loading procedure under ultra-high vacuum and characterize the stability of both particles. It is observed that slow-field micromotion, an effect specific to the dual-field setting, plays a crucial role for ion localization and will be important to account for when engineering controlled interactions between the particles.</description>

      <title>Recursive Quantum Relaxation for Combinatorial Optimization Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum optimization methods use a continuous degree-of-freedom of quantum states to heuristically solve combinatorial problems, such as the MAX-CUT problem, which can be attributed to various NP-hard combinatorial problems. This paper shows that some existing quantum optimization methods can be unified into a solver that finds the binary solution that is most likely measured from the optimal quantum state. Combining this finding with the concept of quantum random access codes (QRACs) for encoding bits into quantum states on fewer qubits, we propose an efficient recursive quantum relaxation method called recursive quantum random access optimization (RQRAO) for MAX-CUT. Experiments on standard benchmark graphs with several hundred nodes in the MAX-CUT problem, conducted in a fully classical manner using a tensor network technique, show that RQRAO outperforms the Goemans--Williamson method and is comparable to state-of-the-art classical solvers. The codes will be made available soon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Klein tunneling, a peculiar effect in relativistic quantum mechanics, poses an outstanding challenge to the quantum-classical correspondence. We establish, based on the scattering matrix framework, an exact periodic-orbit quantization of Klein tunneling for bounded Dirac systems with a step potential. It relies heavily on a family of distinct non-Newtonian orbits, the Klein orbits, to account for the non-decaying propagation inside the classically forbidden barrier. An explicit spectral counting function and a closed form of the Weyl formula with Klein tunneling based corrections are derived. The theoretical findings are supported by microwave analog experiments. The measured quantized levels and corresponding Klein tunneling states provide the first observation of Klein tunneling in bounded Dirac systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimental proposals for testing quantum gravity-induced entanglement of masses (QGEM) typically involve two interacting masses which are each in a spatial superposition state. Here, we propose a QGEM experiment with two particles which are each in a superposition of rotational states, this amounts to a superposition of mass through mass-energy equivalence. Our proposal relies on the fact that rotational energy gravitates. This approach would test a feature unique to gravity since it amounts to sourcing a spacetime in superposition due to a superposition of 'charge'. We propose and analyse a concrete experimental protocol and discuss challenges.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the performance of a Hybrid Quantum Neural Network (HQNN) and a comparable classical Convolution Neural Network (CNN) for detection and classification problem using a radar. Specifically, we take a fairly complex radar time-series model derived from electromagnetic theory, namely the Martin-Mulgrew model, that is used to simulate radar returns of objects with rotating blades, such as drones. We find that when that signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is high, CNN outperforms the HQNN for detection and classification. However, in the low SNR regime (which is of greatest interest in practice) the performance of HQNN is found to be superior to that of the CNN of a similar architecture.</description>

      <title>Recovering quantum coherence of a cavity qubit through environment monitoring and active feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decoherence in qubits, caused by their interaction with a noisy environment, poses a significant challenge to developing reliable quantum processors. Monitoring the qubit's environment enables not only to flag decoherence events but also to reverse these errors, thereby restoring the qubit coherence. This approach is particularly beneficial for superconducting cavity qubits, whose unavoidable interaction with auxiliary transmons impacts their coherence. In this work, we uncover the intricate dynamics of cavity qubit decoherence by tracking the noisy trajectory of a transmon acting as the cavity's environment. Using real-time feedback, we successfully recover the lost coherence of the cavity qubit, achieving a fivefold increase in its dephasing time. Alternatively, by detecting transmon errors and converting them into erasures, we improve the cavity phase coherence by more than an order of magnitude. These advances are essential for using cavity qubits with low photon loss rates as long-lived quantum memories with high-fidelity gates and can enable more efficient bosonic quantum error correction codes.</description>

      <title>Diagonal operator decomposition on restricted topologies via enumeration of quantum state subsets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various quantum algorithms require usage of arbitrary diagonal operators as subroutines. For their execution on a physical hardware, those operators must be first decomposed into target device's native gateset and its qubit connectivity for entangling gates. Here, we assume that the allowed gates are exactly the CX gate and the parameterized phase gate. We introduce a framework for the analysis of CX-only circuits and through its lens provide solution constructions for several different device topologies (fully-connected, linear and circular). We also introduce two additional variants of the problem. Those variants can be used in place of exact decomposition of the diagonal operator when the circuit following it satisfies a set of prerequisites, enabling further reduction in the CX cost of implementation. Finally, we discuss how to exploit the framework for the decomposition of a particular, rather than general, diagonal operator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optically active spin defects in solids offer promising platforms to investigate nuclear spin clusters with high sensitivity and atomic-site resolution. To leverage near-surface defects for molecular structure analysis in chemical and biological contexts using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), further advances in spectroscopic characterization of nuclear environments are essential. Here, we report Fourier spectroscopy techniques to improve localization and mapping of the testbed $^{13}\mathrm{C}$ nuclear spin environment of individual, shallow nitrogen-vacancy centers at room temperature. We use multidimensional spectroscopy, well-known from classical NMR, in combination with weak measurements of single-nuclear-spin precession. We demonstrate two examples of multidimensional NMR: (i) improved nuclear spin localization by separate encoding of the two hyperfine components along spectral dimensions and (ii) spectral editing of nuclear-spin pairs, including measurement of internuclear coupling constants. Our work adds important tools for the spectroscopic analysis of molecular structures by single-spin probes.</description>

      <title>Aluminum Josephson junction microstructure and electrical properties modification with thermal annealing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting qubits based on Al/AlOx/Al Josephson junction are one of the most promising candidates for the physical implementation of universal quantum computers. Due to scalability and compatibility with the state-of-the-art nanoelectronic processes one can fabricate hundreds of qubits on a single silicon chip. However, decoherence in these systems caused by two-level-systems in amorphous dielectrics, including a tunneling barrier AlOx, is one of the major problems. We report on a Josephson junction thermal annealing process development to crystallize an amorphous barrier oxide (AlOx). The dependences of the thermal annealing parameters on the room temperature resistance are obtained. The developed method allows not only to increase the Josephson junction resistance by 175%, but also to decrease by 60% with precisions of 10% in Rn. Finally, theoretical assumptions about the structure modification in tunnel barrier are proposed. The suggested thermal annealing approach can be used to form a stable and reproducible tunneling barriers and scalable frequency trimming for a widely used fixed-frequency transmon qubits.</description>

      <title>Parametric multi-element coupling architecture for coherent and dissipative control of superconducting qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As systems for quantum computing keep growing in size and number of qubits, challenges in scaling the control capabilities are becoming increasingly relevant. Efficient schemes to simultaneously mediate coherent interactions between multiple quantum systems and to reduce decoherence errors can minimize the control overhead in next-generation quantum processors. Here, we present a superconducting qubit architecture based on tunable parametric interactions to perform two-qubit gates, reset, leakage recovery and to read out the qubits. In this architecture, parametrically driven multi-element couplers selectively couple qubits to resonators and neighbouring qubits, according to the frequency of the drive. We consider a system with two qubits and one readout resonator interacting via a single coupling circuit and experimentally demonstrate a controlled-Z gate with a fidelity of $98.30\pm 0.23 \%$, a reset operation that unconditionally prepares the qubit ground state with a fidelity of $99.80\pm 0.02 \%$ and a leakage recovery operation with a $98.5\pm 0.3 \%$ success probability. Furthermore, we implement a parametric readout with a single-shot assignment fidelity of $88.0\pm 0.4 \%$. These operations are all realized using a single tunable coupler, demonstrating the experimental feasibility of the proposed architecture and its potential for reducing the system complexity in scalable quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Dynamical observation of non-trivial doublon formation using a quantum computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical formation of doublons or onsite repulsively bound pairs of particles on a lattice is a highly non-trivial phenomenon. In this work we show the signatures of doublon formation in a quantum computing experiment by simulating the continuous time quantum walk in the framework of the one dimensional extended Fermi-Hubbard model. By considering two up-component and one down-component particles initially created at the three neighbouring sites at the middle of the lattice and allowing intra- (inter-) component nearest neighbour (onsite) interactions we show the formation a stable onsite doublon in the quantum walk. The probability of such doublon formation is more (less) if the hopping strength of the down particle is weaker (stronger) compared to the up particle. On the contrary, for an initial doublon along with a free up particle, the stability of the doublon is more prominent than the doublon dissociation in the dynamics irrespective of the hopping asymmetry between the two components. We first numerically obtain the signatures of the stable doublon formation in the dynamics and then observe them using Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices.</description>

      <title>Strategies and trade-offs for controllability and memory time of ultra-high-quality microwave cavities in circuit QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional microwave cavity resonators have been shown to reach lifetimes of the order of a second by maximizing the cavity volume relative to its surface, using better materials, and improving surface treatments. Such cavities represent an ideal platform for quantum computing with bosonic qubits, but their efficient control remains an outstanding problem since the large mode volume results in inefficient coupling to nonlinear elements used for their control. Moreover, this coupling induces additional cavity decay via the inverse Purcell effect which can easily destroy the advantage of {a} long intrinsic lifetime. Here, we discuss conditions on, and protocols for, efficient utilization of these ultra-high-quality microwave cavities as memories for conventional superconducting qubits. We show that, surprisingly, efficient write and read operations with ultra-high-quality cavities does not require similar quality factors for the qubits and other nonlinear elements used to control them. Through a combination of analytical and numerical calculations, we demonstrate that efficient coupling to cavities with second-scale lifetime is possible with state-of-the-art transmon and SNAIL devices and outline a route towards controlling cavities with even higher quality factors. Our work explores a potentially viable roadmap towards using ultra-high-quality microwave cavity resonators for storing and processing information encoded in bosonic qubits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical decoupling (DD) is a low-overhead method for quantum error suppression. We describe how empirical learning schemes can be used to tailor DD strategies to the quantum device and task at hand. We use genetic algorithms to learn DD (GADD) strategies and apply our method to the 27-qubit Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm, 5-qubit Grover's algorithm, and 80-qubit mirror randomized benchmarking circuits. In each scenario, the GADD strategies significantly outperform canonical DD sequences. We demonstrate the generic and scalable nature of our GADD method in that it does not require a priori knowledge of target circuit outcomes and has runtime remaining constant with increasing circuit depth and qubit number. Moreover, the relative improvement of empirically learned DD strategies over canonical DD sequences is shown to increase with increasing problem size and circuit sophistication.</description>

      <title>Cooling trapped ions with phonon rapid adiabatic passage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent demonstrations of the quantum charge-coupled device (QCCD) computer architecture, circuit times are dominated by cooling. Some motional modes of multi-ion crystals take orders-of-magnitude longer to cool than others because of low coolant ion participation. Here we demonstrate a new technique, which we call phonon rapid adiabatic passage (phrap), that avoids this issue by coherently exchanging the thermal populations of selected modes on timescales short compared to direct cooling. Analogous to adiabatic rapid passage, we quasi-statically couple these slow-cooling modes with fast-cooling ones using DC electric fields. When the crystal is then adiabatically ramped through the resultant avoided crossing, nearly-complete phonon population exchange results. We demonstrate this on two-ion crystals, and show the indirect ground-state cooling of all radial modes--achieving an order of magnitude speedup compared to direct cooling. We also show the technique's insensitivity to trap potential and control field fluctuations, and find that it still achieves sub-quanta temperatures starting as high as n~200.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feedback-based control of nano- and micromechanical resonators can enable the study of macroscopic quantum phenomena and also sensitive force measurements. Here, we demonstrate the feedback cooling of a low-loss and high-stress macroscopic SiN membrane resonator close to its quantum ground state. We use the microwave optomechanical platform, where the resonator is coupled to a microwave cavity. The experiment utilizes a Josephson travelling wave parametric amplifier, which is nearly quantum-limited in added noise, and is important to mitigate resonator heating due to system noise in the feedback loop. We reach a thermal phonon number as low as 1.6, which is limited primarily by microwave-induced heating. We also discuss the sideband asymmetry observed when a weak microwave tone for independent readout is applied in addition to other tones used for the cooling. The asymmetry can be qualitatively attributed to the quantum-mechanical imbalance between emission and absorption. However, we find that the observed asymmetry is only partially due to this quantum effect. In specific situations, the asymmetry is fully dominated by a cavity Kerr effect under multitone irradiation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an axion dark matter search with a haloscope equipped with a microwave photon counter. The haloscope is a tunable high quality factor 3-dimensional microwave cavity placed in a magnetic field. The photon counter, operated cyclically, maps an incoming microwave photon onto the state of a superconducting transmon qubit. The measurement protocol continuously monitors the power emitted by the haloscope cavity as well as the dark count background, and enables tuning of the cavity frequency to probe different axion masses. With this apparatus we enhance by a factor 20 the search speed that can be reached with quantum-limited linear amplifiers, and set a new standard for probing the existence of axions with resonant detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Squeezing the quadrature noise of a harmonic oscillator used as a sensor can enhance its sensitivity in certain measurment schemes. The canonical approach, based on parametric modulation of the oscillation frequency, is usually limited to a squeezing of at most 3 dB. However, this can be overcome by additional stabilization of the anti-squeezed quadrature. Here, we apply this approach to highly-stressed silicon nitride membrane resonators, with effective masses of the order few nanograms and quality factors routinely exceeding 108, which hold promise for sensing applications in both the classical and quantum regimes. We benchmark their performance using either piezo or capacitive parametric modulation. We observe maximum thermomechanical squeezing by record-high 17 dB and 21 dB, respectively, and we argue that even larger values can be attained with minimal changes to the device design. Finally, we provide a full quantum theory of a combination of this approach with quantum-limited motion measurement and conclude that quantum squeezing is attainable at moderate cryogenic temperatures.</description>

      <title>Virtual Reality for Understanding Artificial-Intelligence-driven Scientific Discovery with an Application in Quantum Optics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models can propose solutions to scientific problems beyond human capability. To truly make conceptual contributions, researchers need to be capable of understanding the AI-generated structures and extracting the underlying concepts and ideas. When algorithms provide little explanatory reasoning alongside the output, scientists have to reverse-engineer the fundamental insights behind proposals based solely on examples. This task can be challenging as the output is often highly complex and thus not immediately accessible to humans. In this work we show how transferring part of the analysis process into an immersive Virtual Reality (VR) environment can assist researchers in developing an understanding of AI-generated solutions. We demonstrate the usefulness of VR in finding interpretable configurations of abstract graphs, representing Quantum Optics experiments. Thereby, we can manually discover new generalizations of AI-discoveries as well as new understanding in experimental quantum optics. Furthermore, it allows us to customize the search space in an informed way - as a human-in-the-loop - to achieve significantly faster subsequent discovery iterations. As concrete examples, with this technology, we discover a new resource-efficient 3-dimensional entanglement swapping scheme, as well as a 3-dimensional 4-particle Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-state analyzer. Our results show the potential of VR for increasing a human researcher's ability to derive knowledge from graph-based generative AI that, which is a common abstract data representation used in diverse fields of science.</description>

Abstract: Cavity electrodynamics is emerging as a promising tool to control chemical processes and quantum material properties. In this work we develop a formalism to describe the cavity mediated energy exchange between a material and its electromagnetic environment. We show that coplanar cavities can significantly affect the heat load on the sample if the cavity resonance lies within the frequency region where free-space radiative heat dominates, typically the mid-IR at ambient temperature, while spectral filtering is necessary for having an effect with lower frequency cavities.</description>

      <title>Two-colour photon correlations probe coherent vibronic contributions to electronic excitation transport under incoherent illumination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying signatures of quantum coherent behaviour in photoactive systems that are maintained in stationary states away from thermal equilibrium is an open problem of wide interest in a variety of physical scenarios, including single photosynthetic complexes subjected to continuous incoherent illumination. Here we consider a prototype light-harvesting heterodimer exhibiting coherent and collective exciton-vibration interactions and show that the second-order frequency-filtered correlations of fluorescence photons provide insightful information on the influence of such coherent interactions for different transitions, thereby yielding fundamentally different photon-counting statistics. Furthermore, we show that coherent vibronic mechanisms strongly affect the asymmetries characteristic of time-resolved photon cross-correlations and manifest themselves in a time-dependent violation of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality bounding cross-correlations for classically fluctuating fields. We finally discuss how such second-order correlation asymmetry establishes important connections between coherent vibronic interactions, directional exciton population transport, and violation of quantum detailed balance. Our work then indicates that measurement of two-colour photon correlation asymmetry can be an important avenue to investigate quantum behaviour of single photoactive biomolecular and chemical systems under incoherent illumination conditions.</description>

Abstract: As we enter the post-Moore era, we experience the rise of various non-von-Neumann-architectures to address the increasing computational demand for modern applications, with quantum computing being among the most prominent and promising technologies. However, this development creates a gap in current computer science curricula since most quantum computing lectures are strongly physics-oriented and have little intersection with the remaining curriculum of computer science. This fact makes designing an appealing course very difficult, in particular for non-physicists. Furthermore, in the academic community, there is consensus that quantum computers are going to be used only for specific computational tasks (e.g., in computational science), where hybrid systems - combined classical and quantum computers - facilitate the execution of an application on both quantum and classical computing resources. A hybrid system thus executes only certain suitable parts of an application on the quantum machine, while other parts are executed on the classical components of the system. To fully exploit the capabilities of hybrid systems and to meet future requirements in this emerging field, we need to prepare a new generation of computer scientists with skills in both distributed computing and quantum computing. To bridge this existing gap in standard computer science curricula, we designed a new lecture and exercise series on Hybrid Quantum-Classical Systems, where students learn how to decompose applications and implement computational tasks on a hybrid quantum-classical computational continuum. While learning the inherent concepts underlying quantum systems, students are obligated to apply techniques and methods they are already familiar with, making the entrance to the field of quantum computing comprehensive yet appealing and accessible to students of computer science.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Signalling: Connections between Causal Inference and Space-time Geometry</title>

Abstract: Causality is pivotal to our understanding of the world, presenting itself in different forms: information-theoretic and relativistic, the former linked to the flow of information, the latter to the structure of space-time. Leveraging a framework introduced in PRA, 106, 032204 (2022), which formally connects these two notions in general physical theories, we study their interplay. Here, information-theoretic causality is defined through a causal modelling approach. First, we improve the characterization of information-theoretic signalling as defined through so-called affects relations. Specifically, we provide conditions for identifying redundancies in different parts of such a relation, introducing techniques for causal inference in unfaithful causal models (where the observable data does not "faithfully" reflect the causal dependences). In particular, this demonstrates the possibility of causal inference using the absence of signalling between certain nodes. Second, we define an order-theoretic property called conicality, showing that it is satisfied for light cones in Minkowski space-times with $d&gt;1$ spatial dimensions but violated for $d=1$. Finally, we study the embedding of information-theoretic causal models in space-time without violating relativistic principles such as no superluminal signalling (NSS). In general, we observe that constraints imposed by NSS in a space-time and those imposed by purely information-theoretic causal inference behave differently. We then prove a correspondence between conical space-times and faithful causal models: in both cases, there emerges a parallel between these two types of constraints. This indicates a connection between informational and geometric notions of causality, and offers new insights for studying the relations between the principles of NSS and no causal loops in different space-time geometries and theories of information processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physical reservoir computing (RC) is a machine learning algorithm that employs the dynamics of a physical system to forecast highly nonlinear and chaotic phenomena. In this paper, we introduce a quantum RC system that employs the dynamics of a probed atom in a cavity. The atom experiences coherent driving at a particular rate, leading to a measurement-controlled quantum evolution. The proposed quantum reservoir can make fast and reliable forecasts using a small number of artificial neurons compared with the traditional RC algorithm. We theoretically validate the operation of the reservoir, demonstrating its potential to be used in error-tolerant applications, where approximate computing approaches may be used to make feasible forecasts in conditions of limited computational and energy resources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers promise a qualitative speedup in solving a broad spectrum of real-life optimization problems. The latter can be mapped onto the task of finding low-energy states of spin glasses, which is known to be exceedingly difficult. Using D-Wave's 5000-qubit quantum processor, we demonstrate that a recently proposed iterative cyclic quantum annealing algorithm[1] can find deep low-energy states in record time. We also find intricate structures in a low-energy landscape of spin glasses, such as a power-law distribution of connected clusters with a small surface energy. These observations offer guidance for further improvement of the optimization algorithms.</description>

      <title>Quantum theory of orbital angular momentum in spatiotemporal optical vortices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal Optical Vortices (STOVs) are structured electromagnetic fields propagating in free space with phase singularities in the space-time domain. Depending on the tilt of the helical phase front, STOVs can carry both longitudinal and transverse orbital angular momentum (OAM). Although STOVs have gained significant interest in the recent years, the current understanding is limited to the semi-classical picture. Here, we develop a quantum theory for STOVs with an arbitrary tilt, extending beyond the paraxial limit. We demonstrate that quantum STOV states, such as Fock and coherent twisted photon pulses, display non-vanishing longitudinal OAM fluctuations that are absent in conventional monochromatic twisted pulses. We show that these quantum fluctuations exhibit a unique texture, i.e. a spatial distribution which can be used to experimentally isolate these quantum effects. Our findings represent a step towards the exploitation of quantum effects of structured light for various applications such as OAM-based encoding protocols and platforms to explore novel light-matter interaction in 2D material systems.</description>

Abstract: An influential theorem by Satosi Wantabe convinced many that there can be no genuinely probabilistic theory with both non-trivial forward and backward transition probabilities. We show that this conclusion does not follow from the theorem. We point out the flaw in the argument, and we showcase examples of theories with well-defined backward and forward transition probabilities.</description>

      <title>Diffusive Decay of Collective Quantum Excitations in Electron Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work the multistream quasiparticle model of collective electron excitations is used to study the energy-density distribution of collective quantum excitations in an interacting electron gas with arbitrary degree of degeneracy. Generalized relations for the probability current and energy density distributions is obtained which reveals a new interesting quantum phenomenon of diffusive decay of pure quasiparticle states at microscopic level. The effects is studied for various cases of free quasiparticles, quasiparticle in an infinite square-well potential and half-space collective excitations. It is shown that plasmon excitations have the intrinsic tendency to decay into equilibrium state with uniform energy density spacial distribution. It is found that plasmon levels of quasipaticle in a square-well potential are unstable decaying into equilibrium state due to the fundamental property of collective excitations. The decay rates of pure plasmon states are determined analytically. Moreover, for damped quasiparticle excitations the non-vanishing probability current divergence leads to imaginary energy density resulting in damping instability of energy density dynamic. The pronounced energy density valley close to half-space boundary at low level excitations predicts attractive force close to the surface. Current research can have implications with applications in plasmonics and related fields. Current analysis can be readily generalized to include external potential and magnetic field effects.</description>

      <title>Relativistic and nonrelativistic Landau levels for Dirac fermions in the cosmic string spacetime in the context of rainbow gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the relativistic and nonrelativistic Landau levels for Dirac fermions in the cosmic string spacetime in the context of rainbow gravity in $(3+1)$-dimensions, where we work with the curved Dirac equation with minimal coupling in cylindrical coordinates. Using the tetrads formalism of General Relativity, we obtain a second-order differential equation. Solving this differential equation, we obtain a generalized Laguerre equation as well as the relativistic Landau levels for the fermion and antifermion, where such energy levels are quantized in terms of the quantum numbers $n$, $m_j$ and $m_s$, and explicitly depends on the rainbow functions $f(\varepsilon)$ and $g(\varepsilon)$, charge parameter $\sigma$, cyclotron frequency $\omega_c$, curvature parameter $\alpha$, and on the square rest energy $m^2_0$ and square $z$-momentum $k^2_z$, respectively. Posteriorly, we study the nonrelativistic limit of the system, where we obtain the nonrelativistic Landau levels. In both cases (relativistic and nonrelativistic), we graphically analyze the behavior of Landau levels for the three rainbow gravity scenarios as a function of the magnetic field $B$ and of the curvature parameter $\alpha$. In addition, we also compared our problem with other works, where we verified that our results generalize several particular cases in the literature.</description>

      <title>Semi-vortex solitons and their excited states in spin-orbit-coupled binary bosonic condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that two-dimensional two-component fundamental solitons of the semi-vortex (SV) type, with vorticities $(s_{+},s_{-})=(0,1)$ in their components, are stable ground states (GSs) in the spin-orbit-coupled (SOC) binary Bose-Einstein condensate with the contact self-attraction acting in both components, in spite of the possibility of the critical collapse in the system. However, excited states(ESs) of the SV solitons, with the vorticity set $(s_{+},s_{-})=( S_{+},S_{+}+1)$ and $S_{+}=1,2,3,...$, are unstable in the same system. We construct ESs of SV solitons in the SOC system with opposite signs of the self-interaction in the two components. The main finding is stability of the ES-SV solitons, with the extra vorticity (at least) up to $S_{+}=6$. The threshold value of the norm for the onset of the critical collapse, $N_{\mathrm{thr}}$, in these excited states is higher than the commonly known critical value, $N_{c}\approx 5.85$,associated with the single-component Townes solitons, $N_{\mathrm{thr}}$ increasing with the growth of $S_{+}$. A velocity interval for stable motion of the GS-SV solitons is found too. The results suggest a solution for the challenging problem of the creation of stable vortex solitons with high topological charges.</description>

      <title>Detecting and leaking a Majorana bound state through proximity to a Kitaev ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the existence of a Majorana bound state at one end of a Kitaev chain is unambiguously signaled by observable quantities in a nearby Kitaev ring. When the Kitaev chain is in the topological phase, the band structure of the Kitaev ring breaks chiral symmetry and the ring-Majoranas' spectral functions are even functions of momentum and energy, the latter wielding time-reversal and particle-hole symmetric occupation numbers and, hence, zero current in the ring. Driving a phase transition in the Kitaev chain (e.g., using a backgate to vary the chemical potential of the chain through its critical value), the replacement of the Majorana bound state by a trivial fermion is manifest by chiral symmetry reappearing in the band structure of the ring and by the ring-Majoranas' spectral functions loss of parity, wielding time-reversal and particle-hole symmetry breaking in the occupation numbers and a spontaneous current in the ring. Energy resonance and maximum spectral weight exactly at the resonance energy concur for a high leakage probability between ring-Majoranas' states and the Majorana bound state, whereas the lack of energy resonance makes unlikely any leakage between ring-Majoranas' states and the trivial fermion states. The proposed setup also invites further investigations in the context of braiding and/or fusion of Majorana states, both as detection mechanisms and for quantum computing purposes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Describing open quantum systems in terms of effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonians gives rise to non-unitary time evolution. In this paper, we study the impact of non-unitary dynamics on the emergent hydrodynamics in quantum systems with a global conservation law. To this end, we demonstrate how linear-response correlation functions can be generalized and interpreted in the case of non-Hermitian systems. Moreover, we show that dynamical quantum typicality provides an efficient numerical approach to evaluate such correlation functions, even though the non-unitary dynamics leads to subtleties that are absent in the Hermitian case. As a point of reference for our analysis, we consider the Hermitian spin-$1/2$ XXZ chain, whose high-temperature transport properties have been characterized extensively in recent years. Here, we explore the resulting hydrodynamics for different non-Hermitian perturbations of the XXZ chain. We also discuss the role of integrability by studying the complex energy-level statistics of the non-Hermitian quantum models.</description>

      <title>A Simple and Accurate Method for Computing Optimized Effective Potentials for Exact Exchange Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inverse Kohn-Sham density-functional theory (inv-KS) for the electron density of the Hartree-Fock (HF) wave function was revisited within the context of the optimized effective potential (HF- OEP). First, it is proved that the exchange potential created by the inv-KS is equivalent to the potential obtained by the HF-OEP when the HF-OEP realizes the HF energy of the system under consideration. Next the real-space grid (RSG) implementations of the inv-KS and the HF-OEP are addressed. The total HF energies EHF for the wave functions on the effective potentials optimized by the inv-KS are computed for a set of small molecules. It is found that the mean absolute deviation (MAD) of EHF from the HF energy is clearly smaller than the MAD of EHF, demonstrating that the inv-KS is advantageous in constructing the detailed structure of the exchange potential vx as compared with the HF-OEP. The inv-KS method is also applied to an ortho-benzyne radical known as a strongly correlated polyatomic molecule. It is revealed that the spin populations on the atomic sites computed by the UHF calculation can be faithfully reproduced by the wave functions on the inv-KS potential.</description>

      <title>Online Locality Meets Distributed Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the theory of locally checkable labeling problems (LCLs) from the classical LOCAL model to a number of other models that have been studied recently, including the quantum-LOCAL model, finitely-dependent processes, non-signaling model, dynamic-LOCAL model, and online-LOCAL model [e.g. STOC 2024, ICALP 2023].
  First, we demonstrate the advantage that finitely-dependent processes have over the classical LOCAL model. We show that all LCL problems solvable with locality $O(\log^* n)$ in the LOCAL model admit a finitely-dependent distribution (with constant locality). In particular, this gives a finitely-dependent coloring for regular trees, answering an open question by Holroyd [2023]. This also introduces a new formal barrier for understanding the distributed quantum advantage: it is not possible to exclude quantum advantage for any LCL in the $\Theta(\log^* n)$ complexity class by using non-signaling arguments.
  Second, we put limits on the capabilities of all of these models. To this end, we introduce a model called randomized online-LOCAL, which is strong enough to simulate e.g. SLOCAL and dynamic-LOCAL, and we show that it is also strong enough to simulate any non-signaling distribution and hence any quantum-LOCAL algorithm. We prove the following result for trees: if we can solve an LCL problem with locality $o(\log^{(5)} n)$ in the randomized online-LOCAL model, we can solve it with locality $O(\log^* n)$ in the classical deterministic LOCAL model.
  Put together, these results show that in trees the set of LCLs that can be solved with locality $O(\log^* n)$ is the same across all these models: locality $O(\log^* n)$ in quantum-LOCAL, non-signaling model, dynamic-LOCAL, or online-LOCAL is not stronger than locality $O(\log^* n)$ in the classical deterministic LOCAL model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the dependence of the critical properties of the Anderson model on the dimension $d$ in the language of $\beta$-function and renormalization group recently introduced in Ref.[arXiv:2306.14965] in the context of Anderson transition on random regular graphs. We show how in the delocalized region, including the transition point, the one-parameter scaling part of the $\beta$-function for the fractal dimension $D_{1}$ evolves smoothly from its $d=2$ form, in which $\beta_2\leq 0$, to its $\beta_\infty\geq 0$ form, which is represented by the regular random graph (RRG) result. We show how the $\epsilon=d-2$ expansion and the $1/d$ expansion around the RRG result can be reconciled and how the initial part of a renormalization group trajectory governed by the irrelevant exponent $y$ depends on dimensionality. We also show how the irrelevant exponent emerges out of the high-gradient terms of expansion in the nonlinear sigma-model and put forward a conjecture about a lower bound for the fractal dimension. The framework introduced here may serve as a basis for investigations of disordered many-body systems and of more general non-equilibrium quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological particle creation is the phenomenon by which the expansion of spacetime results in the production of particles of a given quantum field in that spacetime. In this paper, we study this phenomenon by considering a multi-level quantum particle detector in de Sitter spacetime coupled to a massless real quantum scalar field. Rather than considering a fixed classical trajectory for the detector, following recent novel approaches we consider a quantum superposition of trajectories, in particular of static trajectories which keep a fixed distance from one another. The main novel result is that, due to the quantum nature of the superposition of trajectories, the state of the detector after interaction with the field is not only a mixture of the thermal states that would be expected from each individual static trajectory but rather exhibits additional coherences due to interferences between the different trajectories. We study these in detail and associate them with the properties of the particle absorbed by the detector from the thermal bath.</description>

Abstract: The recent development of quantum computing, which makes use of entanglement, superposition, and other quantum fundamental concepts, has the ability to provide substantial processing advantages over traditional computing. These quantum features help solve many hard problems that cannot be solved with traditional computing methods. These problems are in areas like modeling quantum mechanics, logistics, making chemical-based advances, designing drugs, statistical science, sustainable energy, banking, reliable communication, and quantum chemical engineering. The last few years have witnessed remarkable advancements in quantum software and algorithm creation as well as quantum hardware research, which have significantly advanced the prospect of the realization of quantum computers. It would be helpful to have comprehensive literature research on this area to grasp the current status and find outstanding problems that require considerable attention from the research community working in the quantum computing industry. To better understand quantum computing, this paper examines the foundations and vision based on current research in this area. We discuss cutting-edge developments in quantum computer hardware advancement, and subsequent advances in quantum cryptography, quantum software, and high-scalability quantum computers.

      <title>Influence of catastrophes and hidden dynamical symmetries on ultrafast backscattered photoelectrons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the effect of using potentials with a Coulomb tail and different degrees of softening in the photoelectron momentum distributions (PMDs) using the recently implemented hybrid forward-boundary CQSFA (H-CQSFA). We show that introducing a softening in the Coulomb interaction influences the ridges observed in the PMDs associated with backscattered electron trajectories. In the limit of a hard-core Coulomb interaction, the re-scattering ridges close along the polarization axis, while for a soft-core potential, they are interrupted at ridge-specific angles. We analyze the momentum mapping of the different orbits leading to the ridges. For the hard-core potential, there exist two types of saddle-point solutions that coalesce at the ridge. By increasing the softening, we show that two additional solutions emerge as the result of breaking a hidden dynamical symmetry associated exclusively with the Coulomb potential. Further signatures of this symmetry breaking are encountered in subsets of momentum-space trajectories. Finally, we use scattering theory to show how the softening affects the maximal scattering angle and provide estimates that agree with our observations from the CQSFA. This implies that, in the presence of residual binding potentials in the electron's continuum propagation, the distinction between purely kinematic and dynamic caustics becomes blurred.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) has become an essential technology in the realm of secure communication, with applications ranging from secure data transmission to quantum networks. This paper presents a simple, compact, and cost-effective setup for undergraduate tutorial demonstrations of QKD. It relies on using weak coherent pulses, which can be readily produced using an attenuated laser. The system employs the simplified three-state BB84 protocol in free space, the states are encoded using linear polarization. Polarization encoding can be done passively or actively, depending on the budget available. Time multiplexing is implemented at the receiver to reduce the number of required detectors. Only two detectors are used to implement measurements on two bases, with a total of four outcomes. The result demonstrates the practicality of the system for free-space quantum communication, and its compact and portable nature makes it particularly suitable for pedagogical demonstrations. This work paves the way for engaging undergraduate students in the field of quantum communication through hands-on laboratory projects.</description>

Abstract: By developing a new framework of likelihood POVMs, analysis techniques and a new proof of the quantum covering lemma, we address the simulation of separable quantum measurement over bipartite states. In addition to a new one shot inner bound that naturally generalizes to the asymptotic case, we demonstrate the power, generality and universality of the developed techniques in the most general distributed measurement scenario by recovering all current known inner bounds. In addition to the above results, this framework is appealing in being the most natural and simple POVM simulation protocol.</description>

Abstract: In the processing of quantum computation, analyzing and learning the pattern of the quantum data are essential for many tasks. Quantum machine learning algorithms can not only deal with the quantum states generated in the preceding quantum procedures, but also the quantum registers encoding classical problems. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate the anomaly detection of quantum states encoding audio samples with a three-qubit quantum processor consisting of solid-state spins in diamond. By training the quantum machine with a few normal samples, the quantum machine can detect the anomaly samples with a minimum error rate of 15.4%. These results show the power of quantum anomaly detection in dealing with machine learning tasks and the potential to detect abnormal output of quantum devices.</description>

Abstract: Studies have shown that the Hilbert spaces of non-Hermitian systems require nontrivial metrics. Here, we demonstrate how evolution dimensions, in addition to time, can emerge naturally from a geometric formalism. Specifically, in this formalism, Hamiltonians can be interpreted as a Christoffel symbol-like operators, and the Schroedinger equation as a parallel transport in this formalism. We then derive the evolution equations for the states and metrics along the emergent dimensions and find that the curvature of the Hilbert space bundle for any given closed system is locally flat. Finally, we show that the fidelity susceptibilities and the Berry curvatures of states are related to these emergent parallel transports.</description>

      <title>Double-bracket quantum algorithms for diagonalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.11772v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work proposes double-bracket iterations as a framework for obtaining diagonalizing quantum circuits. Their implementation on a quantum computer consists of interlacing evolutions generated by the input Hamiltonian with diagonal evolutions which can be chosen variationally. No qubit overheads or controlled-unitary operations are needed but the method is recursive which makes the circuit depth grow exponentially with the number of recursion steps. To make near-term implementations viable, the proposal includes optimization of diagonal evolution generators and of recursion step durations. Indeed, thanks to this numerical examples show that the expressive power of double-bracket iterations suffices to approximate eigenstates of relevant quantum models with few recursion steps. Compared to brute-force optimization of unstructured circuits double-bracket iterations do not suffer from the same trainability limitations. Moreover, with an implementation cost lower than required for quantum phase estimation they are more suitable for near-term quantum computing experiments. More broadly, this work opens a pathway for constructing purposeful quantum algorithms based on so-called double-bracket flows also for tasks different from diagonalization and thus enlarges the quantum computing toolkit geared towards practical physics problems.</description>

      <title>Saturating the one-axis twisting quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound with a total spin readout</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.11462v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the lowest quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound achievable in interferometry with a one-axis twisted spin coherent state is saturated by the asymptotic method of moments error of a protocol that uses one call to the one-axis twisting, one call to time-reversed one-axis twisting, and a final total spin measurement (i.e., a twist-untwist protocol). The result is derived by first showing that the metrological phase diagram for one-axis twisting is asymptotically characterized by a single quantum Fisher information value $N(N+1)/2$ for all times, then constructing a twist-untwist protocol having a method of moments error that saturates this value. The case of finite-range one-axis twisting is similarly analyzed, and a simple functional form for the metrological phase diagram is found in both the short-range and long-range interaction regimes. Numerical evidence suggests that the finite-range analogues of twist-untwist protocols can exhibit a method of moments error that asymptotically saturates the lowest quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound achievable in interferometry with finite-range one-axis twisted spin coherent states for all interaction times.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.16097v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Subspace diagonalisation methods have appeared recently as promising means to access the ground state and some excited states of molecular Hamiltonians by classically diagonalising small matrices, whose elements can be efficiently obtained by a quantum computer. The recently proposed Variational Quantum Phase Estimation (VQPE) algorithm uses a basis of real time-evolved states, for which the energy eigenvalues can be obtained directly from the unitary matrix U = exp(-iHt), which can be computed with cost linear in the number of states used. In this paper, we report a circuit-based implementation of VQPE for arbitrary molecular systems and assess its performance and costs for the H2, H3+ and H6 molecules. We also propose using Variational Fast Forwarding (VFF) to decrease to quantum depth of time-evolution circuits for use in VQPE. We show that the approximation provides a good basis for Hamiltonian diagonalisation even when its fidelity to the true time evolved states is low. In the high fidelity case, we show that the approximate unitary U can be diagonalised instead, preserving the linear cost of exact VQPE.</description>

      <title>Predicting Properties of Quantum Systems with Conditional Generative Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.16943v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning has emerged recently as a powerful tool for predicting properties of quantum many-body systems. For many ground states of gapped Hamiltonians, generative models can learn from measurements of a single quantum state to reconstruct the state accurately enough to predict local observables. Alternatively, classification and regression models can predict local observables by learning from measurements on different but related states. In this work, we combine the benefits of both approaches and propose the use of conditional generative models to simultaneously represent a family of states, learning shared structures of different quantum states from measurements. The trained model enables us to predict arbitrary local properties of ground states, even for states not included in the training data, without necessitating further training for new observables. We first numerically validate our approach on 2D random Heisenberg models using simulations of up to 45 qubits. Furthermore, we conduct quantum simulations on a neutral-atom quantum computer and demonstrate that our method can accurately predict the quantum phases of square lattices of 13$\times$13 Rydberg atoms.</description>

      <title>Tunable disorder in accessories can enhance precision of atomic clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.08523v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find that a quantum device having an accessory involving precision measurement can have an enhancement of its metrological precision in estimating an unknown parameter of the quantum system by insertion of glassy disorder, accidental or engineered. We clearly mention how an unbiased estimator can also be identified in a disordered situation, and how the precision thereof can be bounded by the quantum Cramer-Rao inequality. We compare the Fisher information-based lower bound of the minimum standard deviation of an unbiased estimator, in presence of glassy disorder in the system, with the same of an ideal, viz. disorder-free, situation. The phenomenon can boost the efficiency of certain measuring devices, such as atomic clocks. The precision of these clocks, when measuring time, hinges on the precise determination of the frequency of a two-level atom. In cases where impurities are present in the atom, and can be modeled as a disorder parameter, it is possible for the measurement of frequency to be more accurate than in an ideal, disorder-free scenario. Moreover, disorder insertion can reduce the requirement of entanglement content of the initial probes, which are copies of two-qubit states, along with providing a disorder-induced enhancement.</description>

Abstract: We address the creation of squeezed states of a mechanical resonator in a hybrid quantum system consisting of two quantum wells placed inside a cavity with a moving end mirror pumped by bichromatic laser fields. The exciton mode and mechanical resonator interact indirectly via microcavity fields. Under the conditions of the generated coupling, we predict squeezing of the mechanical-mode beyond the resolved side-band regime with available experimental parameters. Finally, we show that the squeezing of the mechanical mode is robust against the phonon thermal bath temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.16893v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The parameters of the quantum circuit in a variational quantum algorithm induce a landscape that contains the relevant information regarding its optimization hardness. In this work we investigate such landscapes through the lens of information content, a measure of the variability between points in parameter space. Our major contribution connects the information content to the average norm of the gradient, for which we provide robust analytical bounds on its estimators. This result holds for any (classical or quantum) variational landscape. We validate the analytical understating by numerically studying the scaling of the gradient in an instance of the barren plateau problem. In such instance we are able to estimate the scaling pre-factors in the gradient. Our work provides a new way to analyze variational quantum algorithms in a data-driven fashion well-suited for near-term quantum computers.</description>

Abstract: We study the properties of bound states in waveguide-QED systems consisting of multiple giant atoms coupled to a coupled-resonator waveguide. Based on the general analytical expressions for these states and the corresponding energy spectra, we analyze in detail the threshold conditions for the appearance of bound states and the photon-mediated interactions between dressed atoms for different configurations. In addition, when multiple giant atoms are coupled to the waveguide, different types of interacting atomic chain can be obtained by manipulating the coupling config- urations. Accordingly, the energy spectra of the bound states form metaband structures in the photonic band gaps. This makes the system a useful platform for quantum simulation and quantum information processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.09149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Zou-Wang-Mandel (ZWM) effect is a remarkable consequence of photon indistinguishability and continuous-variable entanglement in which an optical phase shift is imprinted on photonic modes associated with optical paths that that do not pass through the phase shift source. By bringing the canonical formalism of continuous-variable Gaussian states to bear on the mode-structure of the ZWM experiment, we show that the physical consequence of implementing optical path identity is a renormalization of quadrature squeezing which governs the entanglement of four effective optical modes. Nonperturbative expressions for the ZWM interference patterns and normalized first-order coherence function are derived. Generalizations to $\mathcal{H}$-graph states with more than four modes directly follow from the general method used to analyze the minimal example. We show that a ZWM interferometer with a laser-seeded signal mode, which estimates an idler phase shift by detecting photons that did not propagate through the phase shift, exhibits an optimal sensitivity comparable to that of a laser-seeded $SU(1,1)$ interferometer if path identity is implemented with high fidelity.</description>

Abstract: We present a variational quantum algorithm for differentiating several hypotheses encoded as quantum channels. Both state preparation and measurement are simultaneously optimized using success probability of single-shot discrimination as an objective function which can be calculated using localized measurements. Under constrained signal mode photon number quantum illumination we match the performance of known optimal 2-mode probes by simulating a bosonic circuit. Our results show that variational algorithms can prepare optimal states for binary hypothesis testing with resource constraints. Going beyond the binary hypothesis testing scenario, we also demonstrate that our variational algorithm can learn and discriminate between multiple hypotheses.</description>

      <title>Wigner and friends, a map is not the territory! Contextuality in multi-agent paradoxes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.07792v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-agent scenarios, like Wigner's friend and Frauchiger-Renner scenarios, can show contradictory results when a non-classical formalism must deal with the knowledge between agents. Such paradoxes are described with multi-modal logic as violations of the structure in classical logic. Even if knowledge is treated in a relational way with the concept of trust, contradictory results can still be found in multi-agent scenarios. Contextuality deals with global inconsistencies in empirical models defined on measurement scenarios even when there is local consistency. In the present work, we take a step further to treat the scenarios in full relational language by using knowledge operators, thus showing that trust is equivalent to the Truth Axiom in these cases. A translation of measurement scenarios into multi-agent scenarios by using the topological semantics of multi-modal logic is constructed, demonstrating that logical contextuality can be understood as the violation of soundness by supposing mutual knowledge. To address the contradictions, assuming distributed knowledge is considered, which eliminates such violations but at the cost of lambda dependence. Finally, by translating the main examples of multi-agent scenarios to their empirical model representation, contextuality is identified as the cause of their contradictory results.</description>

Abstract: Quantum steering has attracted increasing research attention because of its fundamental importance, as well as its applications in quantum information science. Here we leverage the power of the deep learning model to infer the steerability of quantum states with specific numbers of measurement settings, which form a hierarchical structure. A computational protocol consisting of iterative tests is constructed to overcome the optimization, meanwhile, generating the necessary training data. According to the responses of the well-trained models to the different physics-driven features encoding the states to be recognized, we can numerically conclude that the most compact characterization of the Alice-to-Bob steerability is Alice's regularly aligned steering ellipsoid; whereas Bob's ellipsoid is irrelevant. We have also provided an explanation to this result with the one-way stochastic local operations and classical communication. Additionally, our approach is versatile in revealing further insights into the hierarchical structure of quantum steering and detecting the hidden steerability.</description>

      <title>Fighting noise with noise: a stochastic projective quantum eigensolver</title>

Abstract: In the current noisy intermediate scale quantum era of quantum computation, available hardware is severely limited by both qubit count and noise levels, precluding the application of many current hybrid quantum-classical algorithms to non-trivial quantum chemistry problems. In this paper we propose applying some of the fundamental ideas of conventional Quantum Monte Carlo algorithms -- stochastic sampling of both the wavefunction and the Hamiltonian -- to quantum algorithms in order to significantly decrease quantum resource costs. In the context of an imaginary-time propagation based projective quantum eigensolver, we present a novel approach to estimating physical observables which leads to a two order of magnitude reduction in the required sampling of the quantum state to converge the ground state energy of a system relative to current state-of-the-art eigensolvers. The method can be equally applied to excited-state calculations and, combined with stochastic approximations of the system Hamiltonian, provides a promising near-term approach to Hamiltonian simulation for general chemistry on quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Quantum Lego Expansion Pack: Enumerators from Tensor Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide the first tensor network method for computing quantum weight enumerator polynomials in the most general form. If a quantum code has a known tensor network construction of its encoding map, our method is far more efficient, and in some cases exponentially faster than the existing approach. As a corollary, it produces decoders and an algorithm that computes the code distance. For non-(Pauli)-stabilizer codes, this constitutes the current best algorithm for computing the code distance. For degenerate stabilizer codes, it can be substantially faster compared to the current methods. We also introduce novel weight enumerators and their applications. In particular, we show that these enumerators can be used to compute logical error rates exactly and thus construct (optimal) decoders for any i.i.d. single qubit or qudit error channels. The enumerators also provide a more efficient method for computing non-stabilizerness in quantum many-body states. As the power for these speedups rely on a Quantum Lego decomposition of quantum codes, we further provide systematic methods for decomposing quantum codes and graph states into a modular construction for which our technique applies. As a proof of principle, we perform exact analyses of the deformed surface codes, the holographic pentagon code, and the 2d Bacon-Shor code under (biased) Pauli noise and limited instances of coherent error at sizes that are inaccessible by brute force.</description>

      <title>High-frequency suppression of inductive coupling between flux qubit and transmission line resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07849v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform theoretical calculations to investigate the naturally occurring high-frequency cutoff in a circuit comprising a flux qubit coupled inductively to a transmission line resonator (TLR). Specifically, a decoupling occurs between the qubit and the high-frequency modes. The coupling strength between the qubit and resonator modes increases with mode frequency $\omega$ as $\sqrt{\omega}$ at low frequencies and decreases as $1/\sqrt{\omega}$ at high frequencies. This result is similar to those of past studies that considered somewhat similar circuit designs. By avoiding the approximation of ignoring the qubit-TLR coupling in certain steps in the analysis, we obtain effects not captured in previous studies. In particular, we obtain a resonance effect that shifts the TLR mode frequencies close to qubit oscillation frequencies. We derive expressions for the TLR mode frequencies, qubit-TLR coupling strengths and qubit Lamb shift. We identify features in the spectrum of the system that can be used in future experiments to test and validate the theoretical model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use a floating tunable coupler to mediate interactions between qubits on separate chips to build a modular architecture. We demonstrate three different designs of multi-chip tunable couplers using vacuum gap capacitors or superconducting indium bump bonds to connect the coupler to a microwave line on a common substrate and then connect to the qubit on the next chip. We show that the zero-coupling condition between qubits on separate chips can be achieved in each design and that the relaxation rates for the coupler and qubits are not noticeably affected by the extra circuit elements. Finally, we demonstrate two-qubit gate operations with fidelity at the same level as qubits with a tunable coupler on a single chip. Using one or more indium bonds does not degrade qubit coherence or impact the performance of two-qubit gates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mixed density operator for coarsegrained eigenlevels of a static Hamiltonian is represented in phase space by the spectral Wigner function, which has its peak on the corresponding classical energy shell. The action of trajectory segments along the shell determine the phase of the Wigner oscillations in its interior. The classical transitions between any pair of energy shells, driven by a general external time dependent Hamiltonian, also have a smooth probability density. It is shown here that a further contribution to the transition between the corresponding pair of coarsegrained energy levels, which oscillates with either energy, or the driving time, is determined by four trajectory segments (two in the pair of energy shells and two generated by the driving Hamiltonian) that join exactly to form a closed compound orbit. In its turn, this sequence of segments belongs to the semiclassical expression of a compound unitary operator that combines four quantum evolutions: a pair generated by the static internal Hamiltonian and a pair generated by the driving Hamiltonian. The closed compound orbits are shown to belong to continuous families, which are initially seeded at points where the classical flow generated by both Hamiltonians commute.</description>

      <title>A Post-Training Approach for Mitigating Overfitting in Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN), an early application for quantum computers in the NISQ era, has been consistently proven successful as a machine learning (ML) algorithm for several tasks with significant accuracy. Derived from its classical counterpart, QCNN is prone to overfitting. Overfitting is a typical shortcoming of ML models that are trained too closely to the availed training dataset and perform relatively poorly on unseen datasets for a similar problem. In this work we study post-training approaches for mitigating overfitting in QCNNs. We find that a straightforward adaptation of a classical post-training method, known as neuron dropout, to the quantum setting leads to a significant and undesirable consequence: a substantial decrease in success probability of the QCNN. We argue that this effect exposes the crucial role of entanglement in QCNNs and the vulnerability of QCNNs to entanglement loss. Hence, we propose a parameter adaptation method as an alternative method. Our method is computationally efficient and is found to successfully handle overfitting in the test cases.</description>

Abstract: Quantum backflow is a counterintuitive effect in which the probability density of a free particle moves in the direction opposite to the particle's momentum. If the particle is electrically charged, then the effect can be viewed as the contrast between the direction of electric current and that of the momentum. To date, there has been no direct experimental observation of quantum backflow. However, the effect has been simulated numerically (using classical computers) and optically (using classical light). In this study, we present the first simulation of quantum backflow using a real quantum computer.</description>

      <title>Noisy Demkov-Kunike model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06448v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Demkov-Kunike (DK) model, characterized by a time-dependent Rabi coupling $J~\text{sech}(t/T)$ and on-site detuning $\Delta_0+\Delta_1\tanh(t/T)$, has one of the most general forms of an exactly solvable two-state quantum system, and, therefore, it provides a paradigm for coherent manipulations of a qubit's quantum state. Despite its extensive applications in the noise-free cases, the exploration of the noisy DK model remains limited. Here, we extend the coherent DK model to take into account of a noisy coupling term $J\rightarrow J_{\text{noisy}}(t)$. We consider colored Markovian noise sources represented by the telegraph noise and Gaussian noise. We present exact solutions for the survival probability $Q^{\text{noisy}}_{\text{DK}}$ of the noisy DK model, namely the probability of the system to remain in its initial state. For the slow telegraph noise, we identify parameter regimes where the survival probability $Q^{\text{noisy}}_{\text{DK}}$ is suppressed rather than enhanced by noise. In contrast, for slow Gaussian noise, the noise always enhances the survival probability $Q^{\text{noisy}}_{\text{DK}}$, due to the absorption of noise quanta across the energy gap. This study not only complements the existing research on the noisy Landau-Zener model, but also provides valuable insights for the control of two-level quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10382v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of \emph{complexity} has become pivotal in multiple disciplines, including quantum information, where it serves as an alternative metric for gauging the chaotic evolution of a quantum state. This paper focuses on \emph{Krylov complexity}, a specialized form of quantum complexity that offers an unambiguous and intrinsically meaningful assessment of the spread of a quantum state over all possible orthogonal bases. Our study is situated in the context of Gaussian quantum states, which are fundamental to both Bosonic and Fermionic systems and can be fully described by a covariance matrix. We show that while the covariance matrix is essential, it is insufficient alone for calculating Krylov complexity due to its lack of relative phase information. Our findings suggest that the relative covariance matrix can provide an upper bound for Krylov complexity for Gaussian quantum states. We also explore the implications of Krylov complexity for theories proposing complexity as a candidate for holographic duality by computing Krylov complexity for the thermofield double States (TFD) and Dirac field.</description>

      <title>Achieving the Heisenberg limit with Dicke states in noisy quantum metrology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12411v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Going beyond the standard quantum limit in noisy quantum metrology is an important and challenging task. Here we show how Dicke states can be used to surpass the standard quantum limit and achieve the Heisenberg limit in open quantum systems. The system we study has qubits symmetrically coupled to a resonator and our objective is to estimate the coupling between the qubits and the resonator. The time-dependent quantum Fisher information with respect to the coupling is studied for this open quantum system where the same decay rates are assumed on all qubits. We show that when the system is initialized to a Dicke state with an optimal excitation number one can go beyond the standard quantum limit and achieve the Heisenberg limit even for finite values of the decays on the qubit and the resonator, particularly when the qubits and resonator are strongly coupled. We compare our results against the highly entangled GHZ state and a completely separable state and show that the GHZ state performs quite poorly whereas under certain noise conditions the separable state is able to go beyond the standard quantum limit due to subsequent interactions with a resonator.</description>

Abstract: Scalable quantum processors require high-fidelity universal quantum logic operations in a manufacturable physical platform. Donors in silicon provide atomic size, excellent quantum coherence and compatibility with standard semiconductor processing, but no entanglement between donor-bound electron spins has been demonstrated to date. Here we present the experimental demonstration and tomography of universal 1- and 2-qubit gates in a system of two weakly exchange-coupled electrons, bound to single phosphorus donors introduced in silicon by ion implantation. We surprisingly observe that the exchange interaction has no effect on the qubit coherence. We quantify the fidelity of the quantum operations using gate set tomography (GST), and we use the universal gate set to create entangled Bell states of the electrons spins, with fidelity ~ 93%, and concurrence 0.91 +/- 0.08. These results form the necessary basis for scaling up donor-based quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Entropic uncertainty relations for multiple measurements assigned with biased weights</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The entropic way of formulating Heisenberg's uncertainty principle not only plays a fundamental role in applications of quantum information theory but also is essential for manifesting genuine nonclassical features of quantum systems. In this paper we investigate R\'{e}nyi entropic uncertainty relations (EURs) in the scenario where measurements on individual copies of a quantum system are selected with nonuniform probabilities. In contrast with EURs that characterize an observer's overall lack of information about outcomes with respect to a collection of measurements, we establish state-dependent lower bounds on the weighted sum of entropies over multiple measurements. Conventional EURs thus correspond to the special cases when all weights are equal, and in such cases, we show our results are generally stronger than previous ones. Moreover, taking the entropic steering criterion as an example, we numerically verify that our EURs could be advantageous in practical quantum tasks by optimizing the weights assigned to different measurements. Importantly, this optimization does not require quantum resources and is efficiently computable on classical computers.</description>

Abstract: Symmetry breaking is a fundamental concept in understanding quantum phases of matter, studied so far mostly through the lens of local order parameters. Recently, a new entanglement-based probe of symmetry breaking has been introduced under the name of \textit{entanglement asymmetry}, which has been employed to investigate the mechanism of dynamical symmetry restoration. Here, we provide a universal formula for the entanglement asymmetry of matrix product states with finite bond dimension, valid in the large volume limit. We show that the entanglement asymmetry of any compact -- discrete or continuous -- group depends only on the symmetry breaking pattern, and is not related to any other microscopic features.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum parameter estimation holds the promise of quantum technologies, in which physical parameters can be measured with much greater precision than what is achieved with classical technologies. However, how to obtain a best precision when the optimal measurement is not accessible is still an open problem. In this work, we present a theoretical framework to explore the parameter estimation with limited access of measurements by analyzing the effect of non-optimal measurement on the estimation precision. We define a quantity to characterize the effect and illustrate how to optimize observables to attain a bound with limited accessibility of observables. On the other side, we introduce the minimum Euclidean distance to quantify the difference between an observable and the optimal ones in terms of Frobenius norm and find that the measurement with a shorter distance to the optimal ones benefits the estimation. Two examples are presented to show our theory. In the first, we analyze the effect of non-optimal measurement on the estimation precision of the transition frequency for a driven qubit. While in the second example, we consider a bipartite system, in which one of them is measurement inaccessible. To be specific, we take a toy model, the NV-center in diamond as the bipartite system, where the NV-center electronic spin interacts with a single nucleus via the dipole-dipole interaction. We achieve a precise estimation for the nuclear Larmor frequency by optimizing only the observables of the electronic spin. In these two examples, the minimum Euclidean distance between an observable and the optimal ones is analyzed and the results show that the observable closed to the optimal ones better the estimation precision.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16083v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the Schwinger-Keldysh path integral, we draw a connection between localized quantum field theories and more commonly used models of local probes in Relativistic Quantum Information (RQI). By integrating over and then tracing out the inaccessible modes of the localized field being used as a probe, we show that, at leading order in perturbation theory, the dynamics of any finite number of modes of the probe field is exactly that of a finite number of harmonic-oscillator Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors. The equivalence is valid for a rather general class of input states of the probe-target field system, as well as for any arbitrary number of modes included as detectors. The path integral also provides a closed-form expression which gives us a systematic way of obtaining the corrections to the UDW model at higher orders in perturbation theory due to the existence of the additional modes that have been traced out. This approach vindicates and extends a recently proposed bridge between detector-based and field-theory-based measurement frameworks for quantum field theory [Phys. Rev. D 109, 045013 (2024)], and also points to potential connections between particle detector models in RQI and other areas of physics where path integral methods are more commonplace -- in particular, the Wilsonian approach to the renormalization group and effective field theories.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that certain classes of Schl\" omilch-like infinite series and series that include generalized hypergeometric functions can be calculated in closed form starting from a simple quantum model of a particle trapped inside an infinite potential well and using principles of quantum mechanics. We provide a general framework based on the Hilbert space eigenproblem that can be applied to different exactly solvable quantum models. Obtaining series from normalization conditions in well-defined quantum problems secures their convergence.</description>

      <title>Criteria for Davies Irreducibility of Markovian Quantum Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17641v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics of Markovian open quantum systems are described by Lindblad master equations, generating a quantum dynamical semigroup. An important concept for such systems is (Davies) irreducibility, i.e., the question whether there exist non-trivial invariant subspaces. Steady states of irreducible systems are unique and faithful, i.e., they have full rank. In the 1970s, Frigerio showed that a system is irreducible if the Lindblad operators span a self-adjoint set with trivial commutant. We discuss a more general and powerful algebraic criterion, showing that a system is irreducible if and only if the multiplicative algebra generated by the Lindblad operators $L_a$ and the operator $K=iH+\sum_a L^\dagger_aL_a$, involving the Hamiltonian $H$, is the entire operator space. Examples for two-level systems, show that a change of Hamiltonian terms as well as the addition or removal of dissipators can render a reducible system irreducible and vice versa. Examples for many-body systems show that a large class of spin chains can be rendered irreducible by dissipators on just one or two sites. Additionally, we discuss the decisive differences between (Davies) reducibility and Evans reducibility for quantum channels and dynamical semigroups which has lead to some confusion in the recent physics literature, especially, in the context of boundary-driven systems. We give a criterion for quantum reducibility in terms of associated classical Markov processes and, lastly, discuss the relation of the main result to the stabilization of pure states and argue that systems with local Lindblad operators cannot stabilize pure Fermi-sea states.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Computing allows, in principle, the encoding of the exponentially scaling many-electron wave function onto a linearly scaling qubit register, offering a promising solution to overcome the limitations of traditional quantum chemistry methods. An essential requirement for ground state quantum algorithms to be practical is the initialisation of the qubits to a high-quality approximation of the sought-after ground state. Quantum State Preparation (QSP) allows the preparation of approximate eigenstates obtained from classical calculations, but it is frequently treated as an oracle in quantum information. In this study, we conduct QSP on the ground state of prototypical strongly correlated systems, up to 28 qubits, using the Hyperion GPU-accelerated state-vector emulator. Various variational and non-variational methods are compared in terms of their circuit depth and classical complexity. Our results indicate that the recently developed Overlap-ADAPT-VQE algorithm offers the most advantageous performance for near-term applications.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Discovery of Quantum Error Correction Codes and Encoders with a Noise-Aware Reinforcement Learning Agent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding optimal ways to protect quantum states from noise remains an outstanding challenge across all quantum technologies, and quantum error correction (QEC) is the most promising strategy to address this issue. Constructing QEC codes is a complex task that has historically been powered by human creativity with the discovery of a large zoo of families of codes. However, in the context of real-world scenarios there are two challenges: these codes have typically been categorized only for their performance under an idealized noise model and the implementation-specific optimal encoding circuit is not known. In this work, we train a Deep Reinforcement Learning agent that automatically discovers both QEC codes and their encoding circuits for a given gate set, qubit connectivity, and error model. We introduce the concept of a noise-aware meta-agent, which learns to produce encoding strategies simultaneously for a range of noise models, thus leveraging transfer of insights between different situations. Moreover, thanks to the use of the stabilizer formalism and a vectorized Clifford simulator, our RL implementation is extremely efficient, allowing us to produce many codes and their encoders from scratch within seconds, with code distances varying from 3 to 5 and with up to 20 physical qubits. Our approach opens the door towards hardware-adapted accelerated discovery of QEC approaches across the full spectrum of quantum hardware platforms of interest.</description>

      <title>An atom-doped photon engine: Extracting mechanical work from a quantum system via radiation pressure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The possibility of efficiently converting heat into work at the microscale has triggered an intense research effort to understand quantum heat engines, driven by the hope of quantum superiority over classical counterparts. In this work, we introduce a model featuring an atom-doped optical quantum cavity propelling a classical piston through radiation pressure. The model, based on the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian of quantum electrodynamics, demonstrates the generation of mechanical work through thermal energy injection. We establish the equivalence of the piston expansion work with Alicki's work definition, analytically for quasistatic transformations and numerically for finite time protocols. We further employ the model to construct quantum Otto and Carnot engines, comparing their performance in terms of energetics, work output, efficiency, and power under various conditions. This model thus provides a platform to extract useful work from an open quantum system to generate net motion, and sheds light on the quantum concepts of work and heat.</description>

      <title>Matching Generalized-Bicycle Codes to Neutral Atoms for Low-Overhead Fault-Tolerance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the necessity of fault-tolerant quantum sys- tems built on error correcting codes, many popular codes, such as the surface code, have prohibitively large qubit costs. In this work we present a protocol for efficiently implementing a restricted set of space-efficient quantum error correcting (QEC) codes in atom arrays. This protocol enables generalized-bicycle codes that require up to 10x fewer physical qubits than surface codes. Additionally, our protocol enables logical cycles that are 2-3x faster than more general solutions for implementing space- efficient QEC codes in atom arrays. We also evaluate a proof-of-concept quantum memory hier- archy where generalized-bicycle codes are used in conjunction with surface codes for general computation. Through a detailed compilation methodology, we estimate the costs of key fault- tolerant benchmarks in a hierarchical architecture versus a state-of-the-art surface code only architecture. Overall, we find the spatial savings of generalized-bicycle codes outweigh the overhead of loading and storing qubits, motivating the feasibility of a quantum memory hierarchy in practice. Through sensitivity studies, we also identify key program-level and hardware-level features for using a hierarchical architecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04781v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) is widely recognized as an efficient algorithm for simulating fluid flows in both single-phase and multi-phase scenarios. In this research, a quantum Carleman Linearization formulation of the Lattice Boltzmann equation is described, employing the Bhatnagar Gross and Krook equilibrium function. Our approach addresses the treatment of boundary conditions with the commonly used bounce back scheme.
  The accuracy of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by simulating flow past a rectangular prism, achieving agreement with respect to fluid velocity In comparison to classical LBM simulations. This improved formulation showcases the potential to provide computational speed-ups in a wide range of fluid flow applications.
  Additionally, we provide details on read in and read out techniques.</description>

Abstract: A quantum measurement involves energy exchanges between the system to be measured and the measuring apparatus. Some of them involve energy losses, for example because energy is dissipated into the environment or is spent in recording the measurement outcome. Moreover, these processes take time. For this reason, these exchanges must be taken into account in the analysis of a quantum measurement engine, and set limits to its efficiency and power. We propose a quantum engine based on a spin 1/2 particle in a magnetic field and study its fundamental limitations due to the quantum nature of the evolution. The coupling with the electromagnetic vacuum is taken into account and plays the role of a measurement apparatus. We fully study its dynamics, work, power and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Probabilistic Readout Correction of Mid-Circuit Measurements for Adaptive Feedback via Measurement Randomized Compiling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14139v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum measurements are a fundamental component of quantum computing. However, on modern-day quantum computers, measurements can be more error prone than quantum gates, and are susceptible to nonunital errors as well as non-local correlations due to measurement crosstalk. While readout errors can be mitigated in post-processing, it is inefficient in the number of qubits due to a combinatorially-large number of possible states that need to be characterized. In this work, we show that measurement errors can be tailored into a simple stochastic error model using randomized compiling, enabling the efficient mitigation of readout errors via quasi-probability distributions reconstructed from the measurement of a single preparation state in an exponentially large confusion matrix. We demonstrate the scalability and power of this approach by correcting readout errors without matrix inversion on a large number of different preparation states applied to a register of a eight superconducting transmon qubits. Moreover, we show that this method can be extended to mid-circuit measurements used for active feedback via quasi-probabilistic error cancellation, and demonstrate the correction of measurement errors on an ancilla qubit used to detect and actively correct bit-flip errors on an entangled memory qubit. Our approach enables the correction of readout errors on large numbers of qubits, and offers a strategy for correcting readout errors in adaptive circuits in which the results of mid-circuit measurements are used to perform conditional operations on non-local qubits in real time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pseudorandom states (PRS) are an important primitive in quantum cryptography. In this paper, we show that subset states can be used to construct PRSs. A subset state with respect to $S$, a subset of the computational basis, is \[
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{|S|}}\sum_{i\in S} |i\rangle. \] As a technical centerpiece, we show that for any fixed subset size $|S|=s$ such that $s = 2^n/\omega(\mathrm{poly}(n))$ and $s=\omega(\mathrm{poly}(n))$, where $n$ is the number of qubits, a random subset state is information-theoretically indistinguishable from a Haar random state even provided with polynomially many copies. This range of parameter is tight. Our work resolves a conjecture by Ji, Liu and Song. Since subset states of small size have small entanglement across all cuts, this construction also illustrates a pseudoentanglement phenomenon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop quantum algorithms for pricing Asian and barrier options under the Heston model, a popular stochastic volatility model, and estimate their costs, in terms of T-count, T-depth and number of logical qubits, on instances under typical market conditions. These algorithms are based on combining well-established numerical methods for stochastic differential equations and quantum amplitude estimation technique. In particular, we empirically show that, despite its simplicity, weak Euler method achieves the same level of accuracy as the better-known strong Euler method in this task. Furthermore, by eliminating the expensive procedure of preparing Gaussian states, the quantum algorithm based on weak Euler scheme achieves drastically better efficiency than the one based on strong Euler scheme. Our resource analysis suggests that option pricing under stochastic volatility is a promising application of quantum computers, and that our algorithms render the hardware requirement for reaching practical quantum advantage in financial applications less stringent than prior art.</description>

Abstract: The dynamics of the interaction between an atom of three levels interacting with a quantized field of two modes in a cavity is studied within the rotating wave approximation, by taking into account experimental values of the accessible hyperfine levels of alkaline atoms. An equal detuning is considered to determine the matter-field entanglement, the statistical properties of the photons, and the occupation probabilities of the atom. For a large detuning or weak dipolar strength appear the Raman condition, that is, the suppression of one of his atomic transitions. Analytic expression for the time evolution operator allows to have also explicit closed expressions for the field and matter observables.</description>

Abstract: Simulating quantum circuits on classical hardware is a powerful and necessary tool for developing and testing quantum algorithms and hardware as well as evaluating claims of quantum supremacy in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) regime. Schr\"odinger-style simulations are limited by the exponential growth of the number of state amplitudes which need to be stored. In this work, we apply scalar and vector quantization to Schr\"odinger-style quantum circuit simulations as lossy compression schemes to reduce the number of bits needed to simulate quantum circuits. Using quantization, we can maintain simulation fidelities $&gt;0.99$ when simulating the Quantum Fourier Transform, while using only 7 significand bits in a floating-point number to characterize the real and imaginary components of each amplitude. Furthermore, using vector quantization, we propose a method to bound the number of bits/amplitude needed to store state vectors in a simulation of a circuit that achieves a desired fidelity, and show that for a 6 qubit simulation of the Quantum Fourier Transform, 15 bits/amplitude is sufficient to maintain fidelity $&gt;0.9$ at $10^4$ depth.</description>

      <title>Metropolitan-scale Entanglement Distribution with Co-existing Quantum and Classical Signals in a single fiber</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of prototype metropolitan-scale quantum networks is underway and entails transmitting quantum information via single photons through deployed optical fibers spanning several tens of kilometers. The major challenges in building metropolitan-scale quantum networks are compensation of polarization mode dispersion, high-precision clock synchronization, and compensation for cumulative transmission time fluctuations. One approach addressing these challenges is to co-propagate classical probe signals in the same fiber as the quantum signal. Thus, both signals experience the same conditions, and the changes of the fiber can therefore be monitored and compensated. Here, we demonstrate the distribution of polarization entangled quantum signals co-propagating with the White Rabbit Precision Time Protocol (WR-PTP) classical signals in the same single-core fiber strand at metropolitan-scale distances. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of this quantum-classical coexistence by achieving high-fidelity entanglement distribution between nodes separated by 100 km of optical fiber. This advancement is a significant step towards the practical implementation of robust and efficient metropolitan-scale quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Scattering wave packets of hadrons in gauge theories: Preparation on a quantum computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum simulation holds promise of enabling a complete description of high-energy scattering processes rooted in gauge theories of the Standard Model. A first step in such simulations is preparation of interacting hadronic wave packets. To create the wave packets, one typically resorts to adiabatic evolution to bridge between wave packets in the free theory and those in the interacting theory, rendering the simulation resource intensive. In this work, we construct a wave-packet creation operator directly in the interacting theory to circumvent adiabatic evolution, taking advantage of resource-efficient schemes for ground-state preparation, such as variational quantum eigensolvers. By means of an ansatz for bound mesonic excitations in confining gauge theories, which is subsequently optimized using classical or quantum methods, we show that interacting mesonic wave packets can be created efficiently and accurately using digital quantum algorithms that we develop. Specifically, we obtain high-fidelity mesonic wave packets in the $Z_2$ and $U(1)$ lattice gauge theories coupled to fermionic matter in 1+1 dimensions. Our method is applicable to both perturbative and non-perturbative regimes of couplings. The wave-packet creation circuit for the case of the $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory is built and implemented on the Quantinuum H1-1 trapped-ion quantum computer using 13 qubits and up to 308 entangling gates. The fidelities agree well with classical benchmark calculations after employing a simple symmetry-based noise-mitigation technique. This work serves as a step toward quantum computing scattering processes in quantum chromodynamics.</description>

      <title>Efficiency of neural quantum states in light of the quantum geometric tensor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural quantum state (NQS) ans\"atze have shown promise in variational Monte Carlo algorithms by their theoretical capability of representing any quantum state. However, the reason behind the practical improvement in their performance with an increase in the number of parameters is not fully understood. In this work, we systematically study the efficiency of restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) to represent the ground states in different phases of the spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic model, as the hidden layer density $\alpha$ increases. We train our ansatz by minimizing two different loss functions: 1) energy, and 2) infidelity of the NQS ansatz w.r.t. that of the exact ground state. We observe that the accuracy of our ansatz saturates with $\alpha$ in both cases. We demonstrate that this can be explained by looking at the spectrum of the quantum geometric tensor (QGT). We find that the rank of the QGT saturates beyond a certain $\alpha$, and we emphasize that it corresponds to the \textit{dimension of the relevant manifold} for an optimized NQS. This provides a useful diagnostics for the practical representation power of an NQS ansatz.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03360v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The second-order differential equation for the Uehling potential is derived explicitly. The right side of this differential equation is a linear combination of the two Macdonald's functions $K_{0}(b r)$ and $K_{1}(b r)$. This central potential is of great interest in many QED problems, since it describes the lowest-order correction for vacuum polarization in few- and many-electron atoms, ions, muonic and bi-muonic atoms/ions as well as in other similar systems.</description>

      <title>Web 3.0 and Quantum Security: Long-Distance Free-Space QSDC for Global Web 3.0 Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the advent of Web 3.0, the swift advancement of technology confronts an imminent threat from quantum computing. Security protocols safeguarding the integrity of Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 are growing more susceptible to both quantum attacks and sophisticated classical threats. The article introduces our novel long-distance free-space quantum secure direct communication (LF QSDC) as a method to safeguard against security breaches in both quantum and classical contexts. Differing from techniques like quantum key distribution (QKD), LF QSDC surpasses constraints by facilitating encrypted data transmission sans key exchanges, thus diminishing the inherent weaknesses of key-based systems. The distinctiveness of this attribute, coupled with its quantum mechanics base, protects against quantum computer assaults and advanced non-quantum dangers, harmonizing seamlessly with the untrustworthy tenets of the Web 3.0 age. The focus of our study is the technical design and incorporation of LF QSDC into web 3.0 network infrastructures, highlighting its efficacy for extended-range communication. LF QSDC is based on the memory DL04 protocol and enhanced with our novel Quantum-Aware Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC), Pointing, Acquisition, and Tracking (PAT) technologies, and Atmospheric Quantum Correction Algorithm (AQCA). Utilizing this method not only bolsters the security of worldwide Web 3.0 networks but also guarantees their endurance in a time when quantum and sophisticated classical threats exist simultaneously. Consequently, LF QSDC stands out as a robust security solution, well-suited for Web 3.0 systems amidst the constantly evolving digital environment.</description>

      <title>Quantum optics with giant atoms in a structured photonic bath</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a general framework to tackle quantum optics problems with giant atoms, i.e. quantum emitters each coupled {\it non-locally} to a structured photonic bath (typically a lattice) of any dimension. The theory encompasses the calculation and general properties of Green's functions, atom-photon bound states (BSs), collective master equations and decoherence-free Hamiltonians (DFHs), and is underpinned by a formalism where a giant atom is formally viewed as a normal atom lying at a fictitious location. As a major application, we provide for the first time a general criterion to predict/engineer DFHs of giant atoms, which can be applied both in and out of the photonic continuum and regardless of the structure or dimensionality of the photonic bath. This is used to show novel DFHs in 2D baths such as a square lattice and photonic graphene.</description>

      <title>MITS: A Quantum Sorcerer Stone For Designing Surface Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the evolving landscape of quantum computing, determining the most efficient parameters for Quantum Error Correction (QEC) is paramount. Various quantum computers possess varied types and amounts of physical noise. Traditionally, simulators operate in a forward paradigm, taking parameters such as distance, rounds, and physical error to output a logical error rate. However, usage of maximum distance and rounds of the surface code might waste resources. An approach that relies on trial and error to fine-tune QEC code parameters using simulation tools like STIM can be exceedingly time-consuming. Additionally, daily fluctuations in quantum error rates can alter the ideal QEC settings needed. As a result, there is a crucial need for an automated solution that can rapidly determine the appropriate QEC parameters tailored to the current conditions. To bridge this gap, we present MITS, a tool designed to reverse-engineer the well-known simulator STIM for designing QEC codes. MITS accepts the specific noise model of a quantum computer and a target logical error rate as input and outputs the optimal surface code rounds and code distances. This guarantees minimal qubit and gate usage, harmonizing the desired logical error rate with the existing hardware limitations on qubit numbers and gate fidelity. We explored and compared multiple heuristics and machine learning models for training/designing MITS and concluded that XGBoost and Random Forest regression were most effective, with Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.98 and 0.96 respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11127v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing holds transformative potential for various fields, yet its practical application is hindered by the susceptibility to errors. This study makes a pioneering contribution by applying quantum error correction codes (QECCs) for complex, multi-qubit classification tasks. We implement 1-qubit and 2-qubit quantum classifiers with QECCs, specifically the Steane code, and the distance 3 &amp; 5 surface codes to analyze 2-dimensional and 4-dimensional datasets. This research uniquely evaluates the performance of these QECCs in enhancing the robustness and accuracy of quantum classifiers against various physical errors, including bit-flip, phase-flip, and depolarizing errors. The results emphasize that the effectiveness of a QECC in practical scenarios depends on various factors, including qubit availability, desired accuracy, and the specific types and levels of physical errors, rather than solely on theoretical superiority.</description>

      <title>Saturability of the Quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao Bound in Multiparameter Quantum Estimation at the Single-Copy Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (QCRB) as the ultimate lower bound for precision in quantum parameter estimation is only known to be saturable in the multiparameter setting in special cases and under conditions such as full or average commutavity of the symmetric logarithmic derivatives (SLDs) associated with the parameters. Moreover, for general mixed states, collective measurements over infinitely many identical copies of the quantum state are generally required to attain the QCRB. In the important and experimentally relevant single-copy scenario, a necessary condition for saturating the QCRB in the multiparameter setting for general mixed states is the so-called partial commutativity condition on the SLDs. However, it is not known if this condition is also sufficient. This paper derives new necessary conditions that imply partial commutativity and are almost sufficient. It is shown that together with another condition they become sufficient for saturability of the QCRB in the multiparameter single-copy case. Moreover, when the sufficient conditions are satisfied an optimal measurement saturating the QCRB can be chosen to be projective and explicitly characterized. An example is developed to illustrate the case of a multiparameter quantum state where the conditions derived herein are satisfied and can be explicitly verified.</description>

      <title>Limitations and Separations in the Quantum Sum-of-squares, and the Quantum Knapsack Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We answer two questions regarding the sum-of-squares for the SYK model left open in Ref. 1, both of which are related to graphs. First (a "limitation"), we show that a fragment of the sum-of-squares, in which one considers commutation relations of degree-$4$ Majorana operators but does not impose any other relations on them, does not give the correct order of magnitude bound on the ground state energy. Second (a "separation"), we show that the graph invariant $\Psi(G)$ defined in Ref. 1 may be strictly larger than the independence number $\alpha(G)$. The invariant $\Psi(G)$ is a bound on the norm of a Hamiltonian whose terms obey commutation relations determined by the graph $G$, and it was shown that $\alpha(G)\leq \Psi(G) \leq \vartheta(G)$, where $\vartheta(\cdot)$ is the Lovasz theta function. We briefly discuss the case of $q\neq 4$ in the SYK model. Separately, we define a problem that we call the quantum knapsack problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study brick wall quantum circuits enjoying a global fermionic symmetry. The constituent 2-qubit gate, and its fermionic symmetry, derive from a 2-particle scattering matrix in integrable, supersymmetric quantum field theory in 1+1 dimensions. Our 2-qubit gate, as a function of three free parameters, is of so-called free fermionic or matchgate form, allowing us to derive the spectral structure of both the brick wall unitary $U_F$ and its, non-trivial, hamiltonian limit $H_{\gamma}$ in closed form. We find that the fermionic symmetry pins $H_{\gamma}$ to a surface of critical points, whereas breaking that symmetry leads to non-trivial topological phases. We briefly explore quench dynamics and entanglement build up for this class of circuits.</description>

      <title>Self-testing of genuine multipartite non-local and non-maximally entangled states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-testing enables the characterization of quantum systems with minimal assumptions their internal working. As such it represents the strongest form of certification for quantum systems. In the existing self-testing literature, self-testing states which are not maximally entangled, but exhibit genuine multipartite nonlocality, have remained an open problem. This is particularly important because, for many-body systems, genuine multipartite nonlocality has been recognized as the strongest form of multipartite quantum correlation. In this work, we present a Hardy-like paradox for scenarios involving arbitrary number of parties. This paradox is a tool for detecting genuine multipartite nonlocality, allowing for the specific identification and self-testing of states that defy the paradox's limits the most, which turn out to be non-maximally multipartite entangled states. While recent results [\textit{\v{S}upi\'c et al., Nature Physics, 2023}] suggest network self-testing as a means to self-test all quantum states, here we operate within the standard self-testing framework to self-test genuine multipartite non-local and non-maximally entangled states.</description>

      <title>Universal features of entanglement entropy in the honeycomb Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.04334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The entanglement entropy is a unique probe to reveal universal features of strongly interacting many-body systems. In two or more dimensions these features are subtle, and detecting them numerically requires extreme precision, a notoriously difficult task. This is especially challenging in models of interacting fermions, where many such universal features have yet to be observed. In this paper we tackle this challenge by introducing a new method to compute the R\'enyi entanglement entropy in auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo simulations, where we treat the entangling region itself as a stochastic variable. We demonstrate the efficiency of this method by extracting, for the first time, universal subleading logarithmic terms in a two dimensional model of interacting fermions, focusing on the half-filled honeycomb Hubbard model at $T=0$. We detect the universal corner contribution due to gapless fermions throughout the Dirac semi-metal phase and at the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa critical point, where the latter shows a pronounced enhancement depending on the type of entangling cut. Finally, we observe the universal Goldstone mode contribution in the antiferromagnetic Mott insulating phase.</description>

      <title>Quantum Coherence of Critical Unstable Two-Level Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.06031v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study in detail the dynamics of unstable two-level quantum systems by adopting the Bloch-sphere formalism of qubits. By employing the Bloch-vector representation for such unstable qubit systems, we identify a novel class of critical scenarios in which the so-called energy-level and decay-width vectors, ${\bf E}$ and ${\bf\Gamma}$, are orthogonal to one another, and the parameter $r = |{\bf \Gamma}|/(2|{\bf E}|)$ is less than 1. Most remarkably, we find that critical unstable qubit systems exhibit atypical behaviours like coherence--decoherence oscillations when analysed in an appropriately defined co-decaying frame of the system. In the same frame, a unit Bloch vector ${\bf b}$ describing a pure critical qubit will sweep out unequal areas during equal intervals of time, while rotating about the vector ${\bf E}$. These phenomena emerge beyond the usual oscillatory pattern due to the energy-level difference of the two-level quantum system. Interestingly enough, we observe that these new features will persist even for quasi-critical scenarios, in which the vectors ${\bf E}$ and ${\bf\Gamma}$ are not perfectly orthogonal to each other. Applications of our results to quantum information and to unstable meson--antimeson and other systems are discussed.</description>

Abstract: Cavity optomechanical systems are a paradigmatic setting for the conversion of electromagnetic energy into mechanical work. Experiments with atoms coupled to cavity modes are realized in nonequilibrium conditions, described by phenomenological models encoding non-thermal dissipative dynamics and falling outside the framework of weak system-bath couplings. This fact makes their interpretation as quantum engines, e.g., the derivation of a well-defined efficiency, quite challenging. Here, we present a consistent thermodynamic description of open quantum cavity-atom systems. Our approach takes advantage of their nonequilibrium nature and arrives at an energetic balance which is fully interpretable in terms of persistent dissipated heat currents. The interaction between atoms and cavity modes can further give rise to nonequilibrium phase transitions and emergent behavior and allows to assess the impact of collective many-body phenomena on the engine operation. To enable this, we define two thermodynamic limits related to a weak and to a strong optomechanical coupling, respectively. We illustrate our ideas focussing on a time-crystal engine and discuss power generation, energy-conversion efficiency, and emergence of metastable behavior in both limits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.12713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gauge theories arise in physical systems displaying space-time local symmetries. They provide a powerful description of important realms of physics ranging from fundamental interactions, to statistical mechanics, condensed matter and more recently quantum computation. As such, a remarkably deep understanding has been achieved in the field. With the advent of quantum technology, lower energy analogs, capable to capture important features of the original quantum field theories through quantum simulation, have been intensively studied. Here, we propose a specific scheme implementing an analogic quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories constrained to mesoscopic spatial scales. To this end, we study the dynamics of mesons residing in a ring-shaped lattice of mesoscopic size pierced by an effective magnetic field. In particular, we find a new type of Aharonov-Bohm effect that goes beyond the particle-like effect and reflecting the the features of the confining gauge potential. The coherence properties of the meson are quantified by the persistent current and by specific features of the correlation functions. When the magnetic field is quenched, Aharonov-Bohm oscillations and correlations start a specific matter-wave current dynamics.</description>

Abstract: The Anderson impurity model is a paradigmatic example in the study of strongly correlated quantum systems and describes an interacting quantum dot coupled to electronic leads. In this work, we characterize the emergence of the Kondo effect by investigating the model dynamics following a quantum quench based on matrix product state simulations. The relaxation of the impurity magnetization allows for the estimate of the predicted universal scaling of the Kondo temperature as a function of the impurity-lead hybridization and quantum dot repulsion. Additionally, our simulations permit us to evaluate the current in the nonequilibrium quasi-steady state appearing after the quench. Through their values, we examine the dependence of the conductance on the voltage bias $V_b$ and on the impurity chemical potential $V_g$, which displays a zero-bias Kondo peak. Our results are relevant for transport measurements in Coulomb blockaded devices, and, in particular, in quantum dots induced in nanowires.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.08917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ab-initio Monte Carlo simulations of strongly-interacting fermionic systems are plagued by the fermion sign problem, making the non-perturbative study of many interesting regimes of dense quantum matter, or of theories of odd numbers of fermion flavors, challenging. Moreover, typical fermion algorithms require the computation (or sampling) of the fermion determinant. We focus instead on the meron cluster algorithm, which can solve the fermion sign problem in a class of models without involving the determinant. We develop and benchmark new meron algorithms to simulate fermions coupled to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $U(1)$ gauge fields in the presence of appropriate four-fermi interactions. Such algorithms can be used to uncover potential exotic properties of matter, particularly relevant for quantum simulator experiments. We demonstrate the emergence of the Gauss' Law at low temperatures for a $U(1)$ model in $(1+1)-$d.</description>

Abstract: Understanding fluctuation phenomena plays a dominant role in the development of many-body physics. The time evolution of entanglement is essential to a broad range of subjects in many-body physics, ranging from exotic quantum matter to quantum thermalization. Stemming from various dynamical processes of information, fluctuations in entanglement evolution differ conceptually from out-of-equilibrium fluctuations of traditional physical quantities. Their studies remain elusive. Here we uncover an emergent random structure in the evolution of the many-body wavefunction in two classes of integrable -- either interacting or noninteracting -- lattice models. It gives rise to out-of-equilibrium entanglement fluctuations which fall into the paradigm of mesoscopic fluctuations of wave interference origin. Specifically, the entanglement entropy variance obeys a universal scaling law, in each class, and the full distribution displays a sub-Gaussian upper and a sub-Gamma lower tail. These statistics are independent of both the system's microscopic details and the choice of entanglement probes, and broaden the class of mesoscopic universalities. They have practical implications for controlling entanglement in mesoscopic devices.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussian dynamics of quantum fluctuations and mean-field limit in open quantum central spin systems</title>

Abstract: Central spin systems, in which a {\it central} spin is singled out and interacts nonlocally with several {\it bath} spins, are paradigmatic models for nitrogen-vacancy centers and quantum dots. They show complex emergent dynamics and stationary phenomena which, despite the collective nature of their interaction, are still largely not understood. Here, we derive exact results on the emergent behavior of open quantum central spin systems. The latter crucially depends on the scaling of the interaction strength with the bath size. For scalings with the inverse square root of the bath size (typical of one-to-many interactions), the system behaves, in the thermodynamic limit, as an open quantum Jaynes-Cummings model, whose bosonic mode encodes the quantum fluctuations of the bath spins. In this case, non-Gaussian correlations are dynamically generated and persist at stationarity. For scalings with the inverse bath size, the emergent dynamics is instead of mean-field type. Our work provides a fundamental understanding of the different dynamical regimes of central spin systems and a simple theory for efficiently exploring their nonequilibrium behavior. Our findings may become relevant for developing fully quantum descriptions of many-body solid-state devices and their applications.</description>

      <title>Generating function for projected entangled-pair states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diagrammatic summation is a common bottleneck in modern applications of projected entangled-pair states, especially in computing low-energy excitations of a two-dimensional quantum many-body system. To solve this problem, here we extend the generating function approach for tensor network diagrammatic summation, a scheme previously proposed in the context of matrix product states. Taking the form of a one-particle excitation, we show that the excited state can be computed efficiently in the generating function formalism, which can further be used in evaluating the dynamical structure factor of the system. Our benchmark results for the spin-$1/2$ transverse-field Ising model and Heisenberg model on the square lattice provide a desirable accuracy, showing good agreement with known results. We then study the spin-$1/2$ $J_1$-$J_2$ model on the same lattice and investigate the dynamical properties of the putative gapless spin liquid phase. We conclude with a discussion on generalizations to multi-particle excitations.</description>

      <title>Dark matter detection using nuclear magnetization in magnet with hyperfine interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the possibility to detect cosmic light dark matter (DM), i.e., axions and dark photons, of mass $\sim 10^{-6}$ eV and $\sim 10^{-4}$ eV, by magnetic excitation in a magnet with strong hyperfine interaction. In particular, we consider a canted anti-ferromagnet, MnCO$_3$, as a concrete candidate material. With spin transfer between nuclear and electron spins allowed by the hyperfine interaction, nuclear spins become naturally highly polarized due to an effective (electron-spin-induced) magnetic field, and have long-range interactions with each other. The collective precession of nuclear spins, i.e., a nuclear magnon, can be generated by the DM field through the nucleon-DM interaction, while they are also sensitive to the electron-DM interaction through the electron-nuclear spin mixing. Compared with conventional nuclear-spin precession experiments, this system as a DM sensor is sensitive to higher frequency needing only a small static magnetic field applied. The system also has collective precession of electron spins, mixed with nuclear spins, as the additional channels that can be used for DM probes. We estimate the sensitivity under appropriate readout setups such as an inductive pick-up loop associated with an LC resonant circuit, or a photon cavity with a photon counting device. We show that this method covers an unexplored parameter region of light bosonic DM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14895v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that testing Bell inequalities in $W^\pm$ pair systems by measuring their angular correlation suffers from the ambiguity in kinetical reconstruction of the di-lepton decay mode. We further propose a new set of Bell observables based on the measurement of the linear polarization of the $W$ bosons, providing a realistic observable to test Bell inequalities in $W^\pm$ pair systems for the first time.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian Dynamics of Open Quantum Systems via Auxiliary Particles with Exact Operator Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an auxiliary-particle field theory to treat the non-Markovian dynamics of driven-dissipative quantum systems of the Jaynes-Cummings type. It assigns an individual quantum field to each reservoir state and provides an analytic, faithful representation of the coupled system-bath dynamics. We apply the method to a driven-dissipative photon Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) coupled to a reservoir of dye molecules with electronic and vibronic excitations. The complete phase diagram of this system exhibits a hidden, non-Hermitian phase transition separating temporally oscillating from biexponentially decaying photon density correlations within the BEC. On one hand, this provides a qualitative distinction of the thermal photon BEC from a laser. On the other hand, it shows that one may continuously tune from the BEC to the lasing phase by circumventing a critical point. This auxiliary-particle method is generally applicable to the dynamics of open, non-Markovian quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Floquet systems with continuous dynamical symmetries: characterization, time-dependent Noether charge, and integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study quantum Floquet (periodically-driven) systems having continuous dynamical symmetry (CDS) consisting of a time translation and a unitary transformation on the Hilbert space. Unlike the discrete ones, the CDS strongly constrains the possible Hamiltonians $H(t)$ and allows us to obtain all the Floquet states by solving a finite-dimensional eigenvalue problem. Besides, Noether's theorem leads to a time-dependent conservation charge, whose expectation value is time-independent throughout evolution. We exemplify these consequences of CDS in the seminal Rabi model, an effective model of a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamonds without strain terms, and Heisenberg spin models in rotating fields. Our results provide a systematic way of solving for Floquet states and explain how they avoid hybridization in quasienergy diagrams.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Casimir-Polder Interaction Between Nanoparticles and Substrates Coated with Gapped Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The out-of-thermal-equilibrium Casimir-Polder force between nanoparticles and dielectric substrates coated with gapped graphene is considered in the framework of the Dirac model using the formalism of the polarization tensor. This is an example of physical phenomena violating the time-reversal symmetry. After presenting the main points of the used formalism, we calculate two contributions to the Casimir-Polder force acting on a nanoparticle on the source side of a fused silica glass substrate coated with gapped graphene, which is either cooler or hotter than the environment. The total nonequilibrium force magnitudes are computed as a function of separation for different values of the energy gap and compared with those from an uncoated plate and with the equilibrium force in the presence of graphene coating. According to our results, the presence of a substrate increases the magnitude of the nonequlibrium force. The force magnitude becomes larger with higher and smaller with lower temperature of the graphene-coated substrate as compared to the equilibrium force at the environmental temperature. It is shown that with increasing energy gap the magnitude of the nonequilibrium force becomes smaller, and the graphene coating makes a lesser impact on the force acting on a nanoparticle from the uncoated substrate. Possible applications of the obtained results are discussed.</description>

      <title>The confluence of fractured resonances at points of dynamical, many--body flare</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Resonant transport occurs when there is a matching of frequencies across some spatial medium, increasing the efficiency of shuttling particles from one reservoir to another. We demonstrate that in a periodically driven, many--body titled lattice, there are sets of spatially fractured resonances. These ``emanate'' from two essential resonances due to scattering off internal surfaces created when the driving frequency and many--body interaction strength vary, a scattering reminiscent of lens flare. The confluence of these fractured resonances dramatically enhances transport. At one confluence, the interaction strength is finite and the essential resonance arises due to the interplay of interaction with the counter--rotating terms of the periodic drive. We discuss the origin and structure of the fractured resonances, as well as the scaling of the conductance with system parameters. These results furnish a new example of the richness of open, driven, many--body systems.</description>

      <title>Programmable order by disorder effect and underlying phases through dipolar quantum simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study two different quantum simulators through various theoretical and numerical tools. Our first result provides knowledge upon the quantum order by disorder effect of the $S=1/2$ system, which is programmable in a quantum simulator composed of circular Rydberg atoms. When the total magnetization is zero, a set of sub-extensive degenerate ground states is present in the classical limit, composed of continuous strings whose configuration enjoys a large degree of freedom. Among all possible configurations, we focus on the stripe (up and down spins aligning straightly) and kinked (up and down spins forming zigzag spin chains) patterns. Adopting the real space perturbation theory, we estimate the leading order energy correction when the nearest-neighbor spin exchange coupling, $J$, is considered, and the overall model becomes an effective XXZ model with a spatial anisotropy. Our calculation demonstrates a lifting of the degeneracy, favoring the stripe configuration. When $J$ becomes larger, we adopt the infinite projected entangled-pair state and numerically check the effect of degeneracy lifting, showing that even when the spin exchange coupling term is strong the stripe pattern is still favored. Next, we study the dipolar bosonic model with tilted polar angle which can be realized through a quantum simulator composed of cold atomic gas with dipole-dipole interaction in an optical lattice. By placing the atoms in a triangular lattice and tilting the polar angle, the diagonal anisotropy can also be realized in the bosonic system. With our cluster mean-field theory calculation, we provide various phase diagrams with different tilted angles, showing the abundant underlying phases including the supersolid. Our proposals indicate realizable scenarios through quantum simulators in studying the quantum effect as well as extraordinary phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the potential of quantum acceleration in addressing infinite horizon Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) to enhance average reward outcomes. We introduce an innovative quantum framework for the agent's engagement with an unknown MDP, extending the conventional interaction paradigm. Our approach involves the design of an optimism-driven tabular Reinforcement Learning algorithm that harnesses quantum signals acquired by the agent through efficient quantum mean estimation techniques. Through thorough theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that the quantum advantage in mean estimation leads to exponential advancements in regret guarantees for infinite horizon Reinforcement Learning. Specifically, the proposed Quantum algorithm achieves a regret bound of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1)$, a significant improvement over the $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ bound exhibited by classical counterparts.</description>

Abstract: We propose a new viewpoint on the study of localization transitions in disordered quantum systems, showing how critical properties can be seen also as a geometric transition in the data space generated by the classically encoded configurations of the disordered quantum system. We showcase our approach to the Anderson model on regular random graphs, known for displaying features of interacting systems, despite being a single-particle problem. We estimate the transition point and critical exponents in agreement with the best-known results in the literature. We provide a simple and coherent explanation of our findings, discussing the applicability of the method in real-world scenarios with a modest number of measurements.</description>

Abstract: Mermin's inequalities are investigated in a Quantum Field Theory framework by using von Neumann algebras built with Weyl operators. We devise a general construction based on the Tomita-Takesaki modular theory and use it to compute the vacuum expectation value of the Mermin operator, analyzing the parameter space and explicitly exhibiting a violation of Mermin's inequalities. Therefore, relying on the power of modular operators, we are able to demonstrate that Mermin's inequalities are violated when examined within the vacuum state of a scalar field theory.</description>

      <title>Spectral fluctuations of multiparametric complex matrix ensembles: evidence of a single parameter dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically analyze the spectral statistics of the multiparametric Gaussian ensembles of complex matrices with zero mean and variances with different decay routes away from the diagonals. As the latter mimics different degree of effective sparsity among the matrix elements, such ensembles can serve as good models for a wide range of phase transitions e.g. localization to delocalization in non-Hermitian systems or Hermitian to non-Hermitian one. Our analysis reveals a rich behavior hidden beneath the spectral statistics e.g. a crossover of the spectral statistics from Poisson to Ginibre universality class with changing variances for finite matrix size, an abrupt transition for infinite matrix size and the role of complexity parameter, a single functional of all system parameters, as a criteria to determine critical point. We also confirm the theoretical predictions in \cite{psgs, psnh}, regarding the universality of the spectral statistics in non-equilibrium regime of non-Hermitian systems characterized by the complexity parameter.</description>

      <title>Universal contributions to charge fluctuations in spin chains at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At finite temperature, conserved charges undergo thermal fluctuations in a quantum many-body system in the grand canonical ensemble. The full structure of the fluctuations of the total U(1) charge $Q$ can be succinctly captured by the generating function $G(\theta)=\left\langle e^{i \theta Q}\right\rangle$. For a 1D translation-invariant spin chain, in the thermodynamic limit the magnitude $|G(\theta)|$ scales with the system size $L$ as $\ln |G(\theta)|=-\alpha(\theta)L+\gamma(\theta)$, where $\gamma(\theta)$ is the scale-invariant contribution and may encode universal information about the underlying system. In this work we investigate the behavior and physical meaning of $\gamma(\theta)$ when the system is periodic. We find that $\gamma(\theta)$ only takes non-zero values at isolated points of $\theta$, which is $\theta=\pi$ for all our examples. In two exemplary lattice systems we show that $\gamma(\pi)$ takes quantized values when the U(1) symmetry exhibits a specific type of 't Hooft anomaly with other symmetries. In other cases, we investigate how $\gamma(\theta)$ depends on microscopic conditions (such as the filling factor) in field theory and exactly solvable lattice models.</description>

      <title>Long-Lived Circular Rydberg Qubits of Alkaline-Earth Atoms in Optical Tweezers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coherence time and gate fidelities in Rydberg atom quantum simulators and computers are fundamentally limited by the Rydberg state lifetime. Circular Rydberg states are highly promising candidates to overcome this limitation by orders of magnitude, as they can be effectively protected from decay due to their maximum angular momentum. We report the first realization of alkaline-earth circular Rydberg atoms trapped in optical tweezers, which provide unique and novel control possibilities due to the optically active ionic core. Specifically, we demonstrate creation of very high-$n$ ($n=79$) circular states of $^{88}$Sr. We measure lifetimes as long as 2.55 ms at room temperature, which are achieved via cavity-assisted suppression of black-body radiation. We show coherent control of a microwave qubit encoded in circular states of nearby manifolds, and characterize the qubit coherence time via Ramsey and spin-echo spectroscopy. Finally, circular state tweezer trapping exploiting the Sr$^+$ core polarizability is quantified via measurements of the trap-induced light shift on the qubit. Our work opens routes for quantum simulations with circular Rydberg states of divalent atoms, exploiting the emergent toolbox associated with the optically active core ion.</description>

      <title>Investigating finite-size effects in random matrices by counting resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Resonance counting is an intuitive and widely used tool in Random Matrix Theory and Anderson Localization. Its undoubted advantage is its simplicity: in principle, it is easily applicable to any random matrix ensemble. On the downside, the notion of resonance is ill-defined, and the `number of resonances' does not have a direct mapping to any commonly used physical observable like the participation entropy, the fractal dimensions, or the gap ratios (r-parameter), restricting the method's predictive power to the thermodynamic limit only where it can be used for locating the Anderson localization transition. In this work, we reevaluate the notion of resonances and relate it to measurable quantities, building a foundation for the future application of the method to finite-size systems.

      <title>Quantum particle localization observables on Cauchy surfaces of Minkowski spacetime and their causal properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13894v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study a general notion of spatial localization on spacelike smooth Cauchy surfaces of quantum systems in Minkowski spacetime. The notion is constructed in terms of a coherent family of normalized POVMs, one for each said Cauchy surface. We prove that a family of POVMs of this type automatically satisfies a causality condition which generalizes Castrigiano's one and implies it when restricting to flat spacelike Cauchy surfaces. As a consequence no conflict with Hegerfeldt's theorem arises. We furthermore prove that such families of POVMs do exist for massive Klein-Gordon particles, since some of them are extensions of already known spatial localization observables. These are constructed out of positive definite kernels or are defined in terms of the stress-energy tensor operator. Some further features of these structures are investigated, in particular, the relation with the triple of Newton-Wigner selfadjoint operators and a modified form of Heisenberg inequality in the rest $3$-spaces of Minkowski reference frames</description>

      <title>Electrically defined quantum dots for bosonic excitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum dots are semiconductor nano-structures where particle motion is confined in all three spatial dimensions. Since their first experimental realization, nanocrystals confining the quanta of polarization waves, termed excitons, have found numerous applications in fields ranging from single photon sources for quantum information processing to commercial displays. A major limitation to further extending the range of potential applications has been the large inhomogeneity in, and lack-of tunability of, exciton energy that is generic to quantum dot materials. Here, we address this challenge by demonstrating electrically-defined quantum dots for excitons in monolayer semiconductors where the discrete exciton energies can be tuned using applied gate voltages. Resonance fluorescence measurements show strong spectral jumps and blinking of these resonances, verifying their zero-dimensional nature. Our work paves the way for realizing quantum confined bosonic modes where nonlinear response would arise exclusively from exciton--exciton interactions.</description>

      <title>Ab initio simulation of single vibronic level fluorescence spectra of anthracene using Hagedorn wavepackets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single vibronic level (SVL) fluorescence spectroscopy contributes to the understanding of molecular vibrational structures and relaxation processes. Based on Hagedorn wavepackets, we have recently proposed a time-dependent approach to compute SVL spectra from arbitrary initial vibrational levels, i.e., higher excitations in multiple modes, and validated it against exact quantum calculations on model systems. Here, we extend the application of our method to a realistic molecular system, anthracene, employing a harmonic model constructed from ab initio electronic structure data. With the Hagedorn approach, we not only successfully reproduce the previously reported simulation results for singly excited $12^{1}$ and $\overline{11}^{1}$ levels, but are also able to compute SVL spectra from multiply excited levels in good agreement with experiments and from the same Hagedorn wavepacket trajectory without any additional propagation beyond what is required for ground-state emission spectra.</description>
