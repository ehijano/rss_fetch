      <title>Diffusion and Discrete Temporal Models of the Growth of Free-Ranging Cats in Urban Areas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The survival of the domestic cat (Felis catus) in various ecosystems has become increasingly relevant due to its impact on wildlife, public health, and society. In countries like Mexico, social factors such as abandonment have led to the feralization of the species and an unexpected increase in its population in urban areas. To design and implement effective population control methods, a thorough analysis of the species' population dynamics, along with the social factors influencing it, is necessary. We propose a reaction-diffusion model to simulate the natural dispersal of the population within a bounded domain. After exploring the species' spreading ability, we construct a complex dynamical system based on the biological characteristics of cats and their intraspecific and interspecific interactions, which we explain and study in detail. Both deterministic and stochastic parameters are considered to enhance the realism of the simulations. Our results indicate that the population reaches equilibrium, highlighting the need for control methods combined with social regulations to achieve sustainability in the system.</description>

      <title>Milestones at the Origin of Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Living organisms have some common structures, chemical reactions and molecular structures. The organisms consist of cells with cell division, they have homochirality of protein and carbohydrate units, and metabolism, and genetics, and they are mortal. The molecular structures and chemical reactions underlying these features are common from the simplest bacteria to human beings. The origin of life is evolutionary with the emergence of a network of spontaneous biochemical reactions, and the evolution has taken place over a very long time. The evolution contains, however some "landmarks" and bottlenecks, which in a revolutionary manner directed the evolution, and the article tries to establish the order of these events. The article advocates that a possible order in the emergence of life is that the first milestone in prebiotic evolution is at the emergence of homochirality in proteins. The homochirality of peptides is, however, with instability and racemization which causes aging of the peptides and mortality. The metabolism and genetics are established through homochiral enzymes in the Earth's crust for $\approx$ 4 Gyr ago. Finally, the cells with cell division are established in the Hot Springs environment at the interface between the crust and the Hadean Ocean.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Nowosi\'o{\l}ka skull with RMaCzek</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the first fully quantitative distance matrix visualization methods was proposed by Jan Czekanowski at the beginning of the previous century. Recently, a software package, RMaCzek, was made available that allows for producing such diagrams in R. Here we reanalyze the original data that Czekanowski used for introducing his method, and in the accompanying code show how the user can specify their own custom distance functions in the package.</description>
