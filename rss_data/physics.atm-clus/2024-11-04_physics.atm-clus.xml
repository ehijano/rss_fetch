      <title>Structural and Energetic Stability of the Lowest Equilibrium Structures of Water Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, the low-lying structures of 20 different-sized water clusters are extensively searched using the artificial bee colony algorithm with TIP4P classical force field. To obtain the lowest equilibrium geometries, we select the 10 lowest configurations for further minimization using density functional theory. The resulting structures are lower in energy than previously reported results. The structural and energetic stability of these clusters are studied using various descriptors such as binding energy, ionization potentials, fragmentation energy, first and second energy difference, vibrational and optical spectra. The energetic analysis shows that clusters with N = 4, 8, 12, 14, 16 and 19 are more stable. The analysis of fragmentation energies also supports these findings. Our calculations show that non-covalent interactions play a significant role in stabilizing the water clusters. The infrared spectra of water clusters display three distinct bands: intermolecular O...H vibrations, 23 to 1191 cm^-1, intramolecular H-O-H bending, 1600 to 1741 cm^-1, and O-H stretching, 3229 to 3877 cm^-1. The strongest intensity is observed in the low-frequency symmetric stretching modes, along with a noticeable red shift in the stretching vibrations. The optical band gap ranges from 7.14 eV to 8.17 eV and lies in the ultraviolet region. The absorption spectra also show line broadening for clusters with n&gt;=10, resulting in an increase in spectral lines. Interestingly, only the stable clusters exhibit maximum oscillator strength, with the first excitation in all cases corresponding to a \pi-to-\sigma* transition.</description>

      <title>Tuning electronic and optical properties of 2D polymeric C$_{60}$ by stacking two layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Benefiting from improved stability due to stronger interlayer van der Waals interactions, few-layer fullerene networks are experimentally more accessible compared to monolayer polymeric C$_{60}$. However, there is a lack of systematic theoretical studies on the material properties of few-layer C$_{60}$ networks. Here, we compare the structural, electronic and optical properties of bilayer and monolayer fullerene networks. The band gap and band-edge positions remain mostly unchanged after stacking two layers into a bilayer, enabling the bilayer to be almost as efficient a photocatalyst as the monolayer. The effective mass ratio along different directions is varied for conduction band states due to interlayer interactions,leading to enhanced anisotropy in carrier transport. Additionally, stronger exciton absorption is found in the bilayer than that in the monolayer over the entire visible light range, rendering the bilayer a more promising candidate for photovoltaics. Moreoever, the polarisation dependence of optical absorption in the bilayer is increased in the red-yellow light range, offering unique opportunities in photonics and display technologies with tailored optical properties over specific directions. Our study provides strategies to tune electronic and optical properties of 2D polymeric C$_{60}$ via the introduction of stacking degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Pair Approximating the Action For Molecular Rotations in Path Integral Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Typical path integral Monte Carlo approaches use the primitive approximation to compute the probability density for a given path. In this work, we develop the pair Discrete Variable Representation (pair-DVR) approach to study molecular rotations. The pair propagator, which was initially introduced to study superfluidity in condensed Helium, is naturally well-suited for systems interacting with a pair-wise potential. Consequently, paths sampled using the pair action tend to be closer to the exact paths (compared to primitive Trotter paths) for such systems leading to convergence with less imaginary time steps. Therefore, our approach relies on using the pair factorization approach in conjunction with a discretized Path Integral Ground State (PIGS) paradigm to study a chain of planar rotors interacting with a pair-wise dipole interaction. We first use the Wigner-Kirkwood density expansion to analyze the asymptotics of the pair propagator in imaginary time. Then, we exhibit the utility of the pair factorization scheme via convergence studies comparing the pair and primitive propagators. Finally, we compute energetic and structural properties of this system including the correlation function and Binder ratio as functions of the coupling strength to examine the behaviour of the pair-DVR method near criticality. Density Matrix Renormalization Group results are used for benchmarking throughout.</description>
