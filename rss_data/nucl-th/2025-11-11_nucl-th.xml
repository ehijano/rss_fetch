      <title>Search for shape-isomers in the Pt-Hg-Pb region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Potential energy surfaces of nine even-even isotopes of Pt, Hg, and Pb around $^{186}$Pt are evaluated within a macroscopic-microscopic model based on the Lublin-Strasbourg-Drop macroscopic energy and the microscopic energy obtained using the Yukawa-folded mean-field potential to establish the Strutinski shell corrections and the pairing correlation energy through the BCS approach with a monopole pairing force. The rapidly converging Fourier-over-Spheroid shape parametrization is used to describe nuclear deformations. The stability of the identified shape isomeric states with respect to non-axial and higher-order deformations is investigated. It is also found that in the description of non-axial deformations special attention needs to be devoted to the orientation of the triaxial shape. For the example of the $^{186}$Hg nucleus, where three prolate shape-isomeric states are found, it is shown that the potential energy surface obtained in our model is close to the one obtained in the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory with the Gogny energy-density functional.</description>

      <title>Microscopic study of low-lying states in odd-mass nuclei for atomic electric dipole moment searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a microscopic study of the low-lying states of five odd-mass nuclei of particular interest for experimental searches of atomic electric dipole moments (EDMs): $^{129}$Xe, $^{199}$Hg, $^{225}$Ra, $^{229}$Th, and $^{229}$Pa. The analysis is performed within the recently developed multi-reference covariant density functional theory (MR-CDFT), which incorporates symmetry restoration and configuration mixing based on self-consistent mean-field solutions. The calculated energy spectra and electromagnetic observables of these nuclei are reasonably well reproduced without introducing any parameters beyond those of the underlying universal relativistic energy density functional. The results demonstrate the reliability of MR-CDFT in describing the structure of these nuclei and in providing essential input on nuclear Schiff moments relevant to ongoing EDM searches.</description>

      <title>Universal modified function in conjunction with the short range correlation effect to extract the nuclear $xF_3^A$ structure function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parton distribution functions (PDFs) are comprehensive and not reliant on the process. They are affected by nuclear matter during nuclear scattering process. As a recent approach, in order to study the nuclear PDFs (nPDFs), the nucleon pair PDFs are utilized to describe parton distributions in the nucleon pair which are confined to a nucleus. Nucleon pair PDFs stem from nucleon-nucleon correlation which is called short range correlation (SRC) and are proportional to common nucleon PDFs. In this regard a modified universal function is constructed which provides a test for SRC in (neutrino)-nucleus scattering. In fact we can show that the modification of the structure function of nucleons bound in atomic nuclei (known as the EMC effect) are consistently accounted for within the frame work of a universal modification of nucleons in SRC pairs. In this article, based on the strategy which was introduced in Ref.\cite{nature}, we are investigating to find the universality behaviour for the ratio of nonsinglet $xF_3^A$ nuclear structure function. The numerical calculations performed within the CTEQ framework confirm the universality feature of the concerned ratio, as has been established for the ratio of the structure function $F^A_2$ in Ref. \cite{nature}. Following that we reformulate the $R_{EMC}$ nuclear weight function which relates the free and bound structure function in terms of modified universal function. It makes us a possibility to achieve $R_{EMC}$ and finally $xF_3^A$ nuclear structure function for each nucleus only by considering the specified feature of nucleus.The results are compared with the nuclear $xF_3$ structure function which are computing from bound PDFs, based on some parameterizations models. The findings, considering the SRC effect, demonstrating qualitative agreement with nCTEQ15 and EPPS21 parametrization models and also the available experimental data.</description>

      <title>Analysis of elastic $\alpha$-$^{12}$C scattering with machine learning in the cluster effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the elastic $\alpha$-$^{12}$C scattering including the contribution of resonance states below the $p$-$^{15}$N breakup threshold energy. We use the cluster effective field theory in which scattering amplitude is expanded in terms of the effective range expansion parameters for the angular momentum states from $l=0$ to $l=6$. The amplitude contains 37 parameters, which are determined by fitting to 11,392 differential cross section data points of the elastic $\alpha$-$^{12}$C scattering. To optimize the fitting process, we implement the Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm, which performs a global search over the high-dimensional parameter space and consistently converges to the same minimum $\chi^{2}$ value across independent runs, suggesting proximity to the global minimum within the explored domain. In parallel, the Markov chain Monte Carlo method is used to cross-check the DE results and to estimate the parameter uncertainties. The best fit yields $\chi^{2}/N\!\simeq\!6.2$ for the elastic scattering data. Using the determined 37 parameters, we calculate the differential cross sections and the phase shifts of the elastic $\alpha$-$^{12}$C scattering and compare the results with experimental data and those of an $R$-matrix analysis. Our result of the cross section agrees with the experimental data as accurately as an $R$-matrix analysis. The results demonstrate that the cluster effective field theory, combined with machine learning based optimization and uncertainty quantification, provides a reliable and systematic framework for application to low-energy phenomena relevant to stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <title>Jacobi Coordinates on Hyper-tori and Geometric Factors in the Volume Dependencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the volume dependence of bound states from a cluster-cluster picture with nucleon degrees of freedom. To achieve this, we demonstrate how to construct Jacobi coordinates on the lattice under the periodic boundary. A constant factor called ``Geometric factor'' appears in the generalization from point-like particles to clusters. We validate our derivation using many-body calculations, specifically, we find this factor to be essential in extracting asymptotic normalization constants from lattice calculations of \isotope[16]{O} ground state.</description>

      <title>Renormalization-Group Invariant Parity-Doublet Model for Nuclear and Neutron-Star Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Parity-Doublet Model (PDM) is a chirally invariant effective theory for strong-interaction matter involving nucleons and their opposite-parity partners in a parity-doubling framework. We introduce a multiplicatively renormalizable mean-field approach to include the baryonic vacuum contributions to the resulting grand-canonical potential in an explicitly renormalization-group invariant form. As an application, we evaluate the pertinent thermodynamics of two-flavor symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter, focusing on the restoration of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry at baryon densities and temperatures relevant for the astrophysics of neutron stars. Special attention is paid to the effect of the baryonic vacuum fluctuations on the evolution of chiral condensate with baryon density and temperature for specific choices of the chirally invariant baryon mass $m_0$ to demonstrate the importance of consistently including these vacuum fluctuations in the PDM.</description>

      <title>Accessing baryon-antibaryon generalized distribution amplitudes in $e^{\pm} \gamma \to e^{\pm} B \bar{B} $</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $\gamma^* \gamma \to B \bar{B}$ is the golden process to access chiral-even di-baryon generalized distribution amplitudes (GDAs) as deeply virtual Compton scattering has proven to be for the generalized parton distributions. In the framework of colinear QCD factorization where the leading twist amplitude is the convolution of GDAs and a perturbatively calculable coefficient function, we study the scattering amplitude for the baryonic channels where $B$ is a spin $1/2$ baryon such as the nucleon or hyperon $\Lambda, \Sigma$. Taking into account the interfering QED amplitude, we calculate the cross section of the $e^\pm \gamma \to e^\pm B \bar B$ process that can be experimentally studied in $e^- e^+$ as well as in electron-ion facilities. We explore both the final state polarization summed case and the polarization dependent effects. Numerical estimates are presented for $e^- \gamma \to e^- p \bar{p}$, using motivated models for GDAs. Our results show that a first extraction of baryon-antibaryon GDAs from experimental measurements is feasible at Belle II.</description>

      <title>Isotone Chain Study of $\bar{p}$-atom spectroscopy and Strong Spin-orbit splittings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antiprotonic atoms have served as a pivotal tool for investigating the properties of baryon-baryon interactions, including their spin dependence. Examining the spin-orbit splittings induced by their strong interactions also could help clarify the nature of the $\bar{p}$-nucleus interactions and their fraction mediated by scalar and vector mesons. Although the strong spin-orbit splittings for a certain nucleus have been observed experimentally, thorough theoretical investigations have not yet been conducted. In this study, theoretical calculations based on the Dirac equation are systematically performed for nuclei along several isotone ``chains''. As a result, it is found that the magnitude of the strong spin-orbit splittings exhibits a significant dependence not only on the corresponding level shifts and widths almost linearly, but also on whether the optical potential enters as a vector or scalar potential. A simple perturbative analysis indicates that the relativistic corrections have a dominant effect the magnitude of the splittings. These results are expected to provide deeper insights into $\bar{p}$-nucleus interactions, and by extension baryon-baryon interactions, as well as into the properties of the mesons that mediate them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cold and dense matter is expected to be in a color-superconducting state. Here we review two calculations, relevant for fundamental properties and applications of color superconductivity, respectively: the weak-coupling QCD calculation of the fermionic energy gap together with the magnetic screening masses of the gauge bosons, and the calculation of bulk viscosity from a non-leptonic electroweak process. These calculations are supplemented by a discussion of color superconductors with mismatched Fermi momenta, and they are embedded in the context of the state of the art by giving an overview of previous and ongoing work and future directions.</description>

      <title>Experimental review on the chiral magnetic effect in relativistic heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chiral magnetic effect (CME) refers to a predicted phenomena in quantum chromodynamics that manifests as a charge separation along an external magnetic field, driven by an imbalance of quark chirality. Searches for the CME has been carried out by azimuthal particle correlations in relativistic heavy ion collisions where such a chirality imbalance is anticipated and a strong magnetic field is created in the initial stage. No conclusive experimental evidence on the CME has been established so far because of large background contributions to azimuthal correlation observables. We review the status of the experimental search for the CME, covering the observables used, the techniques to mitigate backgrounds, and the strengths and limitations of various experimental approaches, and outline a future prospect of the CME search in high-energy nuclear collisions.</description>

Abstract: Unexpectedly large and puzzling spin alignment, and thus tensor polarization, of vector mesons has been observed in heavy-ion collisions. Given that tensor polarization represents a fluctuation of spin, we derive, for the first time, a fluctuation-dissipation relation for tensor polarization, where the polarization is proportional to first-order hydrodynamic gradients (e.g., the shear-stress tensor), with dissipative coefficients depending on the particle's damping properties, as characterized by its spectral function. Employing relativistic hydrodynamics at finite density, we find that dissipative contributions can generate substantial spin alignment. We provide illustrative examples (by tuning one coefficients $\alpha_{{\rm sh}}$) that generate a beam energy, $p_T$, and centrality dependence of spin alignment resembling those observed in experiments, offering insights into these puzzling phenomena and demonstrating its potential as a ``spectrometer" for in-medium vector mesons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We clarify how the weak-interaction-driven bulk viscosity $\zeta$ and the bulk relaxation time $\tau_\Pi$ of neutrino-transparent $npe$ matter depend on the nuclear symmetry energy. We show that, at saturation density, the equation-of-state dependence of these transport quantities is fully determined by the experimentally constrained nuclear symmetry energy $S$ and its slope $L$. Variations of $L$ can change the bulk viscosity by orders of magnitude, which can affect both the dissipative and the conservative tidal response of neutron stars. This suggests that both conservative and dissipative effects encoded in the gravitational-wave signatures of binary neutron star inspirals may help constrain nuclear symmetry energy properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The well-tested empirical two quasiparticle rotor model calculations are used to characterize low-lying isomers in the odd-odd nucleus $^{162}$Lu. Physically admissible 2qp bandheads are obtained to construct the low-energy level structure of the nucleus, assign spin-parity (J$^\pi$), orbital configuration, and level energies (E$_x$), for the gs and the two reported isomers. The spin-parity and orbital configuration of the 1.5 min isomer are confirmed to be J$^\pi$= 4$^-$\{$\pi$5/2$^+$[402$\uparrow$] $\otimes$ $\nu$3/2$^-$[521$\uparrow$]\}. Its level energy has been estimated to be E$_x$ $\thickapprox$ 62 keV. The 1.9 min isomer is characterized for the first time with J$^\pi$= 6$^+$\{$\pi$9/2$^-$[514$\uparrow$] $\otimes$ $\nu$3/2$^-$[521$\uparrow$]\} and energy E$_x$ $\thickapprox$ 157 keV. Based on these assignments, individual $\beta$-decay branches of gs and the two isomers to the daughter levels in $^{162}$Yb are proposed. The study is extended to neighboruing isotopes $^{164,166,168}$Lu. A short-lived isomer, tentatively proposed in a previous study of $^{164}$Lu, is identified as J$^\pi$= 6$^+$\{$\pi$7/2$^+$[404$\downarrow$] $\otimes$ $\nu$5/2$^+$[402$\uparrow$]\} with energy E$_x$ $\thickapprox$ 52 keV. The energy of the J$^\pi$=3$^+$ isomer in $^{168}$Lu, currently listed with large uncertainty, is deduced as E$_x$ $\thickapprox$ 100 keV significantly improving its value.</description>

      <title>Configuration mixing effects on neutrinoless $\beta\beta$-decay nuclear matrix elements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mixing and coexistence of intrinsic nuclear shapes play an important role to determine the low-energy structure of heavy nuclei, and are expected to affect nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) of neutrinoless double beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay. This problem is addressed in the interacting boson model with configuration mixing that is formulated by using the nuclear energy density functional theory. It is shown that significant amounts of mixing of normal and deformed intruder configurations are present in the ground and excited $0^+$ states in the even-even nuclei that are parent or daughter nuclei of the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay. An illustrative application to the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decays of $^{76}$Ge, $^{96}$Zr, $^{100}$Mo, $^{116}$Cd, and $^{150}$Nd shows that the inclusion of the configuration mixing reduces the NMEs for most of the $0^+_1$ $\to$ $0^+_1$ $0\nu\beta\beta$ decays.</description>

Abstract: Predictions of the proton directed flow ($v_1$) in semicentral Au+Au collisions in the energy range between 4.5 and 7.7 GeV are done. The calculations are performed within the model of three-fluid dynamics with crossover equation of state, which well reproduces the proton $v_1$ both below 4.5 GeV and above 7.7 GeV, as well as bulk observables in the energy range of interest. It is predicted that the proton flow evolves non-monotonously. At the energy of 7.2 GeV it exhibits antiflow (i.e. negative slope of $v_1(y)$) in the midrapidity. At 7.7 GeV, the flow returns to the normal pattern in accordance with the STAR data. The midrapidity $v_1$-slope excitation functions within the first-order phase and crossover transitions to quark-gluon phase (QGP) turn out to be qualitatively similar, but the amplitude of the wiggle in the crossover scenario is much smaller than that in the strong first-order phase transition. Therefore, the change of sign followed by minimum at 7.2 GeV in the $v_1$-slope excitation function indicates onset of (weak phase or crossover) transition to QGP. The second change of the sign around 10 GeV results from interplay between incomplete baryon stopping and transverse expansion of the system.</description>

      <title>Nucleon electric dipole form factor in QCD vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11856v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the QCD vacuum, the nucleon form factors receive contributions from the underlying ensemble of topological pseudoparticles, which are sensitive to a finite vacuum angle $\theta$. We use this observation to derive a novel relationship between the Pauli and electric dipole form factors, for light quark flavors. This relationship allows for an explicit derivation of the proton and neutron electric dipole moments induced by a small CP violating $\theta$ angle, in terms of the vacuum topological susceptibity times pertinent magnetic moments. The results compare well with some recent lattice estimates.</description>

      <title>Constraining the CME in AVFD-simulated heavy-ion collisions using the Sliding Dumbbell Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01195v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Anomalous Viscous Fluid Dynamics (AVFD) framework is utilized to generate $^{197}_{79}Au+^{197}_{79}Au$, $^{96}_{44}Ru+^{96}_{44}Ru$, and $^{96}_{40}Zr+^{96}_{40}Zr$ collision events at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV to investigate the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME). The CME signal is modulated through the axial charge per entropy density ($n_5/s$) in each event to produce data sets with varying CME signal strengths. Additionally, a 33$\%$ local charge conservation (LCC) is implemented in each event. These data sets are analyzed using CME-sensitive two- and three-particle correlators. Furthermore, the Sliding Dumbbell Method (SDM) is employed to identify potential CME-like events within each data set. The identified events selected using the SDM exhibit characteristics consistent with CME. The CME fraction in these events is quantified while accounting for background contributions.</description>

      <title>A Centrality-independent Framework for Revealing Genuine Higher-Order Cumulants in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel centrality definition-independent method for analyzing higher-order cumulants, specifically addressing the challenge of volume fluctuations that dominate in low-energy heavy-ion collisions. This method reconstructs particle number distributions using the Edgeworth expansion, with parameters optimized via a combination of differential evolution algorithm and Bayesian inference. Its effectiveness is validated using UrQMD model simulations and benchmarked against traditional approaches, including centrality definitions based on particle multiplicity. Our results show that the proposed framework yields cumulant patterns consistent with those obtained using number of participant nucleon ($N_{\text{part}}$) based centrality observables, while eliminating the conventional reliance on centrality determination. This consistency confirms the method's ability to extract genuine physical signals, thereby paving the way for probing the intrinsic thermodynamic properties of the produced medium through event-by-event fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Review of heat and charge transport in strongly magnetized relativistic plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review field-theoretic studies of charge transport in hot relativistic plasmas under strong magnetic fields and extend the analysis to thermal conductivity. The calculations rely on accurately determining the fermion damping rate. Using the Landau-level representation, these damping rates are computed exactly at leading order and incorporated into the Kubo formula to obtain the thermal and electrical conductivity tensors. Our analysis reveals that the mechanisms underlying longitudinal and transverse transport differ significantly. Strong magnetic fields markedly suppress transverse charge transport by confining particles within localized Landau orbits, allowing transport only through quantum transitions between these discrete states. In contrast, longitudinal charge transport is enhanced, as it primarily depends on the reduced scattering probability of particles moving along the direction of the magnetic field. The anisotropy of thermal conductivity is also nontrivial but less pronounced since its underlying transport mechanism is different. We also examine the modification of the Wiedemann--Franz law in strongly magnetized plasmas.</description>

      <title>Chiral symmetry breaking and pion condensation in the early universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine the possible trajectories the universe may have followed in the QCD phase diagram during the QCD epoch. We focus on the roles of chiral symmetry breaking and pion condensation under high imbalances in lepton asymmetry. Adopting the quark-meson model as an effective description of QCD at finite temperature, charge and baryon chemical potentials we show that, for sufficiently large but physically motivated asymmetries, the universe may have entered the pion condensation phase through a first-order phase transition, followed by a second-order phase transition when exiting it. Such a first-order phase transition represents a new possible source of primordial gravitational waves during the QCD epoch.</description>
