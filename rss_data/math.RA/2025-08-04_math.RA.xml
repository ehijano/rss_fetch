      <title>A logical implication between two conjectures on matrix permanents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a logical implication between two old conjectures stated by Bapat and Sunder about the permanent of positive semidefinite matrices. Although Drury has recently disproved both conjectures, this logical implication yields a non-trivial link between two seemingly unrelated conditions that a positive semidefinite matrix may fulfill. As a corollary, the classes of matrices that are known to obey the first conjecture are then immediately proven to obey the second one. Conversely, we uncover new counterexamples to the first conjecture by exhibiting a previously unknown type of counterexamples to the second conjecture.</description>

      <title>Cocharacters of generalized polynomial identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we extend the cocharacter theory to generalized identities of $W$-algebras. We prove that the Hilbert series of the relatively free $W$-algebra admits an expansion in terms of Schur functions whose coefficients coincide with generalized cocharacter multiplicities. Moreover, we prove analogues of the Hook and Strip theorems for $W$-algebras and we derive growth bounds for generalized codimension and colenght sequences. Finally, we establish that every variety $\mathcal{V}$ of $W$-algebras is generated by the Grassmann envelope of a finitely generated $W$-superalgebra, and if $\mathcal{V}$ satisfies a generalized Capelli set, then it is generated by a finitely generated $W$-algebra.</description>

      <title>Zeroing Diagonals, Conjugate Hollowization, and Characterizing Nondefinite Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the conjecture by Damm and Fassbender that, for any pair $L,M$ of real traceless matrices, there exists an orthogonal $V$ such that $V^{-1} L \, V$ is hollow and $V M V^{-1}$ is almost hollow, where a matrix is hollow if and only if its main diagonal consists only of 0s, and a traceless matrix is almost hollow if and only if all its main diagonal elements are 0 except, at most, the last two.
  The claim is a corollary to our considerably more general theorem, as well as another corollary, revealing conditions on $L,M$ under which 0s can be introduced by $V$ to all but the first or first two diagonal elements of $V^{-1} L \, V$ and to all but the last two diagonal elements of $V M V^{-1}$.
  By setting $L = M$, much is revealed concerning freedom and constraint involved in introducing 0s to the diagonal of a single operator. From this we prove novel characterizations of real traceless matrices, and a stronger version of the seminal theorem by Fillmore that every real matrix is orthogonally similar to a matrix with a constant main diagonal.
  Our results are contextualized in a characterization and classification of nondefinite matrices by, roughly, how many zeros can be introduced to their diagonals, and it what ways.</description>

      <title>Pseudotraces on Almost Unital and Finite-Dimensional Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of almost unital and finite-dimensional (AUF) algebras, which are associative $\mathbb C$-algebras that may be non-unital or infinite-dimensional, but have sufficiently many idempotents. We show that the pseudotrace construction, originally introduced by Hattori and Stallings for unital finite-dimensional algebras, can be generalized to AUF algebras.
  Let $A$ be an AUF algebra. Suppose that $G$ is a projective generator in the category $\mathrm{Coh}_{\mathrm{L}}(A)$ of finitely generated left $A$-modules that are quotients of free left $A$-modules, and let $B = \mathrm{End}_{A,-}(G)^{\mathrm{opp}}$. We prove that the pseudotrace construction yields an isomorphism between the spaces of symmetric linear functionals $\mathrm{SLF}(A)\xrightarrow{\simeq} \mathrm{SLF}(B)$, and that the non-degeneracies on the two sides are equivalent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce algebraic families of Dirac operators for the deformation family (and other related families) associated with a real reductive Lie group that interpolates the reductive group and the corresponding Cartan motion group. We prove Vogan's conjecture in this setting, relating the infinitesimal character of an algebraic family of Harish-Chandra modules and its Dirac cohomology.</description>

      <title>Biproduct Quasi-Hopf Algebras of Rank 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the work of Radford, for $H$ an arbitrary quasi-Hopf algebra we describe all the Hopf algebras of dimension $2$ within the braided category of left Yetter-Drinfeld modules over $H$ and determine the biproduct quasi-Hopf algebras defined by them. Classes of such biproduct quasi-Hopf algebras are obtained by taking $H$ as the Hopf algebra of functions on a group $G$, endowed with the quasi-Hopf algebra structure provided by a non-trivial $3$-cocycle on $G$ (especially when $G$ is a finite cyclic group or the double dihedral group), or as being a quasi-Hopf algebra with radical of codimension two. In this way we uncover new classes of basic quasi-Hopf algebras of even dimension, as well as new classes of tensor categories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a topological characterization of quivers whose path algebra satisfies a polynomial identity. This class includes the oriented cycle and acyclic quivers and, in the latter case, we describe the associated T-ideal. We introduce a generalization of Arnold's A-graded algebras, which we call locally A-graded algebras, and prove that they are also PI. We give an example of a quiver algebra satisfying a polynomial identity, even if the path algebra of the quiver does not.</description>

      <title>Locally finitely presented Grothendieck categories with a flat generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A problem raised by Cuadra and Simson in 2007 asks whether a locally finitely presented Grothendieck category with enough flat objects has enough projective objects. We prove that the categories involved in the statement are precisely the locally finitely presented Grothendieck categories with exact product functors. This enables reformulations of the problem that answer the latter in the negative and prove that it is related to a classical problem posed by Miller in 1975 and to the Telescope Conjecture for compactly generated triangulated categories. Our partial affirmative answers imply that any locally finitely presented Grothendieck category whose subcategory of finitely presented objects is Krull--Schmidt has enough flat objects if, and only if, it has a set of finitely generated projective generators.</description>

      <title>Additive subgroups of a module that are saturated with respect to a subset of the ring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11575v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $T$ be a subset of a ring $A$, and let $M$ be an $A$-module. We study the additive subgroups $F$ of $M$ such that, for all $x \in M$, if $tx \in F$ for some $t \in T$, then $x \in F$. We call any such subset $F$ of $M$ a $T$-factroid of $M$, which is a kind of dual to the notion of a $T$-submodule of $M$. We connect the notion with the zero-divisors on $M$, various classes of primary and prime ideals of $A$, Euclidean domains, and the recent concepts of unit-additive commutative rings and of Egyptian fractions with respect to a multiplicative subset of a commutative ring. We also introduce a common generalization of local rings and unit-additive rings, called *sublocalizable* rings, and relate them to $T$-factroids.</description>

      <title>Rational Motions of Minimal Quaternionic Degree with Prescribed Plane Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02330v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the construction of rational motions of a minimal quaternionic degree that generate a prescribed plane trajectory (a ``rational torse''). Using the algebraic framework of dual quaternions, we formulate the problem as a system of polynomial equations. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of such motions, establish a method to compute solutions and characterize solutions of minimal degree. Our findings reveal that a rational torse is realizable as a trajectory of a rational motion if and only if its Gauss map is rational. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the minimal degree of a motion polynomial is geometrically related to a drop of degree of the Gauss and algebraically determined by the structure of the torse's associated plane polynomial and the real greatest common divisor of its vector part. The developed theoretical framework has potential applications in robotics, computer-aided design, and computational kinematic, offering a systematic approach to constructing rational motions of small algebraic complexity.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notions of Hopf group braces, post-Hopf group algebras and Rota-Baxter Hopf group algebras as important generalizations of Hopf brace, post Hopf algebra and Rota-Baxter Hopf algebras respectively. We also discuss their relationships. Explicitly under the condition of cocomutativity, Hopf group braces, post-Hopf group algebras could be mutually obtained, and Rota-Baxter Hopf group algebras could lead to Hopf group braces.</description>

      <title>Perron similarities and the nonnegative inverse eigenvalue problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07682v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The longstanding nonnegative inverse eigenvalue problem (NIEP) is to determine which multisets of complex numbers occur as the spectrum of an entry-wise nonnegative matrix. Although there are some well-known necessary conditions, a solution to the NIEP is far from known. An invertible matrix is called a Perron similarity if it diagonalizes an irreducible, nonnegative matrix. Johnson and Paparella developed the theory of real Perron similarities. Here, we fully develop the theory of complex Perron similarities. Each Perron similarity gives a nontrivial polyhedral cone and polytope of realizable spectra (thought of as vectors in complex Euclidean space). The extremals of these convex sets are finite in number, and their determination for each Perron similarity would solve the diagonalizable NIEP, a major portion of the entire problem. By considering Perron similarities of certain realizing matrices of Type I Karpelevich arcs, large portions of realizable spectra are generated for a given positive integer. This is demonstrated by producing a nearly complete geometrical representation of the spectra of $4 \times 4$ stochastic matrices. Similar to the Karpelevich region, it is shown that the subset of complex Euclidean space comprising the spectra of stochastic matrices is compact and star-shaped. Extremal elements of the set are defined and shown to be on the boundary. It is shown that the polyhedral cone and convex polytope of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrix corresponds to the conical hull and convex hull of its rows, respectively. Similar results are established for multifold Kronecker products of DFT matrices and multifold Kronecker products of DFT matrices and Walsh matrices. These polytopes are of great significance with respect to the NIEP because they are extremal in the region comprising the spectra of stochastic matrices.</description>
