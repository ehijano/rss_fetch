      <title>Characterization of spurious-electron signals in the double-phase argon TPC of the DarkSide-50 experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spurious-electron signals in dual-phase noble-liquid time projection chambers have been observed in both xenon and argon Time Projection Chambers (TPCs). This paper presents the first comprehensive study of spurious electrons in argon, using data collected by the DarkSide-50 experiment at the INFN Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS). Understanding these events is a key factor in improving the sensitivity of low-mass dark matter searches exploiting ionization signals in dual-phase noble liquid TPCs.
  We find that a significant fraction of spurious-electron events, ranging from 30 to 70% across the experiment's lifetime, are caused by electrons captured from impurities and later released with delays of order 5-50 ms. The rate of spurious-electron events is found to correlate with the operational condition of the purification system and the total event rate in the detector. Finally, we present evidence that multi-electron spurious electron events may originate from photo-ionization of the steel grid used to define the electric fields. These observations indicate the possibility of reduction of the background in future experiments and hint at possible spurious electron production mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Preliminary design and simulation for CEPC fast luminosity monitor detector based on 4H-SiC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Circular Electron-Positron Collider (CEPC), a next-generation high-luminosity collider, employs a crab waist scheme to achieve ultrahigh $5 \times 10^{34} \, \text{cm}^{-2}\text{s}^{-1}$ luminosity at Higgs mode. Owing to the extremely small beam size, the luminosity is highly sensitive to the stability of final focusing elements, where mechanical vibrations (e.g. ground motion) may induce beam offsets and luminosity degradation. To address this, a luminosity-driven dithering system is implemented for horizontal beam stabilization. In this work, we develop an optimized 4H-SiC fast luminosity detector scheme using an array of radiation detectors with picosecond time resolution positioned at critical locations. By using self-development software RAdiation SEmiconductoR (RASER), we optimize the active area of the detector to achieve 2\% relative precision at 1~kHz. Furthermore, the Total Sample Current (TSC) exhibits a near-linear correlation with luminosity attenuation, enabling real-time luminosity monitoring.</description>

      <title>Probing Cosmic Ray Composition and Muon-philic Dark Matter via Muon Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a novel cosmic-ray scattering experiment employing a Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC) muon tomography system. By introducing the scattering angle between incident and outgoing cosmic-ray tracks as a key observable, this approach enables simultaneous studies of secondary cosmic-ray composition and searching for new physics. During a 63-day campaign, 1.18 million cosmic ray scattering events were recorded and analyzed. By performing combined template fits to the observed angular distribution, particle abundances are measured, for example, resolving the electron component at $\sim 2\%$ precision. Furthermore, constraints are established on elastic muon-dark matter (DM) scattering cross-sections for muon-philic dark matter. At the 95\% confidence level, the limit reaches 1.62 $\times$ $10^{-17}$ $\rm{cm}^{2}$ for 1 GeV slow DM, demonstrating sensitivity limit to light muon-coupled slow DM.</description>

      <title>Production of Jets at STAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jets serve as an important tool to probe QCD both in the vacuum and in the hot and dense medium. The STAR experiment at RHIC plays a key role in studying QCD phenomena across different collision systems ($p$+$p$, $p$+A, A+A), offering access to a kinematic regime that complements that of the LHC. Building on recent jet and event activity studies at STAR, we present recent measurements on charged-particle jets at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}~=~200$ GeV. In $p$+Au collisions, we explore event activity (EA) measured in the Au-going direction and its correlation with particle production at mid-rapidity. While soft particle production increases with EA, high-$p_{\mathrm{T}}$ jets are found to be inversely related to EA. Ratios of $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ imbalance and azimuthal dijet separation between high- and low-EA events show no significant differences, suggesting no strong evidence of jet quenching in high-EA $p$+Au collisions. In Au+Au collisions, we report semi-inclusive measurements of jets recoiling from $\gamma$ and $\pi^0$ triggers, using mixed-event techniques to subtract background and study jet suppression, intra-jet broadening, and acoplanarity. Additionally, we present inclusive charged-particle jet spectra corrected for background fluctuations, extending the kinematic reach of previous measurements. These results provide crucial insight into the modification of jets in the medium and contribute to a deeper understanding of QCD in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Review on recent results of J/$\psi$ production at STAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying the production of J/$\psi$ (bound state of charm and anti-charm quark) in proton-proton collisions gives an opportunity to test quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculations, as the production of J/$\psi$ involves both perturbative and non-perturbative processes. However, theoretical calculations are still unable to fully and simultaneously explain experimental results, such as polarization and $p_\text{T}$ spectra measured in different kinematic regimes and colliding energies. More studies are needed to investigate J/$\psi$ production mechanism. In heavy-ion collisions, charmonia can be used to study the properties of the medium as they are expected to dissociate in the medium when the Debye radius, inversely proportional to the medium temperature, becomes smaller than their size. Other competing effects, such as recombination, have also been found to modify the observed J/$\psi$ yield in heavy-ion collisions. We review recent measurements of the J/$\psi$ production in proton-proton and heavy-ion collisions at various collision energies measured with the STAR experiment at RHIC. The data are compared with recent model calculations on charmonia production.</description>

      <title>Latest neutrino results from the FASER experiment and their implications for forward hadron production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The muon puzzle -- an excess of muons relative to simulation predictions in ultra-high-energy cosmic-ray air showers -- has been reported by many experiments. This suggests that forward particle production in hadronic interactions is not fully understood. Some of the scenarios proposed to resolve this predict reduced production of forward neutral pions and enhanced production of forward kaons (or other particles). The FASER experiment at the LHC is located 480 m downstream of the ATLAS interaction point and is sensitive to neutrinos and muons, which are the decay products of forward charged pions and kaons. In this study, the latest measurements of electron and muon neutrino fluxes are presented using the data corresponding to 9.5 $\mathrm{fb^{-1}}$ and 65.6 $\mathrm{fb^{-1}}$ of proton-proton collisions with $\sqrt{s}=13.6~\mathrm{TeV}$ by the FASER$\nu$ and the FASER electronic detector, respectively. These fluxes are compared with predictions from recent hadronic interaction models, including EPOS-LHCr, SIBYLL 2.3e, and QGSJET 3. The predictions are generally consistent with the measured fluxes from FASER, although some discrepancies appear in certain energy bins. More precise flux measurements with additional data will follow soon, enabling validation of pion, kaon, and charm meson production with finer energy binning, reduced uncertainties, and multi-differential analyses.</description>

      <title>Jet substructure measurements elucidating partonic evolution in $p$+$p$ collisions at RHIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jets are multiscale objects that connect partons to hadrons, making jet substructure measurements crucial for probing both perturbative and non-perturbative processes in QCD. At STAR, a variety of jet substructure observables, such as SoftDrop groomed splittings and N-Point Energy Correlators (ENC), provide insights into parton evolution and hadronization mechanisms. SoftDrop-groomed observables and ENCs both connect measurement to fundamental QCD at the parton level, allowing for comparisons to first-principles theoretical calculations. Additionally, by also including charge information, as in the charge-weighted ENC, details about the hadronization mechanism can be obtained. In these proceedings, we present preliminary results on measurements of SoftDrop observables and ENCs across different jet momenta and radii in $p$+$p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$~=~200~GeV using STAR data.</description>

      <title>Search for $t\bar tt\bar tW$ Production at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV Using a Modified Graph Neural Network at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simultaneous production of four top quarks in association with a ($W$) boson at $(\sqrt{s} = 13)$ TeV is an rare SM process with a next-to-leading-order (NLO) cross-section of $(6.6^{+2.4}_{-2.6} {ab})$\cite{saiel}. Identifying this process in the fully hadronic decay channel is particularly challenging due to overwhelming backgrounds from $t\bar{t}, t\bar{t}W, t\bar{t}Z$, and triple-top production processes. This study introduces a modified physics informed Neural Network, a hybrid graph neural network (GNN) enhancing event classification. The proposed model integrates Graph layers for particle-level features, a custom Multi Layer Perceptron(MLP) based global stream with a quantum circuit and cross-attention fusion to combine local and global representations. Physics-informed Loss function enforce jet multiplicity constraints, derived from event decay dynamics. Benchmarked against conventional methods, the GNN achieves a signal significance $(S/\sqrt{S+B})$ of $0.174$ and ROC-AUC of 0.974, surpassing BDT's significance of $0.148$ and ROC of $0.913$, while Xgboost achieves a significance of $0.149$ and ROC of $0.920$. The classification models are trained on Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, with events normalized using cross-section-based reweighting to reflect their expected contributions in a dataset corresponding to $350\;$fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity. This enhanced approach offers a framework for precision event selection at the LHC, leveraging high dimensional statistical learning and physics informed inference to tackle fundamental HEP challenges, aligning with ML developments.</description>

      <title>Heavy flavored hydrogen molecule systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study provides a comprehensive analysis of $S$-wave exotic hydrogen-like three-body systems ($pp\mu^-$, $pp\tau^-$, $\mu^-\mu^-p$, $\tau^-\tau^-p$, $p\mu^-\tau^-$) with spin-parity $J^P = 1/2^+$ and $3/2^+$, and four-body systems ($pp\mu^-\mu^-$, $pp\tau^-\tau^-$) with $J^P = 0^+$, $1^+$, and $2^+$. We use complex scaling and Gaussian expansion methods to solve the complex-scaled Schr\"{o}dinger equation and obtain possible bound and quasi-bound states. The resulting binding energies range from $-33.8$~keV to $-340$~eV. Notably, we present the first theoretical estimation of the bound-state energy levels of $pp\mu^-\mu^-$ and $pp\tau^-\tau^-$, which is of significant importance for understanding exotic few-body Coulomb systems. We further analyze spin configurations and root-mean-square radii to elucidate the spatial structure of these bound and quasi-bound states. Our results reveal that $K$-type spatial configurations play a crucial role in accurately describing bound and quasi-bound states in the hydrogen-molecule-like systems $pp\mu^-\mu^-$ and $pp\tau^-\tau^-$. Incorporating $K$-type configurations significantly alters the mass spectra of these states. Future muon colliders and muon facilities may offer promising platforms for the possible copious production of such heavy flavored hydrogen molecules and molecular ions. For instance, scattering processes such as $2\mu^- + \mathrm{H_2} \to \mathrm{H_{2\mu}} + 2e^-$, $\mu^- + \mathrm{H_2} \to \mathrm{H_{\mu e}} + e^-$, and $\mu^- + \mathrm{H_2^+} \to \mathrm{H_{2\mu}^+} + e^-$ could be utilized, facilitating detailed studies of intriguing states such as $\mathrm{H_{2\mu}}$, $\mathrm{H_{\mu e}}$, and $\mathrm{H_{2\mu}^+}$.</description>

      <title>Hidden Sector Custodial Naturalness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Custodial Naturalness is a recently introduced idea that combines conformal and scalar-sector custodial symmetry to address the electroweak (EW) scale hierarchy problem of the Standard Model (SM). We introduce a new model that realizes Custodial Naturalness without extension of the SM gauge group. The number of new dynamical degrees of freedom is minimized and the custodial symmetry is reduced to $\mathrm{SO}(5)$. This requires a new scalar singlet field that automatically is a good Dark Matter (DM) candidate, produced via freeze-in with moderate couplings. The most minimal scenario allows the quantum critical generation of the EW scale in a phenomenologically viable way requiring a UV completion at around $10^{11}\,\mathrm{GeV}$. Including ingredients for neutrino mass generation can push this scale to $M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$.</description>

      <title>Investigating Energy-Dependent Anisotropy in Cosmic Rays with IceTop Surface Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents preliminary results from the analysis of cosmic-ray anisotropy using air showers detected by the IceTop surface array between 2011 and 2022. With improved statistical precision and updated Monte Carlo simulation events compared to previous IceTop reports, we investigate anisotropy patterns across four energy ranges spanning from 300 TeV to 6.9 PeV. This work extends the measurement of cosmic-ray anisotropy in the southern hemisphere to higher energies than previously achieved with IceTop. Our results provide a foundation for exploring potential connections between the observed anisotropy, the energy spectrum, and the mass composition of the cosmic-ray flux.</description>

      <title>Studying Two-Photon Exchange in Deep Inelastic Scattering with the HERA Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-photon exchange (TPE) is one of the leading explanations for discrepancies in measurements of the proton electromagnetic form factors. It has been proposed that TPE could impact not only elastic scattering, but also the cross sections for both inclusive deep inelastic scattering (DIS) and semi-inclusive DIS, thereby affecting the interpretation of DIS structure functions in terms of parton distributions. It is expected that higher-order QED effects such as TPE should manifest as a deviation from unity in the ratio of \epp and \emp DIS cross sections. We use the existing inclusive $e^{\pm}p$ DIS data from HERA and SLAC to constrain higher-order QED effects on inclusive DIS.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based inference for Precision Neutrino Physics through Neural Monte Carlo tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise modeling of detector energy response is crucial for next-generation neutrino experiments which present computational challenges due to lack of analytical likelihoods. We propose a solution using neural likelihood estimation within the simulation-based inference framework. We develop two complementary neural density estimators that model likelihoods of calibration data: conditional normalizing flows and a transformer-based regressor. We adopt JUNO - a large neutrino experiment - as a case study. The energy response of JUNO depends on several parameters, all of which should be tuned, given their non-linear behavior and strong correlations in the calibration data. To this end, we integrate the modeled likelihoods with Bayesian nested sampling for parameter inference, achieving uncertainties limited only by statistics with near-zero systematic biases. The normalizing flows model enables unbinned likelihood analysis, while the transformer provides an efficient binned alternative. By providing both options, our framework offers flexibility to choose the most appropriate method for specific needs. Finally, our approach establishes a template for similar applications across experimental neutrino and broader particle physics.</description>

      <title>Investigating jet induced identified hadron productions from the relative transverse activity classifier in pp collision at LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically investigate the jet associated identified hadron productions of pions, kaons, and protons based on the event topological separation method in proton proton (pp) collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV employing the AMPT model with PYTHIA8 initial conditions. Enabling relative transverse event activity classifier $R_T$, we analyze the transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectra and particle ratios in the jet aligned toward region and the underlying event (UE) contributions sensitive transverse region varying with $R_T$. The results indicate that the AMPT model, incorporating both partonic and hadronic final-state interactions, provides a satisfactory description to the experimental data of the $p_T$ differential yields, particle ratios and average transverse momentum of identified particles in both the toward and transverse regions across different event activity classes. By subtracting the UE contribution from the toward region using the transverse region hadron yield, we introduce the in-jet hadron productions to analyze the modifications to jet itself. We find that the in-jet baryon to meson ratios reveal a sensitive dependence on $R_T$ driven by final state interactions, leading to a unique crossing pattern at intermediate $p_T$. This behavior can be regarded as a novel signature for probing jet medium interactions and energy loss effects in small collision systems.</description>

      <title>Kilo-scale point-source inference using Parametric Cataloging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The estimation of the number of point-sources in the sky is one the oldest problems in astronomy, yet an easy and efficient method for estimating the uncertainty on these counts is still an open problem. Probabilistic cataloging solves the general point-source inference problem, but the trans-dimensional nature of the inference method requires a bespoke approach that is difficult to scale. Here it is shown that probabilistic cataloging can be performed in a fixed-dimensional framework called Parametric Cataloging under mild assumptions on some of the priors. The method requires only a simple reparameterization of the flux coordinates, yielding an accessible method that can be implemented in most probabilistic programming environments. As the parameter space is fixed-dimensional, off the shelf gradient based samplers can be employed which allows the method to scale to tens of thousands of sources.</description>

      <title>Revealing chiral-odd two-meson generalized distribution amplitudes in $e^- e^+ \to (\pi \pi) (\pi \pi)$ reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that chiral-odd dimeson generalized distribution amplitudes (CO-GDAs)-nonperturbative objects encoding the transition of a quark-antiquark pair into two mesons-can be accessed in high-energy $e^- e^+$ annihilation into two meson pairs, each with a relatively low invariant mass. While chiral-even GDAs contribute to the leading one-photon amplitude, the chiral-odd sector enters via two-photon exchange. We show that the interference between these amplitudes leads to measurable effects at BES III or future tau-charm factories. This work opens a direct path to experimentally probing the long-missing chiral-odd sector of meson structure-specifically, the anomalous tensorial magnetic moment of spin-zero mesons such as the pion.</description>

      <title>Quantum-enhanced dark matter detection using Schr\"odinger cat states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum metrology enables sensitive dark matter detection, particularly using nonclassical states, such as Schr\"odinger cat states featuring sub-Planck interference structures in microwave cavities. Here, we report the first experimental application of four-component Schr\"odinger cat states within a high-quality superconducting microwave cavity to detect dark photons, a potential dark matter candidate. We demonstrate an 8.1-fold enhancement in the signal photon rate and constrain the dark photon kinetic mixing angle to an unprecedented $\epsilon &lt; 7.32 \times 10^{-16}$ near 6.44~GHz (26.6~$\mu$eV). By employing a parametric sideband drive to actively tune the cavity frequency, we achieve dark photon searches and background subtraction across multiple frequency bins, yielding a sensitivity at the $10^{-16}$ level within a 100~kHz bandwidth. Our Schr\"odinger's cat-assisted detection (SCaD) scheme demonstrates a substantial improvement over previous results, promising potential implications in quantum-enhanced searches for new physics.</description>

Abstract: Using the most recent experimental data and lattice QCD calculations of $\pi\pi$ scattering lengths, while employing dispersive representations of the amplitude based on Roy equations, we compute the subthreshold parameters of this process. We use Monte Carlo sampling to numerically model the probability distribution of the results based on all uncertainties in the inputs. We also investigate the dependence of the results on a theoretical correlation between the $\pi\pi$ scattering lengths $a^0_0$ and $a^2_0$, which was previously established in the framework of two-flavour chiral perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Branching ratios and CP asymmetries of $B^0 \to \eta_c f_0$ in the improved perturbative QCD formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the idea of fragmented scalar glueball, we investigate the decays $B^0 \to \eta_c f_0$ within the improved perturbative QCD (iPQCD) framework by including the known next-to-leading order corrections. Here, $B^0$ and $f_0$ denote the neutral $B_{d,s}^0$ mesons and the light scalar mesons $f_0(500, 980, 1370, 1500)$ under the $q\bar q$ assignment. The {\it CP}-averaged branching ratios (BRs) and the {\it CP} asymmetries of $B^0 \to \eta_c f_0$ are evaluated with the $f_0(500)[f_0(1370)]-f_0(980)[f_0(1500)]$ mixing in quark-flavor basis. For effective comparisons with the near-future measurements, we further derive the $B^0 \to \eta_c f_0 (\to \pi^+ \pi^-/K^+ K^-)$ BRs under the narrow-width approximation. ${\rm BR}(B_s^0 \to \eta_c f_0(980) (\to \pi^+ \pi^-))= (2.87^{+1.38}_{-1.29}) \times 10^{-4}$ obtained in the iPQCD formalism agrees with the available measurements and predictions within uncertainties. Large BRs of $B_s^0 \to \eta_c f_0(1500) (\to \pi^+ \pi^-/K^+ K^-)$ and large direct {\it CP} asymmetries of $B^0 \to \eta_c f_0(1370, 1500)$ are accessible in the LHCb and Belle-II experiments. The experimental tests of these iPQCD predictions would help us to understand the nature of these light scalars more deeply and provide evidences to decipher $f_0(1500)$ as a primary or fragmented scalar glueball potentially.</description>

      <title>Fast prediction of the hydrodynamic QGP evolution in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions using Fourier Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research in machine learning has employed neural networks to learn mappings between function spaces on bounded domains termed ``neural operators''. As such, these operators can provide alternatives to standard numerical methods for partial differential equation (PDE) solutions. In particular, the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) has been shown to map solutions for classical fluid flow problems with accuracy competitive with traditional PDE solvers and with much greater computing speed. This paper explores the first application of FNOs to model ultra-relativistic hydrodynamic flow of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) generated in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The application in ultra-relativistic flow is novel relative to classical flow, due to the hydrodynamic evolution of the QGP occurring in femtometer-scaled explosions characterized by rapid expansion cooling. In this study we investigate the applicability of FNOs as computationally fast alternatives to standard numerical PDE solvers. The FNO predictions are evaluated by comparing to standard PDE solutions, using \MUSIC in the \JETSCAPE Monte Carlo event generator framework. The performance of calculating established experimental observables for flow and jet quenching using FNOs in the MC framework are also reported.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effect of the QCD scale anomaly on the internal pressure distribution of hadrons is studied based on the trace-traceless decomposition of the energy-momentum tensor. Using recent model-independent results of gravitational form factors as input, the pressure distributions of both pions and nucleons are analyzed in the instant form and the light-front form. It is found that, in all cases, the scale anomaly dominantly generates the confining pressure. This result suggests that the phenomenon is a universal feature, independent of models, types of hadrons, and the choice of form.</description>

      <title>Studying charm hadronisation into baryons with azimuthal correlations of $\Lambda_{\rm c}^{+}$ with charged particles in pp collisions at $\mathbf{\sqrt{\it s} = 13}$ TeV</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The distribution of angular correlations between prompt charm hadrons and primary charged particles in pp collisions is sensitive to the charm-quark hadronisation process. In this letter, charm-baryon correlations are measured for the first time by studying the azimuthal-angle difference between charged particles and prompt $\Lambda_{\rm c}^{+}$ baryons produced in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV, with the ALICE detector. $\Lambda_{\rm c}^{+}$ baryons are reconstructed at midrapidity ($|y| &lt; 0.5$) in the transverse-momentum interval $3 &lt; p_{\rm T} &lt; 16$ GeV/$c$, and correlated with charged particles with $p_{\rm T} &gt; 0.3$ GeV/$c$ and pseudorapidity $|\eta| &lt; 0.8$. For $3&lt; p_{\rm T}^{\Lambda_{\rm c}^{+},{\rm D}} &lt;5$ GeV/$c$, the comparison with published measurements of D-meson and charged-particle correlations in the same collision system hints at a larger number of low-momentum particles associated with $\Lambda_{\rm c}^{+}$-baryon triggers than with D-meson triggers, both in the collinear and opposite directions with respect to the trigger particle. These differences can be quantified by the comparison of the properties of the near- and away-side correlation peaks, and are not reproduced by predictions of various Monte Carlo event generators, generally underpredicting the associated particle yields at $p_{\rm T}^{\rm assoc}&lt;1$ GeV/$c$. This tension between $\Lambda_{\rm c}^{+}$-baryon and D-meson associated peak yields could suggest a modified fragmentation of the charm quark, or a different hadronisation process, when a charm baryon is produced in the final state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05206v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrinos are elementary particles that interact only very weakly with matter. Neutrino experiments are, therefore, usually big, with masses in the multi-tonne range. The thresholdless interaction of coherent elastic scattering of neutrinos on atomic nuclei leads to greatly enhanced interaction rates, which allows for much smaller detectors. The study of this process gives insights into physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. The CONUS+ experiment was designed to first detect elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering in the fully coherent regime with low-energy neutrinos produced in nuclear reactors. For this purpose, semi-conductor detectors based on high-purity germanium crystals with extremely low-energy thresholds were developed. Here we report the first observation of a neutrino signal with a statistical significance of 3.7 sigma from the CONUS+ experiment, operated at the nuclear power plant in Leibstadt, Switzerland. In 119 days of reactor operation (395$\pm$106) neutrinos were measured compared with a predicted number from calculations assuming Standard Model physics of (347$\pm$59) events. With increased precision, there is potential for fundamental discoveries in the future. The CONUS+ results in combination with other measurements of this interaction channel might therefore mark a starting point for a new era in neutrino physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first direct detection of neutrinos at the LHC not only marks the beginning of a novel collider neutrino program at CERN but also motivates considering additional neutrino detectors to fully exploit the associated physics potential. We investigate the feasibility and physics potential of neutrino experiments located at the surface-level. A topographic desk study was performed to identify all points at which the LHC's neutrino beams exit the earth. The closest location lies about 9 km east of the CMS interaction point, at the bottom of Lake Geneva. Several detectors to be placed at this location are considered, including a water Cherenkov detector and an emulsion detector. The detector concepts are introduced, and projections for their contribution to the LHC forward neutrino program and searches for dark sector particles are presented. However, the dilution of the neutrino flux over distance reduces the neutrino yield significantly, limiting the physics potential of surface-level detectors compared to ones closer to the interaction point, including the proposed FPF.</description>

Abstract: We present here measurements and characterizations of several dichroic filters, which are being used more commonly in nuclear and particle physics for photon-detection. The measurements were performed on filters immersed in several media: air, water, and LAB-based liquid scintillator. Measurements of transmission and reflection properties were made at various angles of incidence, and the data presented here can be used to develop detailed optical models for detector simulations. We find a modified Bragg's Law is a good model for the shift in transmission edge as a function of angle of incidence, across the various media.</description>

      <title>Scintillation characteristics of an undoped CsI crystal at low-temperature for dark matter search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07957v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The scintillation characteristics of 1 g undoped CsI crystal were studied by directly coupling two silicon photomultipliers(SiPMs) over a temperature range from room temperature to 86 K. The scintillation decay time and light output were measured using x-ray and gamma-ray peaks from a 109Cd radioactive source. An increase in decay time was observed as the temperature decreased from room temperature to 86 K, ranging from 76 ns to 605 ns. The light output also increased, reaching 26.2 +/- 1.3 photoelectrons per keV electron-equivalent at 86 K. Leveraging the significantly enhanced scintillation light output of the undoped CsI crystal at low temperatures, coupling it with SiPMs results in a promising detector for rare event searches. Both cesium and iodine have an odd number of protons, making them suitable targets for probing dark matter-proton spin-dependent interactions. This study evaluates the sensitivity of the proposed detector to such interactions, incorporating the Migdal effect and assuming 200 kg of undoped CsI crystals for dark matter searches. The results indicate that undoped CsI coupled with SiPM can achieve world-competitive sensitivity for low-mass dark matter detection, particularly in the context of dark matter-proton spin-dependent interactions.</description>

      <title>Two Types of Gluons in QCD: Re-interpretation of ALEPH and CMS Gluon Jet Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08704v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Abelian decomposition of QCD tells that there are two types of gluons in QCD, the color neutral neurons and colored chromons, which behave differently. This strongly implies that QCD has two types of gluon jets, the neuron jet and chromon jet. One quarter of the gluon jets is made of the neuron jets which have sharper jet radius and smaller particle multiplicity, while three quarters of them are made of chromon jets which have the broader jet radius and larger particle multiplicity. Moreover, the neuron jet has a distinct color flow which forms an ideal color dipole pattern, while the chromon jets have distorted dipole pattern. In this paper we provide five circumferential evidences of the existence of two types of gluon jets from the existing ALEPH and DELPHI data on $e \bar e \rightarrow Z \rightarrow b \bar b g$ decay and the CMS data on Pb-Pb heavy ion collision.</description>

      <title>Higher-order symmetry plane correlations in Pb$-$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{{\it s}_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 5.02 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The correlations between event-by-event fluctuations of symmetry planes are measured in Pb--Pb collisions at a centre-of-mass energy per nucleon pair $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 5.02 TeV recorded by the ALICE detector at the Large Hadron Collider. This analysis is conducted using the Gaussian Estimator technique, which is insensitive to biases from correlations between different flow amplitudes. The study presents, for the first time, the centrality dependence of correlations involving up to five different symmetry planes. The correlation strength varies depending on the harmonic order of the symmetry plane and the collision centrality. Comparisons with measurements from lower energies indicate no significant differences within uncertainties. Additionally, the results are compared with hydrodynamic model calculations. Although the model predictions provide a qualitative explanation of the experimental results, they overestimate the data for some observables. This is particularly true for correlators that are sensitive to the non-linear response of the medium to initial-state anisotropies in the collision system. As these new correlators provide unique information -- independent of flow amplitudes -- their usage in future model developments can further constrain the properties of the strongly-interacting matter created in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>J/$\psi$-hadron correlations at midrapidity in pp collisions at $\mathbf{\sqrt{\it s}}$ = 13 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the measurement of inclusive, non-prompt, and prompt J/$\psi$-hadron correlations by the ALICE Collaboration at the CERN Large Hadron Collider in pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy of $13~\text{TeV}$. The correlations are studied at midrapidity ($|y| &lt; 0.9$) in the transverse momentum ranges $p_{\rm T} &lt; 40~\text{GeV}/c$ for the J/$\psi$ and $0.15 &lt; p_{\rm T} &lt; 10~\text{GeV}/c$ and $|\eta|&lt;0.9$ for the associated hadrons. The measurement is based on minimum bias and high multiplicity data samples corresponding to integrated luminosities of $L_{\text{int}} = 34~\text{nb}^{-1}$ and $L_{\text{int}} = 6.9~\text{pb}^{-1}$, respectively. In addition, two more data samples are employed, requiring, on top of the minimum bias condition, a threshold on the tower energy of $E = 4$ and $9~\text{GeV}$ in the ALICE electromagnetic calorimeters, which correspond to integrated luminosities of $L_{\text{int}} = 0.9~\text{pb}^{-1}$ and $L_{\text{int}} = 8.4~\text{pb}^{-1}$, respectively. The azimuthally integrated near and away side yields of associated charged hadrons per J/$\psi$ trigger are presented as a function of the J/$\psi$ and associated hadron transverse momentum. The measurements are discussed in comparison to PYTHIA calculations.</description>

      <title>Search for quasi-particle scattering in the quark-gluon plasma with jet splittings in pp and Pb$-$Pb collisions at $\mathbf{\sqrt{\textit{s}_{\rm NN}} = 5.02}$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ALICE Collaboration reports measurements of the large relative transverse momentum ($k_{\text{T}}$) component of jet substructure in pp and Pb$-$Pb collisions at center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair $\sqrt{s_{\text{NN}}}=5.02$ TeV. Enhancement in the yield of such large-$k_{\text{T}}$ emissions in head-on Pb$-$Pb collisions is predicted to arise from partonic scattering with quasi-particles of the quark-gluon plasma. The analysis utilizes charged-particle jets reconstructed by the anti-$k_{\text{T}}$ algorithm with resolution parameter $R=0.2$ in the transverse-momentum interval $60 &lt; p_{\text{T,ch jet}} &lt; 80$ GeV/$c$. The soft drop and dynamical grooming algorithms are used to identify high transverse momentum splittings in the jet shower. Comparison of measurements in Pb$-$Pb and pp collisions shows medium-induced narrowing, corresponding to yield suppression of high-$k_{\text{T}}$ splittings, in contrast to the expectation of yield enhancement due to quasi-particle scattering. The measurements are compared to theoretical model calculations incorporating jet modification due to jet-medium interactions ("jet quenching"), both with and without quasi-particle scattering effects. These measurements provide new insight into the underlying mechanisms and theoretical modeling of jet quenching.</description>

      <title>System size and energy dependence of the mean transverse momentum fluctuations at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Event-by-event fluctuations of the event-wise mean transverse momentum, $\langle p_{\mathrm{T}}\rangle$, of charged particles produced in proton$-$proton (pp) collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 5.02 TeV, Xe$-$Xe collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}} =$ 5.44 TeV, and Pb$-$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}} =$ 5.0 TeV are studied using the ALICE detector based on the integral correlator $\langle\langle \Delta p_{\rm T}\Delta p_{\rm T}\rangle\rangle $. The correlator strength is found to decrease monotonically with increasing produced charged-particle multiplicity measured at midrapidity in all three systems. In Xe$-$Xe and Pb$-$Pb collisions, the multiplicity dependence of the correlator deviates significantly from a simple power-law scaling as well as from the predictions of the HIJING and AMPT models. The observed deviation from power-law scaling is expected from transverse radial flow in semicentral to central Xe$-$Xe and Pb$-$Pb collisions. In pp collisions, the correlation strength is also studied by classifying the events based on the transverse spherocity, $S_0$, of the particle production at midrapidity, used as a proxy for the presence of a pronounced back-to-back jet topology. Low-spherocity (jetty) events feature a larger correlation strength than those with high spherocity (isotropic). The strength and multiplicity dependence of jetty and isotropic events are well reproduced by calculations with the PYTHIA 8 and EPOS LHC models.</description>

      <title>Testing New Physics in Oscillations at a Neutrino Factory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A neutrino factory is a potential successor to the upcoming generation of neutrino oscillation experiments and a possible precursor to next-generation muon colliders. Such a machine would provide a well-characterized beam of $\nu_\mu$, $\bar\nu_\mu$, $\nu_e$, and $\bar\nu_e$ neutrinos with comparable statistics. Here we show the sensitivity of a neutrino factory to new oscillation physics scenarios such as vector neutrino non-standard interactions and CPT violation. We study two different potential setups for a neutrino factory with different assumptions on charge identification in the far detector. We find that 10 years of a neutrino factory combined with 10 years of DUNE can improve over most of the current constraints on these scenarios and even over forecasted constraints by 20 years of DUNE. Additionally, we find that a neutrino factory can break degeneracies between the standard oscillation parameters and neutrino non-standard interaction parameters present at DUNE.</description>

      <title>Monitoring the tagging efficiency of the Low-Energy Muon beamline through background analysis: Insights into the long-term performance of ultrathin carbon foils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17280v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The efficient tagging of individual muons, along with the stability of the involved ultrathin carbon foil, is critical for ensuring fast, reliable and reproducible low-energy muon spin rotation (LE-$\mathrm{\mu}$SR) measurements. At the Paul Scherrer Institute's Low-Energy Muon (LEM) beamline, we developed a method to monitor the tagging efficiency of the beamline using routinely collected muon decay histograms. This method leverages background comparison before and after the arrival time of the muons at the sample to extract the tagging efficiency, eliminating the need for additional detectors or measurements. By analyzing data collected between 2018 and 2024, we confirm the method's reliability and validate its results using independent reference measurements. Furthermore, we establish a correlation between the tagging efficiency and foil thickness by investigating the impact of contamination and outgassing on the carbon foil, as well as the restoration effects of laser cleaning. The findings underscore the importance of monitoring the carbon foil's condition to maintain consistent beamline performance and reproducibility. This method offers a practical approach for detector efficiency monitoring, applicable to other beamlines employing similar setups.</description>

      <title>On the Simulation of Hidden Parton Showers in the Conformal Window</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider confining Hidden Valley/Dark Sector theories containing many dark quark flavors. These theories are in the ``conformal window'': they reach an infrared fixed point when their quarks are massless, and have unfamiliar confinement when the quark masses are non-zero but small. Their jets of hidden hadrons may be quite different from those familiar from QCD, but their details cannot currently be simulated even qualitatively. This is partly due to the use of approximations to the two-loop running coupling in existing event generators' parton showers, which are not broadly applicable across the conformal window. We argue that the exact two-loop running coupling, and a corresponding Sudakov factor employing that coupling, must be implemented in simulation packages in order to allow phenomenological studies of these theories.</description>

      <title>Transverse spin polarization as a novel probe of medium-induced transverse-momentum-broadening effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transverse polarization of $\Lambda$ hyperons within unpolarized jets originates from the transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) fragmentation function $D_{1T}^\perp (z, p_T, \mu^2)$. In the vacuum environment, the QCD evolution of this TMD fragmentation function is governed by the Collins-Soper equation. However, in the presence of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) medium, the jet-medium interaction induces a transverse-momentum-broadening effect that modifies the QCD evolution. As a result, the transverse spin polarization of $\Lambda$ hyperons in relativistic heavy-ion collisions differs from that in $pp$ collisions. We demonstrate that this difference serves as a sensitive probe for studying jet-medium interaction, offering a novel perspective through the spin degree of freedom.</description>

      <title>Exploring ultra-high energy neutrino experiments through the lens of the transport equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a first-principles formalism, based on the transport equation in the line-of-sight approximation, to link the expected number of muons at neutrino telescopes to the flux of neutrinos at the Earth's surface. We compute the distribution of muons inside Earth, arising from the up-scattering of neutrinos close to the detector, as well as from the decay of taus produced farther away. This framework allows one to account for systematic uncertainties, as well as to clarify the assumptions behind definitions commonly used in the literature, such as the effective area. We apply this formalism to analyze the high-energy muon event recorded by KM3NeT, with a reconstructed energy of $ 120^{+110}_{-60} \, \mathrm{PeV}$ and an elevation angle of $\left(0.54\pm 2.4\right)^\circ$, in comparison with the non-observation of similar events by IceCube. We find a $3.1\,\sigma$ tension between the two experiments, assuming a diffuse neutrino source with a power-law energy dependence. Combining both datasets leads to a preference for a very low number of expected events at KM3NeT, in stark contrast to the observed data. The tension increases both in the case of a diffuse source peaking at the KM3NeT energy and of a steady point source, whereas a transient source may reduce the tension down to $1.6\,\sigma$. The formalism allows one to treat potential beyond-the-Standard-Model sources of muons, and we speculate on this possibility to explain the tension.</description>

      <title>A critical appraisal of tests of locality and of entanglement versus non-entanglement at colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been argued more than 30 years ago that it is not possible to test locality at colliders, due to the inability to directly measure non-commutating observables such as spin components in current collider experiments. Recently, there has been a lot of phenomenological and experimental activity around testing locality via Bell-type experiments or entanglement versus non-entanglement in a collider environment. These results seem to evade the earlier no-go theorem by indirectly measuring spin correlations via their relation to angular correlations between momenta. We perform a careful study of the feasibility of such an approach. We scrutinize the relationship between spin and angular correlations in both quantum mechanics and local hidden variable theories. Our conclusion is that it is currently not possible to perform a logically coherent set of experimental measurements at colliders that would allow one to test locality or entanglement versus non-entanglement. This reaffirms the earlier no-go theorem. We stress that the no-go theorem does not apply to measurements of observables inspired from entanglement and Quantum Information Theory to test the Standard Model of particle physics.</description>

      <title>Data-parallel leading-order event generation in MadGraph5_aMC@NLO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The CUDACPP plugin for MadGraph5_aMC@NLO aims to accelerate leading order tree-level event generation by providing the MadEvent event generator with data-parallel helicity amplitudes. These amplitudes are written in templated C++ and CUDA, allowing them to be compiled for CPUs supporting SSE4, AVX2, and AVX-512 instruction sets as well as CUDA- and HIP-enabled GPUs. Using SIMD instruction sets, CUDACPP-generated amplitude routines routines are shown to speed up linearly with SIMD register size, and GPU offloading is shown to provide acceleration beyond that of SIMD instructions. Additionally, the resulting speed-up in event generation perfectly aligns with predictions from measured runtime fractions spent in amplitude routines, and proper GPU utilisation can speed up high-multiplicity QCD processes by an order of magnitude when compared to optimal CPU usage in server-grade CPUs.</description>
