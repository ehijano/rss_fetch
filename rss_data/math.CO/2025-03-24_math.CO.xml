      <title>Congruences on posets, relatively pseudocomplemented and Boolean posets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of the present paper is to extend the concept of a congruence from lattices to posets. We use an approach different from that used by the first author and V. Sn\'a\v{s}el. By using our definition we show that congruence classes are convex. If the poset in question satisfies the Ascending Chain Condition as well as the Descending Chain Condition, then these classes turn out to be intervals. If the poset has a top element 1 then the 1-class of every congruence is a so-called strong filter. We study congruences on relatively pseudocomplemented posets which form a formalization of intuitionistic logic. For such posets we define so-called deductive systems and we show how they are connected with congruence kernels. We prove that every strong filter F of a relatively pseudocomplemented poset induces a congruence having F as its kernel. Finally, we consider Boolean posets which form a natural generalization of Boolean algebras. We show that congruences on Boolean posets in general do not share properties known from Boolean algebras, but congruence kernels of Boolean posets still have some interesting properties.</description>

      <title>Partial permutations and character evaluations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $I = (i_1, \dots, i_k)$ and $J = (j_1, \dots, j_k)$ be two length $k$ sequences drawn from $\{1, \dots, n \}$. We have the group algebra element $[I,J] := \sum_{w(I) = J} w \in \mathbb{C}[\mathfrak{S}_n]$ where the sum is over permutations $w \in \mathfrak{S}_n$ which satisfy $w(i_p) = j_p$ for $p = 1, \dots, k$. We give an algorithm for evaluating irreducible characters $\chi^\lambda: \mathbb{C}[\mathfrak{S}_n] \to \mathbb{C}$ of the symmetric group on the elements $[I,J]$. This algorithm is a hybrid of the classical Murnaghan--Nakayama rule and a new path Murnaghan--Nakayama rule which reflects the decomposition of a partial permutation into paths and cycles.
  These results first appeared in arXiv:2206.06567, which is no longer intended for publication. We originally used the character theoretic results in this paper to prove asymptotic results on moments of certain permutation statistics restricted to conjugacy classes. A referee generously shared a combinatorial argument which is strong enough to prove these results without recourse to character theory. These results now appear in our companion paper~\cite{HRMoment}. However, the approach in this paper is more explicit, as we demonstrate with several examples.</description>

      <title>Moments of permutation statistics by cycle type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beginning with work of Zeilberger on classical pattern counts, there are a variety of structural results for moments of permutation statistics applied to random permutations. Using tools from representation theory, Gaetz and Ryba generalized Zeilberger's results to uniformly random permutations of a given cycle type. We introduce regular statistics and characterize their moments for all cycle types, generalizing all results in this literature that we are aware of. Our approach splits into two steps: first characterize such statistics as linear combinations of indicator functions for partial permutations, then identifying the moments of such indicators. As an application, we show that many regular statistics exhibit a law of large numbers depending only on fixed point counts and a similar variance property that depends also on two--cycle counts.
  These results first appeared in arXiv:2206.06567, which is no longer intended for publication. Our original proof of the moment result for indicators of partial permutations relied on representation theory and symmetric functions. A referee generously shared a combinatorial argument, allowing us to give a self-contained treatment of these results that does not rely on representation theory.</description>

      <title>Finite analogs of partition bias related to hook length two and a variant of Sylvester's map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we count the total number of hooks of length two in all odd partitions of $n$ and all distinct partitions of $n$ with a bound on the largest part of the partitions. We generalize inequalities of Ballantine et al by showing there is a bias in the number of hooks of length two in all odd partitions over all distinct partitions of $n$ in presence of a bound on the largest part. To establish such a bias, we use a variant of Sylvester's map. Then, we conjecture a similar finite bias for a weighted count of hooks of length two and prove it when we remove the bound on the largest part.</description>

      <title>The $q$-deformed random-to-random family in the Hecke algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize Reiner--Saliola--Welker's well-known but mysterious family of *$k$-random-to-random shuffles* from Markov chains on symmetric groups to Markov chains on the Type-$A$ Iwahori--Hecke algebras. We prove that the family of operators pairwise commutes and has eigenvalues that are polynomials in $q$ with non-negative integer coefficients. Our work generalizes work of Reiner--Saliola--Welker and Lafreni\`ere for the symmetric group, and simplifies all known proofs in this case.</description>

      <title>Odd spanning trees of a graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G=(V,E)$ is said to be odd (or even, resp.) if $d_G(v)$ is odd (or even, resp.) for any $v\in V$. Trivially, the order of an odd graph must be even. In this paper, we show that every 4-edge connected graph of even order has a connected odd factor. A spanning tree $T$ of $G$ is called a homeomorphically irreducible spanning tree (HIST by simply) if $T$ contains no vertex of degree two. Trivially, an odd spanning tree must be a HIST. In 1990, Albertson, Berman, Hutchinson, and Thomassen showed that every connected graph of order $n$ with $\delta(G)\geq \min\{\frac n 2, 4\sqrt{2n}\}$ contains a HIST.
  We show that every complete bipartite graph with both parts being even has no odd spanning tree, thereby for any even integer $n$ divisible by 4, there exists a graph of order $n$ with the minimum degree $\frac n 2$ having no odd spanning tree. Furthermore, we show that every graph of order $n$ with $\delta(G)\geq \frac n 2 +1$ has an odd spanning tree. We also characterize all split graphs having an odd spanning tree. As an application, for any graph $G$ with diameter at least 4, $\overline{G}$ has a spanning odd double star. Finally, we also give a necessary and sufficient condition for a triangle-free graph $G$ whose complement contains an odd spanning tree. A number of related open problems are proposed.</description>

      <title>Solving tiling enumeration problems by tensor network contractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an algorithm for computing the contraction of two-dimensional tensor networks on a square lattice; and we combine it with solving congruence equations to compute the exact enumeration (including weighted enumeration) of Wang tilings. Based on this, the paper demonstrates how to transform other tiling enumeration problems (such as those of polyominoes) into Wang tiling enumeration problems, thereby solving them using this algorithm.
  Our algorithm extends the sequence length records for dozens of sequences defined by polyomino tiling enumeration on chessboards on the OEIS website, covering numerous of different polyomino sets, including I-polyominoes, tetrominoes, pentominoes, etc. This demonstrates the high efficiency and strong universality of the algorithm for solving exact tiling enumeration problems.
  In addition, the theory and techniques used in the algorithm establish a bridge between tensor network contractions and tiling enumeration, where the former provides a theoretical foundation for solving problems in the latter, while the latter offers an intuitive combinatorial interpretation of the former.</description>

      <title>The intersection density of cubic arc-transitive graphs with $2$-arc-regular full automorphism group equal to $\operatorname{PGL}_2(q)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The \emph{intersection density} of a transitive permutation group $G\leq \operatorname{Sym}(\Omega)$ is the ratio between the largest size of a subset of $G$ in which any two agree on at least one element of $\Omega$, and the order of a point-stabilizer of $G$. In this paper, we determine the intersection densities of the automorphism group of the arc-transitive graphs admitting a $2$-arc-regular full automorphism group $G^* = \operatorname{PGL}_2(q)$ and an arc-regular subgroup of automorphism $G = \operatorname{PSL}_2(q)$.</description>

      <title>Efficient reconstruction of the characteristic polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The polynomial reconstruction problem, introduced by Cvetkovi\'c in 1973, asks whether the characteristic polynomial $\phi^G$ of a graph $G$ with at least $3$ vertices can be reconstructed from the polynomial deck $\{\phi^{G \setminus i}\}_{i \in V(G)}$. In this work, we prove that $\phi^G \pmod{4}$ can be reconstructed from the polynomial deck if the number of vertices in $G$ is even or if the rank of the walk matrix of $G$ over $\mathbb{F}_2$ is less than $\lceil n/2 \rceil$. We also prove that for every graph $G$, $\phi^{\overline{G}}\pmod{4}$ can be computed from $\phi^G\pmod{4}$, strengthening a recent result by Ji, Tang, Wang and Zhang. Finally, Hagos showed that the pair of characteristic polynomials $(\phi^G, \phi^{\overline{G}})$ is reconstructible from the generalized polynomial deck $\{(\phi^{G \setminus i}, \phi^{\overline{G} \setminus i})\}_{i \in V(G)}$. We also present an efficient version of this result that requires less information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectral radius of a graph is the largest eigenvalue of its adjacency matrix. Let $\mathcal{C}_{n, e}$ be the set of all the connected simple graphs with $n$ vertices and $n - 1 + e$ edges. Here, we solve the spectral radius maximization problem on $\mathcal{C}_{n, e}$ when $e \le 85$ or $n \ge \frac{5}{2}e$.</description>

      <title>Determining some graph joins by the signless Laplacian spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph is determined by its signless Laplacian spectrum if there is no other non-isomorphic graph sharing the same signless Laplacian spectrum. Let $C_l$, $P_l$, $K_l$ and $K_{s,l-s}$ be the cycle, the path, the complete graph and the complete bipartite graph with $l$ vertices, respectively. We prove that $$G\cong K_1\vee (C_{l_1}\cup C_{l_2}\cup\cdots \cup C_{l_t}\cup sK_1),$$ with $s\ge 0, t\ge 1, n\geq 22$, is determined by the signless Laplacian spectrum if and only if either $s=0$ or $s\ge 1$ and $l_i\ne 3$ holds for all $1\leq i\leq t$, where $n$ is the order of $G$, and $\cup$ and $\vee$ stand for the disjoint union and the join of two graphs, respectively. Moreover, for $s\ge 1$ and $l_t=3$, $K_1\vee (K_{1,3}\cup C_{l_1}\cup C_{l_2}\cup\cdots \cup C_{l_{t-1}}\cup (s-1)K_1)$ is fixed as a graph sharing the signless Laplacian spectrum with $G$. This contribution extends some recently published results.</description>

      <title>Cubulating the sphere with many facets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For each $d\geq 3$ we construct cube complexes homeomorphic to the $d$-sphere with $n$ vertices in which the number of facets (assuming $d$ constant) is $\Omega(n^{5/4})$.
  This disproves a conjecture of Kalai's stating that the number of faces (of all dimensions) of cubical spheres is maximized by the boundaries of neighbourly cubical polytopes. The conjecture was already known to be false for $d=3$, $n=64$. Our construction disproves it for all $d\geq 3$ and $n$ sufficiently large. Moreover, since neighborly cubical polytopes have roughly $n (\log n)^{d/2}$ facets, we show that even the order of growth (at least for the number of facets) in the conjecture is wrong.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A famous conjecture of Graham asserts that every set $A \subseteq \mathbb{F}_p \setminus \{0\}$ can be ordered so that all partial sums are distinct. Bedert and Kravitz proved that this statement holds whenever $|A| \leq e^{c(\log p)^{1/4}}$.
  In this paper, we will use a similar procedure to obtain an upper bound of the same type in the case of dihedral groups $Dih_{p}$.</description>

      <title>The partition of $PG(2,q^3)$ arising from an order 3 planar collineation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\phi$ be a collineation of order 3 acting on $PG(2,q^3)$ whose fixed points are exactly an $\mathbb F_q$-plane $\pi_q$. Let $T$ be a point whose orbit under $\phi$ is a triangle and let $S_G$ be the subgroup of $PGL(3,q^3)$ that fixes setwise the $\mathbb F_q$-plane $\pi_q$ and fixes setwise the line $T^\phi T^{\phi^2}$. The point orbits of $S_G$ form a partition of the points of $PG(2,q^3)$ and consist of: the singletons $T,T^\phi, T^{\phi^2}$; scattered linear sets on the sides of the triangle $T T^\phi T^{\phi^2}$; and $\mathbb F_q$-planes.
  This article studies the structure of this partition, looking at maps that permute elements of the partition.
  The motivation in studying this partition lies in its application to the construction of the Figueroa projective plane, and the article concludes with a characterisation in this setting.</description>

      <title>A proof of the multi-component $q$-Baker--Forrester conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Selberg integral, an $n$-dimensional generalization of the Euler beta integral, plays a central role in random matrix theory, Calogero--Sutherland quantum many body systems, Knizhnik--Zamolodchikov equations, and multivariable orthogonal polynomial theory. The Selberg integral is known to be equivalent to the Morris constant term identity. In 1998, Baker and Forrester conjectured a $(p+1)$-component generalization of the $q$-Morris identity. It in turn yields a generalization of the Selberg integral. The $p=1$ case of Baker and Forrester's conjecture was proved by K\'{a}rolyi, Nagy, Petrov and Volkov in 2015. In this paper, we give a proof of the $(p+1)$-component $q$-Baker--Forrester conjecture, thereby settling this 26-year-old conjecture.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the concept of up-color kernel, which is a generalization of a kernel for vertex-colored digraphs. We give sufficient and necessary conditions for several families of digraphs to have an up-color kernel, as well as for certain products of digraphs.</description>

      <title>New type degree conditions for a graph to have a 2-factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A 2-factor of a graph is a 2-regular spanning subgraph. For a graph $G$ and an independent set $I$ of $G$, let $\delta_G(I)$ denote the minimum degree of vertices contained in $I$. We show that (1) if every independent set $I$ of $G$ satisfies $|I|\leq \delta_G(I)-1$, then $G$ has a 2-factor and that (2) if every independent set $I$ of $G$ satisfies $|I|\leq \delta_G(I)$, then $G$ has a 2-factor unless $G$ is isomorphic to a graph in completely determined exceptional graphs. It can be easily shown that the assumption of (1) is a relaxation of the Dirac condition on Hamiltonicity of graphs, and that the assumption of (2) is a relaxation of the Chv\'{a}tal-Erd\H{o}s condition on Hamiltonicity of graphs. Furthermore, for graphs with the assumption of (1), we show some results on a 2-factor with a bounded number of cycles.</description>

      <title>On the global dimension of Nakayama algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the global dimension of Nakayama algebras. In the case of linear Nakayama algebras, which are in canonical bijection to Dyck paths, we show that the global dimension has the same distribution as the height of Dyck paths. For cyclic Nakayama algebras an explicit classification of finite global dimension is not known. However, we show that in certain special cases cyclic Nakayama algebras with finite global dimension can again be interpreted as Dyck paths. In particular, we show that there is a natural bijection between sincere Nakayama algebras and Dyck paths. In this case, we find that the global dimension is in fact twice the bounce count of the corresponding Dyck path.</description>

      <title>New constructions of unbalanced $\{C_4,\theta_{3, t}\}$-free bipartite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1979, Erd\H{o}s conjectured that if $m = O(n^{2/3})$, then $ex(n, m, \{C_4, C_6 \}) = O(n)$. This conjecture was disproven by several papers and the current best-known bounds for this problem are
  $$
  c_1n^{1 + \frac{1}{15}} \leq ex(n, n^{2/3}, \{C_4, C_6\}) \leq c_2n^{1 + 1/9}
  $$
  for some constants $c_1, c_2$. A consequence of our work here proves that
  $$
  ex(n, n^{2/3}, \{ C_4, \theta_{3, 4} \}) = \Theta(n^{1 + 1/9}).
  $$
  More generally, for each integer $t \geq 2$, we establish that
  $$
  ex(n, n^{\frac{t+2}{2t+1}}, \{ C_4, \theta_{3, t} \}) = \Theta(n^{1 + \frac{1}{2t+1}})
  $$
  by demonstrating that subsets of points $S \subseteq \text{PG}(n,q)$ for which no $t+1$ points lie on a line give rise to $\{ C_4, \theta_{3, t} \}$-free graphs, where PG$(n,q)$ is the projective space of dimension $n$ over the finite field of $q$ elements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The terms "whiskering", and more generally "grafting", refer to adding generators to any monomial ideal to make the resulting ideal Cohen-Macaulay. We investigate the independence complexes of simplicial complexes that are constructed through a whiskering or grafting process, and we show that these independence complexes are (generalized) Bier balls. More specifically, the independence complexes are either homeomorphic to a ball or a sphere. In a related direction, we classify when the independence complexes of very well-covered graphs are homeomorphic to balls or spheres.</description>

Abstract: In 1984, Peter Winkler conjectured that every simple Venn diagram with $n$ curves can be extended to a simple Venn diagram with $n+1$ curves. We present a counterexample to his conjecture for $n=7$, which is obtained by combining theoretical ideas with computer assistance from state-of-the-art SAT solvers.</description>

      <title>Linear hypermaps--modelling linear hypergraphs on surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hypergraph is linear if each pair of distinct vertices appears in at most one common edge. We say $\varGamma=(V,E)$ is an associated graph of a linear hypergraph $\mathcal{H}=(V, X)$ if for any $x\in X$, the induced subgraph $\varGamma[x]$ is a cycle, and for any $e\in E$, there exists a unique edge $y\in X$ such that $e\subseteq y$. A linear hypermap $\mathcal{M}$ is a $2$-cell embedding of a connected linear hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$'s associated graph $\varGamma$ on a compact connected surface, such that for any edge $x\in E(\mathcal{H})$, $\varGamma[x]$ is the boundary of a $2$-cell and for any $e\in E(\varGamma)$, $e$ is incident with two distinct $2$-cells. In this paper, we introduce linear hypermaps to model linear hypergraphs on surfaces and regular linear hypermaps modelling configurations on the surfaces. As an application, we classify regular linear hypermaps on the sphere and determine the total number of proper regular linear hypermaps of genus 2 to 101.</description>

      <title>Path degeneracy and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we relate girth and path-degeneracy in classes with sub-exponential expansion, with explicit bounds for classes with polynomial expansion and proper minor-closed classes that are tight up to a constant factor (and tight up to second order terms if a classical conjecture on existence of $g$-cages is verified). As an application, we derive bounds on the generalized acyclic indices, on the generalized arboricities, and on the weak coloring numbers of high-girth graphs in such classes. Along the way, we prove a conjecture proposed in [T.~Bartnicki et al., Generalized arboricity of graphs with large girth, Discrete Mathematics 342 (2019), no.~5, 1343--1350.], which asserts that, for every integer $k$, there is an integer $g(p,k)$ such that every $K_k$ minor-free graph with girth at least $g(p,k)$ has $p$-arboricity at most $p+1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider products of sets of reals with a combinatorial structure based on scales parameterized by filters. This kind of sets were intensively investigated in products of spaces with combinatorial covering properties as Hurewicz, Scheepers, Menger and Rothberger. We will complete this picture with focusing on properties from the second row of the Scheepers diagram. In particular we show that in the Miller model a product space of two $\mathfrak{d}$-concentrated sets has a strong covering property $\mathsf{S}_1(\Gamma,\Omega)$. We provide also counterexamples in products to demonstrate limitations of used methods.</description>

      <title>Off-diagonally symmetric alternating sign matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A diagonally symmetric alternating sign matrix (DSASM) is a symmetric matrix with entries $-1$, $0$ and $1$, where the nonzero entries alternate in sign along each row and column, and the sum of the entries in each row and column equals $1$. An off-diagonally symmetric alternating sign matrix (OSASM) is a DSASM, where the number of nonzero diagonal entries is 0 for even-order matrices and 1 for odd-order matrices. Kuperberg (Ann. Math., 2002) studied even-order OSASMs and derived a product formula for counting the number of OSASMs of any fixed even order. In this work, we provide a product formula for the number of odd-order OSASMs of any fixed order. Additionally, we present an algebraic proof of a symmetry property for even-order OSASMs. This resolves all the three conjectures of Behrend, Fischer, and Koutschan (arXiv, 2023) regarding the exact enumeration of OSASMs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A leaper is a chess piece which generalises the knight. Given $n$ and a $(p, q)$-leaper $L$, we study the greatest $m$ such that the $m \times m$ grid graph can be embedded into the $n \times n$ leaper graph of $L$. We can assume that $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime. We show that $m \approx n$ when $p$ and $q$ are of opposite parities and $m \approx n/2$ otherwise. The latter case is substantially more difficult. The proof involves certain combinatorial-geometric results on the chords of connected figures which might be of independent interest.</description>

We deduce that the generic C-relation does not have finite big Ramsey degrees.</description>

      <title>On $S$-packing Coloring of Bounded Degree Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a sequence $S=(s_1,s_2,\ldots,s_p)$, $p\geq 2$, of non-decreasing integers, an $S$-packing coloring of a graph $G$ is a partition of its vertex set into $p$ disjoint sets $V_1,\ldots, V_p$ such that any two distinct vertices of $V_i$ are at a distance greater than $s_i$, $1\le i\le p$. In this paper, we study the $S$-packing coloring problem on graphs of bounded maximum degree and for sequences mainly containing 1's and 2's ($i^r$ in a sequence means $i$ is repeated $r$ times). Generalizing existing results for subcubic graphs, we prove a series of results on graphs of maximum degree $k$: We show that graphs of maximum degree $k$ are $(1^{k-1},2^k)$-packing colorable. Moreover, we refine this result for restricted subclasses: A graph of maximum degree $k$ is said to be $t$-saturated, $0\le t\le k$, if every vertex of degree $k$ is adjacent to at most $t$ vertices of degree $k$. We prove that any graph of maximum degree $k\ge 3$ is $(1^{k-1}, 3)$-packing colorable if it is 0-saturated, $(1^{k-1}, 2)$-packing colorable if it is $t$-saturated, $1\leq t\leq k-2$; and $(1^{k-1},2^{k-1})$-packing colorable if it is $(k-1)$-saturated. We also propose some conjectures and questions.</description>

Abstract: The Wiener index of a vertex coloring of a graph is defined to be the sum of all pairwise geodesic distances between vertices of the same color. We provide characterizations of vertex colorings of paths and cycles whose Wiener index is as large as possible over various natural collections. Along the way we establish a connection between the majorization order on tuples of integers and the Wiener index of vertex colorings on paths and cycles.</description>

      <title>Cycle Patterns and Mean Payoff Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of a \emph{cycle pattern} for directed graphs as functions from the set of cycles to the set $\{-,0,+\}$. The key example for such a pattern is derived from a weight function, giving rise to the sign of the total weight of the edges for each cycle. Hence, cycle patterns describe a fundamental structure of a weighted digraph, and they arise naturally in games on graphs, in particular parity games, mean payoff games, and energy games.
  Our contribution is threefold: we analyze the structure and derive hardness results for the realization of cycle patterns by weight functions. Then we use them to show hardness of solving games given the limited information of a cycle pattern. Finally, we identify a novel geometric hardness measure for solving mean payoff games (MPG) using the framework of linear decision trees, and use cycle patterns to derive lower bounds with respect to this measure, for large classes of algorithms for MPGs.</description>

Abstract: We study linear operators preserving the property of being a volume polynomial. More, precisely we show that a linear operator preserves this property if the associated symbol is itself a volume polynomial. This can be seen as an analogue to theorems by Borcea-Br\"and\'en and Br\"and\'en-Huh for stable polynomials and Lorentzian polynomials, respectively.</description>

      <title>A unified convention for achievement positional games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce achievement positional games, a convention for positional games which encompasses the Maker-Maker and Maker-Breaker conventions. We consider two hypergraphs, one red and one blue, on the same vertex set. Two players, Left and Right, take turns picking a previously unpicked vertex. Whoever first fills an edge of their color, blue for Left or red for Right, wins the game (draws are possible). We establish general properties of such games. In particular, we show that a lot of principles which hold for Maker-Maker games generalize to achievement positional games. We also study the algorithmic complexity of deciding whether Left has a winning strategy as first player when all blue edges have size at mot $p$ and all red edges have size at most $q$. This problem is in P for $p,q \leq 2$, but it is NP-hard for $p \geq 3$ and $q=2$, coNP-complete for $p=2$ and $q \geq 3$, and PSPACE-complete for $p,q \geq 3$. A consequence of this last result is that, in the Maker-Maker convention, deciding whether the first player has a winning strategy on a hypergraph of rank 4 after one round of (non-optimal) play is PSPACE-complete.</description>

      <title>Weingarten calculus for centered random permutation matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study the Weingarten calculus for centered random permutation matrices in the symmetric group S_N. After presenting a formulation of the Weingarten calculus on the symmetric group, we derive a formula in the centered case, as well as a sign-respecting formula. Our investigations uncover the fact that a building block of this Weingarten calculus is Kummer's confluent hypergeometric function. It allows us to derive multiple algebraic properties of the Weingarten function and uniform estimate. These results shed a conceptual light on phenomena that take place regarding the algebraic and asymptotic behavior of moments of random permutations in the resolution of Bordenave and Bordenave-Collins of strong convergence. We obtain multiple new non-trivial estimates for moments of coefficients in centered moments.</description>

      <title>On the sampling entropy of permutons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a permuton $\mu$ let $H_n(\mu)$ denote the Shannon entropy of the sampling distribution of $\mu$ on $n$ points. We investigate the asymptotic growth of $H_n(\mu)$ for a wide class of permutons.
  We prove that if $\mu$ has a non-vanishing absolutely continuous part, then $H_n(\mu)$ has a growth rate $\Theta(n \log n)$. We show that if $\mu$ is the graph of a piecewise continuously differentiable, measure-preserving function $f$, then $H_n(\mu)/n$ tends to the Kolmogorov--Sinai entropy of $f$. Using genericity arguments, we also prove the existence of function permutons for which $H_n(\mu)$ does not converge either after normalizing by $n$ or by $n\log n$.
  We study the sampling entropy of a natural family of random fractal-like permutons determined by a sequence of i.i.d. choices. It turns out that for every $n$, $H_n(\mu)/n$ is heavily concentrated. We prove that the sequence $H_n(\mu)/n$ either converges or has deterministic log-periodic oscillations almost surely, and argue towards the conjecture that in nondegenerate case, oscillation holds. On the other hand, for a straightforward random perturbation of the model $\tilde{\mu}$ of $\mu$, we prove the almost sure convergence of $H_n(\tilde{\mu})/n$.</description>

      <title>Identifying and Characterising Higher Order Interactions in Mobility Networks Using Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding human mobility is essential for applications ranging from urban planning to public health. Traditional mobility models such as flow networks and colocation matrices capture only pairwise interactions between discrete locations, overlooking higher-order relationships among locations (i.e., mobility flow among two or more locations). To address this, we propose co-visitation hypergraphs, a model that leverages temporal observation windows to extract group interactions between locations from individual mobility trajectory data. Using frequent pattern mining, our approach constructs hypergraphs that capture dynamic mobility behaviors across different spatial and temporal scales. We validate our method on a publicly available mobility dataset and demonstrate its effectiveness in analyzing city-scale mobility patterns, detecting shifts during external disruptions such as extreme weather events, and examining how a location's connectivity (degree) relates to the number of points of interest (POIs) within it. Our results demonstrate that our hypergraph-based mobility analysis framework is a valuable tool with potential applications in diverse fields such as public health, disaster resilience, and urban planning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A conjecture by Corti, Filip and Petracci, inspired by mirror symmetry, states that smoothing types of affine Gorenstein toric 3-folds correspond to zero mutable Laurent polynomials. We propose a method to prove this conjecture via log crepant log resolutions constructed from compatible collections of divisorial extractions. For affine cones over weighted projective planes we prove for several infinite families of zero mutable Laurent polynomials that they indeed describe curves that admit a compatible collection of divisorial extractions. The construction of log crepant log resolutions and smoothings will be worked out in joint work with Alessio Corti and Helge Ruddat.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A vector (compound) partition problem asks for a number of nonnegative integer solutions to a system of several linear Diophantine equations with integer nonnegative coefficients. J.J. Sylvester put forward an idea of reduction of vector partition to a sum of regular (scalar) partitions. For the simplest case of two equations with positive coefficients A. Cayley performed a reduction of the corresponding double partition to a sum of scalar partitions using an algorithm subject to a set of conditions on the coefficients. We suggested a modification of the original Cayley algorithm for the cases when these conditions are not satisfied. This result is extended to arbitrary number of the Diophantine equations to accomplish the Sylvester program of the vector partition reduction to a combination of scalar partitions.</description>

      <title>M-convexity of the minimum-cost packings of arborescences</title>

      <description>arXiv:1805.08381v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to reveal the discrete convexity of the minimum-cost packings of arborescences and branchings. We first prove that the minimum-cost packings of disjoint $k$ branchings (minimum-cost $k$-branchings) induce an $\mathrm{M}^\natural$-convex function defined on the integer vectors on the vertex set. The proof is based on a theorem on packing disjoint $k$-branchings, which extends Edmonds' disjoint branchings theorem and is of independent interest. We then show the $\mathrm{M}$-convexity of the minimum-cost $k$-arborescences, which provides a short proof for a theorem of Bern\'ath and Kir\'aly (SODA 2016) stating that the root vectors of the minimum-cost $k$-arborescences form a base polyhedron of a submodular function. Finally, building upon the $\mathrm{M}^\natural$-convexity of $k$-branchings, we present a new problem of minimum-cost root location of a $k$-branching, and show that it can be solved in polynomial time if the opening cost function is $\mathrm{M}^\natural$-convex.</description>

      <title>Equivalences of biprojective almost perfect nonlinear functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.04197v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two important problems on almost perfect nonlinear (APN) functions are the enumeration and equivalence problems. In this paper, we solve these two problems for any biprojective APN function family by introducing a strong group theoretic method for those functions. Roughly half of the known APN families of functions on even dimensions are biprojective. By our method, we settle the equivalence problem for all known biprojective APN functions. Furthermore, we give a new family of biprojective APN functions. Using our method, we count the number of inequivalent APN functions in all known biprojective APN families and show that the new family found in this paper gives exponentially many new inequivalent APN functions. Quite recently, the Taniguchi family of APN functions was shown to contain an exponential number of inequivalent APN functions by Kaspers and Zhou (J. Cryptol. 34 (1), 2021) which improved their previous count (J. Comb. Th. A 186, 2022) for the Zhou-Pott family. Our group theoretic method substantially simplifies the work required for proving those results and provides a generic natural method for every family in the large super-class of biprojective APN functions that contains these two family along with many others.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.06714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In several recent papers, the maximal safety distance that two players can maintain while moving through a graph has been defined and studied using three different spans of the graph, each with different movement conditions. Mainly, vertex spans have been studied, in which players visit all the vertices of a graph. In this paper, we analyze the values of three edge spans, which represent the maximal safety distance that two players can maintain while visiting all the edges of a graph. We present edge span values for some graph classes and examine the relationship between different variants of edge spans.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15409v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our previous work introduced a category of extended queer crystals, whose connected normal objects have unique highest weight elements and characters that are Schur $Q$-polynomials. The initial models for such crystals were based on semistandard shifted tableaux. Here, we introduce a simpler construction using certain "primed" decomposition tableaux, which slightly generalize the decomposition tableaux used in work of Grantcharov et al. This leads to a new, shorter proof of the highest weight properties of the normal subcategory of extended queer crystals. Along the way, we analyze a primed extension of Grantcharov et al.'s insertion scheme for decomposition tableaux.</description>

Abstract: We estimate the maximum possible number of cliques of size $r$ in an $n$-vertex graph free of a fixed complete $r$-partite graph $K_{s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_r}$. By viewing every $r$-clique as a hyperedge, the upper bound on the Tur\'an number of the complete $r$-partite hypergraphs gives the upper bound $O\left(n^{r - {1}/{\prod_{i=1}^{r-1}s_i}}\right)$. We improve this to $o\left(n^{r - {1}/{\prod_{i=1}^{r-1}s_i}}\right)$. The main tool in our proof is the graph removal lemma. We also provide several lower bound constructions.</description>

Assume that there exists a $3$-clique $\{x,y,z\}$ such that $E\hat{x},E\hat{y},E\hat{z}$ are linearly dependent. In this paper, we classify all the $Q$-polynomial distance-regular graphs $\Gamma$ with the above property. We describe these graphs from multiple points of view.</description>

Abstract: We provide a classification of positive integral friezes on marked bordered surfaces. The classification is similar to the Conway--Coxeter's one: positive integral friezes are in one-to-one correspondence with ideal triangulations supplied with a collection of rescaling constants assigned to punctures. For every triangulation the set of the collections of constants is finite and is completely determined by the valencies of vertices in the triangulation. In particular, it follows that the number of non-equivalent friezes on bordered surfaces is finite, and all friezes on unpunctured surfaces are unitary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supersolvable lattices, introduced by Stanley in 1972, are geometric lattices that contain a maximal modular chain. The characteristic polynomials of these lattices can be factored into a product of linear terms. Moreover, he showed that a graphical arrangement is supersolvable if and only if the graph is chordal. In 1992, Terao defined a class of hyperplane arrangements with a ``nice partition''. The Orlik-Solomon algebra of these arrangements admits a tensor product of desirable submodules of rank one, which leads to a factorization of its Poincar\'e polynomial into linear terms. In this paper, we prove that a graphical arrangement has a nice partition if and only if the graph is chordal. Moreover, for any chordal graph, every nice partition of its graphical arrangement can be induced by a maximal modular chain of the corresponding supersolvable lattice.</description>

Abstract: Let $f(m,n)$ be the number of primitive lattice triangulations of an $m \times n$ rectangle. We express the limits $\lim_n f(m,n)^{1/n}$ for $m = 4$ and $m=5$ in terms of certain systems of Fredholm integral equations on generating functions (the case $m\le3$ was treated in a previous paper). Solving these equations numerically, we compute approximate values of these limits with a rather high precision.</description>

Abstract: The well-known problem stated by A. Meir and L. Moser consists in tiling the unit square with rectangles (details), whose side lengths equal $\frac1n\times\frac1{n+1}$, where indices $n$ range from 1 to infinity. Recently, Terence Tao has proved that it is possible to tile with $\bigl(\frac1n\bigr)^t\times\bigl(\frac1{n+1}\bigr)^t$ rectangles (squares with the side length of $\bigl(\frac1n\bigr)^t$), $1/2&lt;t&lt;1$, the square, whose area equals the sum of areas of these details, provided that only those details, whose indices exceed certain $n_0$, are taken into consideration. We adduce arguments in favor of the assumption that the result obtained by T. Tao is also valid for $t=1$. We use a new tiling method (the Slack-Pack algorithm), which initially admits gaps between stacks of details. The algorithm uses a pre-fixed parameter $\gamma$, $\sqrt{3/2}&lt;\gamma&lt;3/2$, connected with the gap value. The new algorithm allows one to control the ratio of the area of the large rectangular part, which is free of details, to the whole area of the remaining empty space. This ratio (under certain natural assumptions) always exceeds $1-1/\gamma-\delta$, where $\delta$ tends to zero as $n_0$ increases.</description>

      <title>On graphs with large third eigenvalue</title>

Abstract: Given a graph $G$, let $\lambda_3$ denote the third largest eigenvalue of its adjacency matrix. In this paper, we prove various results towards the conjecture that $\lambda_3(G) \le \frac{|V(G)|}{3}$, motivated by a question of Nikiforov. We generalise the known constructions that yield $\lambda_3(G) = \frac{|V(G)|}{3} - 1$ and prove the inequality holds for $G$ strongly regular, a regular line graph or a Cayley graph on an abelian group. We also consider the extended problem of minimising $\lambda_{n-1}$ on weighted graphs and reduce the existence of a minimiser with simple final eigenvalue to a vertex multiplication of a graph on 11 vertices. We prove that the minimal $\lambda_{n-1}$ over weighted graphs is at most $O(\sqrt{n})$ from the minimal $\lambda_{n-1}$ over unweighted graphs.</description>

      <title>The planar projectivity of PG(2, $q^3$) of order 3 under field reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\phi$ be a collineation of $\mathrm{PG}\left(2, q^{3}\right)$ of order 3 which fixes a plane of order $q$ pointwise. The points of $\mathrm{PG}\left(2, q^{3}\right)$ can be partitioned into three types with respect to orbits of $\phi$ : fixed points; points $P$ with $P, P^{\phi}, P^{\phi^{2}}$ distinct and collinear; and points $P$ with $P, P^{\phi}, P^{\phi^{2}}$ not collinear. Under field reduction, the collineation $\phi$ corresponds to a projectivity $\sigma$ of $\operatorname{PG}(8, q)$ of order 3 . With respect to the field reduction and the orbits of $\sigma$, the points of $\mathrm{PG}(8, q)$ can be partitioned into six types. This article looks at the projectivity $\sigma$ in detail, and classifies and counts the fixed points, fixed lines and fixed planes. The motivation is to give a description of the lines of the Figueroa projective plane in the $\mathrm{PG}(8, q)$ field reduction setting.</description>

      <title>On the number of Hamiltonian cycles in the generalized Petersen graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The generalized Petersen graph $G(n, k)$ is a cubic graph with vertex set $V(G(n, k)) = \{v_i\}_{0 \leq i &lt; n} \cup \{w_i\}_{0 \leq i &lt; n}$ and edge set $E(G(n, k)) = \{v_i v_{i+1}\}_{0 \leq i &lt; n} \cup \{w_i w_{i+k}\}_{0 \leq i &lt; n} \cup \{v_i w_i\}_{0 \leq i &lt; n}$ where the indices are taken modulo $n$. Schwenk found the number of Hamiltonian cycles in $G(n, 2)$, and in this article we present initial conditions and linear recurrence relations for the number of Hamiltonian cycles in $G(n, 3)$ and $G(n, 4)$. This is attained by introducing $G'(n, k)$, which is a modified version of $G(n, k)$, and a subset of its subgraphs which we call admissible, and which are partitioned into different classes in such a manner that we can find relations between the number of admissible subgraphs of each class. The classes and their relations define a directed graph such that each strongly connected component is of a manageable size for $k=3$ and $k=4$, which allows us to find linear recurrence relations for the number of admissible subgraphs in each class in these cases. The number of Hamiltonian cycles in $G(n, k)$ is a sum of the number of admissible subgraphs of $G'(n, k)$ over a certain subset of the classes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the critical probability $p_c(Q_n,r)$ for bootstrap percolation with the infection threshold $r$ on the $n$-dimensional hypercube $Q_n$ with vertex set $V(Q_n)=\{0,1\}^n$ and edges connecting the pairs at Hamming distance $1$. More precisely, by utilizing the techniques developed by Balogh, Bollob{\'a}s, and Morris (2009), we determine the first-order term of $p_c(Q_n,n^a)$ where $\frac{2}{3}&lt;a&lt; 1$. Additionally, we obtain the critical probability $p_c(Q_{k,n},r)$ for bootstrap percolation with the infection threshold $r=\frac{N}{2}$ on the generalized $n$-dimensional hypercube $Q_{k,n}$ with vertex set $V(Q_{k,n})=\{0,1\}^n$ and edges connecting the pairs at Hamming distance $1,2,\dots,k$, where $k\ge 2$ and $N=\sum_{i=1}^k\binom{n}{i}$. More precisely, we obtain the first-order term of $p_c(Q_{k,n},\frac{N}{2})$ and some bounds on the second-order term by extending the main theorem from Balogh, Bollob{\'a}s, and Morris (2009).</description>

      <title>The $\alpha$-representation for the Tait coloring and for the characteristic polynomial of matroid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a finite field $\mathbb F_q$, $q=p^d$, where $p$ is an odd number. Let $M=(E,r)$ be a regular matroid; denote by ${\mathcal B}$ the family of its bases, $\bar s(M;\alpha)=\sum_{B\in {\mathcal B}}\prod_{e\not\in B} \alpha_e$, where ${\alpha_e\in \mathbb F_q}$, $\alpha_e\neq 0$. Let a subset $A\equiv A(\alpha)$ in $E$ have the maximal cardinality and satisfy the condition $\bar s(M|A;\alpha)\neq 0$, while ${r^*}(\alpha)=|A|-r(E)$. Let us represent the value of the characteristic polynomial of the matroid $M$ at the point $q$ as the linear combination of Legendre symbols with respect to $\bar s(M|A;\alpha)$, whose coefficients are modulo equal to $1/q^{r^*(\alpha)/2}$. This representation generalizes the formula for a flow polynomial of a graph which was obtained by us earlier. The latter formula is an analog of the so-called $\alpha$-representation of vacuum Feynman amplitudes in the case of a finite field, which has inspired the Kontsevich conjecture (1997). The $\alpha$-representation technique is also applicable for expressing the number of Tait colorings for a cubic biconnected planar graph in terms of principal minors of the matrix of faces of this graph.</description>

      <title>An improved hypergraph Mantel's Theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent paper, Chao and Yu used an entropy method to show that the Tur\'an density of a certain family $\mathcal{F}$ of $\lfloor r/2\rfloor$ triangle-like $r$-uniform hypergraphs is $r!/r^r$. Later, Liu determined for large $n$ the exact Tur\'an number $\text{ex}(n,\mathcal{F})$ of this family, and showed that the unique extremal graph is the balanced complete $r$-partite $r$-uniform hypergraph. These two results together can be viewed as a hypergraph version of Mantel's Theorem. In this paper, building on their methods, we improve both of these results by showing that they still hold with a subfamily $\mathcal{F}'\subset\mathcal{F}$ of size $\lceil r/e\rceil$ in place of $\mathcal{F}$.</description>

      <title>On almost Gallai colourings in complete graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $t \in \mathbb{N}$, we say that a colouring of $E(K_n)$ is $\textit{almost}$ $t$-$\textit{Gallai}$ if no two rainbow $t$-cliques share an edge. Motivated by a lemma of Berkowitz on bounding the modulus of the characteristic function of clique counts in random graphs, we study the maximum number $\tau_t(n)$ of rainbow $t$-cliques in an almost $t$-Gallai colouring of $E(K_n)$. For every $t \ge 4$, we show that $n^{2-o(1)} \leq \tau_t(n) = o(n^2)$. For $t=3$, surprisingly, the behaviour is substantially different. Our main result establishes that $$\left ( \frac{1}{2}-o(1) \right ) n\log n \le \tau_3(n) = O\big (n^{\sqrt{2}}\log n \big ),$$ which gives the first non-trivial improvements over the simple lower and upper bounds. Our proof combines various applications of the probabilistic method and a generalisation of the edge-isoperimetric inequality for the hypercube.</description>

      <title>Exponential Resolution Lower Bounds for Weak Pigeonhole Principle and Perfect Matching Formulas over Sparse Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:1912.00534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show exponential lower bounds on resolution proof length for pigeonhole principle (PHP) formulas and perfect matching formulas over highly unbalanced, sparse expander graphs, thus answering the challenge to establish strong lower bounds in the regime between balanced constant-degree expanders as in [Ben-Sasson and Wigderson '01] and highly unbalanced, dense graphs as in [Raz '04] and [Razborov '03, '04]. We obtain our results by revisiting Razborov's pseudo-width method for PHP formulas over dense graphs and extending it to sparse graphs. This further demonstrates the power of the pseudo-width method, and we believe it could potentially be useful for attacking also other longstanding open problems for resolution and other proof systems.</description>

      <title>Comparing the number of infected vertices in two symmetric sets for Bernoulli percolation (and other random partitions)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.12183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For Bernoulli percolation on a given graph $G = (V,E)$ we consider the cluster of some fixed vertex $o \in V$. We aim at comparing the number of vertices of this cluster in the set $V_+$ and in the set $V_-$, where $V_+,V_- \subset V$ have the same size. Intuitively, if $V_-$ is further away from $o$ than $V_+$, it should contain fewer vertices of the cluster. We prove such a result in terms of stochastic domination, provided that $o \in V_+$, and $V_+,V_-$ satisfy some strong symmetry conditions, and we give applications of this result in case $G$ is a bunkbed graph, a layered graph, the 2D square lattice or a hypercube graph. Our result only relies on general probabilistic techniques and a combinatorial result on group actions, and thus extends to fairly general random partitions, e.g. as induced by Bernoulli site percolation or the random cluster model.</description>

      <title>Bunkbed conjecture for complete bipartite graphs and related classes of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.12931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G = (V,E)$ be a simple finite graph. The corresponding bunkbed graph $G^\pm$ consists of two copies $G^+ = (V^+,E^+),G^- = (V^-,E^-)$ of $G$ and additional edges connecting any two vertices $v_+ \in V_+,v_- \in V_-$ that are the copies of a vertex $v \in V$. The bunkbed conjecture states that for independent bond percolation on $G^\pm$, for all $v,w \in V$, it is more likely for $v_-,w_-$ to be connected than for $v_-,w_+$ to be connected. While this seems very plausible, so far surprisingly little is known rigorously. Recently the conjecture has been proved for complete graphs. Here we give a proof for complete bipartite graphs, complete graphs minus the edges of a complete subgraph, and symmetric complete $k$-partite graphs.</description>

      <title>Maker-Breaker is solved in polynomial time on hypergraphs of rank 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.12819v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the Maker-Breaker positional game, Maker and Breaker take turns picking vertices of a hypergraph $H$, and Maker wins if and only if she possesses all the vertices of some edge of $H$. Deciding the outcome (i.e. which player has a winning strategy) is PSPACE-complete even when restricted to 5-uniform hypergraphs (Koepke, 2025). On hypergraphs of rank 3, a structural characterization of the outcome and a polynomial-time algorithm have been obtained for two subcases: one by Kutz (2005), the other by Rahman and Watson (2020) who conjectured that their result should generalize to all hypergraphs of rank 3. We prove this conjecture through a structural characterization of the outcome and a description of both players' optimal strategies, all based on intersections of some key subhypergraph collections, from which we derive a polynomial-time algorithm. Another corollary of our structural result is that, if Maker has a winning strategy on a hypergraph of rank 3, then she can ensure to win the game in a number of rounds that is logarithmic in the number of vertices. Note: This paper provides a counterexample to a similar result which was incorrectly claimed (arXiv:2209.11202, Theorem 22).</description>

      <title>When Effort May Fail: Equilibria of Shared Effort with a Threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: People, robots, and companies mostly divide time and effort between projects, and \defined{shared effort games} model people investing resources in public endeavors and sharing the generated values. In linear $\theta$ sharing (effort) games, a project's value is linear in the total contribution, thus modelling predictable, uniform, and scalable activities. The threshold $\theta$ for effort defines which contributors win and receive their share, equal share modelling standard salaries, equity-minded projects, etc. Thresholds between 0 and 1 model games such as paper co-authorship and shared assignments, where a minimum positive contribution is required for sharing in the value. We constructively characterise the conditions for the existence of a pure equilibrium for $\theta\in\{0,1\}$, and for two-player games with a general threshold, and find the prices of anarchy and stability. We also provide existence and efficiency results for more than two players, and use generalised fictitious play simulations to show when a pure equilibrium exists and what its efficiency is. We propose a novel method for studying solution concepts by defining a new concept and proving its equivalence to a previously known on a large subclass of games. This means that the original concept narrows down to a more demanding concepts on certain games, providing new insights and opening a path to study both concepts conveniently. We also prove mixed equilibria always exist and bound their efficiency.</description>

      <title>UMP Monomial Algebras: Combinatorial and Homological Consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13915v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we apply the techniques developed in [5] to present several consequences of studying UMP algebras and the ramifications graph of a monomial bound quiver algebra. Specifically, we prove that every weakly connected component of the ramifications graph of a UMP monomial algebra is unilaterally connected. Furthermore, using the main result characterizing UMP algebras in the monomial context, we prove that the class of UMP algebras is equivalent to the class of special multiserial algebras when the algebra is a quadratic monomial algebra. Based on this equivalence and the classification of Chen-Shen-Zhou on Gorenstein projective modules in [6], we extend their results to the class of monomial special multiserial UMP algebras, where we use the analysis of homological properties on quadratic monomial algebras given by these authors.</description>

Abstract: We prove a Chevalley formula to multiply the motivic Chern classes of Schubert cells in a generalized flag manifold $G/P$ by the class of any line bundle $\mathcal{L}_\lambda$. Our formula is given in terms of the $\lambda$-chains of Lenart and Postnikov. Its proof relies on a change of basis formula in the affine Hecke algebra due to Ram, and on the Hecke algebra action on torus-equivariant K-theory of the complete flag manifold $G/B$ via left Demazure--Lusztig operators. We revisit some wall-crossing formulae for the stable envelopes in $T^*(G/B)$. We use our Chevalley formula, and the equivalence between motivic Chern classes of Schubert cells and K-theoretic stable envelopes in $T^*(G/B)$, to give formulae for the change of polarization, and for the change of slope for stable envelopes. We prove several additional applications, including Serre, star, and Dynkin, dualities of the Chevalley coefficients, new formulae for the Whittaker functions, and for the Hall--Littlewood polynomials. We also discuss positivity properties of Chevalley coefficients, and properties of the coefficients arising from multiplication by minuscule weights.</description>

      <title>Minimal Cellular Resolutions of Path Ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16324v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that the path ideals of both paths and cycles have minimal cellular resolutions. Specifically, these minimal free resolutions coincide with the Barile-Macchia resolutions for paths, and their generalized counterparts for cycles. Furthermore, we identify edge ideals of cycles as a class of ideals that lack a minimal Barile-Macchia resolution, yet have a minimal generalized Barile-Macchia resolution.</description>

      <title>A unital in the generalized hexagon of order two, and an exceptional isomorphism between finite groups of Lie type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a model of the Hermitian unital of order 3 (obtained from the non-degenerate hermitian form in three variables over the field of order 9) inside the octonion algebra over the field of order 2. This construction is invariant under the automorphism group of that algebra, and explains the known isomorphism from the finite group of exceptional Lie type onto the group of semi-similitudes of the hermitian form.</description>

      <title>Coupling and Tensorization of Kinetic Theory and Graph Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14512v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a non-exchangeable multi-agent system and rigorously derive a strong form of the mean-field limit. The convergence of the connection weights and the initial data implies convergence of large-scale dynamics toward a deterministic limit given by the corresponding extended Vlasov PDE, at any later time and any realization of randomness. This is established on what we call a bi-coupling distance defined through a convex optimization problem, which is an interpolation of the optimal transport between measures and the fractional overlay between graphs. The proof relies on a quantitative stability estimate of the so-called observables, which are tensorizations of agent laws and graph homomorphism densities. This reveals a profound relationship between mean-field theory and graph limiting theory, intersecting in the study of non-exchangeable systems.</description>

      <title>Multispecies inhomogeneous $t$-PushTASEP from antisymmetric fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the recently introduced inhomogeneous $n$-species $t$-PushTASEP, a long-range stochastic process on a periodic lattice. A Baxter-type formula is established, expressing the Markov matrix as an alternating sum of commuting transfer matrices over all the fundamental representations of $U_t(\widehat{sl}_{n+1})$. This superposition acts as an inclusion-exclusion principle, selectively extracting the sequential particle transitions characteristic of the PushTASEP, while canceling forbidden channels. The homogeneous specialization connects the PushTASEP to ASEP, showing that the two models share eigenstates and a common integrability structure.</description>

      <title>The largest subcritical component in inhomogeneous random graphs of preferential attachment type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05469v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify the size of the largest connected component in a subcritical inhomogeneous random graph with a kernel of preferential attachment type. The component is polynomial in the graph size with an explicitly given exponent, which is strictly larger than the exponent for the largest degree in the graph. This is in stark contrast to the behaviour of inhomogeneous random graphs with a kernel of rank one. Our proof uses local approximation by branching random walks going well beyond the weak local limit and novel results on subcritical killed branching random walks.</description>

      <title>Wavefunction coefficients from Amplitubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13596v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a graph its set of connected subgraphs (tubes) can be defined in two ways: either by considering subsets of edges, or by considering subsets of vertices. We refer to these as binary tubes and unary tubes respectively. Both notions come with a natural compatibility condition between tubes which differ by a simple adjacency constraint. Compatible sets of tubes are refered to as tubings. By considering the set of binary tubes, and summing over all maximal binary-tubings, one is lead to an expression for the flat space wavefunction coefficients relevant for computing cosmological correlators. On the other hand, considering the set of unary tubes, and summing over all maximal unary-tubings, one is lead to expressions recently referred to as amplitubes which resemble the scattering amplitudes of $\text{tr}(\phi^3)$ theory. In this paper we study the two definitions of tubing in order to provide a new formula for the flat space wavefunction coefficient for a single graph as a sum over products of amplitubes. Motivated by our rewriting of the wavefunction coefficient we introduce a new definition of tubing which makes use of both the binary and unary tubes which we refer to as cut tubings. We explain how each cut tubing induces a decorated orientation of the underlying graph satisfying an acyclic condition and demonstrate how the set of all acyclic decorated orientations for a given graph count the number of basis functions appearing in the kinematic flow.</description>
