      <title>A smack of all neighbouring languages: How multilingual is scholarly communication?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language is a major source of systemic inequities in science, particularly among scholars whose first language is not English. Studies have examined scientists' linguistic practices in specific contexts; few, however, have provided a global analysis of multilingualism in science. Using two major bibliometric databases (OpenAlex and Dimensions), we provide a large-scale analysis of linguistic diversity in science, considering both the language of publications (N=87,577,942) and of cited references (N=1,480,570,087). For the 1990-2023 period, we find that only Indonesian, Portuguese and Spanish have expanded at a faster pace than English. Country-level analyses show that this trend is due to the growing strength of the Latin American and Indonesian academic circuits. Our results also confirm the own-language preference phenomenon (particularly for languages other than English), the strong connection between multilingualism and bibliodiversity, and that social sciences and humanities are the least English-dominated fields. Our findings suggest that policies recognizing the value of both national-language and English-language publications have had a concrete impact on the distribution of languages in the global field of scholarly communication.</description>

      <title>DNB-AI-Project at SemEval-2025 Task 5: An LLM-Ensemble Approach for Automated Subject Indexing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents our system developed for the SemEval-2025 Task 5: LLMs4Subjects: LLM-based Automated Subject Tagging for a National Technical Library's Open-Access Catalog. Our system relies on prompting a selection of LLMs with varying examples of intellectually annotated records and asking the LLMs to similarly suggest keywords for new records. This few-shot prompting technique is combined with a series of post-processing steps that map the generated keywords to the target vocabulary, aggregate the resulting subject terms to an ensemble vote and, finally, rank them as to their relevance to the record. Our system is fourth in the quantitative ranking in the all-subjects track, but achieves the best result in the qualitative ranking conducted by subject indexing experts.</description>
