      <title>Hot Electron-Driven Structural Expansion and Magnetic Collapse in Bilayer FeSe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum phenomena emerging from the interaction of light and matter in low-dimensional systems hold great potential for future quantum technologies. Here, using first-principles calculations incorporating non-local van der Waals interactions and Hubbard corrections, we report simultaneous structural expansion and magnetic collapse in bilayer FeSe induced by photoexcited hot electrons. Our calculations reveal that, while bulk FeSe is paramagnetic, as observed experimentally, double-layer FeSe exhibits robust {\it staggered} antiferromagnetic order at low temperatures with a net site magnetization of $\sim 2.75~\mu_B$/Fe. However, increasing the density of photoexcited electrons systematically enhances the internal electronic entropy, leading to a complete collapse of antiferromagnetic order accompanied by an abrupt expansion of the interlayer separation. Our findings suggest the structural and magnetic properties of FeSe thin films can be finely tuned via ultrafast laser excitation, offering a pathway to control quantum phases in iron-based compounds through electronic temperature.</description>

      <title>Origin of Anomalous Hall effect in Cr-doped RuO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RuO$_2$ is one of the most highlighted candidates for altermagnetism. However, the most recent muon spin spectroscopy and neutron studies demonstrated the absence of magnetic order in this system. The electronic structure of RuO$_2$ hints at a possibility of realizing a magnetically ordered state upon hole doping, and such a possibility was explored experimentally in Cr-doped RuO$_2$, where it was suggested that this system exhibits the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) due to altermagnetism. In this manuscript, based on our density functional calculations, we revise the results obtained for this system and propose a different interpretation of experimental results. Our calculations suggest that extra holes are bound to Cr impurity and do not dope Ru bands, which remain nonmagnetic. Thus, the observed AHE is not due to the altermagnetism but stems entirely from magnetic Cr ions.</description>

      <title>EOSnet: Embedded Overlap Structures for Graph Neural Networks in Predicting Material Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for predicting material properties, yet they often struggle to capture many-body interactions and require extensive manual feature engineering. Here, we present EOSnet (Embedded Overlap Structures for Graph Neural Networks), a novel approach that addresses these limitations by incorporating Gaussian Overlap Matrix (GOM) fingerprints as node features within the GNN architecture. Unlike models that rely on explicit angular terms or human-engineered features, EOSnet efficiently encodes many-body interactions through orbital overlap matrices, providing a rotationally invariant and transferable representation of atomic environments. The model demonstrates superior performance across various materials property prediction tasks, achieving particularly notable results in properties sensitive to many-body interactions. For band gap prediction, EOSnet achieves a mean absolute error of 0.163 eV, surpassing previous state-of-the-art models. The model also excels in predicting mechanical properties and classifying materials, with 97.7\% accuracy in metal/non-metal classification. These results demonstrate that embedding GOM fingerprints into node features enhances the ability of GNNs to capture complex atomic interactions, making EOSnet a powerful tool for materials discovery and property prediction.</description>

      <title>Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Solar Cells for Indoor Energy Harvesting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT), efficient and durable energy harvesters for powering IoT devices operating indoors and outdoors are imperative. Promising materials for indoor photovoltaic (PV) technologies include transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) such as MoS2, MoSe2, WS2, and WSe2, mainly due to their high absorption coefficients and self-passivated surfaces. Here, we assess the performance of single-junction TMD solar cells under various indoor lighting conditions with a realistic detailed balance model including material-specific optical absorption, as well as radiative, Auger, and defect-assisted Shockley-Read-Hall recombination. We find TMD solar cells could achieve up to 36.5%, 35.6%, 11.2%, and 27.6% power conversion efficiency under fluorescent, LED, halogen, and low-light AM 1.5 G lighting, respectively, at 500 lux. Based on this, TMD solar cells could outperform commercial PV technologies in indoor scenarios, suggesting their viability for future IoT energy solutions.</description>

      <title>One-step synthesis of graphene containing topological defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemical vapour deposition enables large-domain growth of ideal graphene, yet many applications of graphene require the controlled inclusion of specific defects. We present a one-step chemical vapour deposition procedure aimed at retaining the precursor topology when incorporated into the grown carbonaceous film. When azupyrene, the molecular analogue of the Stone-Wales defect in graphene, is used as a precursor, carbonaceous monolayers with a range of morphologies are produced as a function of the copper substrate growth temperature. The higher the substrate temperature during deposition, the closer the resulting monolayer is to ideal graphene. Analysis, with a set of complementary materials characterisation techniques, reveals morphological changes closely correlated with changes in the atomic adsorption heights, network topology, and concentration of 5-/7-membered carbon rings. The engineered defective carbon monolayers can be transferred to different substrates, potentially enabling applications in nanoelectronics, sensorics, and catalysis.</description>

      <title>Effects of Lanthanides on the Structure and Oxygen Permeability of Ti-doped Dual-phase Membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The trade-off effect of the oxygen permeability and stability of oxygen transport membranes (OTMs) still exists in working atmospheres containing CO2. Herein, we reported a new series of 60 wt%Ce0.9Ln0.1O2-{\delta}-40wt%Ln0.6Sr0.4Fe0.9Ti0.1O3-{\delta} (CLnO-LnSFTO, Ln = La, Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd, Tb) dual-phase OTMs by selecting different Ln elements based on the reported highly stable Ti-doped CPrO-PrSFTO. The effects of different Ln elements on the structure and oxygen permeability of Ti-doped dual-phase OTMs were systematically studied. Basically, as the atomic number of Ln elements increases, the unit cell parameters of both the fluorite phase and the perovskite phase become smaller. The unit cell volume and spatial symmetry of the perovskite phase are reduced, resulting in a reduction in oxygen permeability. The optimal CLaO-LaSFTO showed JO2 of 0.60 and 0.54 mL min-1 cm-2 with He and CO2 sweeping at 1000 oC, respectively. In addition, all CLnO-LnSFTO OTMs could work for more than 100 hours with no significant performance degradation in a CO2 atmosphere, maintaining excellent stability. This work explores candidate OTM materials for CO2 capture and oxygen separation, as well as provides some ideas for addressing the trade-off effect.</description>

      <title>High temperature diffusion enabled epitaxy of the Ti-O system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High temperatures promote kinetic processes which can drive crystal synthesis towards ideal thermodynamic conditions, thereby realizing samples of superior quality. While accessing very high temperatures in thin-film epitaxy is becoming increasingly accessible through laser-based heating methods, demonstrations of such utility are still emerging. Here we realize a novel self-regulated growth mode in the Ti-O system by relying on thermally activated diffusion of oxygen from an oxide substrate. We demonstrate oxidation selectivity of single phase films with superior crystallinity to conventional approaches as evidenced by structural and electronic measurements. The diffusion-enabled mode is potentially of wide use in the growth of transition metal oxides, opening up new opportunities for ultra-high purity epitaxial platforms based on d -orbital systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Photoinduced Charge Carriers in Metal-Halide Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The measurement and description of the charge-carrier lifetime (tauc) is crucial for the wide-ranging applications of lead-halide perovskites. We present time-resolved microwave-detected photoconductivity decay (TRMCD) measurements and a detailed analysis of the possible recombination mechanisms including trap-assisted, radiative, and Auger recombination. We prove that performing injection-dependent measurement is crucial in identifying the recombination mechanism. We present temperature and injection level dependent measurements in CsPbBr_3, which is an inorganic lead-halide perovskite. In this material, we observe the dominance of charge-carrier trapping, which results in ultra-long charge-carrier lifetimes. Although charge trapping can limit the effectiveness of materials in photovoltaic applications, it also offers significant advantages for various alternative uses, including delayed and persistent photodetection, charge-trap memory, afterglow light-emitting diodes, quantum information storage, and photocatalytic activity.</description>

      <title>Utilizing a machine-learned potential to explore enhanced radiation tolerance in the MoNbTaVW high-entropy alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-entropy alloys (HEAs) based on tungsten (W) have emerged as promising candidates for plasma-facing components in future fusion reactors, owing to their excellent irradiation resistance. In this study, we construct an efficient machine-learned interatomic potential for the MoNbTaVW quinary system. This potential achieves computational speeds comparable to the embedded-atom method (EAM) potential, allowing us to conduct a comprehensive investigation of the primary radiation damage through molecular dynamics simulations. Threshold displacement energies (TDEs) in the MoNbTaVW HEA are investigated and compared with pure metals. A series of displacement cascade simulations at primary knock-on atom energies ranging from 10 to 150 keV reveal significant differences in defect generation and clustering between MoNbTaVW HEA and pure W. In HEAs, we observe more surviving Frenkel pairs (FPs) but fewer and smaller interstitial clusters compared to W, indicating superior radiation tolerance. We propose extended damage models to quantify the radiation dose in the MoNbTaVW HEA, and suggest that one reason for their enhanced resistance is subcascade splitting, which reduces the formation of interstitial clusters. Our findings provide critical insights into the fundamental irradiation resistance mechanisms in refractory body-centered cubic alloys, offering guidance for the design of future radiation-tolerant materials.</description>

      <title>Towards high-performance photodetectors based on quasi-2D Ruddlesden-Popper mixed-n perovskite nanomaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The excellent optoelectronic properties, straightforward synthesis, and robust material stability of quasi-2D metal halide perovskites have made them a hot research topic for optoelectronic devices. In layered organic-inorganic perovskites, the optoelectronic properties are greatly influenced by morphology and quantum confinement, which are crucial for their photodetection performance and offer an excellent tunability tool. Here we investigated the optoelectronic properties and photodetection performance of quasi-2D methylammonium lead bromide perovskites with three different morphologies nanoplatelets, nanosheets, and nanostripes produced by colloidal hot injection technique. The structural and optical characterization reveals the mixed-n phases with varying extents of confinement. Our study shows that nanostripes with the weak confinement effect exhibit superior photodetection performance. They demonstrate highest photoresponsivity, EQE, and detectivity of 183 mA/W, 56 % and 2.9*10^11 Jones respectively. They also show the highest on/off ratio and fastest photoresponse (tau_r=3.4 ms and tau_f=4.3 ms) in comparison to nanoplatelets and nanosheets. Our study will aid in realizing an inexpensive high-performance photodetector based on nanoparticles of quasi-2D perovskites.</description>

      <title>Transverse Bending Mimicry of Longitudinal Piezoelectricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of frequently observed ultrahigh electric-induced longitudinal strain, ranging from 1% to 26%, remains an open question. Recent evidence suggests that this phenomenon is linked to the bending deformation of samples, but the mechanisms driving this bending and the strong dependence of nominal strain on sample thickness have yet to be fully understood. Here, we demonstrate that the bending in piezoceramics can be induced by non-zero gradient of d31 acrcoss thickness direction. Our calculations show that in standard perovskite piezoceramics, such as KNbO3, a 0.69% concentration of oxygen vacancies results in a 6.3 pC/N change in d31 by inhibiting polarization rotation, which is sufficient to produce ultrahigh nominal strain in thin samples. The gradients of defect concentration, composition, and stress can all cause sufficient inhomogeneity in the distribution of d31, leading to the bending effect. We propose several approaches to distinguish true electric-induced strain from bending-induced effects. Our work provides clarity on the origin of nominal ultrahigh electricinduced strain and offers valuable insights for advancing piezoelectric materials.</description>

      <title>Gyrotropic Magnetic Effect in Black Phosphorus Irradiated with Bicircular Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gyrotropic magnetic effect, manifesting as a gyropropic current under a slowly-varying magnetic field, represents a fundamental property of Bloch electrons on the Fermi surface; however, it has not been observed in experiments. Here, we theoretically propose that Floquet engineering with bicircular light (BCL), which is a superposition of two opposite chiral waves of circularly polarized light with an integer frequency ratio, presents a fascinating strategy to generate and manipulate the gyrotropic magnetic effect in nodal line semimetals. The tailoring spatial symmetry of BCL irradiation can induce a topological transition from a nodal line semimetallic phase to a Weyl semimetallic phase characterized by a minimum number of misaligned Weyl nodes, resulting in the generation of gyrotropic current when a slowly oscillating magnetic field is applied. Moreover, using first-principles calculations, we show that the compressed black phosphorus under irradiation of BCL is an ideal candidate to realize the large gyropropic current with great advantages. Our work not only broadens potential candidate materials for achieving the experimentally accessible gyropropic current, but also provides deeper insights into the interplay between topological phenomena and light manipulation of symmetries.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy of exchange interactions in honeycomb ladder compound ReCl5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Re5+(5d2) compounds possess large spin-orbital interaction which urges for large anisotropy, non-collinear structures and other phenomena. Here we present ReCl5 composed by separate Re2Cl10 units formed by edge-shared chlorine octahedra. It demonstrates the formation of antiferromagnetically ordered state in two steps at TN1 = 35.5 K and TN2 = 13.2 K seen in dc-, ac-magnetic susceptibility and in specific heat. At 4K it can be transformed to the state with spontaneous magnetic moment by relatively weak magnetic field m0H = 0.5 T via metamagnetic phase transition. Ab initio calculations give anisotropic ferromagnetic exchange interactions J1 and J2 within and between rhenium pairs forming the zig-zag chains along the a-axis. Pairs of zig-zag chains are coupled by ferromagnetic interaction J3 along the c-axis into magnetic honeycomb ladders. The ladders are coupled by significantly weaker interaction J4.</description>

      <title>Zero-Dipole Schottky Contact: Homologous Metal Contact to 2D Semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Band alignment of metal contacts to 2D semiconductors often deviate from the ideal Shottky-Mott (SM) rule due to the non-ideal factors such as the formation of interface dipole and metal-induced gap states (MIGS). Although MIGS can be strongly suppressed using van der Waals (vdW) contact engineering, the interface dipole is hard to eliminate due to the electronegativity difference of the two contacting materials. Here we show that interface dipole can be practically eliminated in 2D semiconducting MoSi$_2$N$_4$ when contacted by its homologous metallic counterpart MoSi$_2$N$_4$(MoN)$_n$ ($n = 1-4$). The SiN outer sublayers, simultaneously present in both MoSi$_2$N$_4$ and MoSi$_2$N$_4$(MoN)$_n$, creates nearly equal charge `push-back' effect at the contact interface. This nearly symmetrical charge redistribution leads to zero net electron transfer across the interface, resulting in a \emph{zero-dipole} contact. Intriguingly, we show that even in the extreme close-contact case where MoSi$_2$N$_4$(MoN) is arbitrarily pushed towards MoSi$_2$N$_4$ with extremely small interlayer distance, the interface dipole remains practically zero. Such \emph{zero-dipole} Schottky contact represents a peculiar case where the SM rule, usually expected to occur only in the non-interacting regime, manifests in MoSi$_2$N$_4$/MoSi$_2$N$_4$(MoN)$_n$ vdWH even though the constituent monolayers interact strongly. A model for pressure sensing is then proposed based on changing the interlayer distance in MoSi$_2$N$_4$/MoSi$_2$N$_4$(MoN) vdWH.</description>

      <title>A low-temperature synthesis of strongly thermochromic W and Sr co-doped VO2 films with a low transition temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reversible semiconductor-to-metal transition of vanadium dioxide (VO2) makes VO2-based coatings a promising candidate for thermochromic smart windows, reducing the energy consumption of buildings. We report low-temperature (320 degC) depositions of thermochromic V1-x-yWxSryO2 films with a thickness of 71-73 nm onto 170-175 nm thick Y-stabilized ZrO2 layers on a 1 mm thick conventional soda-lime glass. The developed deposition technique is based on reactive high-power impulse magnetron sputtering with a pulsed O2 flow feedback control allowing us to prepare crystalline W and Sr co-doped VO2 films of the required stoichiometry without any substrate bias or post-deposition annealing. The W doping of VO2 decreases the transition temperature below 25 degC, while the Sr doping of VO2 increases the integral luminous transmittance, Tlum, significantly due to widening of the visible-range optical band gap, which is consistent with lowering of the absorption coefficient of films. We present the discussion of the effect of the Sr content in the metal sublattice of VO2 on the electronic and crystal structure of V1-x-yWxSryO2 films, and on their temperature-dependent optical and electrical properties. An optimized V0.855W0.018Sr0.127O2 film exhibits a high Tlum = 56.8% and modulation of the solar energy transmittance deltaTsol = 8.3%, which are 1.50 times and 1.28 times, respectively, higher compared with those of the V0.984W0.016O2 film. The achieved results constitute an important step toward a low-temperature synthesis of large-area thermochromic VO2-based coatings for future smart-window applications, as it is easy to further increase the Tlum and deltaTsol by &gt;6% and &gt;3%, respectively, using a 280 nm thick top SiO2 antireflection layer.</description>

      <title>Unleashing the power of novel conditional generative approaches for new materials discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a very long time, computational approaches to the design of new materials have relied on an iterative process of finding a candidate material and modeling its properties. AI has played a crucial role in this regard, helping to accelerate the discovery and optimization of crystal properties and structures through advanced computational methodologies and data-driven approaches. To address the problem of new materials design and fasten the process of new materials search, we have applied latest generative approaches to the problem of crystal structure design, trying to solve the inverse problem: by given properties generate a structure that satisfies them without utilizing supercomputer powers. In our work we propose two approaches: 1) conditional structure modification: optimization of the stability of an arbitrary atomic configuration, using the energy difference between the most energetically favorable structure and all its less stable polymorphs and 2) conditional structure generation. We used a representation for materials that includes the following information: lattice, atom coordinates, atom types, chemical features, space group and formation energy of the structure. The loss function was optimized to take into account the periodic boundary conditions of crystal structures. We have applied Diffusion models approach, Flow matching, usual Autoencoder (AE) and compared the results of the models and approaches. As a metric for the study, physical PyMatGen matcher was employed: we compare target structure with generated one using default tolerances. So far, our modifier and generator produce structures with needed properties with accuracy 41% and 82% respectively. To prove the offered methodology efficiency, inference have been carried out, resulting in several potentially new structures with formation energy below the AFLOW-derived convex hulls.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable SWCNT ferroelectric field-effect transistor arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable devices have garnered significant attention for alleviating the scaling requirements of conventional CMOS technology, as they require fewer components to construct circuits with similar function. Prior works required continuous voltage application for programming gate terminal(s) in addition to the primary gate terminal, which undermines the advantages of reconfigurable devices in realizing compact and power-efficient integrated circuits. Here, we realize reconfigurable devices based on a single-gate field-effect transistor (FET) architecture by integrating semiconducting channels consisting of a monolayer film of highly aligned SWCNTs with a ferroelectric AlScN gate dielectric, all compatible with CMOS back-end-of-line (BEOL) processing. We demonstrated these SWCNT ferroelectric FETs (FeFETs) in a centimeter-scale array (~1 cm^2) comprising ~735 devices, with high spatial uniformity in device characteristics across the array. The devices exhibited ambipolar transfer characteristics with high on-state currents and current on/off ratios exceeding 10^5, demonstrating an excellent balance between electron and hole conduction (~270 {\mu}A/{\mu}m at a drain voltage of 3 V. When functioning as a non-volatile memory, the SWCNT FeFETs demonstrated large memory windows of 0.26 V/nm and 0.08 V/nm in the hole and electron conduction regions, respectively, combined with excellent retention behavior for up to 10^4 s. Repeated reconfiguration between p-FET and n-FET modes was also enabled by switching the spontaneous polarization in AlScN and operating the transistor within a voltage range below the coercive voltage. We revealed through circuit simulations that reconfigurable SWCNT transistors can realize ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM) with far fewer devices compared to circuits based on silicon CMOS technology or based on resistive non-volatile devices.</description>

      <title>Electron-irradiation effects on monolayer MoS2 at elevated temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of electron irradiation on 2D materials is an important topic, both for the correct interpretation of electron microscopy experiments and for possible applications in electron lithography. After the importance of including inelastic scattering damage in theoretical models describing beam damage, and the lack of oxygen-sensitivity under electron irradiation in 2D MoS2 was recently shown, the role of temperature has remained unexplored on a quantitative level. Here we show the effect of temperature on both the creation of individual defects as well as the effect of temperature on defect dynamics. Based on the measured displacement cross section of sulphur atoms in MoS2 by atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy, we find an increased probability for defect creation for temperatures up to 150{\deg}C, in accordance with theoretical predictions. However, higher temperatures lead to a decrease of the observed cross sections. Despite this apparent decrease, we find that the elevated temperature does not mitigate the creation of defects as this observation would suggest, but rather hides the created damage due to rapid thermal diffusion of the created vacancies before their detection, leading to the formation of vacancy lines and pores outside the measurements field of view. Using the experimental data in combination with previously reported theoretical models for the displacement cross section, we estimate the migration energy barrier of sulphur vacancies in MoS2 to be 0.47 +- 0.24 eV. These results mark another step towards the complete understanding of electron beam damage in MoS2 .</description>

      <title>Finite-Temperature Atomistic and Continuum Stress Fields of Coherent Precipitates with a Small Lattice Misfit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An accurate description of elastic effects of coherent microstructures is necessary for the predictive modeling of microstructural evolution in many structural materials. To date, there has not been a demonstration on how continuum elasticity models are able to reproduce finite-temperature stress-fields and elastic energy estimates of coherent precipitates from atomistic simulations. We present a comparison of stress-fields of coherent precipitates in the body-centered cubic (BCC) Fe-Cr system obtained from atomistic simulation data and from continuum elasticity modeling. The magnitude and topology of the stress-fields show good agreement between the two approaches, and we show the importance of elastic effects on the Gibbs-Thompson effect for this small lattice misfit system. We conclude with a discussion of potential complications of continuum modeling for systems with larger misfit.</description>

      <title>Attomicroscopy imaging and control of electron motion in graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attosecond science has leveraged the highly nonlinear interactions between intense few-cycle laser pulses and matter, allowing for unprecedented observation and control of electron motion with remarkable temporal resolution. However, most existing experiments focusing on laser-controlled attosecond dynamics have dealt with quasi-bound electrons released in the ionization continua of atoms, molecules, or conduction bands in solid-state systems. Here, we employed the recently developed attomicroscopy imaging tool to investigate, visualize, and manipulate the motion of bound electrons in graphene. By adjusting the carrier-envelope phase and the field strength of the driving electric field, we were able to control both the amplitude and direction of the field-induced electron current between carbon atoms in graphene. This research opens new avenues for understanding and controlling dynamic, on-demand electron motion processes, including chemical reactions, molecular bonding, and the electronic properties of materials.</description>

      <title>An information-matching approach to optimal experimental design and active learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The efficacy of mathematical models heavily depends on the quality of the training data, yet collecting sufficient data is often expensive and challenging. Many modeling applications require inferring parameters only as a means to predict other quantities of interest (QoI). Because models often contain many unidentifiable (sloppy) parameters, QoIs often depend on a relatively small number of parameter combinations. Therefore, we introduce an information-matching criterion based on the Fisher Information Matrix to select the most informative training data from a candidate pool. This method ensures that the selected data contain sufficient information to learn only those parameters that are needed to constrain downstream QoIs. It is formulated as a convex optimization problem, making it scalable to large models and datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across various modeling problems in diverse scientific fields, including power systems and underwater acoustics. Finally, we use information-matching as a query function within an Active Learning loop for material science applications. In all these applications, we find that a relatively small set of optimal training data can provide the necessary information for achieving precise predictions. These results are encouraging for diverse future applications, particularly active learning in large machine learning models.</description>

      <title>Unified percolation scenario for the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ processes in simple glass formers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given the vast differences in interaction details, describing the dynamics of structurally disordered materials in a unified theoretical framework presents a fundamental challenge to condensed-matter physics and materials science. This paper investigates numerically a percolation scenario for the two most important relaxation processes of supercooled liquids and glasses. For nine binary glass formers we find that, as temperature is lowered from the liquid state, percolation of immobile particles takes place at the temperature locating the $\alpha$ process. Mirroring this, upon continued cooling into the glass, mobile-particle percolation pinpoints a Johari-Goldstein $\beta$ relaxation whenever it is well separated from the $\alpha$ process. For 2D systems under the same conditions, percolation of mobile and immobile particles occurs nearly simultaneously and no $\beta$ relaxation can be identified. Our findings suggest a general description of glassy dynamics based on a percolation perspective.</description>

      <title>Dynamic switching of ferrocene and plasmonic interactions in Au/self-assembled monolayer/single Ag nanocube molecular junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the redox switching of ferrocene moieties embedded in a double tunnel barrier plasmonic cavity fabricated from a click-chemistry self-assembled monolayers of ferrocenyl-alkylthiol on ultra flat gold surfaces, connected to a single poly(vinylpyrrolidone) capped silver nanocube, AgNC, which is contacted by the tip of a conductive-AFM to study the electron transport properties in the dark and under light irradiation at the plasmonic resonance wavelengths. We observe a dual behavior in the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics in the dark: a large hysteresis loop at positive voltages and an hysteretic negative differential conductance (NDC) at negative voltages, due to the redox switching of ferrocene between its oxidized (Fc+) and neutral (Fc0) states. The I-V curves are analyzed by a generalized combined Marcus-Landauer model. We determine the highest occupied molecular orbital of the Fc+ and Fc0 states at 0.54 and 0.42 eV below the Fermi energy, respectively, with a weak reorganization energy &lt; 0.1 eV upon switching. Under plasmonic excitation, the hysteresis and NDC behaviors are no longer observed and the I-V characteristics of the Au-ferrocenyl-alkylthiol/AgNC junctions become similar to Au-ferrocenyl-alkylthiol SAMs. A virtual molecular orbital due to the plasmon-induced coupling (fast electron transfer) between the two redox states of the Fc is determined at 0.46 eV. This dynamic behavior opens perspectives in artificial synaptic devices for neuromorphic computing with the additional function to turn on/off this synaptic behavior on-demand by light.</description>

      <title>Tensegrity-Inspired Polymer Films: Progressive Bending Stiffness through Multipolymeric Patterning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Materials with J-shaped stress-strain behavior under uniaxial stretching, where strength increases as deformation progresses, have been developed through various materials designs. On the other hand, polymer materials that progressively stiffen under bending remain unrealized. To address this gap, this study drew inspiration from membrane tensegrity structures, which achieve structural stability by balancing compressive forces in rods and tensile forces in membrane. Notably, some of these structures exhibit increased stiffness under bending. Using a multipolymer patterning technique, we developed a polymer film exhibiting membrane tensegrity-like properties that stiffens under bending. This effect results from membrane tension generated by rod protrusions and an increase in second moment of area at regions with maximum curvature.</description>

      <title>Chemifriction and Superlubricity: Friends or Foes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mechanisms underlying chemifriction, i.e. the contribution of interfacial bonding to friction in defected twisted graphene interfaces are revealed using fully atomistic machine-learning molecular dynamics simulations. This involves stochastic events of consecutive bond formation and rupture, that are spatially separated but not necessarily independent. A unique shear-induced interlayer atomic transfer healing mechanism is discovered that can be harnessed to design a run-in procedure to restore superlubric sliding. This mechanism should be manifested as negative differential friction coefficients that are expected to emerge under moderate normal loads. A physically motivated phenomenological model is developed to predict the effects of chemifriction in experimentally relevant sliding velocity regimes. This allows us to identify a distinct transition between logarithmic increase and logarithmic decrease of frictional stress with increasing sliding velocity. While demonstrated for homogeneous graphene interfaces, a similar mechanism is expected to occur in other homogeneous or heterogeneous defected two-dimensional material interfaces.</description>

      <title>Molecular Origins of Exciton Condensation in Van der Waals Heterostructure Bilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments have realized exciton condensation in bilayer materials such as graphene double layers and the van der Waals heterostructure MoSe$_2$-WSe$_2$ with the potential for nearly frictionless energy transport. Here we computationally observe the microscopic beginnings of exciton condensation in a molecular-scale fragment of MoSe$_2$-WSe$_2$, using advanced electronic structure methods based on reduced density matrices. We establish a connection between the signature of exciton condensation -- the presence of a large eigenvalue in the particle-hole reduced density matrix -- and experimental evidence of exciton condensation in the material. The presence of a "critical seed" of exciton condensation in a molecular-scale fragment of a heterostructure bilayer provides insight into how local short-range strongly correlated effects may give rise to macroscopic exciton condensation. We find that molecular-scale properties such as layer alignment and interlayer distance can impact the formation of nonclassical long-range order in heterostructure bilayers, demonstrating the importance of geometric considerations for the rational design of exciton condensate material. Mechanistic insights into the microscopic origins of exciton condensation have potential implications for the design and development of new materials with enhanced energy transport properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: III-V nanowire heterostructures can act as sources of single and entangled photons and are enabling technologies for on-chip applications in future quantum photonic devices. The unique geometry of nanowires allows to integrate lattice-mismatched components beyond the limits of planar epilayers and to create radially and axially confined quantum structures. Here, we report the plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy growth of thin GaAs/GaAsN/GaAs core-multishell nanowires monolithically integrated on Si (111) substrates, overcoming the challenges caused by the low solubility of N and a high lattice mismatch. The nanowires have a GaAsN shell of 10 nm containing 2.7% N, which reduces the GaAs bandgap drastically by 400 meV. They have a symmetric core-shell structure with sharp boundaries and a defect-free zincblende phase. The high structural quality reflects in their excellent opto-electroinic properties, including remarkable single photon emission from quantum confined states in the thin GaAsN shell with a second-order autocorrelation function at zero time delay as low as 0.056.</description>

      <title>Suppression of Phase Separation in AlGaInAs Compositionally Graded Buffers for 1550 nm Photovoltaic Converters on GaAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate strategies to suppress phase separation and reduce threading dislocation densities (TDD) in AlGaInAs compositionally graded buffers (CGBs) that span the lattice constant range from GaAs to InP. Combining results from high resolution x-ray diffraction, cathodoluminescence, transmission electron microscopy, and photovoltaic device measurements, we correlate choices of epitaxial growth conditions with the defect structure of the CGBs and subsequent device performance. Both the use of substrates with high misorientation off (100) towards the (111)A plane and Zn-doping instead of Si-doping are shown to suppress phase separation and reduce TDD. We demonstrate a 0.74 eV GaInAs device grown on a (411)A GaAs substrate using a Zn-doped AlGaInAs CGB with TDD = 3.5 +/- 0.2 x 106 cm^-2 that has a bandgap-open circuit voltage offset of only 0.434 V measured under the AM1.5G solar spectrum. We characterized this device under high-intensity irradiance from a 1570 nm laser and measured a 31.9% peak efficiency laser power conversion efficiency at 3.6 W/cm2. These results provide a roadmap to the manufacture of laser- and thermal-power conversion devices with the performance and cost-effectiveness needed to drive adoption of these technologies at scale.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal topology of plasmonic spin meron pairs revealed by polarimetric photo-emission microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topology is the study of geometrical properties and spatial relations unaffected by continuous changes, and has become an important tool for understanding complex physical systems. Although recent optical experiments have inferred the existence of vector fields with the topologies of merons, the inability to extract the full three dimensional vectors misses a richer set of topologies that have not yet been fully explored. In our work, we extend the study of the topology of electromagnetic fields on surfaces to a spin quasi-particle with the topology of a meron pair, formed by interfering surface plasmon polaritons, and show that the in-plane vectors are constrained by the embedding topology of the space as dictated by the Poincare-Hopf theorem. In addition we explore the time evolution of the three dimensional topology of the spin field formed by femtosecond laser pulses. These experiments are possible using our here developed method called polarimetric photoemission electron microscopy (polarimetric PEEM) that combines an optical pump-probe technique and polarimetry with photo-emission electron microscopy. This method allows for the accurate generation of surface plasmon polariton fields and their subsequent measurement, revealing both the spatial distribution of the full three-dimensional electromagnetic fields at deep sub-wavelength resolution and their time evolution.</description>

      <title>Exploring $\rm Mg^{2+}$ and $\rm Ca^{2+}$ Conductors Via Solid-State Metathesis Reactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04266v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The scarcity of viable electrode and electrolyte materials vastly hinders the advancement of magnesium and calcium batteries. This study utilises solid-state metathetical reactions involving chalcogen- and pnictogen-based honeycomb layered oxides with alkaline-earth halides/nitrates to synthesise $\rm Mg^{2+}$- and $\rm Ca^{2+}$-based materials previously achievable only under high-temperature/high-pressure conditions, as well as new metastable materials with unique crystal versatility. Particularly, we employ metathetical reactions involving $\rm Li_4MgTeO_6$, $\rm Na_2Mg_2TeO_6$, and $\rm Na_4MgTeO_6$ with $\rm MgCl_2$/$\rm MgSO_4$/$\rm Mg(NO_3)_2$.$\rm 6H_2O$ or $\rm Ca(NO_3)_2$.$\rm 4H_2O$ / $\rm CaCl_2$.$\rm 2H_2O$ at temperatures not exceeding 500 $^\circ$C to produce $\rm Mg_3TeO_6$ polymorphs, ilmenite-type $\rm CaMg_2TeO_6$/$\rm Mg_2CaTeO_6$, and double perovskite-type $\rm Ca_2MgTeO_6$. Thus, we demonstrate that these materials, conventionally requiring gigascale pressures or high temperatures (&gt;1000$^\circ$C) for their proper synthesis, are now readily accessible at ambient pressure and considerably lower temperatures. Meanwhile, despite sub-optimal pellet densities, the synthesised ilmenite-type \magenta {$\rm Mg_3TeO_6$ (high-pressure polymorph)} and double perovskite-type ${\rm Ca}_2M{\rm TeO_6}$ ($M = \rm Mg, Ca, Zn$) materials exhibit remarkable bulk ionic conductivity at room temperature, marking them as promising compositional spaces for exploring novel $\rm Mg^{2+}$ and $\rm Ca^{2+}$ conductors. Furthermore, this study extends the applicability of metathetical reactions to attain Mg- or Ca-based antimonates, ruthenates, titanates, phosphates, and silicates, thus opening avenues to novel high-entropy multifunctional nanomaterial platforms with utility in energy storage and beyond.</description>

      <title>Global Optimization of Molybdenum Subnanoclusters on Graphene: a Consistent Approach Towards Catalytic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of novel sub-nanometer clusters (SNCs) catalysts with superior catalytic performance depends on the precise control of clusters' atomistic sizes, shapes, and accurate deposition onto surfaces. The intrinsic complexity of the adsorption process complicates the ability to achieve an atomistic understanding of the most relevant structure-reactivity relationships hampering the rational design of novel catalytic materials. In most cases, existing computational approaches rely on just a few structures to draw conclusions on clusters' reactivity thereby neglecting the complexity of the existing energy landscapes thus leading to insufficient sampling and, most likely, unreliable predictions. Moreover, modelling of the actual experimental procedure that is responsible for the deposition of SNCs on surfaces is often not done even though in some cases this procedure may enhance the significance of certain (e.g., metastable) adsorption geometries. This study proposes a novel systematic approach that utilizes global search techniques, specifically, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) method, in conjunction with \textit{ab-initio} calculations, to simulate {\it all stages} in the beam experiments, from predicting the most relevant SNCs structures in the beam and on a surface, to their reactivity. To illustrate the main steps of our approach, we consider the deposition of Molybdenum SNC of 6 Mo atoms on a free-standing graphene surface, as well as their catalytic properties with respect to the CO molecule dissociation reaction. Even though our calculations are not exhaustive and serve only to produce an illustration of the method, they are still able to provide insight into the complicated energy landscape of Mo SNCs on graphene demonstrating the catalytic activity of Mo SNCs and the importance of performing statistical sampling of available configurations...</description>

      <title>A concise 40 T pulse magnet for condensed matter experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is a growing interest in using pulsed high magnetic field as a controlling parameter of physical phenomena in various scientific disciplines, such as condensed matter physics, particle physics, plasma physics, chemistry and biological studies. We devised a concise and portable pulsed magnetic field generator that produces a 40 T field with a pulse duration of 2 ms. It is assembled using only off-the-shelf components and a homemade coil that leverages small computers, Raspberry Pi, and Python codes. It allows for straightforward modification for general purposes. As working examples, we show representative applications in condensed matter experiments of magnetoresistance, magnetization, and magnetostriction measurements for graphite, NdNi$_{2}$P$_{2}$, and NdCo$_{2}$P$_{2}$, respectively, with the maximum magnetic field of 41 T and the lowest temperature of 4.2 K.</description>

      <title>Mode-Dependent Phonon Relaxation in fcc Ni: Insights from Molecular Dynamics Simulations with Frozen-Trajectory Excitations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a computational study of phonon relaxation in face-centered cubic (fcc) nickel (Ni), focusing on ultra-fast magnetization dynamics. The phonons are excited beyond their thermal equilibrium population, and the relaxation behavior is analyzed as a function of both wave vector ($\vec{q}$) and phonon frequency ($\omega$). To efficiently investigate these excitations, we introduce a trajectory post-processing technique, the frozen-trajectory excitation, which facilitates the $(\vec{q},\omega)$-resolved analysis. Molecular dynamics simulations combined with the frozen-phonon multislice method predict relaxation signatures observable with time-resolved transmission electron microscopy (TEM) at 10 -- 20 fs resolution. Our findings indicate mode dependence in the relaxation processes, highlighting the importance of phonon-specific behavior consideration in ultrafast dynamics.</description>

      <title>Basis set generation and optimization in the NISQ era with Quiqbox.jl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.04586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era, ab initio computation of the electronic structure problems has become one of the major benchmarks for identifying the boundary between classical and quantum computational power. Basis sets play a key role in the electronic structure methods implemented on both classical and quantum devices. To investigate the consequences of the single-particle basis sets, we propose a framework for more customizable basis set generation and optimization. This framework allows composite basis sets to go beyond typical basis set frameworks, such as atomic basis sets, by introducing the concept of mixed-contracted Gaussian-type orbitals. These basis set generations set the stage for more flexible variational optimization of basis set parameters. To realize this framework, we have developed an open-source software package named ``Quiqbox'' in the Julia programming language. We demonstrate various examples of using Quiqbox for basis set optimization and generation, ranging from optimizing atomic basis sets on the Hartree--Fock level, preparing the initial state for VQE computation, and constructing basis sets with completely delocalized orbitals. We also include various benchmarks of Quiqbox for basis set optimization and ab initial electronic structure computation.</description>

      <title>Exploring Intrinsic Magnetic Topological Insulators: The Case of EuIn$_2$As$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11386v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, ultrafast optical spectroscopy was employed to elucidate the intricate topological features of EuIn$_2$As$_2$, a promising candidate for a magnetic topological-crystalline axion insulator. Our investigation, focusing on the real-time evolution of topological states, unveiled a narrow surface magnetic gap (2$\Delta_0$ $\simeq$ 8.2 meV)) emerging at the antiferromagnetic transition temperature ($T_N$ $\approx$ 16 K). Below $T_N$, two extremely low-energy collective modes, $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$, with frequencies of $\sim$9.9 and 21.6 GHz at $T$ = 4 K, respectively, were observed, exhibiting strong temperature dependence. $\omega_1$ correlates with an acoustic phonon, while $\omega_2$ is associated with a magnon. The results suggest that EuIn$_2$As$_2$ has the potential to manifest a magnetic topological-crystalline axion insulator, presenting a small magnetic energy gap on the (001) surface. The findings further our understanding of the interplay between magnetism and topology in this material, showcasing its potential for applications in quantum information processing and spintronics.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Rashba semiconductors and inversion-asymmetric topological insulators in monolayer Janus MAA'ZxZ'(4-x) family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Rashba effect in Janus structures, accompanied by nontrivial topology, plays an important role in spintronics and even photovoltaic applications, which are receiving increasing attention. However, less effort has been devoted to searching for the Rashba effect in conjunction with nontrivial topology, from the perspective of material design and in establishing universal rules. Herein, through first-principles calculations, we systematically investigate the geometric stability and electronic structures of the Janus MAA'ZxZ'(4-x) family derived from two-dimensional MA2Z4 (M=Mg, Ga, Sr; A=Al, Ga; Z=S, Se, Te) monolayers, designed numerous Rashba semiconductors and inversion-asymmetric topological insulators with Rashba splitting. As the total atomic number rises, the bandgaps of Janus MAA'ZxZ'(4-x) decrease continuously from 2.14 eV for MgAl2S3Se. The decrease persists until the bandgap, combined with strong spin-orbit coupling, becomes small enough to lead to the band inversion with nontrivial topology. In specific Janus systems, pz orbitals near the Fermi level, in conjunction with band inversion, could create a hybrid spin texture with double Rashba splitting. Importantly, the Rashba effect, nontrivial topological states and unique spin textures in the MAA'ZxZ'(4-x) systems can be significantly tuned through small biaxial strain. Our work not only develops the abundant Janus MAA'ZxZ'(4-x) family with multifunctional application prospects, but also reveals the designing rules of Rashba semiconductors and inversion-asymmetric nontrivial topological insulators.</description>

      <title>Wiedemann-Franz Law and Thermoelectric Inequalities: Effective ZT and Single-leg Efficiency Overestimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a thermoelectric inequality in thermoelectric conversion between the material figure of merit (ZT) and the module effective ZT using the Constant Seebeck-coefficient Approximation combining with the Wiedemann-Franz law. In a P-N leg-pair module, the effective ZT lies between the individual ZT values of the P- and N-legs. In a single-leg module, however, the effective ZT is less than approximately one-third of the leg's ZT. This reduction results from the need for an external wire to complete the circuit, introducing additional thermal and electrical losses. Multi-dimensional numerical analysis shows that, although structural optimization can mitigate these losses, the system efficiency remains limited to below half of the ideal single-leg material efficiency. Our findings explain the single-leg efficiency overestimation and highlight the importance of optimizing the P-N leg-pair module structure. They also underscore the need for thermoelectric leg-compatibility, particularly with respect to Seebeck coefficients.</description>
