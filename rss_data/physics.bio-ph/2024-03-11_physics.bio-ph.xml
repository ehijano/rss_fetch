      <title>Unveiling nutrient flow mediated stress in the plant roots using on-chip phytofluidic device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The initial emergence of the primary root from a germinating seed is a pivotal phase that influences a plant's survival. Abiotic factors such as pH, nutrient availability, and soil composition significantly affect root morphology and architecture. Of particular interest is the impact of nutrient flow on thigmomorphogenesis, a response to mechanical stimulation in early root growth, which remains largely unexplored. This study explores the intricate factors influencing early root system development, with a focus on the cooperative correlation between nutrient uptake and its flow dynamics. Using physiologically relevant, portable, and cost-effective microfluidic system for the controlled fluid environments offering hydraulic conductivity comparable to that of the soil, this study analyzes the interplay between nutrient flow and root growth post-germination. Emphasizing the relationship between root growth and nitrogen uptake, the findings reveal that nutrient flow significantly influences early root morphology, leading to increased length and improved nutrient uptake, varying with the flow rate. The experimental findings are supported by stress-related fluid flow-root interaction simulations and quantitative determination of nitrogen uptake using the Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN) method. The microfluidic approach offers novel insights into plant root dynamics under controlled flow conditions, filling a critical research gap. By providing a high-resolution platform, this study contributes to the understanding of how fluid-flow assisted nutrient uptake and pressure affect root-cell behavior, which, in turn, induces mechanical stress leading to thigmomorphogenesis. The findings hold implications for comprehending root responses to changing environmental conditions, paving the way for innovative agricultural and environmental management strategies.</description>

      <title>Role of tissue fluidization and topological defects in epithelial tubulogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cellular rearrangements, as primary sources of tissue fluidization, facilitate topological transitions during tissue morphogenesis. We study the role of intrinsic cell properties such as cell polarity and cell-cell adhesion in shaping epithelial tissues using a minimal model of interacting polarized cells. The presence of a vortex in the cell polarization poses the topological constraint that induces an inwards migration with the formation of a conical shape. Local rearrangements at the tip of the cone lead to the onset of tube formation. Switching between collective migration and structural rearrangements is key for balancing the contrasting tendencies, such as the tissue rigidity needed to preserve shape and the tissue fluidity allowing for topological transitions during tissue morphogenesis.</description>

      <title>Electric field of DNA in solution: who is in charge?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In solution, DNA is a highly charged macromolecule which bears a unit of negative charge on each phosphate of its sugar-phosphate backbone. Although partially compensated by counterions adsorbed at or condensed near it, DNA still produces a substantial electric field in its vicinity, which is screened by buffer electrolyte at longer distances from the DNA. Such field has been explored so far predominantly within the scope of a primitive model of the electrolytic solution, not considering more complicated structural effects of the water solvent. In this paper we investigate the distribution of electric field around DNA using linear response nonlocal electrostatic theory, applied here for helix-specific charge distributions, and compare the predictions of such theory with specially performed fully atomistic large scale molecular dynamics simulations. The main finding of this study is that oscillations in the electrostatic potential distribution are present around DNA, caused by the overscreening effect of structured water. Surprisingly, electrolyte ions at physiological concentrations do not strongly disrupt these oscillations, and rather distribute according to these oscillating patterns, indicating that water structural effects dominate the short-range electrostatics. We also show that (i) structured water adsorbed in the grooves of DNA lead to a positive electrostatic potential core, (ii) the Debye length some 10 {\AA} away from the DNA is reduced, effectively renormalised by the helical pitch of the DNA, and (iii) Lorentzian contributions to the nonlocal dielectric function of water, effectively reducing the dielectric constant close to the DNA, enhances the overall electric field. The impressive agreement between the atomistic simulations and the developed theory substantiates the use of nonlocal electrostatics when considering solvent effects in molecular processes in biology.</description>

      <title>Non-additivity in many-body interactions between membrane-deforming spheres increases disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Membrane-induced interactions have been predicted to be important for the organization of membrane proteins. Measurements of the interactions between two and three membrane deforming objects have revealed their non-additive nature. They are thought to lead to complex many-body effects, however, experimental evidence is lacking to date. We here present an experimental method to measure many-body effects in membrane-mediated interactions using colloidal spheres placed between a deflated giant unilamellar vesicles and a planar substrate. The thus confined colloidal particles cause a large deformation of the membrane while not being physochemically attached to it and interact through it. Two particles are found to attract with a maximum force of 0.2~pN. For three particles, we observe a preference for forming compact equilateral triangles over a linear arrangement. We use numerical energy minimization to establish that the attraction stems from a reduction in the membrane-deformation energy caused by the particles. Confining up to 36 particles, we find a preference for hexagonally close packed clusters. However, with increasing number of particles the order of the confined particles decreases, while at the same time, diffusivity of the particles increases. Our experiments for the first time show that the non-additive nature of membrane-mediated interactions affects the interactions and arrangements and ultimately leads to spherical aggregates with liquid-like order of potential importance for cellular processes.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Structural Effects of Water on DNA Homology Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03213v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mechanism behind mutual recognition of homologous DNA sequences prior to genetic recombination is one of the remaining puzzles in molecular biology. Leading models of homology recognition, based on classical electrostatics, neglect the short-range nonlocal screening effects arising from structured water around DNA, and hence may only provide insight for relatively large separations between interacting DNAs. We elucidate the role of the effects of the nonlocal dielectric response of water on DNA-DNA interaction and show that these can dramatically enhance the driving force for recognition.</description>

      <title>Continuous Gated First-Passage Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.09164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gated first-passage processes, where completion depends on both hitting a target and satisfying additional constraints, are prevalent across various fields. Despite their significance, analytical solutions to basic problems remain unknown, e.g. the detection time of a diffusing particle by a gated interval, disk, or sphere. In this paper, we elucidate the challenges posed by continuous gated first-passage processes and present a renewal framework to overcome them. This framework offers a unified approach for a wide range of problems, including those with single-point, half-line, and interval targets. The latter have so far evaded exact solutions. Our analysis reveals that solutions to gated problems can be obtained directly from the ungated dynamics. This, in turn, reveals universal properties and asymptotic behaviors, shedding light on cryptic intermediate-time regimes and refining the notion of high-crypticity for continuous-space gated processes. Moreover, we extend our formalism to higher dimensions, showcasing its versatility and applicability. Overall, this work provides valuable insights into the dynamics of continuous gated first-passage processes and offers analytical tools for studying them across diverse domains.</description>

      <title>Poissonian cellular Potts models reveal nonequilibrium kinetics of cell sorting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.04443v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cellular Potts models are broadly applied across developmental biology and cancer research. We overcome limitations of the traditional approach, which reinterprets a modified Metropolis sampling as ad hoc dynamics, by introducing a physical timescale through Poissonian kinetics and by applying principles of stochastic thermodynamics to separate thermal and relaxation effects from athermal noise and nonconservative forces. Our method accurately describes cell-sorting dynamics in mouse-embryo development and identifies the distinct contributions of nonequilibrium processes, e.g. cell growth and active fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Movement bias in asymmetric landscapes and its impact on population distribution and critical habitat size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ecologists have long investigated how demographic and movement parameters determine the spatial distribution and critical habitat size of a population. However, most models oversimplify movement behavior, neglecting how landscape heterogeneity influences individual movement. We relax this assumption and introduce a reaction-advection-diffusion equation that describes population dynamics when individuals exhibit space-dependent movement bias toward preferred regions. Our model incorporates two types of these preferred regions: a high-quality habitat patch, termed `habitat', which is included to model avoidance of degraded habitats like deforested regions; and a preferred location, such as a chemoattractant source or a watering hole, that we allow to be asymmetrically located with respect to habitat edges. In this scenario, the critical habitat size depends on both the relative position of the preferred location and the movement bias intensities. When preferred locations are near habitat edges, the critical habitat size can decrease when diffusion increases, a phenomenon called the drift paradox. Also, ecological traps arise when the habitat overcrowds due to excessive attractiveness or the preferred location is near a low-quality region. Our results highlight the importance of species-specific movement behavior and habitat preference as drivers of population dynamics in fragmented landscapes and, therefore, in the design of protected areas.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear dynamics of femtosecond laser interaction with the central nervous system in zebrafish</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05453v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the photodamage mechanism underlying the highly nonlinear interaction of femtosecond pulses at 1030 nm with the central nervous system tissue in living zebrafish (Danio rerio). Our study identifies two different cavitation regimes. The damage is confined and well-controlled at low repetition rates due to plasma-based ablation and sudden local temperature rise. At high repetition rates, the damage becomes collateral due to plasma-mediated photochemistry and is not influenced by the thermal accumulation of consecutive laser pulses. Furthermore, we investigate and quantify the role of fluorescence labels with linear and nonlinear absorption pathways in optical breakdown. To verify our findings, we examined cell death and cellular responses to tissue damage, including the recruitment of fibroblasts and immune cells at different time points post-irradiation. These findings contribute to advancing the emerging nonlinear optical microscopy techniques and provide a strategy for inducing deep-tissue, precise, and localized injuries using near-infrared femtosecond laser pulses</description>
