      <title>$\mathrm{SU(N)}$ lattice gauge theories with Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an application of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to the study of $\mathrm{SU}(N_c)$ lattice gauge theories. Our method enables the learning of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues at arbitrary gauge couplings, smoothly moving from the analytically known strong-coupling regime towards weaker couplings. By encoding the Schr\"odinger equation and the symmetries of the eigenstates directly into the loss function, the network performs an unsupervised exploration of the spectrum. We validate the approach on the single-plaquette $\mathrm{U}(1)$ and $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ pure-gauge theories, showing that the PINNs successfully reproduce the hierarchy of energy levels and their corresponding wavefunctions.</description>

      <title>Lattice Calculation of Light Meson Radiative Leptonic Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we perform a lattice QCD calculation of the branching ratios and the form factors of radiative leptonic decays $P \to \ell \nu_\ell \gamma$ ($P = \pi, K$) using $N_f=2+1$ domain wall fermion ensembles generated by the RBC and UKQCD collaborations at the physical pion mass. We adopt the infinite volume reconstruction (IVR) method, which extends lattice data to infinite volume and effectively controls the finite volume effects. This study represents a first step toward a complete calculation of radiative corrections to leptonic decays using the IVR method, including both real photon emissions and virtual photon loops. For decays involving a final state electron, collinear radiative corrections, enhanced by the large logarithmic factors such as $\ln(m_\pi^2/m_e^2)$ and $\ln(m_K^2/m_e^2)$, can reach the level of $O(10\%)$ and are essential at the current level of theoretical and experimental precision. After including these corrections, our result for $\pi \to e\nu_e\gamma$ agrees with the PIBETA measurement; for \(K \to e\nu_e\gamma\), our results are consistent with the KLOE data and exhibit a $1.7\sigma$ tension with E36; and for $K \to \mu\nu_\mu\gamma$, where radiative corrections are negligible, our results confirm the previously observed discrepancies between lattice results and the ISTRA/OKA measurements at large photon energies, and with the E787 results at large muon photon angles.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of the SU(2) scalar-fermion-gauge system under the influence of the Brout-Englert-Higgs effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gauge invariance requires physical states to be composite, even in the weak sector of the Standard Model (SM). The Fr\"ohlich-Morchio-Strocchi (FMS) mechanism resolves this subtlety and predicts additional Higgs contributions in SM processes. While this has been supported by theoretical investigations in the bosonic sector, its impact on fermionic observables remains largely unexplored. We use non-perturbative lattice techniques within a gauge-invariant framework to study a proxy theory of the weak sector with dynamical fermions. We determine the physical spectrum of the theory and interpret the results in the context of the FMS mechanism. Additionally, we identify suitable simulation points for a scattering analysis as a first step toward cross-sections relevant to (future lepton) colliders.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Stress Test of Truncated Hilbert Space Bases against Green's function Monte Carlo in U(1) Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A representation of Lattice Gauge Theories (LGT) suitable for simulations with tensor network state methods or with quantum computers requires a truncation of the Hilbert space to a finite dimensional approximation. In particular for U(1) LGTs, several such truncation schemes are known, which we compare with each other using tensor network states. We show that a functional basis obtained from single plaquette Hamiltonians -- which we call plaquette state basis -- outperforms the other schemes in two spatial dimensions for plaquette, ground state energy and mass gap, as it is delivering accurate results for a wide range of coupling strengths with a minimal number of basis states. We also show that this functional basis can be efficiently used in three spatial dimensions. Green's function Monte Carlo appears to be a highly useful tool to verify tensor network states results, which deserves further investigation in the future.</description>

      <title>Scalable quantum computation of Quantum Electrodynamics beyond one spatial dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Hamiltonian formulation, Quantum Field Theory calculations scale exponentially with spatial volume, making real-time simulations intractable on classical computers and motivating quantum computation approaches. In Hamiltonian quantisation, bosonic fields introduce the additional challenge of an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. We present a scalable quantum algorithm for Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), an Abelian gauge field theory in higher than one spatial dimensions, designed to address this limit while preserving gauge invariance. In our formulation, Gauss's law is automatically satisfied when the implementation remains fully gauge invariant. We demonstrate how gauge invariance is maintained throughout the lattice discretisation, digitisation, and qubitisation procedures, and identify the most efficient representation for extending to large Hilbert space dimensions. Within this framework, we benchmark several quantum error mitigation techniques and find the calibration method to perform most effectively. The approach scales naturally to larger lattices, and we implement and test the 2+1 and 3+1 dimensional setups on current quantum hardware. Our results indicate that next-generation quantum platforms could enable reliable, fully quantum simulations of large-scale QED dynamics.</description>

      <title>Improved calculation of radiative corrections to $\boldsymbol{\tau\to\pi\pi\nu_\tau}$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A reliable calculation of radiative corrections to $\tau\to\pi\pi\nu_\tau$ decays is an important prerequisite for using hadronic $\tau$ decays for a data-driven evaluation of the hadronic-vacuum-polarization contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, $a_\mu^\text{HVP, LO}[\pi\pi,\tau]$. In this Letter, we present an improved model-independent analysis of these radiative corrections, including, for the first time, effects beyond point-like pions in the evaluation of the loop diagrams. These structure-dependent corrections, implemented via a dispersive representation of the pion form factor, lead to significant changes compared to previous calculations due to enhancements near the $\rho(770)$ resonance. We also devise strategies for the matching to chiral perturbation theory and a stable implementation of the real corrections down to the two-pion threshold, which shows that some higher-order isospin-breaking corrections need to be kept due to a strong threshold enhancement. Finally, we perform dispersive fits to the currently available $\tau\to\pi\pi\nu_\tau$ spectra and discuss the consequences for isospin-breaking corrections in the evaluation of $a_\mu^\text{HVP, LO}[\pi\pi,\tau]$.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic tomography of spin-$\frac{3}{2}$ hidden-charm strange pentaquarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how quarks are spatially arranged inside exotic pentaquarks remains one of the key open problems in contemporary hadron spectroscopy. The electromagnetic multipole moments of hadrons provide a direct probe of their internal quark--gluon geometry and spatial charge distributions. Motivated by this, we employ QCD light-cone sum rules to compute the magnetic dipole, electric quadrupole, and magnetic octupole moments of the $J^P = 3/2^-$ pentaquark with strangeness $S = -1$. Five distinct diquark--diquark--antiquark interpolating currents are constructed to explore possible internal configurations. The resulting electromagnetic moments exhibit pronounced sensitivity to the underlying quark arrangement: magnetic dipole moments range from $-2.28\mu_N$ to $+3.36\mu_N$, establishing this observable as a key discriminator among configurations with identical quantum numbers. Nonzero electric quadrupole and magnetic octupole moments indicate clear deviations from spherical symmetry, while a detailed decomposition shows that light quarks dominate the magnetic response and the charm quark drives quadrupole deformation. These findings position electromagnetic multipole moments as quantitative and discriminating probes of exotic hadron structure, providing concrete benchmarks for forthcoming LHCb, Belle~II, and lattice QCD studies.</description>

      <title>Sample-Based Krylov Quantum Diagonalization for the Schwinger Model on Trapped-Ion and Superconducting Quantum Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the recently proposed Sample-based Krylov Quantum Diagonalization (SKQD) method to lattice gauge theories, using the Schwinger model with a $\theta$-term as a benchmark. SKQD approximates the ground state of a Hamiltonian, employing a hybrid quantum-classical approach: (i) constructing a Krylov space from bitstrings sampled from time-evolved quantum states, and (ii) classically diagonalizing the Hamiltonian within this subspace. We study the dependence of the ground-state energy and particle number on the value of the $\theta$-term, accurately capturing the model's phase structure. The algorithm is implemented on trapped-ion and superconducting quantum processors, demonstrating consistent performance across platforms. We show that SKQD substantially reduces the effective Hilbert space, and although the Krylov space dimension still scales exponentially, the slower growth underscores its promise for simulating lattice gauge theories in larger volumes.</description>

      <title>Beyond Leading Logarithms in $g_V$: The Semileptonic Weak Hamiltonian at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha\,\alpha_s^2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first next-to-leading-logarithmic QCD analysis of the electromagnetic corrections to the semileptonic weak Hamiltonian, including the mixed $\mathcal{O}(\alpha\,\alpha_s^2)$ corrections to the vector coupling $g_V$. The analysis combines the evaluation of three-loop anomalous dimensions and two-loop matching corrections with a consistent factorization of short-distance QCD effects. The latter is implemented through a scheme change based on a $d$-dimensional operator product expansion performed inside the loop integrals. The resulting renormalization-group--improved expression for the radiative correction $\Delta^V_R = 2.432(16)\%$ can be systematically refined using input from lattice QCD and perturbation theory and improves the consistency of first-row CKM unitarity tests.</description>

      <title>Lattice investigation of custodial two-Higgs-doublet model at weak quartic couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $SU(2){-}$gauged custodial two-Higgs-doublet model, which shares the same global-symmetry properties with the standard model, is studied non-perturbatively on the lattice. The additional Higgs doublet enlarges the scalar spectrum and opens the possibility for spontaneous breaking of the global symmetry. In this work we start by showing the occurrence of spontaneous breaking of the custodial symmetry in a region of the parameter space of the model. Following this, both the spectrum and the running of the gauge coupling are examined at weak quartic couplings in the presence of the custodial symmetry. The calculations are performed with energy cutoffs ranging from 300 to 600 GeV on a line of constant standard model physics, obtained by tuning bare couplings to fix the ratio between the masses of the Higgs and the $W$ bosons, as well as the value of the renormalized gauge coupling at the scale of the $W$ boson mass. The realizable masses for the additional scalar states are explored. For the choice of bare quartic couplings in this work, the estimated lower bound of these masses is found to be well below the $W$ boson mass, and independent of the cutoff. We also study the finite temperature electroweak transition along this line of constant standard model physics, revealing properties of a smooth crossover behavior.</description>
