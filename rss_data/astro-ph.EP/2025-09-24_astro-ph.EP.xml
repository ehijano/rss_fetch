      <title>The Streaming Instability in 3D: Conditions for Strong Clumping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The streaming instability (SI) is a leading mechanism for planetesimal formation, driving the aerodynamic concentration of solids in protoplanetary disks. The SI triggers strong clumping (i.e., strong enough for clumps to collapse) when the solid-to-gas column density ratio, $Z$, exceeds a threshold, $\Zcrit$. This threshold depends on the dimensionless stopping time, $\tau_s$. Although the strong-clumping threshold has been explored over the last decade, it has been determined largely through 2D axisymmetric simulations. In this work, we perform a suite of 3D, vertically stratified simulations to establish a clumping threshold across $10^{-3} \leq \tau_s \leq 1.0$. Additionally, we study SI-driven concentration that is unique to 3D. We find that $\Zcrit$ is as low as $\approx 0.002$ at $\tau_s=0.1$ and exceeds $\approx 0.03$ at $\tau_s=10^{-3}$. Compared to 2D, our 3D results yield lower $\Zcrit$ for $\tau_s &gt; 0.02$, but higher for $\tau_s \leq 0.02$, with a sharp transition between $\tau_s = 0.02$ and 0.03. This transition correlates with midplane density ratio ($\epsilon$): $\epsilon &lt; 1$ where 3D gives lower thresholds, and $\epsilon &gt; 1$ where 3D gives higher thresholds. We also find a filaments-in-filaments structure when $\epsilon &lt; 1$, which enhances clumping compared to 2D. By contrast, when $\epsilon &gt; 1$ and $\tau_s \leq 0.03$, dust filaments in 3D do not drift inward, suppressing filament mergers and strong clumping. In 2D, filaments drift inward regardless of $\epsilon$, triggering strong clumping easier in this regime. Our results underscore the necessity of 3D simulations for accurately capturing SI-driven concentration and building the strong-clumping threshold.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Analysis of Three Microlensing Planet Candidates with the Planet/Binary Degeneracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present observations and analyses of three high-magnification microlensing events: KMT-2022-BLG-0954, KMT-2024-BLG-0697, and MOA-2024-BLG-018. All three exhibit the "Planet/Binary" degeneracy, with planetary solutions corresponding to mass ratios in the range $-3.7 &lt; \log q &lt; -2.2$, while the binary solutions yield $\log q &gt; -2.0$. For KMT-2022-BLG-0954, we identify a previously unrecognized degeneracy among planetary solutions, involving different mass ratios and normalized source radii. In all three cases, single-lens binary-source models are excluded. Bayesian analyses suggest that the planetary solutions correspond to gas giants orbiting M/K dwarfs beyond the snow line, while KMT-2022-BLG-0954 also admits an alternative interpretation as a super-Earth orbiting a late-type M dwarf. The binary solutions imply a diverse set of systems, including M-dwarf pairs and M-dwarf--brown-dwarf binaries. A review of known events subject to the "Planet/Binary" degeneracy shows that in most cases the degeneracy cannot be resolved through follow-up high-resolution imaging, particularly in the presence of the newly identified degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Simulations of multiple dust ring formation in a subsolar-metallicity protoplanetary disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Super-Earths exist around subsolar-metallicity host stars with a frequency comparable to that around solar-metallicity stars, suggesting efficient assembly of dust grains even in metal-deficient environments. In this study, we propose a pathway for the formation of multiple dust rings that will promote planetesimal formation in a subsolar-metallicity disk. We investigate the long-term evolution of a circumstellar disk with 0.1 $Z_{\odot}$ over 750 kyr from its formation stage using two-dimensional thin-disk hydrodynamic simulations. The motion of dust grains is solved separately from the gas, incorporating dust growth and self-consistent radial drift. The disk is initially gravitationally unstable and undergoes intense fragmentation. By 300 kyr, it tends toward a stable state, leaving a single gravitationally bound clump. This clump generates tightly wound spiral arms through its orbital motion. After the clump dissipates at $\sim$410 kyr, the spiral arms transition into axisymmetric substructures under the influence of viscosity. These axisymmetric substructures create local gas pressure bumps that halt the inward radial drift of dust grains, resulting in the formation of multiple-ring-shaped dust distributions. We observe several rings within $\simeq$200 au of the central star, with separations between them on the order of $\sim$10 au, and dust surface density contrasts with inter-ring gaps by factors of $\sim$10-100. We also demonstrate that turbulent viscosities at observationally suggested levels are essential for converting spiral arms into axisymmetric substructures. We speculate that the physical conditions in the dust rings may be conducive to the development of streaming instability and planetesimal formation.</description>

      <title>TOI-2155b: a high-mass brown dwarf near the hydrogen burning mass limit from the TESS mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present TOI-2155 b, a high-mass transiting brown dwarf discovered using data from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission and confirmed with ground-based radial velocity measurements from the Tillinghast Reflector Echelle Spectrograph (TRES). We also analyze ground-based follow-up photometric data from the Wendelstein Observatory (WST), Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope (LCOGT), and Wild Boar Remote Observatory (WBR). TOI-2155 b is a short-period brown dwarf with a period of 3.7246950 +0.0000029/-0.0000028 days. The radius and mass of TOI-2155 b are found to be 0.975 +/- 0.008 Jupiter radii and 81.1 +/- 1.1 Jupiter masses, respectively, corresponding to a density of 110 +/- 3 g/cm3. The effective temperature of the subgiant host star is estimated at 6085 +/- 78 K, which identifies it as an F-type star with a radius of 1.705 +0.066/-0.064 solar radii and a mass of 1.33 +/- 0.008 solar masses. With a mass close to the hydrogen-burning limit, TOI-2155 b occupies a high-mass regime in the brown dwarf mass-radius diagram, making it a valuable benchmark system for testing models of substellar structure and evolution.</description>

      <title>Silicate Precursor Silane detected in Cold Low-Metallicity Brown Dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within 20 pc of the Sun there are currently 29 known cold brown dwarfs, sources with measured distances and an estimated effective temperature between that of Jupiter (170K) and ~500K. These sources are almost all isolated and are the closest laboratories we have for detailed atmospheric studies of giant planets formed outside the solar system. Here we report JWST observations of one such source, WISEA J153429.75-104303.3 (W1534), which we confirm is a substellar mass member of the Galactic halo with a metallicity &lt;0.01xsolar. Its spectrum reveals methane (CH4), water (H2O), and silane (SiH4) gas. Although SiH4 is expected to serve as a key reservoir for the cloud-forming element Si in gas giant worlds, it eluded detection until now because it is removed from observable atmospheres by the formation of silicate clouds at depth. These condensates are favored with increasing metallicity, explaining why SiH4 remains undetected on well studied, metal-rich solar system worlds like Jupiter and Saturn. On the metal-poor world W1534, we detect a clear signature of SiH4 centered at ~4.55 microns with an abundance of 19+/-2 parts per billion (ppb). Our chemical modelling suggests that this SiH4 abundance may be quenched at ~kilobar levels just above the silicate cloud layers, whereupon vertical atmospheric mixing can transport SiH4 to the observable photosphere. The formation and detection of SiH4 demonstrates key coupled relationships between composition, cloud formation, and atmospheric mixing in cold brown dwarf and planetary atmospheres.</description>

      <title>A multi-object approach for studying exoplanet atmospheres using high-resolution spectrographs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric characterization of exoplanets has traditionally relied on Low-Resolution Transmission Spectroscopy (LRTS), obtained from both space- and ground-based facilities, as well as on High-Resolution Transmission Spectroscopy (HRTS). Although HRTS can resolve individual spectral lines, it is subject to normalization degeneracies that limit the accurate retrieval of key atmospheric parameters such as pressure, abundance, and cloud opacity. A promising strategy to mitigate this issue is to combine ground-based HRTS with space-based LRTS. However, this approach depends on two separate datasets, thereby requiring two independent observations. In this study, we explore the feasibility of Multi-Object High-Resolution Transmission Spectroscopy (Mo-HRTS) as a means to constrain atmospheric parameters in retrievals using a single dataset. Through simulations based on existing spectrograph specifications for a well-studied target, we demonstrate that low-resolution broadband transmission spectra can be extracted from Mo-HRTS data.</description>

      <title>Momentum transfer coefficient constraints for the 2024 PDC25 Hypothetical Asteroid Impact Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Epoch 2 of the 2024 PDC25 Hypothetical Asteroid Impact Scenario, an asteroid is confirmed to be on a collision course with the Earth, and its size and surface composition have been well characterized via a flyby mission. A kinetic impactor deflection strategy is the most technologically mature path in order to mitigate this threat. Our goal is to constrain the possible range in momentum transfer coefficients, with implications for the number of impactors and the disruption risk. We conduct a series of numerical simulations, using a shock physics smoothed particle hydrodynamics code, in which we vary the impact velocity, cohesive properties and physical properties (mass / porosity) of the target asteroid. Given a judiciously chosen impactor mass, we show that the momentum transfer coefficient range is capable of a moderate-to-large enhancement of the asteroid deflection, yet keeps the disruption risk firmly at bay. These results are generally unique in having higher impact velocities compared to most previous studies.</description>

      <title>Using SOFIA's EXES to search for C$_6$H$_2$ and C$_4$N$_2$ in Titan's atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Titan's atmosphere, the chemistry of small hydrocarbons and nitriles represent an important link from molecular species to the ubiquitous organic haze that gives Titan its characteristic yellow color. Here we present a new search for two previously undetected molecules, triacetylene (C$_{6}$H$_{2}$) and the gas phase dicyanoacetylene (C$_{4}$N$_{2}$), using the Echelon-Cross-Echelle Spectrograph (EXES) instrument aboard the SOFIA (Stratospheric Observatory For Infrared Astronomy) aircraft. We do not detect these two molecules but determine upper limits for their mixing ratios and column abundances. We find the $3\sigma$ upper limits on the uniform volume mixing ratio (VMR) above 100 km for C$_{6}$H$_{2}$ to be $4.3\times10^{-11}$ which is lower than the photochemical model predictions. This new upper limit suggests that the growth of linear molecules is inhibited. We also put a strict upper limit on the uniform VMR for gas phase C$_{4}$N$_{2}$ above 125 km to be $1.0\times10^{-10}$. This upper limit is well below the saturation mixing ratio at this altitude for C$_{4}$N$_{2}$ and greatly limits the feasibility of C$_{4}$N$_{2}$ forming ice from condensation.</description>

      <title>Models of the night-sky brightness and the efficiency of searching for exoplanets with the microlensing method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze photometric observations of stars, which experienced microlensing events at the considered time, in order to compare the efficiency of detecting exoplanets in observations performed at thirteen different telescopes and with several approaches to the selection of observable events. In constructing an algorithm of the optimal selection of targets for these observations and in comparing the detection efficiencies for several telescopes, we considered models of the night-sky brightness that satisfy the data of infrared observations carried out in 2011 with the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) telescope and the RoboNet telescopes (FTS, FTN, and LT) used to search for planets with the microlensing method. The considered models of the night-sky brightness can be used for various observations (not only microlensing events). The time intervals, during which microlensing events can be observed, were determined with accounting for the positions of the Sun and the Moon and the other constraints on the telescope pointing. Our algorithm allows us to determine the already known microlensing events that are accessible for observation with a particular telescope and to select targets, for which the probability of detecting an exoplanet is maximal. The events, which would maximize the probability of detecting exoplanets, were selected for observations. The probability of detecting an exoplanet is usually proportional to the mirror diameter of a telescope. Telescopes with a wider field of view, such as the OGLE, are more effective in finding new microlensing events. To observe different microlensing events, it is usually better to use different nearby telescopes. However, all such telescopes are often better to use for observing the same event in those relatively short time intervals that correspond to the peak brightness of the event.</description>

      <title>Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk). XX: Constraining the Chemical Tracers of Young Protostellar Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies indicate that the formation of planets in protoplanetary disks begins early in the embedded Class 0/I phases of protostellar evolution. The physical and chemical makeup of the embedded phase can provide valuable insights into the process of star and planet formation. This study aims to provide a thorough overview of the various morphologies for molecular emissions observed on disk scales toward nearby embedded sources. We present high angular resolution (0.1", 15 au) molecular line emissions for $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O, SO, SiO, DCN, CH$_3$OH, H$_2$CO, and c-C$_3$H$_2$ towards 19 nearby protostellar sources in the context of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Large Program "Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk)". Emissions in $^{12}$CO are seen towards all sources and primarily trace outflowing materials. A few sources also show high-velocity jets in SiO emission and high-velocity channel maps of $^{12}$CO. The $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O emissions are well-known tracers of high-density regions and trace the inner envelope and disk regions with clear signs of rotation seen at continuum scales. The large-scale emissions of $^{13}$CO also delineate the outflow cavity walls where the outflowing and infalling materials interact with each other, and exposure to UV radiation leads to the formation of hydrocarbons such as c-C$_3$H$_2$. Both DCN and CH$_3$OH, when detected, show compact emissions from the inner envelope and disk regions that peak at the position of the protostar. The CH$_3$OH emissions are contained within the region of DCN emissions, which suggests that CH$_3$OH traces the hot core regions. Likewise, a few sources also display emissions in CH$_3$OH towards the outflow. Both SO and H$_2$CO show complex morphology among the sources, suggesting that they are formed through multiple processes in protostellar systems.</description>

      <title>A Scatter of Light from a Polarized World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many known exoplanets harbor clouds, which lead to degeneracies in spectroscopic models between particle composition and size. Polarimetry, however, provides independent assessment. Here we report the $7.2 \sigma$ discovery of linearly polarized, scattered light from the hot Jupiter HD 189733b in $B$ band (390 to 475 nm) peaking near quarter phase with $\Delta p = 40.9 \pm 7.1$ ppm. Polarization measurements, obtained with the POLISH2 polarimeter at both Gemini North and the Lick Observatory 3-m, are best explained by silicate (SiO$_2$ or MgSiO$_3$) particles with effective radius $r_\text{eff}=0.038^{+0.047}_{-0.023}$ $\mu$m ($90\%$ confidence). This is broadly consistent with results from both Hubble transmission spectroscopy and JWST secondary eclipse spectroscopy suggesting small, SiO$_2$ scattering particles. It is difficult to reconcile large polarization and moderate Hubble secondary eclipse depth via pure Rayleigh, silicate, or MnS scatterers. The measured polarization of HD 189733b is detected with such high confidence that we place a $2\sigma$ lower limit on its $B$ band geometric albedo of $A_g &gt; 0.26$ with a preferred value of $A_g = 0.6$. This is larger than the prior estimate of $A_g = 0.226 \pm 0.091$ from Hubble secondary eclipse photometry, and it presents HD 189733b as one of the most reflective known exoplanets in $B$ band. It also validates Rayleigh scattering from the exoplanet, as opposed to starspot contamination, as the cause of HD 189733's blue optical slope in transmission spectroscopy. Assuming other known exoplanets harbor atmospheres like HD 189733b, we model dozens to be detectable with at least $5 \sigma$ confidence after one week of Gemini time each.</description>

      <title>Spectra of Earth-like exoplanets with different rotation periods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the spectra of Earth-like planets but with different axial rotation periods. Using the general circulation model of the atmosphere and considering the atmospheric circulation lasting for two years, we calculated the radiation spectra of the Earth and the exo-Earth rotating with periods of 1 and 100 days, respectively. The radiation spectra of the atmospheres were calculated with the SBDART code. We analyzed the spectrum of upward radiation at altitudes of 1 and 11 km in wavelength ranges of 1 to 18 and 0.3 to 1 micron. The following common features were obtained for the Earth and the exo-Earth: (1) the planets exhibit a wide absorption band of CO2 around 14 micron; (2) the radiation spectra at different locations near the equator show no significant differences; and (3) if the spectrum is integrated over the entire disk of the Earth/exo-Earth, the difference in the spectral signal obtained in observations from different directions becomes substantially lower than the difference between the results of observations of individual regions of the planets. The differences in the spectra of exoplanets, which differ from the Earth only in axial rotation period, are comparable to the differences associated with changes in the angle of viewing the planet. Consequently, if the observation angle is not known, the analysis of the spectrum of the planet cannot be used to determine its axial rotation period. The maximal differences in the spectra of Earth-like exoplanets were obtained for wavelengths of about 5-10 and 13-16 micron. By analyzing the spectrum at wavelengths around 9.4-10 micron, we can determine whether the atmosphere of the exoplanet contains ozone or not. Since ozone is essential for life, the 9.4-10 micron band may be important for future observations of Earth-like exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Sub-Neptune Frontier with JWST</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sub-Neptune planets, with sizes and masses between those of Earth and Neptune, dominate the exoplanet population. Sub-Neptunes are expected to be the most diverse family of the exoplanet population, potentially including rocky gas dwarfs, water worlds, and mini-Neptunes, with a wide range of atmospheric, surface and interior conditions. With no analogue in the solar system, these planets open fundamental questions in planetary processes, origins, and habitability, and present new avenues in the search for life elsewhere. Atmospheric observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are enabling unprecedented characterization of sub-Neptunes, starting with the first detections of carbon-bearing molecules in the habitable zone sub-Neptune K2-18 b. We survey the present landscape of JWST observations and atmospheric inferences of sub-Neptunes, which in turn provide key insights into their atmospheric processes, internal structures, surface conditions, formation pathways and potential habitability. The atmospheric abundance constraints reveal evidence of chemical disequilibria, and insights into the planetary mass-metallicity relation in the sub-Neptune regime. Similarly, for sub-Neptunes with H$_2$O-rich interiors, increasing atmospheric H$_2$O abundances with the equilibrium temperature may indicate the existence of a critical temperature for transition from H$_2$ dominated atmospheres with tropospheric cold traps to those with steamy atmospheres. The chemical abundances also provide initial evidence for diverse planet types, from potentially habitable hycean worlds to steam worlds with super critical water layers. These planet types serve as benchmarks for an emerging taxonomy of volatile-rich sub-Neptunes as a function of their equilibrium temperature and atmospheric extent, heralding a new era of chemical classification of low-mass exoplanets with JWST.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding low-mass planets around solar-type stars requires to understand the physical variability of the host star, which greatly exceeds the planet-induced radial-velocity modulation. This project aims at analyzing - observationally and theoretically - the character and physical origins of fluctuations in solar photospheric absorption lines. Observationally, photospheric equivalent-width variations were measured in 1000 selected spectra from three years of HARPS-N data of the Sun-as-a-star, showing changes that largely shadow the chromospheric CaII H&amp;K activity-cycle signal, but with much smaller amplitudes on sub-percent levels. Among iron lines, the greatest are for FeII in the blue, while the trends change sign among lines in the green MgI triplet and between Balmer lines. No variation was seen in the semi-forbidden MgI 457.1 nm. Theoretically, hydrodynamic 3D modeling of solar surface convection produced time sequences of synthetic high-resolution spectral atlases. Radial velocities averaged over small simulation areas jitter by some +-150 m/s, scaling to 2 m/s for the full solar disk on timescales of granular convection. Among different lines, jittering is in phase, but amplitudes differ by about one tenth of their values: greater for stronger and for ionized lines, decreasing at longer wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Tidally-Controlled Fragmentation around Black Holes, Massive Clumps, Protostars, and the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravity plays important roles at multiple scales in the universe. An important, yet often neglected, role of gravity is its ability in driving anisotropic fragmentation through tides. When tides dominate, fragmentation becomes anisotropic, and the Jeans length along the short axis, $l_{\rm tidal, Jeans}$, is approximately $\sigma_{\rm v}/\sqrt{G \rho_{\rm mean}}$, determined by the external tides through the mean density $\rho_{\rm mean}$. We compare predictions of $l_{\rm tidal, Jeans}$ against observational results in massive star-forming clumps, the Circumnuclear Disk (CND) around the supermassive black hole Sgr A* at the center of the Galaxy, the Central Molecular Zone in the Galactic Center, a hub-filament system, and a streamer around a young star. We find that the observed widths of these filamentary structures match theoretical predictions from tidally-controlled Jeans fragmentation. The formation of filaments can potentially shield cold gas against radiation pressure and photoevaporation, as well as hydrodynamical interaction with the ambient medium, potentially enabling the cold gas to survive. Thus, tidal forces are major players regulating gas transport around massive objects.</description>

      <title>Lunar Time Ephemeris $\texttt{LTE440}$: definitions, algorithm and performance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robotic and human activities in the cislunar space are expected to rapidly increase in the future. Modeling, jointly analysis and sharing of time measurements made in the vicinity of the Moon might indispensably demand calculating a lunar time scale and transforming it into other time scales. For users, we present a ready-to-use software package of Lunar Time Ephemeris $\texttt{LTE440}$ that can calculate the Lunar Coordinate Time (TCL) and its relations with the Barycentric Coordinate Time (TCB) and the Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB). According to the International Astronomical Union Resolutions on relativistic time scales, we numerically calculate the relativistic time-dilation integral in the transformation between TCL and TCB/TDB with the JPL ephemeris DE440 including the gravitational contributions from the Sun, all planets, the main belt asteroids and the Kuiper belt objects, and export data files in the SPICE format. At a conservative estimate, $\texttt{LTE440}$ has an accuracy better than 0.15 ns before 2050 and a numerical precision at the level of 1 ps over its entire time span. The secular drifts between the coordinate times in $\texttt{LTE440}$ are respectively estimated as $\langle \mathrm{d}\,\mathrm{TCL}/\mathrm{d}\,\mathrm{TCB}\rangle=1-1.482\,536\,216\,7\times10^{-8}$ and $\langle \mathrm{d}\,\mathrm{TCL}/\mathrm{d}\,\mathrm{TDB}\rangle=1+6.798\,355\,24\times10^{-10}$. Its most significant periodic variations are an annual term with amplitude of 1.65 ms and a monthly term with amplitude of 126 $\mu$s. $\texttt{LTE440}$ might satisfy most of current needs and is publicly available.</description>

      <title>WaveDriver: a Laser Guide Star AO System for HWO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: HWO's Tier 1 Contrast Stability Technology Gap presents a key challenge for technology development in the coming years, requiring to a &gt;100x more stable system than JWST. WaveDriver is a concept for a laser guide star spacecraft coupled to an adaptive optics (AO) system onboard HWO that would enable HWO to reach its picometer-level wavefront stability requirements while relaxing other HWO subsystem requirements. At LLNL and UCSC we are revisiting the concept initially proposed by Douglas et al. (2019). We present results from our project's first year, including (1) AO control developments, including with Linear Quadratic Gaussian control and machine learning, (2) AO wavefront sensor (WFS) trade study simulations, and (3) simulations, fabrication, and testing of a 133-port photonic lantern WFS/spectrograph. A key finding from our work is that WaveDriver could be needed to enable HWO's primary mirror segment stability and/or low order wavefront stability requirements.</description>

      <title>3D Macro Physics and Light Odd-Z Element Production in O-C Shell Mergers: Implications for $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ production and radiogenic heating inventories of rocky exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The light odd-Z elements P, Cl, K, and Sc are underproduced in galactic chemical evolution models compared to spectroscopic observations of stars in the Milky Way. The most promising solution to this puzzle is that some massive stars experience O-C shell mergers boosting their yields through dynamic, convective-reactive nucleosynthesis. We report how convective macro physics based on 3D $4\pi$ hydrodynamic simulations impacts production in the O shell by post-processing the $\mathrm{M_{ZAMS}}=15~\mathrm{M_\odot}$ $Z=0.02$ model from the NuGrid dataset. We explore a mixing downturn, boosted velocities, reduced ingestion rate, and convective quenching. Across 24 mixing cases, the pre-explosive yields for [P/Fe], [Cl/Fe], [K/Fe], and [Sc/Fe] are modified by $[-0.33,0.23]~\mathrm{dex}$, $[-0.84,0.64]~\mathrm{dex}$, $[-0.78,1.48]~\mathrm{dex}$, and $[-0.36,1.29]~\mathrm{dex}$, respectively. Cases with a convective downturn with the fastest ingestion rate have the largest enhancement, and production is non-monotonic with boosted velocities. Which reactions are most important for the convective-reactive element production pathways depends on the mixing. We parameterize production of $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ ($t_{1/2} = 1.248~\mathrm{Gyr}$), an important radiogenic heat source for younger ($2{-}3~\mathrm{Gyr}$) rocky planets and find a yield variation exceeding three orders of magnitude. This range of initial abundances for $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ implies the early geodynamic behaviour of silicate mantles in rocky planets can differ greatly from that of Earth. These results underscore the importance of investigating the 3D macro physics of shell merger convection through hydrodynamic simulations to develop a predictive understanding of the origin and variability of the light odd-Z elements and the $^{40}\mathrm{K}/\mathrm{K}$ ratio in planet host stars.</description>

      <title>Microphysical Regulation of Non-Ideal MHD in Weakly-Ionized Systems: Does the Hall Effect Matter?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations plus 'non-ideal' (Ohmic, Hall, ambipolar) resistivities are widely used to model weakly-ionized astrophysical systems. We show that if gradients in the magnetic field become too steep, the implied charge drift speeds become much faster than microphysical signal speeds, invalidating the assumptions used to derive both the resistivities and MHD equations themselves. Generically this situation will excite microscale instabilities that suppress the drift and current. We show this could be relevant at low ionization fractions especially if Hall terms appear significant, external forces induce supersonic motions, or dust grains become a dominant charge carrier. Considering well-established treatments of super-thermal drifts in laboratory, terrestrial, and Solar plasmas as well as conduction and viscosity models, we generalize a simple prescription to rectify these issues, where the resistivities are multiplied by a correction factor that depends only on already-known macroscopic quantities. This is generalized for multi-species and weakly-ionized systems, and leaves the equations unchanged in the drift limits for which they are derived, but restores physical behavior (driving the system back towards slow drift by diffusing away small-scale gradients in the magnetic field) if the limits are violated. This has important consequences: restoring intuitive behaviors such as the system becoming hydrodynamic in the limit of zero ionization; suppressing magnetic structure on scales below a critical length which can comparable to circumstellar disk sizes; limiting the maximum magnetic amplification; and suppressing the effects of the Hall term in particular. This likely implies that the Hall term does not become dynamically important under most conditions of interest in these systems.</description>

      <title>SPORES-HWO. II. Companion Mass Limits and Updated Planet Properties for 120 Future Exoplanet Imaging Targets from 35 Years of Precise Doppler Monitoring</title>

Abstract: One goal of the future Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) is to directly image and spectroscopically characterize $\sim$25 true Earth analogs. However, if a large fraction of HWO target stars host unknown disruptive giant planets in their habitable zones (HZs), then additional targets that are farther away will need to be added to the survey, potentially requiring a larger-aperture telescope and a coronagraph with a smaller inner working angle (IWA). Therefore, the sooner we constrain the presence of massive planets orbiting potential HWO target stars, the easier and less costly it will be to adjust key aspects of HWO's architecture. In this work, we uniformly analyze over 153,000 public archival radial velocity (RV) observations of 120 potential HWO target stars to derive mass limits on planetary companions. The RVs were measured by 23 high-precision spectrographs located at 15 observatories around the world, with the first data going back to 1987. Based on empirical search completeness tests, we determine that undetected Jupiter-mass (Saturn-mass) planets may be hiding in up to 38% (53%) of the HZs of targets in the ExEP Mission Star List. The median mass sensitivity limit in the middle of the conservative HZ is approximately 48 M$_\oplus$. We also provide updated orbital parameters for 53 known companions, and we detect 4 planet candidates and 26 signals corresponding to stellar activity. We note that 44 of the ExEP stars lack substantial RV monitoring history, and we advocate for community-coordinated observing campaigns of these stars using moderate-precision RV facilities.</description>

      <title>The Gradient of Mean Molecular Weight Across the Radius Valley</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photo-evaporation shapes the observed radii of small exoplanets and constrains the underlying distributions of atmospheric and core masses. However, the diversity of atmospheric chemistries corresponding to these distributions remains unelucidated. We develop a first-principles carbon-hydrogen-oxygen-sulfur-silicon (CHOSSi) outgassing model that accounts for non-ideal gas behavior (via fugacities) at high pressures, as well as the tendency for water and hydrogen to dissolve in melt (via solubility laws). We use data-driven radius valley constraints to establish the relationship between the atmospheric surface pressures and melt temperatures of sub-Neptunes. Sub-Neptunes with less massive rocky cores retain less of their primordial hydrogen envelopes, which leads to less heat retention and diminished melt temperatures at the surfaces of these cores. Lower melt temperatures lead thermodynamically to the dominance of carbon-, oxygen-, sulfur- and silicon-bearing molecules over molecular hydrogen, which naturally produce a diversity of mean molecular weights. Our geochemical outgassing calculations robustly predict a gradient of mean molecular weight across the radius valley, where the strength of this gradient is primarily driven by the oxygen fugacity of the molten cores and not by the carbon enrichment (or "metallicity") of the atmosphere. Smaller sub-Neptunes are predicted to have less hydrogen-dominated atmospheres. The precise relationship between the observed and outgassed chemistries requires an understanding of how convection near the core interacts with large-scale atmospheric circulation (driven by stellar heating) near the photosphere, as well as the influence of photochemistry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21402v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS is expected to arrive at a distance of $53.56(\pm 0.45)$ million ${\rm km}$ ($0.358\pm 0.003$~au) from Jupiter on March 16, 2026. We show that applying a total thrust $\Delta$V of $2.6755 {{\rm km~s^{-1}}}$ to lower perijove on September 9, 2025 and then execute a Jupiter Oberth Maneuver, can bring the Juno spacecraft from its orbit around Jupiter to intercept the path of 3I/ATLAS on March 14, 2026. We further show that it is possible for Juno to come much closer to 3I/ATLAS ($\sim{27}$ million km) with 110 kg of remaining propellant, merely 5.4% of the initial fuel reservoir. We find that for low available $\Delta$V there is no particular benefit in application of a double impulse (for example to reach $\sim{27}$ million km from 3I/ATLAS), however if Juno has a higher $\Delta$V capability there is significant advantage to a second impulse with typically a saving of propellant by a factor of a half. A close fly-by might be able to probe the nature of 3I/ATLAS far better than telescopes on Earth.</description>

Abstract: Ultra-short period (USP) exoplanets -- with $R_p \leq 2~$R$_{\oplus}$ and periods $\leq$1 day -- are expected to be stripped of volatile atmospheres by intense host star irradiation, which is corroborated by their nominal bulk densities and previous eclipse observations consistent with bare rock surfaces. However, a few USP planets appear anomalously under-dense relative to an Earth-like composition, suggesting an exotic interior structure (e.g., core-less) or a volatile-rich secondary atmosphere increasing their apparent radius. Here we present the first dayside emission spectrum of the low density (4.3$\pm$0.4 g~cm$^{-3}$) ultra-short period planet TOI-561 b, which orbits an iron-poor, alpha-rich, $\sim$10 Gyr old thick disk star. Our 3-5 $\mu$m JWST/NIRSpec observations demonstrate the dayside of TOI-561 b is inconsistent with a bare-rock surface at high statistical significance, suggesting instead a thick volatile envelope that is cooling the dayside to well below the $\sim$3000 K expected in the bare rock or thin atmosphere case. These results reject the popular hypothesis of complete atmospheric desiccation for highly irradiated exoplanets and support predictions that planetary-scale magma oceans can retain substantial reservoirs of volatiles, opening the geophysical study of ultra-hot super-Earths through the lens of their atmospheres.</description>
