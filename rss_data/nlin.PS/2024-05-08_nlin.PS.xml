      <title>Predicting positon solutions of a family of Nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equations through Deep Learning algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a hierarchy of nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equations (NLSEs) and forecast the evolution of positon solutions using a deep learning approach called Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINN). Notably, the PINN algorithm accurately predicts positon solutions not only in the standard NLSE but also in other higher order versions, including cubic, quartic and quintic NLSEs. The PINN approach also effectively handles two coupled NLSEs and two coupled Hirota equations. In addition to the above, we report exact second-order positon solutions of the sextic NLSE and coupled generalized NLSE. These solutions are not available in the existing literature and we construct them through generalized Darboux transformation method. Further, we utilize PINNs to forecast their behaviour as well. To validate PINN's accuracy, we compare the predicted solutions with exact solutions obtained from analytical methods. The results show high fidelity and low mean squared error in the predictions generated by our PINN model.</description>

      <title>Riemann problem for polychromatic soliton gases: a testbed for the spectral kinetic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use Riemann problem for soliton gas as a benchmark for a detailed numerical validation of the spectral kinetic theory for the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) and the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger (fNLS) equations. We construct weak solutions to the kinetic equation for soliton gas describing collision of two dense "polychromatic" soliton gases composed of a finite number of "monochromatic" components, each consisting of solitons with nearly identical spectral parameters of the scattering operator in the Lax pair. The interaction between the gas components plays the key role in the emergent, large-scale hydrodynamic evolution. We then use the solutions of the spectral kinetic equation to evaluate macroscopic physical observables in KdV and fNLS soliton gases and compare them with the respective ensemble averages extracted from the "exact" soliton gas numerical solutions of the KdV and fNLS equations. To numerically synthesise dense polychromatic soliton gases we develop a new method which combines recent advances in the spectral theory of the so-called soliton condensates and the effective algorithms for the numerical realisation of $n$-soliton solutions with large $n$.</description>

      <title>Energy-based theory of autoresonance in chains of coupled damped-driven generic oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An energy-based theory of autoresonance in driven dissipative chains of coupled generic oscillators is discussed on the basis of a variational principle concerning the energy functional. The theory is applied to chains of delayed Duffing-Ueda oscillators and the equations that together govern the autoresonance forces and solutions are derived and solved analytically for generic values of parameters and initial conditions, including the case of quenched time-delay disorder. Remarkably, the presence of retarded potentials with time-delayed feedback drastically modify the autoresonance scenario preventing the growth of the energy oscillation over specific regions of the parameter space. Additionally, effective harmonic forces with a slowly varying frequency are derived from the exact autoresonant excitations and the effectiveness of the theory is demonstrated at suppressing the chaos induced by homogeneous periodic excitations in such oscillator chains. Numerical experiments confirmed all the theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Convergence Rate of the Hypersonic Similarity for Two-Dimensional Steady Potential Flows with Large Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the optimal convergence rate of the hypersonic similarity for two-dimensional steady potential flows with {\it large data} past over a straight wedge in the $BV\cap L^1$ framework, provided that the total variation of the large data multiplied by $\gamma-1+\frac{a_{\infty}^2}{M_\infty^2}$ is uniformly bounded with respect to the adiabatic exponent $\gamma&gt;1$, the Mach number $M_\infty$ of the incoming steady flow, and the hypersonic similarity parameter $a_\infty$. Our main approach in this paper is first to establish the Standard Riemann Semigroup of the initial-boundary value problem for the isothermal hypersonic small disturbance equations with large data and then to compare the Riemann solutions between two systems with boundary locally case by case. Based on them, we derive the global $L^1$--estimate between the two solutions by employing the Standard Riemann Semigroup and the local $L^1$--estimates. We further construct an example to show that the convergence rate is optimal.</description>

      <title>Quench dynamics of Wannier-Stark states in an active synthetic photonic lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic emulators have facilitated the investigation of numerous solid-state phenomena and have contributed to the development of optical devices inspired by quantum mechanics. Although current photonic emulators are constrained to bosonic behavior with local interactions, the utilization of active synthetic lattices holds promise for surpassing these limitations. In this study, we propose employing the modulated ring fast-gain laser as a foundation for emulating quench dynamics within a synthetic lattice that conforms to equal density filling of its reciprocal space. To illustrate the effectiveness of this emulation platform, we subject a dispersed Wannier-Stark ladder to quenching and directly observe oscillations, enabled by the fast-gain, along with their coherent stabilization to a single Wannier stark state. These coherent dynamics stem directly from our lasers liquid state of light, a characteristic resulting from fast-gain and explained by the rapid decay of fluctuations occurring on the system's shortest timescale. Additionally, by adequately biasing the lattice through detuning the modulation from the cavity resonance, this process supports oscillatory dynamics within the synthetic space.</description>

      <title>Kerr nonlinearity effect on the stability of Wannier-Stark states in active optical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper provides an analytical and numerical investigation of the dynamics of a one-dimensional chain of coupled optical resonators with conservative cubic nonlinearity and the gain saturated by nonlinear losses. The linear dependency of the resonator eigenfrequencies on their indexes makes it possible to use Wannier-Stark states as lasing modes. Numerical simulations have shown that the dependency of the resonant frequencies on the light intensity strongly affects the stability of Wannier-Stark states. To explain the observed destabilization of monochromatic lasing based on Wannier-Stark states a simple perturbation theory has been developed and compared with the data obtained in the numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Phase-induced vortex pinning in rotating supersolid dipolar systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the pinning of vortices for a stationary rotating dipolar supersolid along the low-density paths between droplets as a function of the rotation frequency. We restrict ourselves to the stationary configurations of vortices with the same symmetry as that of the array of droplets. Our approach exploits the fact that the wave function of each droplet acquires a linear phase on the coordinates, and hence the relative phases between neighboring droplets allows us to predict the position of the vortices. For a confined system, the estimate accurately reproduces the Gross-Pitaevskii results in the spatial regions where the neighboring droplets are well defined.</description>

      <title>Emergence of rogue-like waves in a reaction-diffusion system: Stochastic output from deterministic dissipative dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18349v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rogue waves are an intriguing nonlinear phenomenon arising across different scales, ranging from ocean waves through optics to Bose-Einstein condensates. We describe the emergence of rogue-like wave dynamics in a reaction-diffusion system that arise as a result of a subcritical Turing instability. This state is present in a regime where all time-independent states are unstable, and consists of intermittent excitation of spatially localized spikes, followed by collapse to an unstable state and subsequent regrowth. We characterize the spatiotemporal organization of spikes and show that in sufficiently large domains the dynamics are consistent with a memoryless process.</description>
