      <title>Thermodynamic consistency and fluctuations in mesoscopic stochastic simulations of reactive gas mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is essential that mesoscopic simulations of reactive systems reproduce the correct statistical distributions at thermodynamic equilibrium. By considering a compressible fluctuating hydrodynamics (FHD) simulation method of ideal gas mixtures undergoing reversible reactions described by the chemical Langevin equations, we show that thermodynamic consistency in reaction rates and the use of instantaneous temperatures for the evaluation of reaction rates is required for fluctuations for the overall system to be correct. We then formulate the required properties of a thermodynamically-consistent reaction (TCR) model. As noted in the literature, while reactions are often discussed in terms of forward and reverse rates, these rates should not be modeled independently because they must be compatible with thermodynamic equilibrium for the system. Using a simple TCR model where each chemical species has constant heat capacity, we derive the explicit condition that the forward and reverse reaction rate constants must satisfy in order for the system to be thermodynamically consistent. We perform equilibrium and non-equilibrium simulations of ideal gas mixtures undergoing a reversible dimerization reaction to measure the fluctuational behavior of the system numerically. We confirm that FHD simulations with the TCR model give the correct static structure factor of equilibrium fluctuations. For the statistically steady simulation of a gas mixture between two isothermal walls with different temperatures, we show using the TCR model that the temperature variance agrees with the corresponding thermodynamic-equilibrium temperature variance in the interior of the system, whereas noticeable deviations are present in regions near walls, where chemistry is far from equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Precision frequency comb spectroscopy of the $^{14}$N$_{2}$O, $^{14}$N$^{15}$NO, $^{15}$N$^{14}$NO, and $^{15}$N$_{2}$O isotopocules in the 3300-3550 cm$^{-1}$ range</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nitrous oxide is a long-lived greenhouse gas. Its isotopic composition provides valuable insights into sources and sinks, and about the mechanism of formation. A major challenge in the spectroscopic analysis of the isotopocule compositions is the availability of accurate spectroscopic parameters, particularly for the minor $^{15}$N isotopocules. In this work, we introduce high-resolution spectroscopic measurements of four isotopocules of nitrous oxide: $^{14}$N$_{2}$O, $^{14}$N$^{15}$NO, $^{15}$N$^{14}$NO, and $^{15}$N$_{2}$O in the mid-infrared range of 3300 - 3550 cm$^{-1}$, using a frequency comb-based Fourier transform spectrometer. The nitrous oxide samples were obtained from a chemical synthesis involving acid-catalyzed amine-borane reduction of equimolar amounts of $^{15}$N isotopically enriched sodium nitrite and $^{14}$N sodium nitrite. The high-resolution spectra, measured in a temperature-controlled single-pass absorption cell, were used to retrieve line center frequencies and relative intensities for a total of 426 rovibrational transitions of the ${\nu}$$_{1}$ + ${\nu}$$_{3}$ band of the four isotopocules, and of the one order of magnitude weaker 2${\nu}$$_{2}$ + ${\nu}$$_{3}$ and ${\nu}$$_{1}$ + ${\nu}$$_{2}$ + ${\nu}$$_{3}$ - ${\nu}$$_{2}$ bands in the same spectral region. We compare the determined line center frequencies and relative intensities with spectroscopic parameters available in high-resolution molecular databases. For $^{14}$N$_{2}$O, $^{14}$N$^{15}$NO and $^{15}$N$^{14}$NO we find good agreement with the HITRAN database. The $^{15}$N$_{2}$O isotopocule is missing in HITRAN, and we find that its line center frequencies in the GEISA database, the Institute of Atmospheric Optics database, as well as the Ames-1 line list deviate severely from the comb measurements.</description>

      <title>Theory of Frequency Fluctuation of Intramolecular Vibration in Solution Phase: Application to C--N Stretching Mode of Organic Compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate frequency fluctuations of intramolecular vibrations of a solute by exploring the fluctuation of the electrostatic potential by solvents. We present a numerical methodology for estimating the frequency fluctuations; the methodology is based on the reference interaction site model self-consistent field with constrained spatial electron density distribution, a the theoretical model of solvation fields based on classical statistic mechanics. By applying the present theory to the C--N stretching vibrations of several nitrile compounds, our estimated frequency fluctuation scale and bandwidth shift by changing solvent kinds reproduced the experimental data. Further, we regard the standard deviation of the electrostatic potential as the multiple random variables for analyzing the frequency fluctuations. Our results reveal that the dominant fluctuation of the electrostatic field is almost parallel to the vibrational axis. Additionally, the fluctuations of electrostatic potential become spatially nonuniform as the solvents form stronger hydrogen bonds with the solute. The development of the solvation field confirms that the nonuniformity of the electrostatic field is crucial to the frequency fluctuation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Chemical Density Matrix Renormalization Group Method Boosted by Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate electronic structure calculations are essential in modern materials science, but strongly correlated systems pose a significant challenge due to their computational cost. Traditional methods, such as complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF), scale exponentially with system size, while alternative methods like the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) scale more favorably, yet remain limited for large systems. In this work, we demonstrate how a simple machine learning model can enhance quantum chemical DMRG calculations, improving their accuracy to chemical precision, even for systems that would otherwise require considerably higher computational resources. The systems under study are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which are typical candidates for DMRG calculations and are highly relevant for advanced technological applications.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent density-functional study of hydrogen adsorption and scattering on graphene surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-dependent density-functional theory simulations are performed to examine the effects of varying incident points and kinetic energies of hydrogen atom projectiles on a graphene-like structure. The simulations reveal that the incident point significantly influences the hydrogen atom's kinetic energy post-interaction, the vibrational dynamics of the graphene lattice, and the scattering angles. Incident points that do not directly collide with carbon atoms result in prolonged interaction times and reduced energy transfer, increasing the likelihood of overcoming the graphene's potential energy barrier and hydrogen atom adsorption. The study also explores the role of initial kinetic energy in determining adsorption, scattering, or transmission outcomes. These results emphasize the critical influence of initial parameters on the hydrogenation process and provide a foundation for future experimental validation and further exploration of hydrogen-graphene interactions.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian simulation-based quantum-selected configuration interaction for large-scale electronic structure calculations with a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum-selected configuration interaction (QSCI) is one of the most promising approaches for quantum chemical calculations with the current pre-fault tolerant quantum computers. In the conventional QSCI, the Slater determinants used for the wave function expansion are sampled by iteratively performing approximate wave function preparation and subsequent measurement in the computational basis, and then the subspace Hamiltonian matrix is diagonalized on a classical computer. In this approach, the preparation of a high-quality approximate wave function is necessary to compute total energies accurately. In this work, we propose a Hamiltonian simulation-based QSCI (HSB-QSCI) to avoid this difficulty. In the HSB-QSCI, the Slater determinants are sampled from quantum states generated by the real-time evolution of approximate wave functions. We provide numerical simulations for the spin-singlet ground state and the first excited spin-triplet state of oligoacenes (benzene, naphthalene, and anthracene), phenylene-1,4-dinitrene, and hexa-1,2,3,4,5-pentaene molecules; these results reveal that the HSB-QSCI is applicable not only to molecules where the Hartree--Fock provides a good approximation of the ground state, but also to strongly correlated systems with multiconfigurational characteristics (i.e., the case where preparing a high-quality approximate wave function is hard). We have also numerically confirmed that the HSB-QSCI is robust to approximation errors of the Hamiltonian simulation, such as Trotter errors and the truncation errors of Hamiltonian term by maximum locality in the localized molecular orbital basis. Hardware demonstrations of the HSB-QSCI are also reported for the hexa-1,2,3,4,5-pentaene molecule using 20 qubits IBM superconducting device. The differences between the HSB-QSCI energy and the CAS-CI value are at most 0.15 kcal mol$^{-1}$, achieving chemical precision.</description>

      <title>Watching lanthanide nanoparticles one at a time: characterization of their photoluminescence dynamics at the single nanoparticle level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lanthanide nanoparticles (LnNPs) feature sharp emission lines together with millisecond emission lifetimes which makes them promising luminescent probes for biosensing and bioimaging. Although LnNPs are gathering a large interest, their photoluminescence properties at the single nanoparticle level remain largely unexplored. Here, we employ fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and photoluminescence burst analysis to investigate the photodynamics of Sm and Eu-based LnNPs with single nanoparticle sensitivity and microsecond resolution. By recording the photoluminescence intensity and the number of contributing LnNPs, we compute the photoluminescence brightness per individual nanoparticle, and estimate the actual number of emitting centers per nanoparticle. Our approach overcomes the challenges associated with ensemble-averaged techniques and provides insights into LnNP photodynamics. Moreover, we demonstrate our microscope capability to detect and analyze LnNPs at the single nanoparticle level, monitoring both photoluminescence brightness and burst duration. These findings expand our understanding of LnNPs and pave the way for their advanced biosensing applications at the single nanoparticle level.</description>

      <title>Cogwheel phase cycling in population-detected optical coherent multidimensional spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An integral procedure in every coherent multidimensional spectroscopy experiment is to suppress undesired background signals. For that purpose, one can employ a particular phase-matching geometry or phase cycling, a procedure that was adapted from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. In optical multidimensional spectroscopy, phase cycling has been usually carried out in a "nested" fashion, where pulse phases are incremented sequentially with linearly spaced increments. Another phase-cycling approach which was developed for NMR spectroscopy is "cogwheel phase cycling," where all pulse phases are varied simultaneously in increments defined by so-called "winding numbers". Here we explore the concept of cogwheel phase cycling in the context of population-based coherent multidimensional spectroscopy. We derive selection rules for resolving and extracting fourth-order and higher-order nonlinear signals by cogwheel phase cycling and describe how to perform a numerical search for the winding numbers for various population-detected 2D spectroscopy experiments. We also provide an expression for a numerical search for nested phase-cycling schemes and predict the most economical schemes of both approaches for a wide range of nonlinear signals. The signal selectivity of the technique is demonstrated experimentally by acquiring rephasing and nonrephasing fourth-order signals of a laser dye by both phase-cycling approaches. We find that individual nonlinear signal contributions are, in most cases, captured with fewer steps by cogwheel phase cycling compared to nested phase cycling.</description>

      <title>Steering Non-Equilibrium Molecular Dynamics in Optical Cavities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical resonators have shown outstanding abilities to tailor chemical landscapes through enhanced light-matter interaction between confined optical modes and molecule vibrations. We propose a theoretical model to study cooperative vibrational strong coupling in an open quantum system. The non-equilibrium stochastic molecular dynamics in an optical cavity with an auxiliary ensemble is investigated. It shows that coupling with a cavity mode introduces an additional colored noise and a negative feedback, both of which enable control over thermalization rates (i.e. the lifetime of excitation) of reactive molecules. Our work offers a pathway to steer stability of chemical bonds for chemical reactivity under cooperative vibrational strong coupling.</description>

      <title>A unified framework for coarse grained molecular dynamics of proteins with high-fidelity reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17513v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating large proteins using traditional molecular dynamics (MD) is computationally demanding. To address this challenge, we propose a novel tree-structured coarse-grained model that efficiently captures protein dynamics. By leveraging a hierarchical protein representation, our model accurately reconstructs high-resolution protein structures, with sub-angstrom precision achieved for a 168-amino acid protein. We combine this coarse-grained model with a deep learning framework based on stochastic differential equations (SDEs). A neural network is trained to model the drift force, while a RealNVP-based noise generator approximates the stochastic component. This approach enables a significant speedup of over 20,000 times compared to traditional MD, allowing for the generation of microsecond-long trajectories within a few minutes and providing valuable insights into protein behavior. Our method demonstrates high accuracy, achieving sub-angstrom reconstruction for short (25 ns) trajectories and maintaining statistical consistency across multiple independent simulations.</description>

      <title>Influence of light, temperature and iron oxidation state on the dissolution rate of combusted iron particles in oxalic acid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, the influence of temperature $(40-80 ^\circ\mathrm{C})$ and light exposure on the dissolution of combusted iron particles in aqueous oxalic acid $(0.45~\mathrm{mol/L})$ is experimentally investigated. Unlike previous studies, real combusted iron particles with varying fuel-to-air equivalence ratios were used instead of model oxides. In-situ video recordings reveal the evolution of particle size and morphology. Increasing temperature and short-wavelength light exposure enhance the reaction rate, with light-induced effects only becoming significant above $40 ^\circ$C for the duration of the experiments. This behavior differs significantly from hematite/maghemite oxides, attributed to the internal Fe phase structure of the combusted iron particles. At $80^\circ$C with additional light irradiation, a sudden decrease in reaction rate is observed due to solid ferrous oxide formation. While the fuel-to-air ratio induces differences in iron oxide phase composition, it does not affect the dissolution combusted iron particles significantly.</description>

Abstract: The integration of deep learning, particularly AI-Generated Content, with high-quality data derived from ab initio calculations has emerged as a promising avenue for transforming the landscape of scientific research. However, the challenge of designing molecular drugs or materials that incorporate multi-modality prior knowledge remains a critical and complex undertaking. Specifically, achieving a practical molecular design necessitates not only meeting the diversity requirements but also addressing structural and textural constraints with various symmetries outlined by domain experts. In this article, we present an innovative approach to tackle this inverse design problem by formulating it as a multi-modality guidance optimization task. Our proposed solution involves a textural-structure alignment symmetric diffusion framework for the implementation of molecular optimization tasks, namely 3DToMolo. 3DToMolo aims to harmonize diverse modalities including textual description features and graph structural features, aligning them seamlessly to produce molecular structures adhere to specified symmetric structural and textural constraints by experts in the field. Experimental trials across three guidance optimization settings have shown a superior hit optimization performance compared to state-of-the-art methodologies. Moreover, 3DToMolo demonstrates the capability to discover potential novel molecules, incorporating specified target substructures, without the need for prior knowledge. This work not only holds general significance for the advancement of deep learning methodologies but also paves the way for a transformative shift in molecular design strategies. 3DToMolo creates opportunities for a more nuanced and effective exploration of the vast chemical space, opening new frontiers in the development of molecular entities with tailored properties and functionalities.</description>

      <title>From Biased to Unbiased Dynamics: An Infinitesimal Generator Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate learning the eigenfunctions of evolution operators for time-reversal invariant stochastic processes, a prime example being the Langevin equation used in molecular dynamics. Many physical or chemical processes described by this equation involve transitions between metastable states separated by high potential barriers that can hardly be crossed during a simulation. To overcome this bottleneck, data are collected via biased simulations that explore the state space more rapidly. We propose a framework for learning from biased simulations rooted in the infinitesimal generator of the process and the associated resolvent operator. We contrast our approach to more common ones based on the transfer operator, showing that it can provably learn the spectral properties of the unbiased system from biased data. In experiments, we highlight the advantages of our method over transfer operator approaches and recent developments based on generator learning, demonstrating its effectiveness in estimating eigenfunctions and eigenvalues. Importantly, we show that even with datasets containing only a few relevant transitions due to sub-optimal biasing, our approach recovers relevant information about the transition mechanism.</description>

Abstract: Understanding and accurately predicting hydrogen diffusion in materials is challenging due to the complex interactions between hydrogen defects and the crystal lattice. These interactions span large length and time scales, making them difficult to address with standard ab initio techniques. This work addresses this challenge by employing accelerated machine learning (ML) molecular dynamics simulations through active learning. We conduct a comparative study of different ML-based interatomic potential schemes, including VASP, MACE, and CHGNet, utilizing various training strategies such as on-the-fly learning, pre-trained universal models, and fine-tuning.By considering different temperatures and concentration regimes, we obtain hydrogen diffusion coefficients and activation energy values which align remarkably well with experimental results, underlining the efficacy and accuracy of ML-assisted methodologies in the context of diffusive dynamics. Particularly, our procedure significantly reduces the computational effort associated with traditional transition state calculations or ad-hoc designed interatomic potentials. The results highlight the limitations of pre-trained universal solutions for defective materials and how they can be improved by fine-tuning. Specifically, fine-tuning the models on a database produced during on-the-fly training of VASP ML force-field allows the retrieving of DFT-level accuracy at a fraction of the computational cost.</description>

      <title>Mutual neutralization of C$_{60}^+$ and C$_{60}^-$ ions: Excitation energies and state-selective rate coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11851</link>

Abstract: Context: Mutual neutralization between cations and anions play an important role in determining the charge-balance in certain astrophysical environments. However, empirical data for such reactions involving complex molecular species has been lacking due to challenges in performing experimental studies, leaving the astronomical community to rely on decades old models with large uncertainties for describing these processes in the interstellar medium. Aims: To investigate the mutual neutralization (MN) reaction, C$_{60}^+$ + C$_{60}^-$ $\rightarrow$ C$_{60}^*$ + C$_{60}$, for collisions at interstellar-like conditions. Methods: The mutual neutralization reaction between C$_{60}^+$ and C$_{60}^-$ at collision energies of 100\,meV was studied using the Double ElectroStatic Ion Ring ExpEriment, DESIREE, and its merged-beam capabilities. To aid in the interpretation of the experimental results, semi-classical modeling based on the Landau-Zener approach was performed for the studied reaction. Results: We experimentally identify a narrow range of kinetic energies for the neutral reaction products. Modeling was used to calculate the quantum state-selective reaction probabilities, absolute cross sections, and rate coefficients of these MN reactions, using the experimental results as a benchmark. The MN cross sections are compared with model results for electron attachment to C$_{60}$ and electron recombination with C$_{60}^+$. Conclusions: The present results show that it is crucial to take mutual polarization effects, the finite sizes, and the final quantum states of both molecular ions into account for reliable predictions of MN rates expected to strongly influence the charge-balance and chemistry in, e.g., dense molecular clouds.</description>

      <title>Doob's Lagrangian: A Sample-Efficient Variational Approach to Transition Path Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07974v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rare event sampling in dynamical systems is a fundamental problem arising in the natural sciences, which poses significant computational challenges due to an exponentially large space of trajectories. For settings where the dynamical system of interest follows a Brownian motion with known drift, the question of conditioning the process to reach a given endpoint or desired rare event is definitively answered by Doob's h-transform. However, the naive estimation of this transform is infeasible, as it requires simulating sufficiently many forward trajectories to estimate rare event probabilities. In this work, we propose a variational formulation of Doob's h-transform as an optimization problem over trajectories between a given initial point and the desired ending point. To solve this optimization, we propose a simulation-free training objective with a model parameterization that imposes the desired boundary conditions by design. Our approach significantly reduces the search space over trajectories and avoids expensive trajectory simulation and inefficient importance sampling estimators which are required in existing methods. We demonstrate the ability of our method to find feasible transition paths on real-world molecular simulation and protein folding tasks.</description>

      <title>High-throughput computational screening of small, eco-friendly, molecular crystals for sustainable piezoelectric materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Organic molecular crystals are ideally placed to become next-generation piezoelectric materials due to their diverse chemistries that can be used to engineer tailor-made solid-state assemblies. Using crystal engineering principles, and techniques such as co-crystallisation, these materials can be engineered to have a wide range of electromechanical properties. For materials that have been structurally characterised by methods such as X-Ray Diffraction, computational chemistry is an effective tool to predict their electromechanical properties, allowing researchers to screen these molecular crystals and identify materials best suited to their chosen application. Here we present our database of small molecular crystals, and their Density Functional Theory (DFT) predicted electromechanical properties, CrystalDFT (https://actuatelab.ie/CrystalDFT). We highlight the broad range of electromechanical properties amongst this primary dataset, and in particular, the high number of crystals that have a naturally occurring longitudinal d33 constant. This longitudinal electromechanical coupling is a prerequisite for several conventional sensing and energy harvesting applications, the presence of which is notably rare amongst the literature on biomolecular crystal piezoelectricity to date.</description>
