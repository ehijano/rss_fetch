      <title>Curve Segment Neighborhood-based Vector Field Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integral curves have been widely used to represent and analyze various vector fields. In this paper, we propose a Curve Segment Neighborhood Graph (CSNG) to capture the relationships between neighboring curve segments. This graph representation enables us to adapt the fast community detection algorithm, i.e., the Louvain algorithm, to identify individual graph communities from CSNG. Our results show that these communities often correspond to the features of the flow. To achieve a multi-level interactive exploration of the detected communities, we adapt a force-directed layout that allows users to refine and re-group communities based on their domain knowledge. We incorporate the proposed techniques into an interactive system to enable effective analysis and interpretation of complex patterns in large-scale integral curve datasets.</description>

      <title>Interconnected Kingdoms: Comparing 'A Song of Ice and Fire' Adaptations Across Media Using Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we propose and apply a method to compare adaptations of the same story across different media. We tackle this task by modelling such adaptations through character networks. We compare them by leveraging two concepts at the core of storytelling: the characters involved, and the dynamics of the story. We propose several methods to match characters between media and compare their position in the networks; and perform narrative matching, i.e. match the sequences of narrative units that constitute the plots. We apply these methods to the novel series \textit{A Song of Ice and Fire}, by G.R.R. Martin, and its comics and TV show adaptations. Our results show that interactions between characters are not sufficient to properly match individual characters between adaptations, but that using some additional information such as character affiliation or gender significantly improves the performance. On the contrary, character interactions convey enough information to perform narrative matching, and allow us to detect the divergence between the original novels and its TV show adaptation.</description>

      <title>Group Fairness Metrics for Community Detection Methods in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding community structure has played an essential role in explaining network evolution, as nodes join communities which connect further to form large-scale complex networks. In real-world networks, nodes are often organized into communities based on ethnicity, gender, race, or wealth, leading to structural biases and inequalities. Community detection (CD) methods use network structure and nodes' attributes to identify communities, and can produce biased outcomes if they fail to account for structural inequalities, especially affecting minority groups. In this work, we propose group fairness metrics ($\Phi^{F*}_{p}$) to evaluate CD methods from a fairness perspective. We also conduct a comparative analysis of existing CD methods, focusing on the performance-fairness trade-off, to determine whether certain methods favor specific types of communities based on their size, density, or conductance. Our findings reveal that the trade-off varies significantly across methods, with no specific type of method consistently outperforming others. The proposed metrics and insights will help develop and evaluate fair and high performing CD methods.</description>

      <title>Disruption Risk Evaluation on Large-scale Production Network with Establishments and Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We constructed an establishment-level production network where each establishment inputs and outputs multiple products, using data that includes the firm-level production network and establishments covering nearly all Japanese entities. The network represents the manufacturing sector with 183,951 establishments across 157,537 firms and 919,982 inter-establishment linkages. A probabilistic model of supply chain disruptions was applied to this network. The key findings are as follows: (1) The establishment-level network exhibits greater shock propagation compared to the firm-level network. (2) Incorporating actual product information leads to a larger impact on propagation compared to using industry-level information. (3) Regional shock simulations reveal that while the firm-level network shows greater shock propagation when the shock originates in Tokyo, no such difference is observed in the establishment-level network.</description>

      <title>Diversity and Inclusion Index with Networks and Similarity: Analysis and its Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the concepts of ``diversity'' and ``inclusion'' have attracted considerable attention across a range of fields, encompassing both social and biological disciplines. To fully understand these concepts, it is critical to not only examine the number of categories but also the similarities and relationships among them. In this study, I introduce a novel index for diversity and inclusion that considers similarities and network connections. I analyzed the properties of these indices and investigated their mathematical relationships using established measures of diversity and networks. Moreover, I developed a methodology for estimating similarities based on the utility of diversity. I also created a method for visualizing proportions, similarities, and network connections. Finally, I evaluated the correlation with external metrics using real-world data, confirming that both the proposed indices and our index can be effectively utilized. This study contributes to a more nuanced understanding of diversity and inclusion analysis.</description>

      <title>Patient flow networks absorb healthcare stress during pandemic crises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disasters, such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic, impose recurrent and heterogeneous stress on healthcare systems, necessitating the redistribution of stress to enhance healthcare resilience. However, existing studies have been hindered by limited datasets and approaches for assessing its absorptive capacity - defined as the system's ability to absorb stress by redistributing patient flows. This study addresses this gap by analyzing patient flow networks constructed from billions of electronic medical records and introducing an approach to quantify network absorptivity under crisis conditions. Our analysis of U.S. healthcare systems reveals that during the COVID-19 pandemic, cross-regional patient flows increased by 3.89%, a 0.90% rise from pre-pandemic levels. The networks exhibited an average absorptivity of 0.21, representing a 10% increase over pre-pandemic conditions. Flow networks with higher connectivity and heterogeneity showed a greater capacity to alleviate system burdens. These empirical and analytical insights underscore the critical role of proactive patient flow management in strengthening healthcare resilience during crises.</description>

      <title>Data-informed modeling of the formation, persistence, and evolution of social norms and conventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social norms and conventions are commonly accepted and adopted behaviors and practices within a social group that guide interactions -- e.g., how to spell a word or how to greet people -- and are central to a group's culture and identity. Understanding the key mechanisms that govern the formation, persistence, and evolution of social norms and conventions in social communities is a problem of paramount importance for a broad range of real-world applications, spanning from preparedness for future emergencies to promotion of sustainable practices. In the past decades, mathematical modeling has emerged as a powerful tool to reproduce and study the complex dynamics of norm and convention change, gaining insights into their mechanisms, and ultimately deriving tools to predict their evolution. The first goal of this chapter is to introduce some of the main mathematical approaches for modeling social norms and conventions, including population models and agent-based models relying on the theories of dynamical systems, evolutionary dynamics, and game theory. The second goal of the chapter is to illustrate how quantitative observations and empirical data can be incorporated into these mathematical models in a systematic manner, establishing a data-based approach to mathematical modeling of formation, persistence, and evolution of social norms and conventions. Finally, current challenges and future opportunities in this growing field of research are discussed.</description>

      <title>Hate Speech Detection Using Cross-Platform Social Media Data In English and German Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hate speech has grown into a pervasive phenomenon, intensifying during times of crisis, elections, and social unrest. Multiple approaches have been developed to detect hate speech using artificial intelligence, but a generalized model is yet unaccomplished. The challenge for hate speech detection as text classification is the cost of obtaining high-quality training data. This study focuses on detecting bilingual hate speech in YouTube comments and measuring the impact of using additional data from other platforms in the performance of the classification model. We examine the value of additional training datasets from cross-platforms for improving the performance of classification models. We also included factors such as content similarity, definition similarity, and common hate words to measure the impact of datasets on performance. Our findings show that adding more similar datasets based on content similarity, hate words, and definitions improves the performance of classification models. The best performance was obtained by combining datasets from YouTube comments, Twitter, and Gab with an F1-score of 0.74 and 0.68 for English and German YouTube comments.</description>

      <title>Interactive Event Sifting using Bayesian Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forensic analysts often use social media imagery and texts to understand important events. A primary challenge is the initial sifting of irrelevant posts. This work introduces an interactive process for training an event-centric, learning-based multimodal classification model that automates sanitization. We propose a method based on Bayesian Graph Neural Networks (BGNNs) and evaluate active learning and pseudo-labeling formulations to reduce the number of posts the analyst must manually annotate. Our results indicate that BGNNs are useful for social-media data sifting for forensics investigations of events of interest, the value of active learning and pseudo-labeling varies based on the setting, and incorporating unlabelled data from other events improves performance.</description>

      <title>Post-hoc Study of Climate Microtargeting on Social Media Ads with LLMs: Thematic Insights and Fairness Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Climate change communication on social media increasingly employs microtargeting strategies to effectively reach and influence specific demographic groups. This study presents a post-hoc analysis of microtargeting practices within climate campaigns by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to examine Facebook advertisements. Our analysis focuses on two key aspects: demographic targeting and fairness. We evaluate the ability of LLMs to accurately predict the intended demographic targets, such as gender and age group, achieving an overall accuracy of 88.55%. Furthermore, we instruct the LLMs to generate explanations for their classifications, providing transparent reasoning behind each decision. These explanations reveal the specific thematic elements used to engage different demographic segments, highlighting distinct strategies tailored to various audiences. Our findings show that young adults are primarily targeted through messages emphasizing activism and environmental consciousness, while women are engaged through themes related to caregiving roles and social advocacy. In addition to evaluating the effectiveness of LLMs in detecting microtargeted messaging, we conduct a comprehensive fairness analysis to identify potential biases in model predictions. Our findings indicate that while LLMs perform well overall, certain biases exist, particularly in the classification of senior citizens and male audiences. By showcasing the efficacy of LLMs in dissecting and explaining targeted communication strategies and by highlighting fairness concerns, this study provides a valuable framework for future research aimed at enhancing transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in social media-driven climate campaigns.</description>

      <title>Weighted Embeddings for Low-Dimensional Graph Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning low-dimensional numerical representations from symbolic data, e.g., embedding the nodes of a graph into a geometric space, is an important concept in machine learning. While embedding into Euclidean space is common, recent observations indicate that hyperbolic geometry is better suited to represent hierarchical information and heterogeneous data (e.g., graphs with a scale-free degree distribution). Despite their potential for more accurate representations, hyperbolic embeddings also have downsides like being more difficult to compute and harder to use in downstream tasks.
  We propose embedding into a weighted space, which is closely related to hyperbolic geometry but mathematically simpler. We provide the embedding algorithm WEmbed and demonstrate, based on generated as well as over 2000 real-world graphs, that our weighted embeddings heavily outperform state-of-the-art Euclidean embeddings for heterogeneous graphs while using fewer dimensions. The running time of WEmbed and embedding quality for the remaining instances is on par with state-of-the-art Euclidean embedders.</description>

      <title>HumVI: A Multilingual Dataset for Detecting Violent Incidents Impacting Humanitarian Aid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humanitarian organizations can enhance their effectiveness by analyzing data to discover trends, gather aggregated insights, manage their security risks, support decision-making, and inform advocacy and funding proposals. However, data about violent incidents with direct impact and relevance for humanitarian aid operations is not readily available. An automatic data collection and NLP-backed classification framework aligned with humanitarian perspectives can help bridge this gap. In this paper, we present HumVI - a dataset comprising news articles in three languages (English, French, Arabic) containing instances of different types of violent incidents categorized by the humanitarian sector they impact, e.g., aid security, education, food security, health, and protection. Reliable labels were obtained for the dataset by partnering with a data-backed humanitarian organization, Insecurity Insight. We provide multiple benchmarks for the dataset, employing various deep learning architectures and techniques, including data augmentation and mask loss, to address different task-related challenges, e.g., domain expansion. The dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/dataminr-ai/humvi-dataset.</description>

      <title>DiffGAD: A Diffusion-based Unsupervised Graph Anomaly Detector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) is crucial for identifying abnormal entities within networks, garnering significant attention across various fields. Traditional unsupervised methods, which decode encoded latent representations of unlabeled data with a reconstruction focus, often fail to capture critical discriminative content, leading to suboptimal anomaly detection. To address these challenges, we present a Diffusion-based Graph Anomaly Detector (DiffGAD). At the heart of DiffGAD is a novel latent space learning paradigm, meticulously designed to enhance its proficiency by guiding it with discriminative content. This innovative approach leverages diffusion sampling to infuse the latent space with discriminative content and introduces a content-preservation mechanism that retains valuable information across different scales, significantly improving its adeptness at identifying anomalies with limited time and space complexity. Our comprehensive evaluation of DiffGAD, conducted on six real-world and large-scale datasets with various metrics, demonstrated its exceptional performance.</description>

      <title>A Law of Large Numbers for SIR on the Stochastic Block Model: A Proof via Herd Immunity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the dynamics of the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model on a network with community structure, namely the stochastic block model (SBM). As usual, the SIR model is a stochastic model for an epidemic where infected vertices infect susceptible neighbors at some rate $\eta$ and recover at rate $\gamma$, and the SBM is a random graph model where vertices are partitioned into a finite number of communities. The connection probability between two vertices depends on their community affiliation, here scaled so that the average degrees have a finite limit as the network grows. We prove laws of large numbers (LLN) for the epidemic's trajectory to a system of ordinary differential equations over any time horizon (finite or infinite), including in particular a LLN for the final size of the infection.
  Our proofs rely on two main ingredients: (i) a new coupling of the SIR epidemic and the randomness of the SBM, revealing a vector-valued random variable that drives the epidemic (related to what is usually called the ``force of the infection'' via a linear transformation), and (ii) a novel technique for analyzing the limiting behavior of the infinite time horizon for the infection, using the fact that once the infection passes the herd immunity threshold it dies out quickly and has a negligible impact on the overall size of the infection.</description>

      <title>InstructG2I: Synthesizing Images from Multimodal Attributed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we approach an overlooked yet critical task Graph2Image: generating images from multimodal attributed graphs (MMAGs). This task poses significant challenges due to the explosion in graph size, dependencies among graph entities, and the need for controllability in graph conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a graph context-conditioned diffusion model called InstructG2I. InstructG2I first exploits the graph structure and multimodal information to conduct informative neighbor sampling by combining personalized page rank and re-ranking based on vision-language features. Then, a Graph-QFormer encoder adaptively encodes the graph nodes into an auxiliary set of graph prompts to guide the denoising process of diffusion. Finally, we propose graph classifier-free guidance, enabling controllable generation by varying the strength of graph guidance and multiple connected edges to a node. Extensive experiments conducted on three datasets from different domains demonstrate the effectiveness and controllability of our approach.

      <title>Unraveling the Viral Spread of Misinformation: Maximum-Likelihood Estimation and Starlike Tree Approximation in Markovian Spreading Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying the source of epidemic-like spread in networks is crucial for removing internet viruses or finding the source of rumors in online social networks. The challenge lies in tracing the source from a snapshot observation of infected nodes. How do we accurately pinpoint the source? Utilizing snapshot data, we apply a probabilistic approach, focusing on the graph boundary and the observed time, to detect sources via an effective maximum likelihood algorithm. A novel starlike tree approximation extends applicability to general graphs, demonstrating versatility. Unlike previous works that rely heavily on structural properties alone, our method also incorporates temporal data for more precise source detection. We highlight the utility of the Gamma function for analyzing the ratio of the likelihood being the source between nodes asymptotically. Comprehensive evaluations confirm algorithmic effectiveness in diverse network scenarios, advancing source detection in large-scale network analysis and information dissemination strategies.</description>

      <title>SAGraph: A Large-scale Text-Rich Social Graph Dataset for Advertising Campaigns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Influencer selection in marketing involves choosing users with a strong online presence to promote products or services, leveraging their credibility and audience reach. This process is vital for its direct impact on brand visibility, consumer trust, and ultimately, sales conversion. Current research simplifies complex elements like user attitudes, thought processes, and advertising content into numerical values. This kind of approach risks missing the dynamic and contextual nuances crucial for developing effective influencer marketing strategies. To bridge this gap, we introduce a text-rich large Social Advertisement Graph (SAGraph) dataset collected from Weibo, a real-world influencer advertising platform. Our dataset centers around the advertising campaign for 6 products, consisting of 317,287 users, each with their profile information, and interaction data including 891,834 comments and 441,836 reposts. By leveraging this rich interaction and textual content, one can gain deeper insights into consumer behavior, refine influencer selection criteria, and develop more targeted and effective marketing strategies. We evaluated existing influencer selection baselines and the latest LLMs on this dataset, demonstrating the importance of textual content in advertising campaigns, as well as the availability and significant potential of LLMs for enhancing advertising strategies. We hope that this dataset will inspire further research: \url{https://github.com/xiaoqzhwhu/SAGraph/}.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing networks from simple and complex contagions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00129v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Network scientists often use complex dynamic processes to describe network contagions, but tools for fitting contagion models typically assume simple dynamics. Here, we address this gap by developing a nonparametric method to reconstruct a network and dynamics from a series of node states, using a model that breaks the dichotomy between simple pairwise and complex neighborhood-based contagions. We then show that a network is more easily reconstructed when observed through the lens of complex contagions if it is dense or the dynamic saturates, and that simple contagions are better otherwise.</description>

      <title>Clarify Confused Nodes via Separated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02285v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable advances in graph-oriented tasks. However, real-world graphs invariably contain a certain proportion of heterophilous nodes, challenging the homophily assumption of traditional GNNs and hindering their performance. Most existing studies continue to design generic models with shared weights between heterophilous and homophilous nodes. Despite the incorporation of high-order messages or multi-channel architectures, these efforts often fall short. A minority of studies attempt to train different node groups separately but suffer from inappropriate separation metrics and low efficiency. In this paper, we first propose a new metric, termed Neighborhood Confusion (NC), to facilitate a more reliable separation of nodes. We observe that node groups with different levels of NC values exhibit certain differences in intra-group accuracy and visualized embeddings. These pave the way for Neighborhood Confusion-guided Graph Convolutional Network (NCGCN), in which nodes are grouped by their NC values and accept intra-group weight sharing and message passing. Extensive experiments on both homophilous and heterophilous benchmarks demonstrate that our framework can effectively separate nodes and yield significant performance improvement compared to the latest methods. The source code will be available in https://github.com/Graph4Sec-Team/NCGNN.</description>

Abstract: Graph learning has become essential in various domains, including recommendation systems and social network analysis. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as promising techniques for encoding structural information and improving performance in tasks like link prediction and node classification. However, a key challenge remains: the difficulty of generalizing to unseen graph data with different properties. In this work, we propose a novel graph foundation model, called OpenGraph, to address this challenge. Our approach tackles several technical obstacles. Firstly, we enhance data augmentation using a large language model (LLM) to overcome data scarcity in real-world scenarios. Secondly, we introduce a unified graph tokenizer that enables the model to generalize effectively to diverse graph data, even when encountering unseen properties during training. Thirdly, our developed scalable graph transformer captures node-wise dependencies within the global topological context. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework. By adapting OpenGraph to new graph characteristics and comprehending diverse graphs, our approach achieves remarkable zero-shot graph learning performance across various settings. We release the model implementation at https://github.com/HKUDS/OpenGraph.</description>

      <title>New contexts, old heuristics: How young people in India and the US trust online content in the age of generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conducted in-person ethnography in India and the US to investigate how young people (18-24) trusted online content, just as generative AI (genAI) became mainstream. We found that when online, how participants determined what content to trust was shaped by emotional states, which we term "information modes." Our participants reflexively shifted between modes to maintain "emotional equilibrium," and eschewed engaging literacy skills in the more passive modes in which they spent the most time. We found participants imported trust heuristics from established online contexts into emerging ones (i.e., genAI). This led them to use ill-fitting trust heuristics, and exposed them to the risk of trusting false and misleading information. While many had reservations about AI, prioritizing efficiency, they used genAI and habitual heuristics to quickly achieve goals at the expense of accuracy. We conclude that literacy interventions designed to match users' distinct information modes will be most effective.</description>

      <title>Richelieu: Self-Evolving LLM-Based Agents for AI Diplomacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06813v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diplomacy is one of the most sophisticated activities in human society. The complex interactions among multiple parties/ agents involve various abilities like social reasoning, negotiation arts, and long-term strategy planning. Previous AI agents surely have proved their capability of handling multi-step games and larger action spaces on tasks involving multiple agents. However, diplomacy involves a staggering magnitude of decision spaces, especially considering the negotiation stage required. Recently, LLM agents have shown their potential for extending the boundary of previous agents on a couple of applications, however, it is still not enough to handle a very long planning period in a complex multi-agent environment. Empowered with cutting-edge LLM technology, we make the first stab to explore AI's upper bound towards a human-like agent for such a highly comprehensive multi-agent mission by combining three core and essential capabilities for stronger LLM-based societal agents: 1) strategic planner with memory and reflection; 2) goal-oriented negotiate with social reasoning; 3) augmenting memory by self-play games to self-evolving without any human in the loop.</description>

      <title>Fast and Accurate Algorithms to Calculate Expected Modularity in Probabilistic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modularity maximization is a widely used community detection technique for deterministic networks. However, little research has been performed to develop efficient modularity calculation algorithms for probabilistic networks. Particularly, it is challenging to efficiently calculate expected modularity when all possible worlds are considered. To address this problem, we propose two algorithms, namely $\mathrm{PWP}^{\mathrm{EMOD}}$ and $\mathrm{APWP}^{\mathrm{EMOD}}$, partitioning the possible worlds based on their modularities to significantly reduce the number of probability calculations. We evaluate the accuracy and time efficiency of our algorithms through comprehensive experiments.</description>

      <title>Neural Collaborative Filtering to Detect Anomalies in Human Semantic Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18427v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human trajectory anomaly detection has become increasingly important across a wide range of applications, including security surveillance and public health. However, existing trajectory anomaly detection methods are primarily focused on vehicle-level traffic, while human-level trajectory anomaly detection remains under-explored. Since human trajectory data is often very sparse, machine learning methods have become the preferred approach for identifying complex patterns. However, concerns regarding potential biases and the robustness of these models have intensified the demand for more transparent and explainable alternatives. In response to these challenges, our research focuses on developing a lightweight anomaly detection model specifically designed to detect anomalies in human trajectories. We propose a Neural Collaborative Filtering approach to model and predict normal mobility. Our method is designed to model users' daily patterns of life without requiring prior knowledge, thereby enhancing performance in scenarios where data is sparse or incomplete, such as in cold start situations. Our algorithm consists of two main modules. The first is the collaborative filtering module, which applies collaborative filtering to model normal mobility of individual humans to places of interest. The second is the neural module, responsible for interpreting the complex spatio-temporal relationships inherent in human trajectory data. To validate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments using simulated and real-world datasets comparing to numerous state-of-the-art trajectory anomaly detection approaches.</description>
