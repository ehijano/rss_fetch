      <title>Filtered cospans and interlevel persistence with boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the notion of a "filtered cospan" as an algebraic object that stands in the same relation to interlevel persistence modules as filtered chain complexes stand with respect to sublevel persistence modules. This relation is expressed via a functor from a category of filtered cospans to a category of persistence modules that arise in Bauer-Botnan-Fluhr's study of relative interlevel set homology. We associate a filtered cospan to a Morse function $f:X\to [-\Lambda,\Lambda]$ such that $\partial X$ is the union of the regular level sets $f^{-1}(\{\pm\Lambda\})$; this allows us to capture the interlevel persistence of such a function in terms of data associated to Morse chain complexes. Similar filtered cospans are associated to simplicial and singular chain complexes, and isomorphism theorems are proven relating these to each other and to relative interlevel set homology. Filtered cospans can be decomposed, under modest hypotheses, into certain standard elementary summands, giving rise to a notion of persistence diagram for filtered cospans that is amenable to computation. An isometry theorem connects interleavings of filtered cospans to matchings between these persistence diagrams.</description>

      <title>Polynomial functors over free nilpotent groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a unital commutative ring. In this paper, we study polynomial functors from the category of finitely generated free nilpotent groups to the category of $k$-modules, focusing on comparisons across different nilpotency classes and polynomial degrees. As a consequence, we obtain refinements of parts of the results of Baues and Pirashvili on polynomial functors over free nilpotent groups of class at most 2, which also recover several folklore results for free groups and free abelian groups. Furthermore, we investigate a modular analogue, formulated using dimension subgroups over a field of positive characteristic instead of lower central series. To prove the main results, we establish general criteria that guarantee equivalences between the categories of polynomial functors of different degrees or with different base categories. They are described by using a two-sided ideal of a monad associated with the base category, which encodes polynomiality of a specific degree. Inspired by the main results, we also investigate an analogous ideal for analytic functors, and show that, in most cases, no such an ideal exists.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider commutative Frobenius pseudomonoids in the bicategory of spans, and we show that they are in correspondence with 2-Segal cosymmetric sets. Such a structure can be interpreted as a coherent 2-dimensional topological quantum field theory taking values in the bicategory of spans. We also describe a construction that produces a 2-Segal cosymmetric set from any partial monoid equipped with a distinguished element.</description>

      <title>The period map from commutative to noncommutative deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the period map from infinitesimal deformations of a scheme $X$ over a perfect field $k$ to those of the associated $k$-linear $\infty$-category $\mathrm{QC}(X)$. For quasicompact, smooth, and separated $X$, we identify the corresponding map on tangent fibres with the dual HKR map $\mathrm{R}\Gamma(X, \mathrm{T}_X)[1] \to \mathrm{HH}^{\bullet}(X/k)[2]$, and give conditions for injectivity on homotopy groups. As applications, we prove liftability along square-zero extensions to be a derived invariant (at least when $\mathrm{char}(k) \ne 2$), and exhibit cases where the entire (classical) deformation functor of $X$ is a derived invariant; this partially answers a question of Lieblich.</description>

      <title>Fragile Topological Phases and Topological Order of 2D Crystalline Chern Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply methods of equivariant homotopy theory, which may not previously have found due attention in condensed matter physics, to classify first the fragile/unstable topological phases of 2D crystalline Chern insulator materials, and second the possible topological order of their fractional cousins. We highlight that the phases are given by the equivariant 2-Cohomotopy of the Brillouin torus of crystal momenta (with respect to wallpaper point group actions) -- which, despite the attention devoted to crystalline Chern insulators, seems not to have been considered before. Arguing then that any topological order must be reflected in the adiabatic monodromy of gapped quantum ground states over the covariantized space of these band topologies, we compute the latter in examples where this group is non-abelian, showing that any potential FQAH anyons must be localized in momentum space. We close with an outlook on the relevance for the search for topological quantum computing hardware. Mathematical details are spelled out in a supplement.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Multi-Target Tracking using Cellular Sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent target tracking in the presence of nonlinear dynamics and agent heterogeneity, where state-space dimensions may differ, is a challenging problem that traditional graph Laplacian methods cannot easily address. This work leverages the framework of cellular sheaves, a mathematical generalization of graph theory, to natively model such heterogeneous systems. While existing coordination sheaf frameworks focus on cooperative problems like consensus, this work extends them to the non-cooperative target-tracking problem. The tracking of multiple, unknown targets is formulated as a harmonic extension problem on a cellular sheaf, accommodating nonlinear dynamics and external disturbances for all agents. A decentralized control law is developed using the sheaf Laplacian, and a corresponding Lyapunov-based stability analysis is provided to guarantee tracking error convergence, with results validated by simulation.</description>

      <title>Frequent subgraph-based persistent homology for graph classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Persistent homology (PH) has recently emerged as a powerful tool for extracting topological features. Integrating PH into machine learning and deep learning models enhances topology awareness and interpretability. However, most PH methods on graphs rely on a limited set of filtrations, such as degree-based or weight-based filtrations, which overlook richer features like recurring information across the dataset and thus restrict expressive power. In this work, we propose a novel graph filtration called Frequent Subgraph Filtration (FSF), which is derived from frequent subgraphs and produces stable and information-rich frequency-based persistent homology (FPH) features. We study the theoretical properties of FSF and provide both proofs and experimental validation. Beyond persistent homology itself, we introduce two approaches for graph classification: an FPH-based machine learning model (FPH-ML) and a hybrid framework that integrates FPH with graph neural networks (FPH-GNNs) to enhance topology-aware graph representation learning. Our frameworks bridge frequent subgraph mining and topological data analysis, offering a new perspective on topology-aware feature extraction. Experimental results show that FPH-ML achieves competitive or superior accuracy compared with kernel-based and degree-based filtration methods. When integrated into graph neural networks, FPH yields relative performance gains ranging from 0.4 to 21 percent, with improvements of up to 8.2 percentage points over GCN and GIN backbones across benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Topological Hochschild homology of the image of j</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the mod $(p,v_1)$ and mod $(2,\eta,v_1)$ $\mathrm{THH}$ of many variants of the image-of-$J$ spectrum. In particular, we do this for $j_{\zeta}$, whose $\mathrm{TC}$ is closely related to the $K$-theory of the $K(1)$-local sphere. We find in particular that the failure for $\mathrm{THH}$ to satisfy $\mathbb{Z}_p$-Galois descent for the extension $j_{\zeta} \to \ell_p$ corresponds to the failure of the $p$-adic circle to be its own free loop space. For $p&gt;2$, we also prove the Segal conjecture for $j_{\zeta}$, and we compute the $K$-theory of the $K(1)$-local sphere in degrees $\leq 4p-6$.</description>

      <title>Approaches to critical point theory via sequential and parametrized topological complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01980v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of a space was introduced to obtain a lower bound on the number of critical points of a $C^1$-function on a given manifold. Related to Lusternik-Schnirelmann category and motivated by topological robotics, the topological complexity (TC) of a space is a numerical homotopy invariant whose topological properties are an active field of research. The notions of sequential and parametrized topological complexity extend the ideas of topological complexity. While the definition of TC is closely related to Lusternik-Schnirelmann category, the connections of sequential and parametrized TC to critical point theory have not been fully explored yet. In this article we apply methods from Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory to establish various lower bounds on numbers of critical points of functions in terms of sequential and parametrized TCs. We carry out several consequences and applications of these bounds, among them a computation of the parametrized TC of the unit tangent bundles of $(4m-1)$-spheres.</description>

      <title>Natural Image Classification via Quasi-Cyclic Graph Ensembles and Random-Bond Ising Models at the Nishimori Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern multi-class image classification relies on high-dimensional CNN feature vectors, which are computationally expensive and obscure the underlying data geometry. Conventional graph-based classifiers degrade on natural multi-class images because typical graphs fail to preserve separability on feature manifolds with complex topology. We address this with a physics-inspired pipeline frozen MobileNetV2 embeddings are treated as Ising spins on a sparse Multi-Edge Type QC-LDPC graph forming a Random Bond Ising Model. The system is tuned to its Nishimori temperature identified where the smallest Bethe-Hessian eigenvalue vanishes. Our method rests on two innovations: we prove a spectral-topological correspondence linking graph trapping sets to invariants via the Ihara-Bass zeta function removing these structures boosts top-1 accuracy over four-fold in multi-class settings; we develop a quadratic-Newton estimator for the Nishimori temperature converging in around 9 Arnoldi iterations for a 6-times speedup enabling spectral embedding on scales like ImageNet-100. The resulting graphs compress 1280-dimensional MobileNetV2 features to 32 dimensions for ImageNet10 and 64 for ImageNet-100 We achieve 98.7% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-10 and 84.92% on ImageNet-100 with a three-graph soft ensemble Versus MobileNetV2 our hard ensemble increases top-1 by 0.1% while cutting FLOPs by 2.67-times compared to ResNet50 the soft ensemble drops top1 by only 1.09% yet reduces FLOPs by 29-times. Novelty lies in (a) rigorously linking trapping sets to topological defects, (b) an efficient Nishimori temperature estimator and (c) demonstrating that topology-guided LDPC embedding produces highly compressed accurate classifiers for resource-constrained deployment</description>

      <title>On hyperbolic links associated to Eulerian subgraphs on right-angled hyperbolic $3$-polytopes of finite volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03017v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider Eulerian cycles without transversal selfintersections in $4$-valent planar graphs. We prove that any cycle of this type in the graph of an ideal right-angled hyperbolic $3$-polytope corresponds to a hyperbolic link such that its complement consists of $4$-copies of this polytope glued according to its checkerboard coloring. Moreover, this link consists of trivially embedded circles bijectively corresponding to the vertices of the polytope. We prove that there is always at least one Eulerian cycle of this type and introduce a transformation of a cycle along conjugated vertices allowing to build new cycles from a given one. The $2$-fold branched covering space corresponding to our link is a small cover over some simple $3$-polytope. It corresponds to a Hamiltonian cycle on this polytope via the A.D. Mednykh's construction. We show that any Hamiltonian cycle on a compact right-angled hyperbolic $3$-polytope arises in this way, while in the finite volume case the necessary and sufficient condition is that at each ideal vertex it does not go straight. The link corresponding to a Hamiltonian cycle on a simple $3$-polytope always contains the Hopf link consisting of two circles. We consider links corresponding to Hamiltonian theta-graphs and Hamiltonian $K_4$-graphs on simple $3$-polytopes introduced by A.D. Mednykh and A.Yu. Vesnin. We give a criterion when such a link consists of mutually unlinked circles and when it is trivial. We give a necessary condition for such a link to be hyperbolic. The simplest example is the Borromean rings corresponding to the Hamiltonian theta-graph on the cube. We introduce the notions of a nonselfcrossing Eulerian theta-graph and $K_4$-graph on a right-angled hyperbolic $3$-polytope of finite volume with $2$ or $4$ finite vertices and construct the corresponding hyperbolic link.</description>
