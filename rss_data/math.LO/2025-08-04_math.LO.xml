      <title>A Counterexample Regarding C.E. Closed Subsets of [0,1] Under Homeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an example of a computably enumerable closed subset of [0,1] that is not homeomorphic to any computably compact space. This answers a question of Koh, Melnikov and Ng.</description>

      <title>Proof complexity of Mal'tsev CSP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) form a broad class of combinatorial problems, which can be formulated as homomorphism problems between relational structures. The CSP dichotomy theorem classifies all such problems over finite domains into two categories: NP-complete and polynomial-time, see Zhuk (2017), Bulatov (2017). Polynomial-time CSPs can be further subdivided into smaller subclasses. Mal'tsev CSPs are defined by the property that every relation in the problem is invariant under a Mal'tsev operation, a ternary operation $\mu$ satisfying $\mu(x, y, y) = \mu(y, y, x) = x$ for all $x, y$. Bulatov and Dalmau proved that Mal'tsev CSPs are solvable in polynomial time, presenting an algorithm for such CSPs (2006). The negation of an unsatisfiable CSP instance can be expressed as a propositional tautology. We formalize the algorithm for Mal'tsev CSPs within bounded arithmetic $V^1$, which captures polynomial-time reasoning and corresponds to the extended Frege proof system. We show that $V^1$ proves the soundness of Mal'tsev algorithm, implying that tautologies expressing the non-existence of a solution for unsatisfiable instances of Mal'tsev CSPs admit short extended Frege proofs. In addition, with small adjustments, we achieved an analogous result for Dalmau's algorithm that solves generalized majority-minority CSPs -- a common generalization of near-unanimity operations and Mal'tsev operations.</description>

      <title>On the regularity of almost stable relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a general theory of local stability up to belonging to an ideal (e.g. having measure zero). From a model-theoretic perspective, we prove a stationarity principle for almost stable formulas in this sense, and build a topological space of partial types whose Cantor-Bendixson rank is finite. The interaction of this space with Keisler measures and definable groups yields, on the one hand, a regularity lemma for infinite graphs where the edge relation is almost stable, and, on the other hand, the existence of definable stabilizer subgroups. As an application, we prove a finite graph regularity lemma and an arithmetic regularity lemma for almost stable relations in arbitrary finite groups.</description>

      <title>Reasoning under uncertainty in the game of Cops and Robbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The game of Cops and Robbers is an important model for studying computational queries in pursuit-evasion environments, among others. As recent logical explorations have shown, its structure exhibits appealing analogies with modal logic. In this paper, we enrich the game with a setting in which players may have imperfect information. We propose a new formal framework, Epistemic Logic of Cops and Robbers (ELCR), to make the core notions of the game precise, for instance, players' positions, observational power and inference. Applying ELCR to analyze the game, we obtain an automated way to track interactions between players and characterize their information updates during the game. The update mechanism is defined by a novel dynamic operator, and we compare it with some relevant paradigms from the game and logic perspectives. We study various properties of ELCR including axiomatization and decidability. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to explore these games from a formal point of view where (partial) information available to players is taken into account.</description>

      <title>Formal Power Series Representations in Probability and Expected Utility Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We advance a general theory of coherent preference that surrenders restrictions embodied in orthodox doctrine. This theory enjoys the property that any preference system admits extension to a complete system of preferences, provided it satisfies a certain coherence requirement analogous to the one de Finetti advanced for his foundations of probability. Unlike de Finetti's theory, the one we set forth requires neither transitivity nor Archimedeanness nor boundedness nor continuity of preference. This theory also enjoys the property that any complete preference system meeting the standard of coherence can be represented by utility in an ordered field extension of the reals. Representability by utility is a corollary of this paper's central result, which at once extends H\"older's Theorem and strengthens Hahn's Embedding Theorem.</description>

      <title>Nonvanishing Higher Derived Limits without $w\diamondsuit_{\omega_1}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a common refinement of theorems of Bergfalk and of Casarosa and Lambie-Hanson, showing that under certain hypotheses, the higher derived limits of a certain inverse system of abelian groups $\mathbf{A}$ do not vanish. The refined theorem has a number of interesting corollaries, including the nonvanishing of the second derived limit of $\mathbf{A}$ in many of the common models of set theory of the reals and in the Mitchell model. In particular, we disprove a conjecture of Bergfalk, Hru\v{s}\'ak, and Lambie-Hanson that higher derived limits of $\mathbf{A}$ vanish in the Miller model.</description>
