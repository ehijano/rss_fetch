      <title>Spin-Glass Phases and Multichaos in the Ashkin-Teller Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global phase diagram of the Ashkin-Teller spin glass is calculated in d = 3 spatial dimensions by renormalization-group theory. Depending on the value of the positive or negative four-spin interaction, qualitatively different topologies are found for the spin-glass phase diagram in the usual variables of temperature and fraction of antiferromagnetic nearest-neighbor interactions. Two different spin-glass phases occur. Both spin-glass phases are chaotic. One spin-glass exhibits phase reentrance that is reverse from the reentrances seen in previous spin-glass phase diagrams. Seven different phases: Ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic, entropic ferromagnetic and entropic antiferromagnetic, spin-glass and entropic spin-glass, and disordered phases occur. The entropic ferromagnetic phase unusually but understandably occurs at temperatures above one spin-glass phase. A random disorder line is identified and no phase transition occurs on this lie. Our calculation is exact on the d = 3 hierarchical lattice and Migdal-Kadanoff approximate on the cubic lattice.</description>

      <title>Universal shape-dependence of quantum entanglement in disordered magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disordered quantum magnets are not only experimentally relevant, but offer efficient computational methodologies to calculate the low energy states as well as various measures of quantum correlations. Here, we present a systematic analysis of quantum entanglement in the paradigmatic random transverse-field Ising model in two dimensions, using an efficient implementation of the asymptotically exact strong disorder renormalization group method. The phase diagram is known to be governed by three distinct infinitely disordered fixed points (IDFPs) that we study here. For square subsystems, it has been recently established that quantum entanglement has a universal logarithmic correction due to the corners of the subsystem at all three IDFPs. This corner contribution has been proposed as an "entanglement susceptibility", a useful tool to locate the phase transition and to measure the correlation length critical exponent. Towards a deeper understanding, we quantify how the corner contribution depends on the shape of the subsystem. While the corner contribution remains universal, the shape-dependence is qualitatively different in each universality class, also confirmed by line segment subsystems, a special case of skeletal entanglement. Therefore, unlike in conformally invariant systems, in general different subsystem shapes are versatile probes to unveil new universal information on the phase transitions in disordered quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Anderson-Skin dualism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a novel localization phenomenon that emerges in non-Hermitian and quasiperiodic coupled systems, which we dub ``Anderson-Skin (AS) dualism". The emergence of AS dualism is due to the fact that non-Hermitian topological systems provide non-trivial topological transport channels for disordered systems, causing the originally localized Anderson modes to transform into skin modes, i.e., the localized states within the point gap regions have dual characteristics of localization under periodic boundary condition (PBC) and skin effects under open boundary conditions (OBC). As an example, we analytically prove the 1D AS dualism through the transfer matrix method. Moreover, by discussing many-body interacting systems, we confirm that AS dualism is universal.</description>

      <title>A Generative Diffusion Model for Amorphous Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models show great promise for the inverse design of molecules and inorganic crystals, but remain largely ineffective within more complex structures such as amorphous materials. Here, we present a diffusion model that reliably generates amorphous structures up to 1000 times faster than conventional simulations across processing conditions, compositions, and data sources. Generated structures recovered the short- and medium-range order, sampling diversity, and macroscopic properties of silica glass, as validated by simulations and an information-theoretical strategy. Conditional generation allowed sampling large structures at low cooling rates of 10$^{-2}$ K/ps to uncover a ductile-to-brittle transition and mesoporous silica structures. Extension to metallic glassy systems accurately reproduced local structures and properties from both computational and experimental datasets, demonstrating how synthetic data can be generated from characterization results. Our methods provide a roadmap for the design and simulation of amorphous materials previously inaccessible to computational methods.</description>

      <title>Quantum Spin Glass in the Two-Dimensional Disordered Heisenberg Model via Foundation Neural-Network Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the two-dimensional frustrated quantum Heisenberg model with bond disorder on nearest-neighbor couplings using the recently introduced Foundation Neural-Network Quantum States framework, which enables accurate and efficient computation of disorder-averaged observables with a single variational optimization. Simulations on large lattices reveal an extended region of the phase diagram where long-range magnetic order vanishes in the thermodynamic limit, while the overlap order parameter, which characterizes quantum spin glass states, remains finite. These findings, supported by a semiclassical analysis based on a large-spin expansion, provide compelling evidence that the spin glass phase is stable against quantum fluctuations, unlike the classical case where it disappears at any finite temperature.</description>

      <title>Dynamics and chaotic properties of the fully disordered Kuramoto model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frustrated random interactions are a key ingredient of spin glasses. From this perspective, we study the dynamics of the Kuramoto model with quenched random couplings: the simplest oscillator ensemble with fully disordered interactions. We answer some open questions by means of extensive numerical simulations and a perturbative calculation (the cavity method). We show frequency entrainment is not realized in the thermodynamic limit and that chaotic dynamics are pervasive in parameter space. In the weak coupling regime, we find closed formulas for the frequency shift and the dissipativeness of the model. Interestingly, the largest Lyapunov exponent is found to exhibit the same asymptotic dependence on the coupling constant irrespective of the coupling asymmetry, within the numerical accuracy.</description>

      <title>Quasiconservation Laws and Suppressed Transport in Weakly Interacting Localized Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stability of localization in the presence of interactions remains an open problem, with finite-size effects posing significant challenges to numerical studies. In this work, we investigate the perturbative stability of noninteracting localization under weak interactions, which allows us to analyze much larger system sizes. Focusing on disordered Anderson and quasiperiodic Aubry-Andr\'e models in one dimension, and using the adiabatic gauge potential (AGP) at first order in perturbation theory, we compute first-order corrections to noninteracting local integrals of motion (LIOMs). We find that for at least an $O(1)$ fraction of the LIOMs, the corrections are well-controlled and converge at large system sizes, while others suffer from resonances. Additionally, we introduce and study the charge-transport capacity of this weakly interacting model. To first order, we find that the charge transport capacity remains bounded in the presence of interactions. Taken together, these results demonstrate that localization is perturbatively stable to weak interactions at first order, implying that, at the very least, localization persists for parametrically long times in the inverse interaction strength. We expect this perturbative stability to extend to all orders at sufficiently strong disorder, where the localization length is short, representing the true localized phase. Conversely, our findings suggest that the previously proposed interaction-induced avalanche instability, namely in the weakly localized regime of the Anderson and Aubry-Andr\'e models, is a more subtle phenomenon arising only at higher orders in perturbation theory or through nonperturbative effects.</description>

      <title>AFLOW4: heading toward disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AFLOW4 is the latest iteration of the AFLOW toolkit, specifically tailored to study high-entropy disordered materials. This upgrade includes innovative features like the Soliquidy module, based on the Euclidean transport cost between disordered and ordered material states. AFLOW4 can calculate dielectric functions to understand optical and electronic properties of disordered ceramics. The newly introduced human-readable data export feature ensures the uncomplicated incorporation of AFLOW4 in diverse automated workflows. Features relevant to high-entropy research, like prototype identification, partial occupation method, convex hull calculation, and enthalpy corrections based on local atomic environments, have been improved and exhibit substantial speed-up. Together, these enhancements represent a step forward for AFLOW as a valuable tool for research of high-entropy materials.</description>

      <title>Numerical investigation of the equilibrium Kauzmann transition in a two-dimensional atomistic glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dense liquids gradually transform into non-equilibrium amorphous solids as they pass through the experimental glass transition. Experimentally, ergodicity is lost because measurements are conducted within a finite time window. More than seventy years ago, Kauzmann posed a fundamental question: If experiments could run indefinitely, would there exist a critical temperature at which an ergodicity-breaking phase transition occurs? Random first-order transitions represent the modern theoretical framework for this idea, rigorously established in the mean-field limit of high-dimensional atomistic systems and several idealized physical models. However, achieving theoretical understanding in finite dimensions is challenging, while experimental and numerical limitations on accessible timescales hinder direct observation of the putative Kauzmann transition. Here, we overcome this longstanding barrier by developing a computational strategy that combines three advanced Monte Carlo methods to access the equilibrium thermodynamic properties of a two-dimensional atomistic glass-former down to zero temperature across a range of system sizes. This enables us to directly measure thermodynamic and structural observables that provide unambiguous evidence that the system undergoes a Kauzmann transition at a temperature that vanishes in the thermodynamic limit. This transition is towards an ideal glass state characterized by a complex energy landscape with a hierarchical organization of low-lying states. Our results are the first demonstration that computer simulations can fully probe the statistical mechanics of the bulk transition to a non-ergodic glass state. We anticipate that our study will serve as a foundation for future simulation work on larger systems, three-dimensional materials, and more complex glass-forming models to fully elucidate the nature of the glass state of matter.</description>

      <title>Topological defects govern plasticity and shear band formation in two-dimensional amorphous solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the fundamental mechanisms behind plastic instabilities and shear band formation in amorphous media under applied deformation remains a long-standing challenge. Leveraging on the mathematical concept of topology, we revisit this problem using two-dimensional experimental amorphous granular packings subjected to pure shear. We demonstrate that topological defects (TDs) in the displacement vector field act as carriers of plasticity, enabling the prediction of both the onset of plastic flow and the global mechanical response of the system. At the microscopic level, we show that these TDs are responsible for the dynamical breakdown of local orientational order, thereby linking topological excitations to short-range structural changes. Finally, we establish that the spatial localization and cooperative alignment of TDs underlie the formation of macroscopic shear bands, which drive plastic flow under large shear loads. This process is mediated by the quasi-periodic annihilation of large defect clusters and their geometric transformation from an approximately isotropic to a strongly anisotropic shape. Our results provide a unified framework for understanding plastic deformation and shear band formation in two-dimensional amorphous systems by connecting topology, short-range order, and mechanical response.</description>

      <title>Absence of higher than 6-fold coordination in glassy $GeO_{2}$ up to 158 GPa revealed by X-ray absorption spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simple binary oxide glasses can exhibit a compression behavior distinct from that of their crystalline counterparts. In this study, we employed high-pressure X-ray absorption spectroscopy coupled to the diamond anvil cell to investigate in detail local structural changes around Ge in glassy $GeO_{2}$ up to 158 GPa. We conducted four independent runs, both with and without pressure-transmitting media. Up to 30 GPa, we observed no significant influence of the pressure medium on the pressure dependence of the $Ge-O$ bond length ($&lt;R_{Ge-O}&gt;$). Between 10 and 30 GPa, the evolution of $&lt;R_{Ge-O}&gt;$ shows substantial variability across our experiments and previous works. The measured values lie close to those reported for crystalline polymorphs, including the rutile- and $CaCl_{2}$-type phase of $GeO_{2}$. This finding suggests that the amorphous structure possesses considerable flexibility to transition among different atomic configurations. From 30 GPa to 158 GPa, our results for both $&lt;R_{Ge-O}&gt;$ and the non-bonded cation-cation distance $&lt;R_{Ge...Ge}&gt;$ demonstrate that edge-sharing octahedra remain the main structural motives in glassy $GeO_{2}$. Up to 100 GPa, compaction proceeds primarily via distortions of octahedral $O-Ge-O$ bond angles accompanied by octahedral bond shortening. Above 100 GPa, octahedral distortion becomes the prevailing mechanism. Compared to its crystalline analogues ($\alpha-PbO_{2}$ and pyrite-like phase), glassy $GeO_{2}$ exhibits a slightly less efficient compaction mechanism, likely due to kinetic constraints that inhibit reconstructive lattice rearrangements.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Origins of Conformable Dynamics: From Disorder to Deformation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformable derivatives have attracted increasing interest for bridging classical and fractional calculus while retaining analytical tractability. However, their physical foundations remain underexplored. In this work, we provide a systematic derivation of conformable relaxation dynamics from microscopic principles. Starting from a spatially-resolved Ginzburg-Landau framework with quenched disorder and temperature-dependent kinetic coefficients, we demonstrate how spatial heterogeneity and energy barrier distributions give rise to emergent power-law memory kernels. In the adiabatic limit, these kernels reduce to a conformable temporal structure of the form T^{1-\mu}\,d\psi/dT. The deformation parameter \mu is shown to be connected to experimentally measurable properties such as transport coefficients, disorder statistics, and relaxation time spectra. This formulation also reveals a natural link with nonextensive thermodynamics and Tsallis entropy. By unifying memory effects, anomalous relaxation, and spatial correlations under a coherent physical mechanism, our framework transforms conformable derivatives from heuristic tools into physically grounded operators suitable for modeling complex critical dynamics.</description>

      <title>Growth and prediction of plastic strain in metallic glasses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the failure and plasticity of solids remains a longstanding challenge, with broad implications for materials design and functional reliability. Disordered solids like metallic glasses can fail either abruptly or gradually without clear precursors, and the mechanical response depends strongly on composition, thermal history and deformation protocol -- impeding generalizable modeling. While deep learning methods offer predictive power, they often rely on numerous input parameters, hindering interpretability, methodology advancement and practical deployment. Here, we propose a macroscopic, physically grounded approach that uses plastic strain accumulation in the elastic regime to robustly predict deformation and yield. This method reduces complexity and improves interpretability, offering a practical alternative for disordered materials. For the Cu-Zr-(Al) metallic glasses prepared with varied annealing, we identify two limiting regimes of plastic strain growth: power-law in poorly annealed and exponential in well-annealed samples. A physics-informed framework with Bayesian inference extracts growth parameters from stress-strain data within $\sim$5\% strain, enabling early prediction of bulk response and yield point, well before the failure. The predictive performance improves with annealing, and bulk plasticity correlates with the microscopic plastic activity from scattered to growth near yielding. This work presents a physically interpretable and experimentally relevant framework for predicting plasticity and failure in metallic glasses from early mechanical response, offering both theoretical insights and practical tools for material characterization and design.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning in Infinite Width Feature Learning Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of transfer learning in infinitely wide neural networks where both the pretraining (source) and downstream (target) task can operate in a feature learning regime. We analyze both the Bayesian framework, where learning is described by a posterior distribution over the weights, and gradient flow training of randomly initialized networks trained with weight decay. Both settings track how representations evolve in both source and target tasks. The summary statistics of these theories are adapted feature kernels which, after transfer learning, depend on data and labels from both source and target tasks. Reuse of features during transfer learning is controlled by an elastic weight coupling which controls the reliance of the network on features learned during training on the source task. We apply our theory to linear and polynomial regression tasks as well as real datasets. Our theory and experiments reveal interesting interplays between elastic weight coupling, feature learning strength, dataset size, and source and target task alignment on the utility of transfer learning.</description>

      <title>Structure and dynamics jointly stabilize the international trade hypergraph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how fluctuations arise and spread in the international trade system can help assess the current state and guide future developments. We analyze the world trade data to investigate strong adverse fluctuations, characterized here as `collapsed trades' -- individual trades that experience significant declines in annual trade volume compared to the previous year. Adopting a hypergraph framework for a fine-scale trade-centric representation of international trade, we find that collapsed trades are clustered similar to infectious disease outbreaks in societies. Moreover, the portion of collapsed trades is found to be negatively correlated with trade volume. We develop a collapse propagation model, an epidemic-like model with a weight-dependent infection rate, that reproduces all the essential empirical features. Through both analytical and numerical analysis, we identify two key factors that synergistically suppress the onset of global collective collapse and serve as a joint stabilizing mechanism for the international economy: i) a positive correlation between a trade's degree (the number of adjacent trades) and its volume and ii) an algebraically decaying infection rate with trade volume. In particular, the second factor weakened during the 2008--2009 global economic recession, possibly explaining the broader spread of collapse.</description>

      <title>Stealthy-Hyperuniform Wave Dynamics in Two-Dimensional Photonic Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperuniform structures are spatial patterns whose fluctuations disappear on long length scales, making them effectively homogeneous when observed from afar. Mathematically, this means that their spectral density, $\tilde{\rho}({\bf k})$, approaches zero for low wavenumber, $|\textbf{k}|$. Crystalline lattices are hyperuniform, as are certain quasicrystals, maximally random jammed packing of spheres, and electrons in the fractional quantum Hall state. Stealthy-hyperuniformity is an even stronger constraint on the spectral density: it requires that $\tilde{\rho}({\bf k})$ is strictly zero in a finite range of wavevectors around $\mathbf{k}=\mathbf{0}$, called the stealthy regime, or exclusion region. Since the degree of scattering by disorder is, to leading order, proportional to $\tilde{\rho}({\bf k})$, waves propagating through such structures may do so without scattering for sufficiently long wavelengths and short distances. Here, we measure scattering by disorder in photonic crystal slabs with stealthy-hyperuniform disorder by measuring the linewidths of the photonic bands. We observe the transition between the stealthy and non-stealthy regimes, marked by a sharp increase in linewidth. We also observe the effects of multiple scattering in the stealthy regime, which implies diminishing transparency. Moreover, we show that residual single scattering in the stealthy regime arises from an intrinsically non-Hermitian effect: propagating light has a complex effective mass due to radiative loss out of the slab.</description>

      <title>When Homogeneous Systems Meet Dissipation and Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11383v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the localization and topological properties of the non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) in a one-dimensional homogeneous system. Our results demonstrate that, despite the absence of disorder in the initial system, the NESS can exhibit localization under bond dissipation. These dissipation-driven localization and delocalization phenomena are clearly distinguished using Wigner distributions. Furthermore, we find that the initial localization characteristics of the system significantly influence the localization properties of the NESS. Drawing upon the concept of Bose-Einstein condensate broadening in cold-atom experiments, along with experimental data, we systematically characterize the impact of bond dissipation and disorder on the localization and topological properties of the NESS. The phase diagram reveals that the NESS can be topologically non-trivial even when the initial system is topologically trivial, and that the topological triviality of the initial system strengthens the topological non-triviality of the NESS. This work provides new insights into the localization and topological phase transitions in homogeneous systems induced by bond dissipation and disorder.</description>

      <title>Spin and energy diffusion vs. subdiffusion in disordered spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the high-temperature spin diffusion in spin chains with random local fields has been the subject of numerous studies concerning the phenomenon of many-body localization (MBL), the energy diffusion in the same models has been much less explored. We demonstrate that energy diffusion is faster at weak random fields but becomes essentially equal at strong fields; hence, both diffusions determine the slowest relaxation time scale (Thouless time) in the system. Numerically reachable finite-size systems reveal the anomalously large distribution of diffusion constants with respect to actual field configurations. Despite the exponential-like dependence of diffusion on field strength, the results for sensitivity to twisted boundary conditions are incompatible with the Thouless criterion for localization and the presumed transition to MBL, at least for numerically reachable sizes. In contrast, we find indications of the scenario of subdiffusive transport, particularly in the dynamical diffusivity response.</description>

      <title>Finding the right path: statistical mechanics of connected solutions in constraint satisfaction problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define and study a statistical mechanics ensemble that characterizes connected solutions in constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). Built around a well-known local entropy bias, it allows us to better identify hardness transitions in problems where the energy landscape is dominated by isolated solutions. We apply this new device to the symmetric binary perceptron model (SBP), and study how its manifold of connected solutions behaves. We choose this particular problem because, while its typical solutions are isolated, it can be solved using local algorithms for a certain range of constraint density $\alpha$ and threshold $\kappa$. With this new ensemble, we unveil the presence of a cluster composed of delocalized connected solutions. In particular, we demonstrate its stability until a critical threshold $\kappa^{\rm no-mem}_{\rm loc.\, stab.}$ (dependent on $\alpha$). This transition appears as paths of solutions shatter, a phenomenon that more conventional statistical mechanics approaches fail to grasp. Finally, we compared our predictions to simulations. For this, we used a modified Monte-Carlo algorithm, designed specifically to target these delocalized solutions. We obtained, as predicted, that the algorithm finds solutions until $\kappa\approx\kappa^{\rm no-mem}_{\rm loc.\, stab.}$.</description>

      <title>The Basins of Attraction of Soft Sphere Packings Are Not Fractal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The energy landscape plays a central role in understanding the dynamics of low-temperature and athermal systems, which are characterized by a plethora of minima and the intricate geometry of their basins of attraction. Due to their complexity, these landscapes resist analytical treatment and must instead be studied numerically. We focus on jammed soft spheres, a paradigmatic model of glasses and granulars, to expose the limitations of standard numerical methods in resolving the true structure of energy landscapes. We show that CVODE is the ODE solver with the best time-for-error trade-off, outperforming commonly used steepest-descent solvers by several orders of magnitude. Using this numerical approach, we provide unequivocal evidence that optimizers widely used in computational studies of soft sphere packings destroy all semblance of the true landscape geometry, even in moderately low dimensions. Employing a range of geometric indicators, both low- and high-dimensional, we show that earlier claims on the fractality of basins of attraction originated from the use of inadequate mapping strategies. In reality, the basins of attraction of soft sphere packings are smooth structures with well-defined length scales.</description>

      <title>Observation of disorder-free localization using a (2+1)D lattice gauge theory on a quantum processor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Disorder-induced phenomena in quantum many-body systems pose significant challenges for analytical methods and numerical simulations at relevant time and system scales. To reduce the cost of disorder-sampling, we investigate quantum circuits initialized in states tunable to superpositions over all disorder configurations. In a translationally-invariant lattice gauge theory (LGT), these states can be interpreted as a superposition over gauge sectors. We observe localization in this LGT in the absence of disorder in one and two dimensions: perturbations fail to diffuse despite fully disorder-free evolution and initial states. However, R\'enyi entropy measurements reveal that superposition-prepared states fundamentally differ from those obtained by direct disorder sampling. Leveraging superposition, we propose an algorithm with a polynomial speedup in sampling disorder configurations, a longstanding challenge in many-body localization studies.</description>

      <title>Hypermodularity and community detection in hypergraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerous networked systems feature a structure of nontrivial communities, which often correspond to their functional modules. Such communities have been detected in real-world biological, social and technological systems, as well as in synthetic models thereof. While much effort has been devoted to developing methods for community detection in traditional networks, the study of community structure in networks with higher-order interactions is still not as extensively explored. In this article, we introduce a formalism for the hypermodularity of higher-order networks that allows us to use spectral methods to detect community structures in hypergraphs. We apply this approach to synthetic random networks as well as to real-world data, showing that it produces results that reflect the nature and the dynamics of the interactions modelled, thereby constituting a valuable tool for the extraction of hidden information from complex higher-order data sets.</description>

      <title>Thermal Quench Dynamics of Visons in Gapless Kitaev Spin Liquid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The relaxation dynamics of the Kitaev honeycomb model under a thermal quench is dominated by the quasi-stochastic diffusion and pair annihilation of visions, which are gapped flux excitations of an emergent $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field of the Kitaev spin liquid. Both the diffusion energy barrier as well as the effective interactions between visons are mediated by the Majorana fermions which are fractionalized quasiparticles of the spin liquid. Through extensive kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the interplay between the thermal diffusion and nonlocal multi-vision interactions leads to a variety of temperature-dependent dynamical behaviors ranging from diffusion-limited and terminal-velocity-limited annihilation to dynamical arresting and freezing. Notably, we show that the freezing phenomenon is intimately related to the formation of metastable $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ vison crystals and a hidden coarsening of super-clusters associated with a broken $\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Martensites subjected to quasistatic deformation are known to exhibit power law distributed acoustic emission in a broad range of scales, however, the origin of the observed scaling behavior and the mechanism of self-organization towards apparent criticality remains obscure. Here we argue that the power law structure of intermittent fluctuations can be at least partially interpreted as an effect of inertia. We build on the insight that inertial dynamics, evidenced by acoustic emission, can become an important factor if the underlying mechanical system is only marginally stable. We first illustrate the possibility of inertia-induced \textit{heavy-tailed} avalanche size distributions using a prototypical example of a discrete chain with bi-stable springs. We then explore the effects of inertia in fully realistic two- and three-dimensional continuum models of elastic phase transitions. In particular, we demonstrate that a three-dimensional model can produce not only qualitative but also quantitative agreement with experiment.</description>

      <title>Role of scrambling and noise in temporal information processing with quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scrambling quantum systems have attracted attention as effective substrates for temporal information processing. Here we consider a quantum reservoir processing framework that captures a broad range of physical computing models with quantum systems. We examine the scalability and memory retention of the model with scrambling reservoirs modelled by high-order unitary designs in both noiseless and noisy settings. In the former regime, we show that measurement readouts become exponentially concentrated with increasing reservoir size, yet strikingly do not worsen with the reservoir iterations. Thus, while repeatedly reusing a small scrambling reservoir with quantum data might be viable, scaling up the problem size deteriorates generalization unless one can afford an exponential shot overhead. In contrast, the memory of early inputs and initial states decays exponentially in both reservoir size and reservoir iterations. In the noisy regime, we also prove that memory decays exponentially in time for local noisy channels. These results required us to introduce new proof techniques for bounding concentration in temporal quantum models.</description>
