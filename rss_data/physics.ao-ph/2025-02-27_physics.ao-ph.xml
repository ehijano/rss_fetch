      <title>Arctic teleconnection on climate and ozone pollution in the polar jet stream path of eastern US</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arctic sea ice is in reduction and has been a key significant indicator of climate change. In this paper, we explore Arctic Sea ice extent data to identify teleconnection with weather change in the polar and sub-tropical jet stream intersection in eastern United States (US) and hence the potential influence in ground level ozone pollution. Several statistical methods including Bayesian techniques such as: spatio-temporal modelling and Bayesian network are implemented to identify the teleconnection and also validated based on theories in atmospheric science. We observe that the teleconnection is relatively strong in autumn, winter and spring seasons compared to the summer. Furthermore, the sudden decremental effect of Arctic sea-ice extent in mid-2000s has a shifting influence in ozone pollutions compared to the previous years. A similar downward shift in the Arctic sea-ice extent has been projected in 2030. These findings indicate to initiate further strategic policies for the Arctic influence, ozone concentrations together the seasonal and global changing patterns of climate.</description>

      <title>Highly Localised Droplet Clustering in Shallow Cumulus Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growth, lifetime, number density, and size of water droplets in warm atmospheric clouds determine the evolution, lifetime and light transmission properties of those clouds. These small-scale cloud properties, in addition to precipitation initiation, have strong implications for the Earth's energy budget since warm clouds cover large geographic areas. Spatio-temporal correlations on the millimetre scale and smaller may or may not affect these properties of clouds. To date, the pioneering measurements of such correlations in marine stratocumulus clouds have relied on averaging over holographically reconstructed volumes spanning at least ten kilometres. These have revealed weak but widespread spatial clustering of cloud droplets. Here we present results of strong localised clustering on scales of half a metre or less from holographic measurements collected with the Max Planck CloudKite in shallow cumulus clouds in the mid-Atlantic trade wind region near Barbados, with a spatial separation of only 12~cm between measurement volumes. This observation challenges the foundations of our understanding of cloud microphysics at the droplet scale, with implications for cloud modelling in weather and climate prediction.</description>

      <title>Limited hysteresis in the atmospheric dynamics of hot Jupiters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past two decades, a coherent picture has emerged of the atmospheric dynamics of hot Jupiters from a combination of three-dimensional general circulation models (GCMs) and astronomical observations. This paradigm consists of hot Jupiters being spin-synchronized due to their close-in orbit, with a resulting large day-to-night irradiation gradient driving a day-to-night temperature contrast. This day-to-night temperature contrast in turn raises day-to-night pressure gradients that are balanced by a circulation with wind speeds on the order of km~s$^{-1}$. The dominant feature of this circulation is a superrotating equatorial jet, maintained by eddy-mean flow interactions that pump momentum into the jet. In this work, I explore the dependence of this circulation paradigm on the initial thermal and dynamical conditions in atmospheric circulation models of hot Jupiters. To do so, I conduct MITgcm simulations of the atmospheric circulation of hot Jupiters with both varying initial wind directions and initial temperature profiles. I find that the results are insensitive to the initial conditions, implying that the current paradigm of hot Jupiter circulation exhibits at most limited hysteresis. I demonstrate that there is a single characteristic wind speed of hot Jupiters for given planetary and atmospheric parameters using an idealized scaling theory, and discuss implications for the interpretation of hot Jupiter observations.</description>

      <title>Fast, Scale-Adaptive, and Uncertainty-Aware Downscaling of Earth System Model Fields with Generative Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02774v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate and high-resolution Earth system model (ESM) simulations are essential to assess the ecological and socio-economic impacts of anthropogenic climate change, but are computationally too expensive to be run at sufficiently high spatial resolution. Recent machine learning approaches have shown promising results in downscaling ESM simulations, outperforming state-of-the-art statistical approaches. However, existing methods require computationally costly retraining for each ESM and extrapolate poorly to climates unseen during training. We address these shortcomings by learning a consistency model (CM) that efficiently and accurately downscales arbitrary ESM simulations without retraining in a zero-shot manner. Our approach yields probabilistic downscaled fields at a resolution only limited by the observational reference data. We show that the CM outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion models at a fraction of computational cost while maintaining high controllability on the downscaling task. Further, our method generalizes to climate states unseen during training without explicitly formulated physical constraints.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning Earth System Model for Efficient Simulation of the Observed Climate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A key challenge for computationally intensive state-of-the-art Earth System models is to distinguish global warming signals from interannual variability. Here we introduce DLESyM, a parsimonious deep learning model that accurately simulates the Earth's current climate over 1000-year periods with no smoothing or drift. DLESyM simulations equal or exceed key metrics of seasonal and interannual variability--such as tropical cyclogenesis over the range of observed intensities, the cycle of the Indian Summer monsoon, and the climatology of mid-latitude blocking events--when compared to historical simulations from four leading models from the 6th Climate Model Intercomparison Project. DLESyM, trained on both historical reanalysis data and satellite observations, is an accurate, highly efficient model of the coupled Earth system, empowering long-range sub-seasonal and seasonal forecasts while using a fraction of the energy and computational time required by traditional models.</description>

      <title>Inferring Thunderstorm Occurrence from Vertical Profiles of Convection-Permitting Simulations: Physical Insights from a Physical Deep Learning Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thunderstorms have significant social and economic impacts due to heavy precipitation, hail, lightning, and strong winds, necessitating reliable forecasts. Thunderstorm forecasts based on numerical weather prediction (NWP) often rely on single-level surrogate predictors, like convective available potential energy and convective inhibition, derived from vertical profiles of three-dimensional atmospheric variables. In this study, we develop SALAMA 1D, a deep neural network which directly infers the probability of thunderstorm occurrence from vertical profiles of ten atmospheric variables, bypassing single-level predictors. By training the model on convection-permitting NWP forecasts, we allow SALAMA 1D to flexibly identify convective patterns, with the goal of enhancing forecast accuracy. The model's architecture is physically motivated: sparse connections encourage interactions at similar height levels while keeping model size and inference times computationally efficient, whereas a shuffling mechanism prevents the model from learning non-physical patterns tied to the vertical grid. SALAMA 1D is trained over Central Europe with lightning observations as the ground truth. Comparative analysis against a baseline machine learning model that uses single-level predictors shows SALAMA 1D's superior skill across various metrics and lead times of up to at least 11 hours. Moreover, expanding the archive of forecasts from which training examples are sampled improves skill, even when training set size remains constant. Finally, a sensitivity analysis using saliency maps indicates that our model relies on physically interpretable patterns consistent with established theoretical understanding, primarily focusing on convection initiation and refining its skill by checking for ongoing convection in the NWP model.</description>
