      <title>Quantum Circuit Reasoning Models: A Variational Framework for Differentiable Logical Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This report introduces a novel class of reasoning architectures, termed Quantum Circuit Reasoning Models (QCRM), which extend the concept of Variational Quantum Circuits (VQC) from energy minimization and classification tasks to structured logical inference and reasoning. We posit that fundamental quantum mechanical operations, superposition, entanglement, interference, and measurement, naturally map to essential reasoning primitives such as hypothesis branching, constraint propagation, consistency enforcement, and decision making. The resulting framework combines quantum-inspired computation with differentiable optimization, enabling reasoning to emerge as a process of amplitude evolution and interference-driven selection of self-consistent states. We develop the mathematical foundation of QCRM, define its parameterized circuit architecture, and show how logical rules can be encoded as unitary transformations over proposition-qubit states. We further formalize a training objective grounded in classical gradient descent over circuit parameters and discuss simulation-based implementations on classical hardware. Finally, we propose the Quantum Reasoning Layer (QRL) as a differentiable hybrid component for composable reasoning models applicable to scientific, biomedical, and chemical inference domains.</description>

      <title>The State-Operator Clifford Compatibility: A Real Algebraic Framework for Quantum Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the Pauli-Clifford connection to introduce a real, grade-preserving algebraic framework for $N$-qubit quantum computation based on the tensor product structure $C\ell_{2,0}(\mathbb{R})^{\otimes N}$. In this setting the bivector $J = e_{12}$ satisfies $J^{2} = -1$ and supplies the complex structure on a minimal left ideal via right-multiplication, while Pauli operations arise as left actions of suitable Clifford elements. Adopting a canonical stabilizer mapping, the $N$-qubit computational basis state $|0\cdots 0\rangle$ is represented natively by a tensor product of real algebraic idempotents. This structural choice leads to a State-Operator Clifford Compatibility law that is stable under the geometric product for $N$ qubits and aligns symbolic Clifford multiplication with unitary evolution on the Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Quantum catalysis-enhanced extract energy in qubit quantum battery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What physical mechanism enables quantum catalysis to boost quantum battery (QB) performance in open systems? We investigate an external-field-driven qubit QB coupled to a harmonic oscillator catalyst, revealing a key thermodynamic mechanism: the catalyst induces transient negative heat flow ($J(t)&lt;0$, or energy backflow) into the battery. This backflow actively counters dephasing losses, rapidly pushing the qubit into non-passive states, and results in a drastic enhancement of extractable work (Ergotropy). Leveraging the quantum first law, we precisely quantify this causal link between negative heat flux and QB performance enhancement. Our work uncovers the fundamental role of transient thermodynamic backflow in quantum catalysis, offering a crucial blueprint for high-performance quantum energy storage devices.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Based Quantum Codes Beyond the Pauli Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Typical stabilizer codes aim to solve the general problem of fault-tolerance without regard for the structure of a specific system. By incorporating a broader representation-theoretic perspective, we provide a generalized framework that allows the code designer to take this structure into account. For any representation of a finite group, we produce a quantum code with a code space invariant under the group action, providing passive error mitigation against errors belonging to the image of the representation. Furthermore, errors outside this scope are detected and diagnosed by performing a projective measurement onto the isotypic components corresponding to irreducible representations of the chosen group, effectively generalizing syndrome extraction to symmetry-resolved quantum measurements. We show that all stabilizer codes are a special case of this construction, including qudit stabilizer codes, and show that there is a natural one logical qubit code associated to the dihedral group. Thus we provide a unifying framework for existing codes while simultaneously facilitating symmetry-aware codes tailored to specific systems.</description>

      <title>Fair Benchmarking of Optimisation Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum optimisation is emerging as a promising approach alongside classical heuristics and specialised hardware, yet its performance is often difficult to assess fairly. Traditional benchmarking methods, rooted in digital complexity theory, do not directly capture the continuous dynamics, probabilistic outcomes, and workflow overheads of quantum and hybrid systems. This paper proposes principles and protocols for fair benchmarking of quantum optimisation, emphasising end-to-end workflows, transparency in tuning and reporting, problem diversity, and avoidance of speculative claims. By extending lessons from classical benchmarking and incorporating application-driven and energy-aware metrics, we outline a framework that enables practitioners to evaluate quantum methods responsibly, ensuring reproducibility, comparability, and trust in reported results.</description>

      <title>Quantum computing of nonlinear reacting flows via the probability density function method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing offers the promise of speedups for scientific computations, but its application to reacting flows is hindered by nonlinear source terms and the challenges of time-dependent simulations. We present a quantum framework to address these issues. We employ a probability density function (PDF) formulation to transform the nonlinear reacting-flow governing equations into high-dimensional linear ones. The entire temporal evolution is then solved as a single large linear system using the history state method, which avoids the measurement bottleneck of conventional time-marching schemes and fully leverages the advantages of quantum linear system algorithms. To extract the quantity of interest from the resulting quantum state, we develop an efficient algorithm to measure the statistical moments of the PDF, bypassing the need for costly full-state tomography. A computational complexity analysis indicates the potential for a near-exponential speedup over classical algorithms. We validate the framework by simulating a perfectly stirred reactor, demonstrating its capability to capture the PDF evolution and statistics of a nonlinear reactive system. This work establishes a pathway for applying quantum computing to nonlinear reacting flows.</description>

      <title>Quantum algorithms for viscosity solutions to nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi equations based on an entropy penalisation method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a framework for efficient extraction of the viscosity solutions of nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi equations with convex Hamiltonians. These viscosity solutions play a central role in areas such as front propagation, mean-field games, optimal control, machine learning, and a direct application to the forced Burgers' equation. Our method is based on an entropy penalisation method proposed by Gomes and Valdinoci, which generalises the Cole-Hopf transform from quadratic to general convex Hamiltonians, allowing a reformulation of viscous Hamilton-Jacobi dynamics by a discrete-time linear dynamics which approximates a linear heat-like parabolic equation, and can also extend to continuous-time dynamics. This makes the method suitable for quantum simulation. The validity of these results hold for arbitrary nonlinearity that correspond to convex Hamiltonians, and for arbitrarily long times, thus obviating a chief obstacle in most quantum algorithms for nonlinear partial differential equations. We provide quantum algorithms, both analog and digital, for extracting pointwise values, gradients, minima, and function evaluations at the minimiser of the viscosity solution, without requiring nonlinear updates or full state reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Exchange Symmetry in Multiphoton Quantum Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photons are bosons, and yet, when prepared in specific entangled states, they can exhibit non-bosonic behaviour. While this phenomenon has so far been studied in two-photon systems, exchange symmetries and interference effects in multi-photon scenarios remain largely unexplored. In this work, we show that multi-photon states uncover a rich landscape of exchange symmetries. With three photons already, multiple pairwise combinations are possible, where each pair of photons can exhibit either bosonic, fermionic, or anyonic exchange symmetry. This gives rise to mixed symmetry systems that are not possible to achieve with two photon alone. We experimentally investigate how these symmetry configurations manifest themselves in the observed interference of three photons. We show that multi-photon interference can be effectively turned on and off by tuning the symmetry of the constituent pairs. The possibility of accessing and tuning new quantum statistics in a scalable photonic platform not only deepens our understanding of quantum systems, but is also highly relevant for quantum technologies that rely on quantum interference.</description>

      <title>Coherence-limited digital control of a superconducting qubit using a Josephson pulse generator at 3 K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compared to traditional semiconductor control electronics (TSCE) located at room temperature, cryogenic single flux quantum (SFQ) electronics can provide qubit measurement and control alternatives that address critical issues related to scalability of cryogenic quantum processors. Single-qubit control and readout have been demonstrated recently using SFQ circuits coupled to superconducting qubits. Experiments where the SFQ electronics are co-located with the qubit have suffered from excess decoherence and loss due to quasiparticle poisoning of the qubit. A previous experiment by our group showed that moving the control electronics to the 3 K stage of the dilution refrigerator avoided this source of decoherence in a high-coherence 3D transmon geometry. In this paper, we also generate the pulses at the 3 K stage but have optimized the qubit design and control lines for scalable 2D transmon devices. We directly compare the qubit lifetime $T_1$, coherence time $T_2^*$ and gate fidelity when the qubit is controlled by the Josephson pulse generator (JPG) circuit versus the TSCE setup. We find agreement to within the daily fluctuations for $T_1$ and $T_2^*$, and agreement to within 10% for randomized benchmarking. We also performed interleaved randomized benchmarking on individual JPG gates demonstrating an average error per gate of $0.46$% showing good agreement with what is expected based on the qubit coherence and higher-state leakage. These results are an order of magnitude improvement in gate fidelity over our previous work and demonstrate that a Josephson microwave source operated at 3 K is a promising component for scalable qubit control.</description>

      <title>Measurement-and Feedback-Driven Non-Equilibrium Phase Transitions on a Quantum Processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mid-circuit measurements and feedback operations conditioned on the measurement outcomes are essential for implementing quantum error-correction on quantum hardware. When integrated in quantum many-body dynamics, they can give rise to novel non-equilibrium phase transitions both at the level of each individual quantum trajectory and the averaged quantum channel. Experimentally resolving both transitions on realistic devices has been challenging due to limitations on the fidelity and the significant latency for performing mid-circuit measurements and feedback operations in real time. Here, we develop a superconducting quantum processor that enables global mid-circuit measurement with an average quantum non-demolition (QND) fidelity of 98.7% and fast conditional feedback with a 200 ns real-time decision latency. Using this platform, we demonstrate the coexistence of an absorbing-state transition in the quantum channel and a measurement-induced entanglement transition at the level of individual quantum trajectories. For the absorbing-state transition, we experimentally extract a set of critical exponents at the transition point, which is in excellent agreement with the directed percolation universality class. Crucially, the two transitions occur at distinct values of the tuning parameter. Our results demonstrate that adaptive quantum circuits provide a powerful platform for exploring non-equilibrium quantum many-body dynamics.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Analysis of Weak Measurements and Their Reversal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study trade-off relations in information extraction from quantum systems subject to null-result weak measurements, where the absence of a detected photon continuously updates the system state. We present a detailed analysis of qubit and qutrit systems and investigate a general framework for a multilevel quantum system. We develop a dynamical characterization of null-result weak measurements that quantifies the information extracted over time, revealing the amount of the obtained information and also the rate of the information accumulation. The characterizations are obtained by examining the time-dependent evolution of the information theoretic quantities. More specifically, we consider Shannon entropy, mutual information, fidelity, and relative entropy to characterize the weak measurement dynamics. Our results provide an information theoretic analysis of the weak measurement process and highlight the dynamical nature of information extraction and reversibility in the weak measurement processes.</description>

      <title>Classical and quantum dynamics of a particle confined in a paraboloidal cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a classical and quantum analysis of a particle confined in a three-dimensional paraboloidal cavity formed by two confocal paraboloids. Classically, the system is integrable and presents three independent constants of motion, namely, the energy, the $z$-component of the angular momentum, and a third dynamical constant associated with the paraboloidal geometry, which can be derived from the separability of the Hamilton--Jacobi equation. We derive closed-form analytical expressions for the actions, which allow us to determine the two conditions to get periodic closed trajectories. We classify these trajectories through the indices $(s,t,\ell)$. The caustic paraboloids that bound the motion provide a complete geometric characterization of admissible trajectories. Quantum mechanically, separability of the Schr\"odinger equation in parabolic coordinates yields eigenmodes described by Whittaker functions. We determine the energy spectrum and identify degeneracies arising not only from azimuthal symmetry but also from specific cavity deformations. A direct correspondence between classical trajectories and quantum eigenstates reveals that probability densities concentrate in the classically allowed region with controlled penetration into forbidden zones.</description>

      <title>F2: Offline Reinforcement Learning for Hamiltonian Simulation via Free-Fermionic Subroutine Compilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compiling shallow and accurate quantum circuits for Hamiltonian simulation remains challenging due to hardware constraints and the combinatorial complexity of minimizing gate count and circuit depth. Existing optimization method pipelines rely on hand-engineered classical heuristics, which cannot learn input-dependent structure and therefore miss substantial opportunities for circuit reduction.
  We introduce \textbf{F2}, an offline reinforcement learning framework that exploits free-fermionic structure to efficiently compile Trotter-based Hamiltonian simulation circuits. F2 provides (i) a reinforcement-learning environment over classically simulatable free-fermionic subroutines, (ii) architectural and objective-level inductive biases that stabilize long-horizon value learning, and (iii) a reversible synthetic-trajectory generation mechanism that consistently yields abundant, guaranteed-successful offline data.
  Across benchmarks spanning lattice models, protein fragments, and crystalline materials (12-222 qubits), F2 reduces gate count by 47\% and depth by 38\% on average relative to strong baselines (Qiskit, Cirq/OpenFermion) while maintaining average errors of $10^{-7}$. These results show that aligning deep reinforcement learning with the algebraic structure of quantum dynamics enables substantial improvements in circuit synthesis, suggesting a promising direction for scalable, learning-based quantum compilation</description>

      <title>Observation of a Topological Berry Phase with a Single Phonon in an Ion Microtrap Array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlled quantum mechanical motion of trapped atomic ions can be used to simulate and explore collective quantum phenomena and to process quantum information. Groups of cold atomic ions in an externally applied trapping potential self-organize into "Coulomb crystals" due to their mutual electrostatic repulsion. The motion of the ions in these crystals is strongly coupled, and the eigenmodes of motion all involve multiple ions. While this enables studies of many-body physics, it limits the flexibility and tunability of the system as a quantum platform. Here, we demonstrate an array of trapped ions in individual trapping sites whose motional modes can be controllably coupled and decoupled by tuning the local applied confining potential for each ion. We show that a single motional quantum, or phonon, can be coherently shared among two or three ions confined at the vertices of an equilateral triangle 30 $\mu$m on a side. We can adiabatically tune the ion participation in the motional modes around a closed contour in configuration space, observing that the single-phonon wavefunction acquires a topological Berry phase if the contour encircles a conical intersection of motional eigenvalue surfaces. We observe this phase by single-phonon interference and study its breakdown as the motional mode tuning becomes non-adiabiatic. Our results show that precise, individual quantum control of ion motion in a two-dimensional array can provide unique access to quantum multi-body effects.</description>

      <title>Coherent and compact van der Waals transmon qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art superconducting qubits rely on a limited set of thin-film materials. Expanding their materials palette can improve performance, extend operating regimes, and introduce new functionalities, but conventional thin-film fabrication hinders systematic exploration of new material combinations. Van der Waals (vdW) materials offer a highly modular crystalline platform that facilitates such exploration while enabling gate-tunability, higher-temperature operation, and compact qubit geometries. Yet it remains unknown whether a fully vdW superconducting qubit can support quantum coherence and what mechanisms dominate loss at both low and elevated temperatures in such a device. Here we demonstrate quantum-coherent merged-element transmons made entirely from vdW Josephson junctions. These first-generation, fully crystalline qubits achieve microsecond lifetimes in an ultra-compact footprint without external shunt capacitors. Energy relaxation measurements, together with microwave characterization of vdW capacitors, point to dielectric loss as the dominant relaxation channel up to hundreds of millikelvin. These results establish vdW materials as a viable platform for compact superconducting quantum devices.</description>

      <title>On Dirac-type correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum correlations often defy an explanation in terms of fundamental notions of classical physics, such as causality, locality, and realism. While the mathematical theory underpinning quantum correlations between spacelike separated systems has been well-established since the 1930s, the mathematical theory for correlations between non-spacelike separated systems is much less developed. In this work, we develop the theory of what we refer to as "local-density operators", which we view as joint states for possibly non-spacelike separated quantum systems. Local-density operators are unit trace operators whose marginals are genuine density operators, which we show not only subsumes the notion of density operator, but also several extensions of the notion of density operator into the spatiotemporal domain, such as pseudo-density operators and quantum states over time. More importantly, we prove a result which establishes a one-to-one correspondence between local-density operators and what we refer to as "Dirac measures", which are complex-valued measures on the space of separable projectors associated with two quantum systems. In the case that one of the systems is the trivial quantum system with a one-dimensional Hilbert space, our result recovers the fundamental result known as Gleason's Theorem, which implies that the Born rule from quantum theory is the only way in which one may assign probabilities to the outcomes of measurements performed on quantum systems in a non-contextual manner. As such, our results establish a direct generalization of Gleason's Theorem to measurements performed on possibly non-spacelike separated systems, thus extending the mathematical theory of quantum correlations across space to quantum correlations across space and time.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Equations for Feedback Control of Open Quantum Systems II: Properties of the memory function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feedback uses past detection outcomes to dynamically modify a quantum system and is central to quantum control. These outcomes can be stored in a memory, defined as a stochastic function of past measurements. In this work, we investigate the main properties of a general memory function subject to arbitrary feedback dynamics. We show that the memory can be treated as a classical system coupled to the monitored quantum system, and that their joint evolution is described by a hybrid bipartite state. This framework allows us to introduce information-theoretic measures that quantify the correlations between the system and the memory. Furthermore, we develop a general framework to characterize the statistics of the memory -- such as moments, cumulants, and correlation functions -- which can be applied both to general feedback-control protocols and to monitored systems without feedback. As an application, we analyze feedback schemes based on detection events in a two-level system coupled to a thermal bath, focusing on protocols that stabilize either the excited-state population or Rabi oscillations against thermal dissipation.</description>

      <title>On the Emergence of Time and Space in Closed Quantum Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time, space and entanglement are the main characters in this work. Their nature is still a great mystery in physics and we study here the possibility that these three phenomena are closely connected, showing how entanglement can be at the basis of the emergence of time and space within closed quantum systems. We revisit and extend the Page and Wootters theory that was originally introduced in order to describe the emergence of time through entanglement between subsystems in a globally static, quantum Universe. In the book, after providing a complete review of the salient aspects of the theory, we establish a connection with recent research on the foundations of statistical mechanics and we propose a new understanding of the thermalization process. Furthermore, we generalize the framework in order describe the spatial degree of freedom and we provide a model of 3+1 dimensional, quantum spacetime emerging from entanglement among different subsystems in a globally "timeless" and "positionless" Universe. Finally, via the Page and Wootters theory, the evolution of quantum clocks within a gravitational field is treated and a time dilation effect is obtained in agreement with the Schwarzschild solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A paradoxical idea in quantum transport is that attaching weakly-coupled edges to a large base graph creates high-fidelity quantum state transfer. We provide a mathematical treatment that rigorously prove this folklore idea. Our proofs are elementary and build upon the Feshbach-Schur method from perturbation theory. We also show the idea is effective in circumventing Anderson localization in spin chains and finding speedups in hitting times useful for quantum search.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a coarse-graining map arising from incomplete and imperfect addressing of particles in a multipartite quantum system. In its simplest form, corresponding to a two-qubit state, the resulting channel produces a convex mixture of the two partial traces. We derive the probability density of obtaining a given coarse-grained state, using geometric arguments for two qubits coarse-grained to one, and random-matrix methods for larger systems. As the number of qubits increases, the probability density sharply concentrates around the maximally mixed state, making nearly pure coarse-grained states increasingly unlikely. For two qubits, we also compute the inverse state needed to characterize the effective dynamics under coarse-graining and find that the average preimage of the maximally mixed state contains a finite singlet component. Finally, we validate the analytical predictions by inferring the underlying probabilities from Monte-Carlo-generated coarse-grained statistics.</description>

      <title>Large-scale Lindblad learning from time-series data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a protocol for learning a time-independent Lindblad model for operations that can be applied repeatedly on a quantum computer. The protocol is highly scalable for models with local interactions and is in principle insensitive to state-preparation errors. At its core, the protocol forms a linear system of equations for the model parameters in terms of a set of observable values and their gradients. The required gradient information is obtained by fitting time-series data with sums of exponentially damped sinusoids and differentiating those curves. We develop a robust curve-fitting procedure that finds the most parsimonious representation of the data up to shot noise. We demonstrate the approach by learning the Lindbladian for a full layer of gates on a 156-qubit superconducting quantum processor, providing the first learning experiment of this kind. We study the effects of state-preparation and measurement errors and limitations on the operations that can be learned. For improved performance under readout errors, we propose an optional fine-tuning strategy that improves the fit between the time-evolved model and the measured data.</description>

      <title>The utility of noiseless linear amplification and attenuation in single-rail discrete-variable quantum communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum communication offers many applications, with teleportation and superdense coding being two of the most fundamental. In these protocols, pre-shared entanglement enables either the faithful transfer of quantum states or the transmission of more information than is possible classically. However, channel losses degrade the shared states, reducing teleportation fidelity and the information advantage in superdense coding. Here, we investigate how to mitigate these effects by optimising the measurements applied by the communicating parties. We formulate the problem as an optimisation over general positive operator-valued measurements (POVMs) and compare the results with physically realisable noiseless attenuation (NA) and noiseless linear amplification (NLA) circuits. For teleportation, NLA/NA and optimised POVMs improve the average fidelity by up to 78% while maintaining feasible success probabilities. For superdense coding, they enhance the quantum advantage over the classical channel capacity by more than 100% in some regimes and shift the break-even point, thereby extending the tolerable range of losses. Notably, the optimal POVMs effectively reduce to NA or NLA, showing that simple, experimentally accessible operations already capture the essential performance gains.</description>

      <title>Programmable Open Quantum Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Programmability is a unifying paradigm for enacting families of quantum transformations via fixed processors and program states, with a fundamental role and broad impact in quantum computation and control. While there has been a shift from viewing open systems solely as a source of error to treating them as a computational resource, their programmability remains largely unexplored. In this work, we develop a framework that characterizes and quantifies the programmability of Lindbladian semigroups by combining physically implementable retrieval maps with time varying program states. Within this framework, we identify quantum programmable classes enabled by symmetry and stochastic structure, including covariant semigroups and fully dissipative Pauli Lindbladians with finite program dimension. We further provide a necessary condition for physical programmability that rules out coherent generators and typical dissipators generating amplitude damping. For such nonphysically programmable cases, we construct explicit protocols with finite resources. Finally, we introduce an operational programming cost, defined via the number of samples required to program the Lindbladian, and establish its core structural properties, such as continuity and faithfulness. These results provide a notion of programming cost for Lindbladians, bridge programmable channel theory and open system dynamics, and yield symmetry driven compression schemes and actionable resource estimates for semigroup simulation and control in noisy quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Major technological advances of the past century are rooted in our understanding of quantum physics in the non-interacting limit. A central challenge today is to understand the behavior of complex quantum many-body systems, where interactions play an essential role. About four decades ago, Richard Feynman proposed using controllable quantum systems to efficiently simulate complex physics and chemistry problems, envisioning quantum orreries, highly tunable quantum devices built to emulate less understood quantum systems. Here we ask whether quantum simulators have already uncovered new physical phenomena-and, if so, in which areas and with what impact. We find that, in several notable instances, they have advanced our understanding of many-body quantum dynamics. Although many of these insights could in principle have been obtained theoretically or numerically, they were nevertheless first achieved using quantum processors. While a broad landscape of problems beyond non-equilibrium dynamics still awaits exploration, it is encouraging that quantum simulators are already beginning to challenge and refine our conventional wisdom.</description>

      <title>Quantum-classical correspondence in resonant and nonresonant Rabi-Stark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Testing the correspondence principle in nonlinear quantum systems is a fundamental pursuit in quantum physics. In this paper, we employed mean field approximation theory to study the semiclassical dynamics in the Rabi-Stark model (RSM) and showed that the nonlinear Stark coupling significantly modulates the semiclassical phase space structure. By analyzing the linear entanglement entropy of coherent states prepared in the classical chaotic and regular regions of the semiclassical phase space, we demonstrate that quantum-classical correspondence can be achieved in the RSM with large atom-light frequency ratios. While this correspondence fails in the resonant Rabi model because its truncated photon number is insufficient to approach the large quantum number limit, we discovered that in the resonant RSM when the nonlinear Stark coupling $U \to \pm 1$, the time-averaged linear entanglement entropy correlates strongly with the semiclassical phase space. In particular, when $U \to -1$, the truncated photon number in the resonant RSM is very close to that in the resonant Rabi model, but the time-averaged linear entanglement entropy still corresponds well with the semiclassical phase space. This result demonstrates that quantum-classical correspondence can be realized in the few-body resonant RSM.</description>

Abstract: Machine learning is widely applied in modern society, but has yet to capitalise on the unique benefits offered by quantum resources. Boson sampling -- a quantum-interference based sampling protocol -- is a resource that is classically hard to simulate and can be implemented on current quantum hardware. Here, we present a quantum accelerator for classical machine learning, using boson sampling to provide a high-dimensional quantum fingerprint for reservoir computing. We show robust performance improvements under various conditions: imperfect photon sources down to complete distinguishability; scenarios with severe class imbalances, classifying both handwritten digits and biomedical images; and sparse data, maintaining model accuracy with twenty times less training data. Crucially, we demonstrate the acceleration and scalability of our scheme on a photonic quantum processing unit, providing the first experimental validation that boson-sampling-enhanced learning delivers real performance gains on actual quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Quantum Communication Between Fixed-Frequency Superconducting Qubits via Broadband Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum communication between remote chips is essential for realizing large-scale superconducting quantum computers. For such communication, itinerant microwave photons propagating through transmission lines offer a promising approach. However, demonstrations to date have relied on frequency-tunable circuit elements to compensate for fabrication-related parameter variations between sender and receiver devices, introducing control complexity and limiting scalability. In this work, we demonstrate deterministic quantum state transfer and remote entanglement generation between fixed-frequency superconducting qubits on separate chips. To compensate for the sender-receiver mismatch, we employ a frequency-tunable photon-generation technique which enables us to adjust the photon frequency without modifying circuit parameters. To enhance the frequency tunability, we implement broadband transfer resonators composed of two coupled coplanar-waveguide resonators, achieving a bandwidth of more than 100 MHz. This broadband design enables successful quantum communication across a 30-MHz range of photon frequencies between the remote qubits. Quantum process tomography reveals state transfer fidelities of around 78% and Bell-state fidelities of around 73% across the full frequency range. Our approach avoids the complexity of the control lines and noise channels, providing a flexible pathway toward scalable quantum networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantum algorithmic routine that extends the realm of Grover-based heuristics for tackling combinatorial optimization problems with arbitrary efficiently computable objective and constraint functions. Building on previously developed quantum methods that were primarily restricted to linear constraints, we generalize the approach to encompass a broader class of problems in discrete domains. To evaluate the potential of our algorithm, we assume the existence of sufficiently advanced logical quantum hardware. With this assumption, we demonstrate that our method has the potential to outperform state-of-the-art classical solvers and heuristics in terms of both runtime scaling and solution quality. The same may be true for more realistic implementations, as the logical quantum algorithm can achieve runtime savings of up to $10^2-10^3$.</description>

      <title>Practical protein-pocket hydration-site prediction for drug discovery on a quantum computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Demonstrating the practical utility of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware for recurrent tasks in Computer-Aided Drug Discovery is of paramount importance. We tackle this challenge by performing three-dimensional protein pockets hydration-site prediction on a quantum computer. Formulating the water placement problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO), we use a hybrid approach coupling a classical three-dimensional reference-interaction site model (3D-RISM) to an efficient quantum optimization solver, to run various hardware experiments up to 123 qubits. Matching the precision of classical approaches, our results reproduced experimental predictions on real-life protein-ligand complexes. Furthermore, through a detailed resource estimation analysis, we show that accuracy can be systematically improved with increasing number of qubits, indicating that full quantum utility is in reach. Finally, we provide evidence that advantageous situations could be found for systems where classical optimization struggles to provide optimal solutions. The method has potential for assisting simulations of protein-ligand complexes for drug lead optimization and setup of docking calculations.</description>

      <title>Single-Step Phase-Engineered Pulse for Active Readout Cavity Reset in Superconducting Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a circuit QED architecture, we experimentally demonstrate a simple and hardware-efficient Single-Step Phase-Engineered (SSPE) pulse scheme for actively depopulating the readout cavity. The method appends a reset segment with tailored amplitude and phase to a normal square readout pulse. Within the linear-response regime, the optimal reset amplitude scales proportionally with the readout amplitude, while the optimal reset phase remains nearly invariant, significantly simplifying the calibration process. By characterizing the cavity photons dynamics, we show that the SSPE pulse accelerates photon depletion by up to a factor of six compared to passive free decay. We further quantify the qubit backaction induced by the readout pulse and find that the SSPE pulse yields the lowest excitation and relaxation rates compared to a Square and CLEAR pulses. Our results establish the SSPE scheme as a practical and scalable approach for achieving fast, smooth, low-backaction cavity reset in superconducting quantum circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss a refinement of quantum data processing inequality for the sandwiched quasi-relative entropy $\mathcal{S}_2$ on a tracial von-Neumann algebra. The main result is a universal recoverability bound with the Petz recovery map, which was previously obtained in the finite dimensional setup.</description>

      <title>Real-time heralded non-Gaussian teleportation resource-state generator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum teleportation is a fundamental quantum communications primitive that requires an entangled resource state. In the continuous-variable regime, non-Gaussian entangled resources have been shown theoretically to improve teleportation fidelity compared to Gaussian squeezed vacuum. We experimentally demonstrate a heralded two-mode resource state for non-Gaussian teleportation capable of real-time use. We characterize this state with two-mode homodyne tomography showing it has fidelity $F=0.973\pm 0.005$ with the expected resource state. Real-time use is enabled by a photon-subtraction orchestrator system performing live coincidence detection and outputting low-jitter and low-latency heralding signals. Live collection of real-time quadrature measurements of photon-subtracted states is enabled by the development of a synchronized homodyne detection server where the orchestrator system queries to collect the real-time quadrature samples corresponding to the heralded state. These results demonstrate significant advancement in enabling the use of heralded non-Gaussian states in quantum networking protocols, especially in the context of quantum repeaters, non-Gaussian quantum sensing and measurement-based quantum computing.</description>

      <title>A Grover-compatible manifold optimization algorithm for quantum search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grover's algorithm is a fundamental quantum algorithm that offers a quadratic speedup for the unstructured search problem by alternately applying physically implementable oracle and diffusion operators. In this paper, we reformulate the unstructured search as a maximization problem on the unitary manifold and solve it via the Riemannian gradient ascent (RGA) method. To overcome the difficulty that generic RGA updates do not, in general, correspond to physically implementable quantum operators, we introduce Grover-compatible retractions to restrict RGA updates to valid oracle and diffusion operators. Theoretically, we establish a local Riemannian $\mu$-Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (PL) inequality with $\mu = \tfrac{1}{2}$, which yields a linear convergence rate of $1 - \kappa^{-1}$ toward the global solution. Here, the condition number $\kappa = L_{\mathrm{Rie}} / \mu$, where $L_{\mathrm{Rie}}$ denotes the Riemannian Lipschitz constant of the gradient. Taking into account both the geometry of the unitary manifold and the special structure of the cost function, we show that $L_{\mathrm{Rie}} = O(\sqrt{N})$ for problem size $N = 2^n$. Consequently, the resulting iteration complexity is $O(\sqrt{N} \log(1/\varepsilon))$ for attaining an $\varepsilon$-accurate solution, which matches the quadratic speedup of $O(\sqrt{N})$ achieved by Grover's algorithm. These results demonstrate that an optimization-based viewpoint can offer fresh conceptual insights and lead to new advances in the design of quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Gaussian and non-Gaussian input states with a hybrid sampling platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The original boson sampling paradigm-consisting of multiple single-photon input states, a large interferometer, and multi-channel click detection-was originally proposed as a photonic route to quantum computational advantage. Its non-Gaussian resources, essential for outperforming any classical system, are provided by single-photon inputs and click detection. Yet the drive toward larger experiments has led to the replacement of experimentally demanding single-photon sources with Gaussian states, thereby diminishing the available non-Gaussianity-a critical quantum resource. As the community broadens its focus from the initial sampling task to possible real-world applications, it becomes crucial to quantify the performance cost associated with reducing non-Gaussian resources and to benchmark sampling platforms that employ different input states.
  To address this need, we introduce the Paderborn Quantum Sampler (PaQS), a hybrid platform capable of performing sampling experiments with eight Gaussian or non-Gaussian input states in a 12-mode interferometer within a single experimental run. This architecture enables direct, side-by-side benchmarking of distinct sampling regimes under otherwise identical conditions. By employing a semi-device-independent framework, offering certification that does not rely on prior knowledge of the interferometer or the input states, we verify that the observed data cannot be reproduced by any classical model-a prerequisite for demonstrating quantum advantage. Applying this framework, we observe clear performance gains arising from non-Gaussian input states.</description>

      <title>High-OAM Deep Ultraviolet Twisted Light Generation for RF-Photoinjector Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the generation and characterization of ultraviolet (wavelength 266 nm) twisted light with high orbital angular momentum (OAM) using three types of fabricated diffractive optical elements (DOEs): a reflective fork grating, a high-charge spiral phase plate (SPP), and binary axicons. All elements were integrated into a drive-laser beamline of an electron RF-photoinjector, enabling direct evaluation under accelerator-relevant conditions.
  The SPP produced a high-purity Laguerre-Gaussian mode with OAM l = 64 and a measured conversion efficiency of approximately 80\%. Binary axicons generated quasi-Bessel twisted light with topological charges up to m = 10, exhibiting low divergence and stable multi-lobe ring structures. The fork grating reliably produced lower-order modes, l = 2-8, with good agreement between simulations and cylindrical-lens diagnostics.
  These results constitute, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive experimental demonstration of deep-UV high-OAM beams generated with fabricated DOEs and validated through mode-conversion measurements. The demonstrated techniques are compatible with high-power UV laser systems used in RF-photoinjectors and offer a practical route toward structured photocathode illumination and the generation of relativistic vortex electrons at a particle accelerator facility.</description>

      <title>Heralded generation of a three-mode NOON state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entangled states of photons form the foundation of quantum communication, computation, and metrology. Yet their generation remains fundamentally constrained: in the absence of intrinsic photon-photon interactions, the generation of such states is inherently probabilistic rather than deterministic. The prevalent technique of post-selection verifies the creation of an entangled state by detecting and thus destroying it. Heralding offers a solution in which measuring ancillary photons in auxiliary modes signals the state generation without the need to measure it. Here, we report an experiment to generate a three-mode two-photon NOON state, where the detection of a single photon in one heralding mode signifies the presence of the state in three target modes. We validate the generated state by estimating a fidelity of 0.823 +/- 0.018 with respect to an ideal three-mode NOON state and certifying genuine multipartite entanglement. By virtue of the high success probability and small resource overhead of our scheme, our work provides a theoretical and experimental stepping stone for entangled multi-mode state generation, which is realizable with current technology. These multi-mode entangled states represent a key direction for linear optical quantum information that is complementary to multi-qubit state encoding.</description>

      <title>Higher Josephson harmonics in a tunable double-junction transmon qubit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tunable Josephson harmonics open up for new qubit design. We demonstrate a superconducting circuit element with a tunnel junction in series with a SQUID loop, yielding a highly magnetic-flux tunable harmonic content of the Josephson potential. We analyze spectroscopy of the first four qubit transitions with a circuit model which includes the internal mode, revealing a second harmonic up to $\sim10\%$ of the fundamental harmonic. Interestingly, a sweet spot where the dispersive shift vanishes is achieved by balancing the dispersive couplings to the internal and qubit modes. The highly tunable set-up provides a route toward protected qubits, and customizable nonlinear microwave devices.</description>

      <title>Syntactic Structure, Quantum Weights</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Why do local actions and exponential Euclidean weights arise so universally in classical, statistical, and quantum theories? We offer a structural explanation from minimal constraints on finite descriptions of admissible histories. Assume that histories admit finite, self-delimiting (prefix-free) generative codes that can be decoded sequentially in a single forward pass. These purely syntactic requirements define a minimal descriptive cost, interpretable as a smoothed minimal program length, that is additive over local segments. First, any continuous local additive cost whose stationary sector coincides with the empirically identified classical variational sector is forced into a unique Euler--Lagrange equivalence class. Hence the universal form of an action is fixed by descriptional structure alone, while the specific microscopic Lagrangian and couplings remain system-dependent semantic input. Second, independently of microscopic stochasticity, finite prefix-free languages exhibit exponential redundancy: many distinct programs encode the same coarse history, and this redundancy induces a universal exponential multiplicity weight on histories. Requiring this weight to be real and bounded below selects a real Euclidean representative for stable local bosonic systems, yielding the standard Euclidean path-integral form. When Osterwalder--Schrader reflection positivity holds, the Euclidean measure reconstructs a unitary Lorentzian amplitude.</description>

      <title>Tunable passive squeezing of squeezed light through unbalanced double homodyne detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The full characterization of quantum states of light is a central task in quantum optics and information science. Double homodyne detection provides a powerful method for the direct measurement of the Husimi Q quasi-probability distribution, offering a complete state representation in a simple experimental setting and a limited time frame. Here, we demonstrate that double homodyne detection can serve as more than a passive measurement apparatus. By intentionally unbalancing the input beamsplitter that splits the quantum signal, we show that the detection scheme itself performs an effective squeezing or anti-squeezing transformation on the state being measured. The resulting measurement directly samples the Q function of the input state as if it were acted upon by a squeezing operator whose strength is a tunable experimental parameter : the beamsplitter's reflectivity. We experimentally realize this technique using a robust polarization-encoded double homodyne detection to characterize a squeezed vacuum state. Our results demonstrate the controlled deformation of the measured Q function's phase-space distribution, confirming that unbalanced double homodyne detection is a versatile tool for simultaneous quantum state manipulation and characterization.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric cavity magnomechanics with gain-assisted transparency and amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate magnomechanically induced transparency in a parity-time-symmetric cavity magnomechanical system with traveling-field-induced non-Hermiticity. The setup consists of a microwave cavity mode coupled to magnons in a single-crystal yttrium iron garnet sphere, which in turn are hybridized with a vibrational mechanical mode through magnetostrictive interaction. In the Hermitian regime, strong photon-magnon coupling generates a single transparency window in the cavity transmission, which splits into a doublet when the magnon is coherently hybridized with the mechanical mode via magnomechanical coupling. This establishes a versatile platform in which the transparency spectrum can be engineered from single- to multi-window response using experimentally accessible, scaled magnomechanical interactions. When a non-Hermitian coupling is introduced, the system enters a parity-time-broken regime in which the transparency ceases to be purely passive and becomes gain assisted, leading to asymmetric transmission with amplification on one side of the resonance and enhanced absorption on the other. By tuning the cavity detuning, we convert magnomechanical transparency into Fano-type line shapes with strongly non-Lorentzian phase dispersion and map their deformation into asymmetric, gain-assisted Fano ridges in the joint space of probe and magnon detunings. Finally, we analyze the associated group delay and show that both slow- and fast-light behavior can be widely tuned by varying the photon-magnon and magnomechanical couplings together with the non-Hermitian strength, highlighting parity-time-symmetric cavity magnomechanics as a promising platform for reconfigurable quantum signal processing and enhanced sensing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new secret communication scheme over the bosonic wiretap channel. It uses readily available hardware such as lasers and direct photodetectors. The scheme is based on randomness extractors, pulse-position modulation, and Reed-Solomon codes and is therefore computationally efficient. It is secure against an eavesdropper performing coherent joint measurements on the quantum states it observes. In the low-photon-flow limit, the scheme is asymptotically optimal and achieves the same dominant term as the secrecy capacity of the same channel.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Processes with indefinite causal order can arise when quantum theory is locally valid. Here, we identify an information-theoretic principle, termed parity erasure, that completely characterizes such processes. Our characterization does not rely on the formalism of quantum theory itself, but instead is derived from a set of axioms for general operational probabilistic theories, and thus holds also for a large class of theories beyond quantum theory. This informational approach reveals a fundamental property of information exchange in scenarios with indefinite causal structure.</description>

Abstract: The Michelson interferometric phase detection resolution can be enhanced by replacing conventional beam splitters with novel directionally unbiased four-port scatterers, such as Grover coins. We present a quantitative analysis of the noise-to-signal ratio of sideband frequencies generated by gravitational wave-induced phase perturbations in a Grover-Michelson interferometer (GMI). We discuss the principles of GMI signal enhancement and demonstrate how combining this configuration with additional light-recycling arrangements further enhances the performance.</description>

      <title>Quantum Brownian Motion as a Classical Stochastic Process in Phase Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish that the exact quantum dynamics of a Brownian particle in the Caldeira-Leggett model can be mapped, at any temperature, onto a classical, non-Markovian stochastic process in phase space. Starting from a correlated thermal equilibrium state between the particle and bath, we prove that this correspondence is exact for quadratic potentials under arbitrary quantum state preparations of the particle itself. For more general, smooth potentials, we identify and exploit a natural small parameter: the density matrix becomes strongly quasidiagonal in the coordinate representation, with its off-diagonal width shrinking as the bath's spectral cutoff increases, providing a controlled parameter for accurate approximation. The framework is fully general: arbitrary initial quantum states-including highly non-classical superpositions-are incorporated via their Wigner functions, which serve as statistical weights for trajectory ensembles. Furthermore, the formalism naturally accommodates external manipulations and measurements modeled by preparation functions acting at arbitrary times, enabling the simulation of complex driven-dissipative quantum protocols.</description>

Abstract: Quantum microcombs generated in high-Q microresonators provide compact, multiplexed sources of entangled modes for continuous-variable (CV) quantum information processing. While deterministic generation of CV states via Kerr-induced two-mode squeezing has been demonstrated, achieving spectrally uniform squeezing remains challenging because of asymmetry and anomalies in the dispersion profile. Here we overcome these limitations by combining a microresonator with an engineered mode spectrum and optimized pump conditions. We realize a CV quantum microcomb comprising 14 independent two-mode squeezed states, each exhibiting more than 4 dB of raw squeezing (up to 4.3 dB) across a 0.7 THz bandwidth. This uniform, high-performance quantum resource represents a key step toward scalable, integrated CV quantum technologies operating beyond classical limits.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic readout of chiral photonic topology in a single-cavity spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological photonic phases are typically identified through band reconstruction, steady-state transmission, or real-space imaging of edge modes. In this work, we present a framework for spectroscopic readout of chiral photonic topology in a single driven optical cavity containing a spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensate. We demonstrate that the cavity transmission power spectral density provides a direct and measurable proxy for a momentum- and frequency-resolved photonic Chern marker, enabling topological characteristics to be inferred from spectral data without the need for bulk-band tomography. In the loss-dominated regime, where cavity decay exceeds atomic dissipation, the power spectral density exhibits Dirac-like gapped hybrid modes with a vanishing Chern marker, indicating a trivial phase. When the dissipation imbalance is reversed, a bright, gap-spanning spectral ridge emerges, co-localized with peaks in both the Chern marker and Berry curvature. The complex spectrum reveals parity-time symmetric coalescences and gain-loss bifurcations, marking exceptional points and enabling chiral, gap-traversing transport. By linking noise spectroscopy to geometric and non-Hermitian topology in a minimal cavity-QED architecture, this work provides a framework for spectroscopic detection of topological order in driven quantum systems. This approach offers a pathway to compact, tunable topological photonics across a broad range of light-matter platforms, providing a method for the study and control of topological phases in hybrid quantum systems.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for Optimizing Uniformly Controlled Structures in Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum unitaries of the form ${\Sigma_{c}\ket{c}\bra{c}\otimes U_{c}}$ are ubiquitous in quantum algorithms. This class encompasses not only standard uniformly controlled gates (UCGs) but also a wide range of circuits with uniformly controlled structures. However, their circuit-depth and gate-count complexities have not been systematically analyzed within a unified framework. In this work, we study the general decomposition problem for UCG and UCG-like structure. We then introduce the restricted Uniformly Controlled Gates (rUCGs) as a unified algebraic model, defined by a 2-divisible Abelian group that models the controlled gate set. This model captures uniformly controlled rotations, multi-qubit uniformly controlled gates, and diagonal unitaries. Furthermore, this model also naturally incorporates k-sparse version (k-rUCGs), where only a subset of control qubits participate in each multi-qubit gate. Building on this algebraic model, we develop a general framework. For an n-control rUCG, the framework reduce the gate complexity from ${O(n2^n)}$ to ${O(2^n})$ and the circuit depth from ${O(2^n\log n)}$ to ${O(2^n\log n/n)}$. The framework further provides systematic size and depth bounds for k-rUCGs by exploiting sparsity in the control space, with same optimization coefficient as rUCG, respectively. Empirical evaluations on representative QAOA circuits and quantum state preparation both confirm reductions in depth and size. Crucially, these results highlight that the rUCG model and its associated decomposition framework unify circuits previously considered structurally distinct under a single, asymptotically optimal synthesis paradigm.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian symmetry breaking and Lee-Yang theory for quantum XYZ and clock models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lee-Yang theory offers a unifying framework for understanding classical phase transitions and dynamical quantum phase transitions through the analysis of partition functions and Loschmidt echoes. Recently, this framework is extended to characterize quantum phase transitions in arXiv:2509.20258 by introducing the concepts of non-Hermitian symmetry breaking and fidelity zeros. Here, we generalize the theory by studying a broad class of quantum models, including the XY model, the XXZ model, the XYZ model, and the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ clock model in one dimension, subject to complex external magnetic field. For the XY, XXZ and XYZ models, we find that the complex field breaks parity symmetry and induces oscillations of the ground state between the two parity sectors, giving rise to fidelity zeros within the ordered phases. For the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ clock model, the complex field splits the real part of the ground-state energy between the neutral sector ($q=0$) and the charged sectors ($q=1,2$), while preserving the degeneracy within the charged sector. Fidelity zeros arise only after projecting out one of the charged sectors, and the finite-size scaling of these zeros produces critical exponents fully consistent with analytical predictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the influence of geometry in the critical behavior of sparse long-range spin models. We examine a model with interactions that can be continuously tuned to induce distinct changes in the metric, topology, and dimensionality of the coupling graph. This underlying geometry acts as the driver of criticality, with structural changes in the graph coinciding with and dictating the phase boundaries. We further discuss how this framework connects naturally to realizations in tweezer arrays with Rydberg excitations. In certain cases, the effective geometry can be incorporated in the layout of atoms in tweezers to realize phase transitions that preserve universal features, simplifying their implementation in near-term experiments.</description>

      <title>Non-abelian quantum double models from iterated gauging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reconstruct all (2+1)D quantum double models of finite groups from their boundary symmetries through the repeated application of a gauging procedure, extending the existing construction for abelian groups. We employ the recently proposed categorical gauging framework, based on matrix product operators (MPOs), to derive the appropriate gauging procedure for the $\mathsf{Rep}\, G$ symmetries appearing in our construction and give an explicit description of the dual emergent $G$ symmetry, which is our main technical contribution. Furthermore, we relate the possible gapped boundaries of the quantum double models to the quantum phases of the one-dimensional input state to the iterated gauging procedure. Finally, we propose a gauging procedure for 1-form $\mathsf{Rep}\, G$ symmetries on a two-dimensional lattice and use it to extend our results to the construction of (3+1)D quantum doubles models through the iterative gauging of (2+1)-dimensional symmetries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a driven-dissipative Floquet model in which a single harmonic oscillator with modulated frequency and decay realizes a non-Hermitian synthetic lattice with an effective electric field gradient in frequency space. Using the Floquet-Green's function and its doubled-space representation, we identify a topological regime that supports directional amplification and frequency conversion, accurately captured by a local winding number. The underlying mode structure is well described by a Jackiw-Rebbi-like continuum theory with Dirac cones and solitonic zero modes in synthetic frequency. Our results establish a simple and experimentally feasible route to non-Hermitian topological amplification, naturally implementable in current quantum technologies such as superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Emergent Non-Markovianity in Logical Qubit Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Logical qubits encoded in quantum error correcting codes can exhibit non-Markovian dynamical evolution, even when the underlying physical noise is Markovian. To understand this emergent non-Markovianity, we define a Markovianity condition appropriate to logical gate operations, and study it by relating logical operations to their physical implementation (operations on the data qubits into which the logical qubit is encoded). We apply our analysis to small quantum codes, and show that they exhibit non-Markovian dynamics even for very simple physical noise models. We show that non-Markovianity can emerge from Markovian physical operations if (and only if) the physical qubits are not necessarily returned to the code subspace after every round of QEC. In this situation, the syndrome qubits can act as a memory, mediating time correlations and enabling violation of the Markov condition. We quantify the emergent non-Markovianity in simple examples, and propose sufficient conditions for reliable use of gate-based characterization techniques like gate set tomography in early fault-tolerant quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Deterministic randomness extraction for semi-device-independent quantum random number generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is a well-known fact in classical information theory that no deterministic procedure can extract close-to-ideal randomness from an arbitrary entropy source. On the other hand, if additional knowledge about the source is available -- e.g., that it is a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials -- then deterministic extractors do exist. For quantum entropy sources, where in addition to classical random variables we consider quantum side information, the use of extra knowledge about their structure was pioneered in a recent publication [C. Foreman and L. Masanes, Quantum 9, 1654 (2025)]. In that work, the authors provide deterministic extractors for device-independent randomness generation with memoryless devices achieving a sufficiently high CHSH score. In this work, we extend their construction to the prepare-and-measure scenario. Specifically, we prove that the considered functions are also extractors for memoryless devices in a semi-device-independent setting under an overlap assumption on the prepared quantum states. We then simulate the resulting randomness generation protocol on a novel and experimentally relevant family of behaviors, observing positive key rates already for $7\times 10^3$ rounds.</description>

      <title>SAQ: Stabilizer-Aware Quantum Error Correction Decoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Error Correction (QEC) decoding faces a fundamental accuracy-efficiency tradeoff. Classical methods like Minimum Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) exhibit variable performance across noise models and suffer from polynomial complexity, while tensor network decoders achieve high accuracy but at prohibitively high computational cost. Recent neural decoders reduce complexity but lack the accuracy needed to compete with computationally expensive classical methods. We introduce SAQ-Decoder, a unified framework combining transformer-based learning with constraint aware post-processing that achieves both near Maximum Likelihood (ML) accuracy and linear computational scalability with respect to the syndrome size. Our approach combines a dual-stream transformer architecture that processes syndromes and logical information with asymmetric attention patterns, and a novel differentiable logical loss that directly optimizes Logical Error Rates (LER) through smooth approximations over finite fields. SAQ-Decoder achieves near-optimal performance, with error thresholds of 10.99% (independent noise) and 18.6% (depolarizing noise) on toric codes that approach the ML bounds of 11.0% and 18.9% while outperforming existing neural and classical baselines in accuracy, complexity, and parameter efficiency. Our findings establish that learned decoders can simultaneously achieve competitive decoding accuracy and computational efficiency, addressing key requirements for practical fault-tolerant quantum computing systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated photonics in trapped-ion systems are critical for the realization of applications such as portable optical atomic clocks and scalable quantum computers. However, system-level integration of all required functionalities remains a key challenge. In this work, we demonstrate an autonomously operating optical clock having a short-term frequency instability of $3.14(5)\times 10^{-14} / \sqrt{\tau}$ using an ensemble of four \ybion ions trapped in a multi-site surface-electrode trap at room temperature. All clock operations are performed with light delivered via on-chip waveguides. We showcase the system's resilience through sustained, autonomous operation featuring automated ion shuttling and reloading to mitigate ion loss during interleaved clock measurements. This work paves the way beyond component-level functionality to establish a viable and robust architecture for the next generation of portable, multi-ion quantum sensors and computers.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the experimental observation of vortex leapfrogging in a two-dimensional fluid of light. By imprinting two vortex-antivortex pairs and tracking their real-time evolution through phase-resolved imaging, we observe a dynamics that is accurately described by a point-vortex model with an outward background flow. By precisely controlling the initial vortex separation, we identify configurations in which leapfrogging breaks down and determine the corresponding dissipation mechanisms. The first originates from phase-slip events occurring at large injected velocities. The second arises when the injection of multi-charged vortices leads to the formation of a dispersive shock wave which acts as a continuous source of phase slippage. These mechanisms advance our understanding of vortex dynamics and dissipation in superfluids.</description>

Abstract: Building upon the Covariant Derivative Expansion, we develop a method to compute effective actions that is able to capture non-perturbative effects induced by strong background fields. We demonstrate the method in scalar QED, by deriving the full second-derivative corrections to the scalar Heisenberg--Euler effective action. The corresponding result is interpreted as an effective field theory with three characteristic scales, two of which are large (mass and field strength) in comparison with the remaining one (derivatives of the field). As an application, we show that, at this order, the transseries structure of the Schwinger pair production rate is preserved, even if the involved coefficients are modified. Our analysis also helps clarify recent disagreements concerning the coefficients of this effective action.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Present theoretical predictions for the entanglement entropy through topological defects are vi- olated by numerical simulations. In order to resolve this, we introduce a paradigm shift in the preparation of reduced density matrices in the presence of topological defects, and emphasize the role of defect networks with which they can be dressed. We consider the cases of grouplike and du- ality defects in detail for the Ising model, and match all numerically found entanglement entropies. Since our construction functions at the level of reduced density matrices, it accounts for topological defects beyond the entanglement entropy to other entanglement measures.</description>

      <title>Moire-Engineered Ferroelectric Transistors for Nearly Trap-free, Low-Power and Non-Volatile 2D Electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-range moire patterns in twisted WSe2 enable a built-in, moire-length-scale ferroelectric polarization that can be directly harnessed in electronic devices. Such a built-in ferroic landscape offers a compelling means to enable ultralow-voltage and non-volatile electronic functionality in two-dimensional materials; however, achieving stable polarization control without charge trapping has remained a persistent challenge. Here, we demonstrate a moire-engineered ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FeFET) utilizing twisted WSe2 bilayers that leverages atomically clean van der Waals interfaces to achieve efficient polarization-channel coupling and trap-suppressed, ultralow-voltage operation (subthreshold swing of 64 mV per decade). The device exhibits a stable non-volatile memory window of 0.10 V and high mobility, exceeding the performance of previously reported two-dimensional FeFET and matching that of advanced silicon-based devices. In addition, capacitance-voltage spectroscopy, corroborated by self-consistent Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire modeling, indicates ultrafast ferroelectric switching (~0.5 microseconds). These results establish moire-engineered ferroelectricity as a practical and scalable route toward ultraclean, low-power, and non-volatile 2D electronics, bridging atomistic lattice engineering with functional device architectures for next-generation memory and logic technologies.</description>

By systematically varying the projectile's impact point and orientation relative to the molecular plane, we compare orthogonal and in-plane trajectories and quantify their effects on fragment momenta, electron-density response, and atom-resolved ionization. Newton plots and time-resolved density snapshots show that trajectories avoiding direct atomic collisions yield the most faithful structural reconstructions, whereas direct impacts impart large, highly localized momenta that distort the recovered geometry. Planar trajectories generate substantially greater ionization and broader momentum distributions than orthogonal ones due to deeper traversal through the molecular electron cloud. Quantitative analysis of electron removal at 10~fs confirms that projectile proximity and orientation strongly modulate both local and global ionization. These findings clarify how impact geometry governs the fidelity of ion-induced CEI structural recovery and help explain the variability and noise observed in experimental CEI measurements. More broadly, the results highlight both the strengths and the intrinsic limitations of ion-induced CEI and identify key considerations for interpreting experiments.</description>

Abstract: We theoretically investigated the readout process of a spin--qubit structure based on a gate-all-around (GAA) transistor. Our study focuses on a logical qubit composed of two physical qubits. Different spin configurations result in different charge distributions, which subsequently influence the electrostatic effects on the GAA transistor. Consequently, the current flowing through the GAA transistor depends on the qubit's state. We calculated the current-voltage characteristics of the three-dimensional configurations of the qubit and GAA structures, using technology computer-aided design (TCAD) simulations. Moreover, we performed circuit simulations using the Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis (SPICE) to investigate whether a readout circuit made from complementary metal--oxide semiconductor (CMOS) transistors can amplify the weak signals generated by the qubits. Our findings indicate that, by dynamically controlling the applied voltage within a properly designed circuit, the readout can be detected effectively based on a conventional sense amplifier.</description>

      <title>Direct Generation of an Array with 78400 Optical Tweezers Using a Single Metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalability remains a major challenge in building practical fault-tolerant quantum computers. Currently, the largest number of qubits achieved across leading quantum platforms ranges from hundreds to thousands. In atom arrays, scalability is primarily constrained by the capacity to generate large numbers of optical tweezers, and conventional techniques using acousto-optic deflectors or spatial light modulators struggle to produce arrays much beyond $\sim 10,000$ tweezers. Moreover, these methods require additional microscope objectives to focus the light into micrometer-sized spots, which further complicates system integration and scalability. Here, we demonstrate the experimental generation of an optical tweezer array containing $280\times 280$ spots using a metasurface, nearly an order of magnitude more than most existing systems. The metasurface leverages a large number of subwavelength phase-control pixels to engineer the wavefront of the incident light, enabling both large-scale tweezer generation and direct focusing into micron-scale spots without the need for a microscope. This result shifts the scalability bottleneck for atom arrays from the tweezer generation hardware to the available laser power. Furthermore, the array shows excellent intensity uniformity exceeding $90\%$, making it suitable for homogeneous single-atom loading and paving the way for trapping arrays of more than $10,000$ atoms in the near future.</description>

      <title>Decay of spin helices in XXZ quantum spin chains with single-ion anisotropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-lived spin-helix states facilitate the study of non-equilibrium dynamics in quantum magnets. We consider the decay of transverse spin-helices in antiferromagnetic spin-$S$ XXZ chains with single-ion anisostropy. The spin-helix decay is observable in the time evolution of the local magnetization that we calculate numerically for the system in the thermodynamic limit using infinite time-evolving block decimation simulations. Although the single-ion anisotropy prevents helix states from being eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, they still can be long-lived for appropriately chosen wave numbers. In case of an easy-axis exchange anisotropy the single-ion anisotropy may even stabilize the helices. Within a spin-wave approximation, we obtain a condition giving an estimate for the most stable wave number $Q$ that agrees qualitatively with our numerical results.</description>

      <title>Radiative process of tripartite entangled probes in inertial motion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the radiative process of three entangled quantum probes initially prepared in a tripartite W state. As a basic set-up, we consider the probes to be inertial in flat spacetime and investigate how the radiative process is affected by different probe configurations. We take the quantum probes as either static or moving with uniform velocities and consider different switching scenarios. Our main observation confirms that the radiative process depends distinctively on the initial configuration in which the probes are arranged, as well as on the direction of the probe velocity. We also extend our analysis to a thermal environment, thereby simulating a more realistic background. We thoroughly discuss the effects due to different switchings, the thermal background, and probe motion on the radiative process of these tripartite entangled probes. We also comment on how the observations from this work can help prepare a set-up least affected by quantum decoherence.</description>

Abstract: Closing the gap between ray tracing simulations and experimentally observed electron jetting in bilayer graphene (BLG), we study all-electronic, gate-defined BLG cavities using tight-binding simulations and semiclassical equations of motion. Such cavities offer a rich playground to investigate anisotropic electron transport due to the trigonally warped Fermi surfaces. In this work, we achieve two things: First, we verify the existence of triangular modes (as predicted by classical ray tracing calculations) in the quantum solutions of closed circular BLG cavities. Then, we explore signatures of said triangular modes in transport through open BLG cavities connected to leads. We show that the triangular symmetry translates into anisotropic transport and present an optimal setup for experimental detection of the triangular modes as well as for controlled modulation of transport in preferred directions.</description>

      <title>Operator Lanczos Approach enabling Neural Quantum States as Real-Frequency Impurity Solvers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To understand the intricate exchange between electrons of different bands in strongly correlated materials, it is essential to treat multi-orbital models accurately. For this purpose, dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) provides an established framework, whose scope crucially hinges on the availability of efficient quantum impurity solvers. Here we present a real-frequency impurity solver based on neural quantum states (NQS) combined with an operator-Lanczos construction. NQS are an asymptotically unbiased variational ground-state ansatz that employs neural networks to capture long-range correlations on complicated graph structures. We leverage this ability to solve multi-orbital impurity problems using a systematically improvable Segmented Commutator Operator-Lanczos (SCOL) construction. Our benchmarks on both the single-orbital Anderson model and the multi-orbital Hubbard-Kanamori impurity Hamiltonian reveal excellent ground-state precision and the capacity to accurately resolve zero temperature spectral functions and self-energies. These results open avenues for extending DMFT to more challenging problems.</description>

      <title>The bound state of dark atom with the nucleus of substance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hypothesis of composite $XHe$ dark atoms offers a compelling framework to address the challenges in direct dark matter particles detection, as their neutral, atom-like configuration evades conventional experimental signatures. A critical issue may arise in interaction between $XHe$ and atomic nuclei due to the unshielded nuclear attraction, which could destabilize the dark atom's bound state. To resolve this, we propose a novel numerical quantum mechanical approach that accounts for self-consistent electromagnetic-nuclear couplings. This method addresses to eliminate the inherent complexity of the $XHe$-nucleus three-body system, where analytical solutions are intractable. By reconstructing the effective interaction potential - including dipole Coulomb barrier and shallow potential well - we demonstrate how these features lead to the formation of $XHe$-nucleus bound states and modulate low-energy capture processes. Our model enables validation of the dark atom hypothesis, particularly in interpreting experimental anomalies like annual modulation signals observed in DAMA/LIBRA. These findings advance the theoretical foundation for dark matter interactions and provide a robust framework for future experimental design.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation-Induced Supersolidity at the Superfluid-Solid Interface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supersolidity, combining superfluid and crystalline orders, has been realized in dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates by tuning interatomic interactions. Here we show that supersolidity can also emerge from mode coupling at a superfluid-solid interface, without modifying bulk interactions and for a broad class of superfluids. Using an analytical and numerical treatment of the coupled superfluid and phonon fields, we derive the criterion for a density-modulation instability driven by interfacial coupling and dependent on dimensionality. In superfluid helium, the instability first appears at the roton mode, while in a Bose-Einstein condensate with contact interactions it occurs at the lowest accessible wave vector set by the system size. Beyond the threshold, the ground state acquires an interfacial density modulation while the bulk remains superfluid, forming a hybrid superfluid-supersolid phase. Our results identify interfacial mode coupling as a promising route to supersolidity, enabling the simultaneous exploitation of interfacial supersolid and bulk superfluid quantum properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a four-dimensional system composed of a mass-dimension-one fermionic field, also known as Elko, interacting with a real scalar field. Our main objective is to analyze the Casimir effects associated with this system, assuming that both the Elko and scalar fields satisfy Dirichlet boundary conditions on two large parallel plates separated by a distance $L$. In this scenario, we calculate the vacuum energy density and its first-order correction in the coupling constants of the theory. Additionally, we consider the mass correction for each field separately, namely the topological mass that arises from the boundary conditions imposed on the fields and which also depends on the coupling constants. To develop this analysis, we use the mathematical formalism known as the effective potential, expressed as a path integral in quantum field theory.</description>

Abstract: Tensor network states are used extensively as a mathematically convenient description of physically relevant states of many-body quantum systems. Those built on regular lattices, i.e. matrix product states (MPS) in dimension 1 and projected entangled pair states (PEPS) in dimension 2 or higher, are of particular interest in condensed matter physics. The general goal of this work is to characterize which features of MPS and PEPS are generic and which are, on the contrary, exceptional. This problem can be rephrased as follows: given an MPS or PEPS sampled at random, what are the features that it displays with either high or low probability? One property which we are particularly interested in is that of having either rapidly decaying or long-range correlations. In a nutshell, our main result is that translation-invariant MPS and PEPS typically exhibit exponential decay of correlations at a high rate. We have two distinct ways of getting to this conclusion, depending on the dimensional regime under consideration. Both yield intermediate results which are of independent interest, namely: the parent Hamiltonian and the transfer operator of such MPS and PEPS typically have a large spectral gap. In all these statements, our aim is to get a quantitative estimate of the considered quantity (generic correlation length or spectral gap), which has the best possible dependency on the physical and bond dimensions of the random MPS or PEPS.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2105.05444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-photon interference, known as the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect, has colossal implications for quantum technology. It was observed in 1987 with two photodetectors monitoring outputs of the beamsplitter illuminated by photon pairs: the coincidence rate of the detectors drops to zero when detected photons overlap in time. More broadly, bosons (e.g., photons) coalesce while fermions (e.g., electrons) anti-coalesce when interfering on a lossless beamsplitter. Quantum interference of bosons and fermions can be tested in a single - photonics platform, where bosonic and fermionic states are artificially created as pairs of entangled photons with symmetric and anti-symmetric spatial wavefunctions. We observed that interference on a lossy beamsplitter, or a subwavelength coherent absorber reverses quantum interference in such a way that bosonic states anti-coalesce while fermionic states exhibit coalescent-like behavior. The ability to generate states of light with different statistics and manipulate their interference offers important opportunities for quantum information and metrology.</description>

      <title>An Appropriate Probability Model for the Bell Experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.05174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Bell inequality constrains the outcomes of measurements on pairs of distant entangled particles. The Bell contradiction states that the Bell inequality is inconsistent with the calculated outcomes of these quantum experiments. This contradiction led many to question the underlying assumptions, viz. so-called realism and locality. The probability model underlying the Bell inequality is generally left implicit. This implicit consensus model assumes four simultaneously observable detector settings. The Bell contradiction follows from this assumption.
  We propose an explicit probability model for the CHSH version of the Bell experiment. This model has only two simultaneously observable detector settings per measurement, and therefore does not assume realism. The quantum expectation now becomes a conditional expectation, given the two detector settings. This probability model is in full agreement with both quantum mechanics and experiments. In this model the notion of Bell contradiction has no meaning. Furthermore, the proposed probability model is statistically local, and is not Bell-separable. The latter implies that either hidden variables must be ruled out, or that locality must be violated, in agreement with Bell's conclusion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03496v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-testing identifies quantum states and correlations that exhibit nonlocality, distinguishing them, up to local transformations, from other quantum states. Due to their strong nonlocality, it is known that all graph states can be self-tested in the standard setting - where parties are not allowed to communicate. Recently it has been shown that graph states display nonlocal correlations even when bounded classical communication on the underlying graph is permitted, a feature that has found applications in proving a circuit-depth separation between classical and quantum computing. In this work, we develop self testing in the framework of bounded classical communication, and we show that certain graph states can be robustly self-tested even allowing for communication. In particular, we provide an explicit self-test for the circular graph state and the honeycomb cluster state - the latter known to be a universal resource for measurement based quantum computation. Since communication generally obstructs self-testing of graph states, we further provide a procedure to robustly self-test any graph state from larger ones that exhibit nonlocal correlations in the communication scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00235v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the task of performing shadow tomography of a logical subsystem defined via the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) error correcting code. Our protocol does not require the input state to be a code state but is implemented by appropriate twirling of the measurement channel, such that the encoded logical tomographic information becomes encoded in the classical shadow. We showcase this protocol for measurements natural in continuous variable (CV) quantum computing. For heterodyne measurement, the protocol yields a probabilistic decomposition of any input state into Gaussian states that simulate the encoded logical information of the input relative to a fixed GKP code where we prove bounds on the Gaussian compressibility of states in this setting. For photon parity measurements, our protocol is equivalent to a Wigner sampling protocol for which we develop the appropriate sampling strategies. Finally, by randomizing over the reference GKP code, we show how Wigner samples of any input state relative to a random GKP codes can be used to estimate any sufficiently bounded observable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a sensing scheme for estimating the frequency difference of two non-entangled photons. The technique consists of time-resolving sampling measurements at the output of a beam splitter. With this protocol, the frequency shift between two photons can be estimated with the ultimate precision achievable in nature, overcoming the limits in precision and the range of detection of frequency-resolving detectors employed in standard direct measurements of the frequencies. The sensitivity can be increased by increasing the coherence time of the photons. We show that, already with $\sim 1000$ sampling measurements, the Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound is saturated independently of the value of the difference in frequency.</description>

Abstract: Rapid development of quantum computing technology has led to a wide variety of sophisticated quantum devices. Benchmarking these systems becomes crucial for understanding their capabilities and paving the way for future advancements. The Quantum Volume (QV) test is one of the most widely used benchmarks for evaluating quantum computer performance due to its architecture independence. However, as the number of qubits in a quantum device grows, the test faces a significant limitation: classical simulation of the quantum circuit, which is indispensable for evaluating QV, becomes computationally impractical. In this work, we propose modifications of the QV test that allow for direct determination of the most probable outcomes of a quantum circuit, eliminating the need for expensive classical simulations. This approach resolves the scalability problem of the Quantum Volume test beyond classical computational capabilities, while still examining key features of universal quantum computing.</description>

Abstract: By decoupling the geometric from the dynamical contributions in the scattering processes, we develop a method to compute the scattering matrix of electrons in a one-dimensional coherent conductor connected to two electrodes. In particular, we demonstrate that, in the high-energy regime, the transmission matrix converges to the Berry operator of the system. We showcase the method through several examples featuring different in-plane magnetic field profiles. Notably, our results reveal the possibility of achieving near-perfect spin-flip transmission, highlighting potential applications in spintronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08620v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the interplay between nonstabilizerness and entanglement is crucial for uncovering the fundamental origins of quantum complexity. Recent studies have proposed entanglement spectral quantities, such as antiflatness of the entanglement spectrum and entanglement capacity, as effective complexity measures, establishing direct connections to stabilizer R\'enyi entropies. In this work, we systematically investigate quantum complexity across a diverse range of spin models, analyzing how entanglement structure and nonstabilizerness serve as distinctive signatures of quantum phases. By studying entanglement spectra and stabilizer entropy measures, we demonstrate that these quantities consistently differentiate between distinct phases of matter. Specifically, we provide a detailed analysis of spin chains including the XXZ model, the transverse-field XY model, its extension with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, as well as the Cluster Ising and Cluster XY models. Our findings reveal that entanglement spectral properties and magic-based measures serve as intertwined, robust indicators of quantum phase transitions, highlighting their significance in characterizing quantum complexity in many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Glassiness From Efficient Learning</title>

Abstract: We show a relation between quantum learning theory and algorithmic hardness. We use the existence of efficient, local learning algorithms for energy estimation -- such as the classical shadows algorithm -- to prove that finding near-ground states of disordered quantum systems exhibiting a certain topological property is impossible in the average case for Lipschitz quantum algorithms. A corollary of our result is that many standard quantum algorithms fail to find near-ground states of these systems, including time-$T$ Lindbladian dynamics from an arbitrary initial state, time-$T$ quantum annealing, phase estimation to $T$ bits of precision, and depth-$T$ variational quantum algorithms, whenever $T$ is less than some universal constant times the logarithm of the system size. To achieve this, we introduce a generalization of the overlap gap property (OGP) for quantum systems that we call the quantum overlap gap property (QOGP). We prove that preparing low-energy states of systems which exhibit the QOGP is intractable for quantum algorithms whose outputs are stable under perturbations of their inputs. We then prove that the QOGP is satisfied for a sparsified variant of the quantum $p$-spin model, giving the first known algorithmic hardness-of-approximation result for quantum algorithms in finding the ground state of a non-stoquastic, noncommuting quantum system. Inversely, we show that the Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model does not exhibit the QOGP, consistent with previous evidence that the model is rapidly mixing at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Verifying Quantum Memory in the Dynamics of Spin Boson Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the nature of memory effects in the non-Markovian dynamics of spin boson models. Local quantum memory criteria can be used to indicate that the reduced dynamics of an open system necessarily requires a quantum memory in its environment. We apply two such criteria, derived from different definitions put forward in the literature, to spin boson and two-spin boson models. For the computation of dynamical maps and process tensors, we employ a numerically exact method for non-Markovian open system dynamics based on matrix product operator influence functionals, that can be applied across broad parameter regimes. We find that, with access to single-intervention process tensors, one can generally predict quantum memory in the dynamics at low temperatures. Given instead only the dynamical map, we are still able to detect quantum memory in the case of resonant environments at short evolution times. Moreover, we confirm quantum memory in the stationary dynamical regime using process tensors with the correlated steady state of system and environment as initial condition.</description>

      <title>Optimal Phase-Insensitive Force Sensing with Non-Gaussian States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20832v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum metrology enables sensitivity to approach the limits set by fundamental physical laws. Even a single continuous mode offers enhanced precision, with the improvement scaling with its occupation number. Due to their high information capacity, continuous modes allow for the engineering of quantum non-Gaussian states, which not only improve metrological performance but can also be tailored to specific experimental platforms and conditions. Recent advancements in control over continuous platforms operating in the quantum regime have renewed interest in sensing weak forces, also coupling to massive macroscopic objects. In this work, we investigate a force-sensing scheme where a physical process completely randomizes the direction of the induced phase-space displacement, and the unknown force strength is inferred through excitation-number-resolving measurements. We find that $N$-spaced states, where only every $N^{\text{th}}$ Fock state occupation is nonzero, approach the achievable sensing bound. Additionally, non-Gaussian states are shown to be more resilient against decoherence than their Gaussian counterparts with the same occupation number. While Fock states typically offer the best protection against decoherence, we uncover a transition in the metrological landscape -- revealed through a tailored decoherence-aware Fisher-information-based reward functional -- where experimental constraints favor a family of number-squeezed Schr\"odinger cat states. Specifically, by implementing quantum optimal control in a minimal spin-boson system, we identify these states as maximizing force sensitivity under lossy dynamics and finite system controllability. Our results provide a pathway for enhancing force sensing in a variety of continuous quantum systems, ranging from massive systems like mechanical oscillators to massless systems such as quantum light and microwave resonators.</description>

Abstract: Anonymity and privacy are two key properties of modern communication networks. In quantum networks, distributed quantum sensing has emerged as a powerful use case, with applications to clock synchronisation, detecting gravitational effects and more. In this work, we develop a new protocol that, for the first time, combines the different cryptographic properties of anonymity and privacy for the task of distributed parameter estimation. That is, we present a protocol that allows a selected subset of network participants to anonymously collaborate in estimating the average of their private parameters. Crucially, this is achieved without disclosing either the individual parameter values or the identities of the participants, neither to each other nor to the broader network.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Equations for Feedback Control of Open Quantum Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Feedback control in open quantum dynamics is crucial for the advancement of various coherent platforms. However, currently only a handful of feedback master equations exist in the literature, which are restricted to specific types of feedback. In this letter we first introduce a unifying framework, based on a single general equation, that describes all possible feedback schemes in sequentially (and continuously) measured systems, and from which all previous results follow. Next, we specialize it to the case of quantum jumps and introduce a new type of feedback based on the channel of the last detected jump, as well as the time elapsed since it occurred. Our description is experimentally grounded, and naturally allows for the introduction of realistic effects, such as time-delays in the feedback loop. We illustrate our results with two time-dependent feedback protocols conditioned on quantum-jump detections: one achieving population inversion of a two-level system against a thermal bath, and another enabling real-time reversal of quantum transitions, both admitting steady-state solutions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Power Iteration Unified Using Generalized Quantum Signal Processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a unifying framework for the state preparation using quantum power method algorithms based on generalized quantum signal processing (GQSP). We apply GQSP to realize quantum analogs of classical power iteration, power Lanczos, inverse iteration, and folded spectrum methods, all within a single coherent framework. GQSP allows efficient realization of methods that require complex polynomials, while avoiding the limitations of approaches based on linear combinations of time-evolution operators. Our constructions, including a Trotter-decomposition-free quantum inverse iteration, achieve near-optimal query scaling, together with reduced qubit requirements. The same formalism yields a quantum folded spectrum method for excited state preparation that avoids explicitly forming powers of the Hamiltonian or performing variational optimization. We provide a theoretical analysis of success probabilities and resource scaling, and we validate the methods numerically using molecular Hamiltonians. The results show that quantum power Lanczos lowers the computational cost and provides robust convergence compared to naive quantum power iteration. Our findings reveal that GQSP-based implementations of power methods combine scalability, flexibility, and robust convergence, paving the way for practical initial state preparations on fault-tolerant quantum devices.</description>

Abstract: Dicke states are permutation-invariant superpositions of qubit computational basis states, which play a prominent role in quantum information science. We consider here two higher-dimensional generalizations of these states: $SU(2)$ spin-$s$ Dicke states and $SU(d)$ Dicke states. We present various ways of preparing both types of qudit Dicke states on a qudit quantum computer, using two main approaches: a deterministic approach, based on exact canonical matrix product state representations; and a probabilistic approach, based on quantum phase estimation. The quantum circuits are explicit and straightforward, and are arguably simpler than those previously reported.</description>

      <title>Correlation Enhanced Autonomous Quantum Battery Charging via Structured Reservoirs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18086v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the autonomous charging process of a quantum battery coupled to a structured reservoir composed of two qubits, each in thermal equilibrium with its own bosonic bath. Moreover, the reservoir interacts with a charger-battery architecture through three configurations: (I) direct coupling between reservoir qubits and battery, (II) collective coupling among the reservoir qubits, charger, and battery, while (III) reflects a collective coupling between the reservoir qubits and charger together with a local charger-battery interaction. However, by using incoherent and coherent initial states, we analyze the stored energy, ergotropy, and charging power of battery, where we derive the upper and lower bounds on the extractable work in terms of the free energy of coherence and correlations exchanged between subsystems. Our results show that global and local coherences, as well as total correlations act as quantum resources that enhance autonomous charging. Additionally, we demonstrate that the free energy stored in the quantum battery splits into contributions from coherence and correlations, providing numerical evidence that supports the derived ergotropy bounds. Importantly, this work highlights how structured reservoirs enable autonomous and resource-enhanced quantum battery operation.</description>

Abstract: We propose a new approach to coarse-grained description of quantum evolution that provides an explicit recipe to construct and evaluate multi-time decoherent histories in a controlled way, applicable to non-Markovian and integrable systems. Specifically, we study local interaction quench of a local degree of freedom (an open quantum system) within a noninteracting integrable environment. This setting allows us to identify the environmental degrees of freedom that irreversibly store records of the system's past. These modes emerge sequentially in time and define the projectors required for decoherent histories. We show numerically that the off-diagonal elements of the decoherence functional are exponentially suppressed relative to a significance threshold.</description>

      <title>Toward Axion Signal Extraction in Semiconductor Spin Qubits Via Spectral Engineering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06791v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum sensing and computational technologies indicate the possibility of improving the precision of measurements aimed at detecting cosmological particles and weakly interacting massive particles using various qubit platforms. While recent progress has been made, mitigating environmental noise remains a challenge in extracting particle parameters with high fidelity. Addressing these challenges requires efforts on two levels. At the device level, the qubit and its array acting as a probe, must be isolated from electrical and magnetic noise through optimized device geometry. At the signal-processing level, it is necessary to develop filtering methods targeting specific noise spectra based on different qubit architectures. In this work, we explore the possibility of using semiconductor quantum dot spin qubits as a platform to search for quantum chromodynamics axions and, more broadly, axion like particles (ALPs). Starting by deriving an effective Hamiltonian for electron-axion interactions, we identify an axion-induced effective magnetic field and determine the characteristic axion oscillation frequency. To suppress charge noise in the devices and environmental noise, we first analyze the charge noise spectrum and then develop a dedicated filtering and noise-reduction protocol, paving the way for exploring feasible axion mass ranges. Our preliminary study holds promise for enhancing the screening of various axion signals using quantum technologies. We expect that our analysis and filtering protocol can help advance the use of semiconductor quantum dot spin qubit arrays in axion detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07359v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A framework is introduced for expressing electromagnetic (EM) potentials and fields of single atomic or molecular emitters modeled as oscillating dipoles, which follows a recently proposed method for solving inhomogeneous wave equations for arbitrary, time-dependent distributions of charge. This framework is first used to evaluate the physical implications of simplifying assumptions made in the standard approach to quantization of the EM fields and the impact of such assumptions on the results of energy and momentum quantization. Then, the exact expressions for the EM potentials and fields, in relation to the oscillating (transition) dipoles properties, afforded by the present framework are used to quantize electromagnetic fields from single emitters and restore the agreement with the well-known classical dipole radiation pattern, while maintaining the quantum mechanical description of electromagnetic radiation in terms of the probability distribution of quantum modes. Contributions of the present analysis to the understanding of photon emission from excited atoms or molecules stimulated by light or vacuum field fluctuations are highlighted, and possible experimental tests and practical applications are proposed.</description>

Abstract: Locally Purified Density Operators (LPDOs) are state-of-the-art tensor network ansatze candidates that efficiently represent mixed quantum states at scale. However, given their non-uniqueness, their representational complexity is generally sub-optimal in practical computations. In this work we perform a comprehensive numerical and analytical analysis and resolve this issue in the experimentally relevant limit where noise depolarizes the density operator into a maximally mixed state. To resolve the sub-optimality issue, we analyze two numerical tools, one analytic method, and detail the relations between them. The numerical tools used are fidelity-preserving truncations and isometric gauge transformations leveraging Riemannian optimizations over entropic objective functions. In addition, by invoking the injectivity and symmetry constraints of the maximally mixed LPDO, we also present analytical closed-form expressions for the disentangler and discuss their relation to numerical optimizers. Our work shows how, by minimizing the resources required to represent key states of practical interest in experiment, the efficiency of tensor network algorithms can be substantially increased. This paves the path for uncovering tensor network's fundamental scalability limits and latent potential in representing the wide locus of mixed quantum states that are accessible on near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Fourier Spectrum of Noisy Quantum Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing promises exponential speedups for certain problems, yet fully universal quantum computers remain out of reach and near-term devices are inherently noisy. Motivated by this, we study noisy quantum algorithms and the landscape between $\mathsf{BQP}$ and $\mathsf{BPP}$. We build on a powerful technique to differentiate quantum and classical algorithms called the level-$\ell$ Fourier growth (the sum of absolute values of Fourier coefficients of sets of size $\ell$) and show that it can also be used to differentiate quantum algorithms based on the types of resources used. We show that noise acting on a quantum algorithm dampens its Fourier growth in ways intricately linked to the type of noise.
  Concretely, we study noisy models of quantum computation where highly mixed states are prevalent, namely: $\mathsf{DQC}_k$ algorithms, where $k$ qubits are clean and the rest are maximally mixed, and $\frac{1}{2}\mathsf {BQP}$ algorithms, where the initial state is maximally mixed, but the algorithm is given knowledge of the initial state at the end of the computation. We establish upper bounds on the Fourier growth of $\mathsf{DQC}_k$, $\frac{1}{2}\mathsf{BQP}$ and $\mathsf{BQP}$ algorithms and leverage the differences between these bounds to derive oracle separations between these models. In particular, we show that 2-Forrelation and 3-Forrelation require $N^{\Omega(1)}$ queries in the $\mathsf{DQC}_1$ and $\frac{1}{2}\mathsf{BQP}$ models respectively. Our results are proved using a new matrix decomposition lemma that might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Software Framework for Optically Accessible Quantum Memory Using Group-IV Color Centers in Diamond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07045v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of quantum technology, the precise and detailed description of quantum components is not just a necessity but the foundation for advancing research, development, and applications. Optically accessible quantum memories are key building blocks for devices such as quantum repeaters and two-factor authentication. The memory we describe here is based on a tin-vacancy color center coupled to a highly efficient cavity. It leverages state-dependent reflection from the cavity and implements high-fidelity fractional single qubit gates via a train of optical $\pi/8$ pulses. We also describe its operation under microwave control, further extending our analysis. Our primary contribution in this work is the integration of this device model into a standardized software framework for quantum memory architectures.</description>

      <title>Beyond Hoeffding and Chernoff: Trading conclusiveness for advantages in quantum hypothesis testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ultimate limits of quantum state discrimination are often thought to be captured by asymptotic bounds that restrict the achievable error probabilities, notably the quantum Chernoff and Hoeffding bounds. Here we study hypothesis testing protocols that are permitted a probability of producing an inconclusive discrimination outcome, and investigate their performance when this probability is suitably constrained. We show that even by allowing an arbitrarily small probability of inconclusiveness, the limits imposed by the quantum Hoeffding and Chernoff bounds can be significantly exceeded. This completely circumvents the conventional trade-offs between error exponents in hypothesis testing while incurring only a vanishingly small overhead over conventional approaches. Such improvements over standard state discrimination are robust and can be obtained even when an exponentially vanishing probability of inconclusive outcomes is demanded. Relaxing the constraints on the inconclusive probability can enable even larger advantages, but this comes at a price. We show a 'strong converse' property of this setting: targeting error exponents beyond those achievable with vanishing inconclusiveness necessarily forces the probability of inconclusive outcomes to converge to one. By exactly quantifying the rate of this convergence, we give a complete characterisation of the trade-offs between error exponents and rates of conclusive outcome probabilities. Overall, our results provide a comprehensive asymptotic picture of how the allowance for inconclusive measurement outcomes reshapes optimal quantum hypothesis testing.</description>

      <title>Purified phase estimation samples spectra efficiently</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum phase estimation (QPE) is a cornerstone algorithm for extracting Hamiltonian eigenvalues, but its standard, eigenstate-centric form relies on carefully prepared coherent inputs that are costly or impractical for many strongly correlated systems. We overcome this bottleneck via DOS-QPE, an incoherent, purification-based variant of QPE that works directly with mixed-state probes and estimates the density of states (DOS) of the Hamiltonian. By adding a purification register and simple entangling layers, we turn standard QPE into an ensemble-based DOS sampler without modifying the core phase-estimation block. Conceptually, this purification closely aligns with the recent random purification channel framework from quantum learning theory, but instantiated here as a concrete phase-estimation circuit. We further equip DOS-QPE with symmetry-adapted input ensembles and a compressed-sensing reconstruction pipeline, and demonstrate on fermionic and nuclear Hamiltonians that a single experimental setup can recover rich spectral information relevant to thermodynamics, spectroscopy, and many-body structure.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Based Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation on High-Connectivity Devices: A Resource-Efficient Approach toward Early FTQC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a measurement-based FTQC (MB-FTQC) architecture for high-connectivity platforms such as trapped ions and neutral atoms. The key idea is to use verified logical ancillas combined with Knill's error-correcting teleportation, eliminating repeated syndrome measurements and simplifying decoding to logical Pauli corrections, thus keeping classical overhead low. To align with near-term device scales, we present two implementations benchmarked under circuit-level depolarizing noise: (i) a Steane-code version that uses analog $R_Z(\theta)$ rotations, akin to the STAR architecture [Akahoshi et al., PRX Quantum 5, 010337], aiming for the megaquop regime ($\sim 10^6$ $T$ gates) on devices with thousands of qubits; and (ii) a Golay-code version with higher-order zero-level magic-state distillation, targeting the gigaquop regime ($\sim 10^9$ $T$ gates) on devices with tens of thousands of qubits. At a physical error rate $p=10^{-4}$, the Steane path supports $5\times 10^{4}$ logical $R_Z(\theta)$ rotations, corresponding to $\sim 2.4\times 10^{6}$ $T$ gates and enabling megaquop-scale computation. With about $2{,}240$ physical qubits, it achieves $\log_{2}\mathrm{QV}=64$. The Golay path supports more than $2\times 10^{9}$ $T$ gates, enabling gigaquop-scale computation. These results suggest that our architecture can deliver practical large-scale quantum computation on near-term high-connectivity hardware without relying on resource-intensive surface codes or complex code concatenation.</description>

      <title>A Non-Variational Quantum Approach to the Job Shop Scheduling Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum heuristics offer a potential advantage for combinatorial optimization but are constrained by near-term hardware limitations. We introduce Iterative-QAOA, a variant of QAOA designed to mitigate these constraints. The algorithm combines a non-variational, shallow-depth circuit approach using fixed-parameter schedules with an iterative warm-starting process. We benchmark the algorithm on Just-in-Time Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JIT-JSSP) instances on IonQ Forte Generation QPUs, representing some of the largest such problems ever executed on quantum hardware. We compare the performance of the algorithm against both the Variational Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (VarQITE) algorithm and the non-variational Linear Ramp (LR) QAOA algorithm. We find that Iterative-QAOA robustly converges to find optimal solutions as well as high-quality, near-optimal solutions for all problem instances evaluated. We evaluate the algorithm on larger problem instances up to 97 qubits using tensor network simulations. The scaling behavior of the algorithm indicates potential for solving industrial-scale problems on fault-tolerant quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Optimal transfer of entanglement in oscillator chains in non-Markovian open systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We considered the transfer of continuous-variable entangled states in coupled oscillator chains embedded in a generic environment. We demonstrate high-fidelity transfer via optimal control in two configurations - a linear chain and an X-shaped chain. More specifically, we use the Krotov optimization algorithm to design control fields that achieve the desired state transfer. Under the environmental memory effects, the Krotov algorithm needs to be modified, since the dissipative terms in non-Markovian dynamics are generally governed by the time-dependent system Hamiltonian. Remarkably, we can achieve high-fidelity transfer by simply tuning the frequencies of the oscillators while keeping the coupling strength constant, even in the presence of open-system effects. For the system under consideration, we find that quantum memory effects can aid in the transfer of entanglement and show improvement over the memoryless case. In addition, it is possible to target a range of entangled states, making it unnecessary to know the parameters of the initial state beforehand.</description>

      <title>Annual-modulation fingerprint of the axion wind induced sideband triplet in quantum dot spin qubit sensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a phase-coherent, narrowband magnetometer for searching couplings between axions or axion-like particles (ALPs) and electron spins, using gate-defined silicon quantum-dot spin qubits. With repeated Ramsey echo sequences and dispersive readout, the qubit precession response can be tracked with sub-Hz spectral resolution. The accessible axion mass window is determined using a series of filtering protocols that take into account sensing noise, including readout errors and $1/f$ noise. We demonstrate clear evidence of sidereal modulation of the signal due to Earth's rotation, while Earth's orbital motion produces an annual amplitude envelope that generates sidebands at fixed frequency spacing $\pm \Omega_\oplus$ around the sidereal component. For axion masses between $1$-$10~\mu{\rm eV}$, the proposed method covers axion-electron coupling strengths $g_{ae}$ ranging from $10^{-14}$ to $10^{-10}$. Including both daily and annual modulation patterns in the likelihood analysis enhances the rejection of stationary or instrumental noise. Our results indicate that spin-qubit magnetometry can achieve sensitivities approaching those suggested by astrophysical considerations, providing a complementary, laboratory-based probe of axion-electron interactions. Although we focus on silicon spin-qubit architectures, the approach is broadly applicable to spin-based quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>Family of two-parameter multipartite entanglement measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multipartite entanglement is regarded as a crucial physical resource in quantum network communication. However, due to the intrinsic complexity of quantum many-body systems, identifying a multipartite entanglement measure that is both efficiently computable and capable of accurately characterizing entanglement remains a challenging problem. To address these issues, we propose a family of two-parameter multipartite entanglement measures for mixed states, termed unified-entropy concentratable entanglements. Many well-known multipartite entanglement measures are recovered as special cases of this family of measures, such as the entanglement of formation and the concentratable entanglements introduced in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 140501 (2021)]. We demonstrate that the unified-entropy concentratable entanglements constitutes a well-defined entanglement monotones, and establish several desirable properties it satisfies, such as subadditivity and continuity. We further investigate the ordering relations of unified-entropy concentratable entanglements and discuss how these quantities can be efficiently estimated on near-term quantum devices. As an application, we demonstrate that the unified-entropy concentratable entanglements can effectively distinguish between multi-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states and W states. The ordering relations of these entanglement measures are further validated using four-partite star quantum network states and four-qubit Dicke states. Moreover, we find that the unified-entropy concentratable entanglements exhibit greater sensitivity than the original concentratable entanglements in detecting certain four-partite star quantum network states.</description>

Abstract: Quantum memory plays a critical role in quantum communication, sensing, and computation. However, studies on quantum memory under a unified benchmarking framework remain scarce. In this paper, we propose a weight-based quantifier as a benchmarking method to evaluate the performance advantage of quantum memory in nonlocal exclusion tasks. We establish a general lower bound for the weight-based measure of quantum memory. Moreover, this measure provides fundamental theoretical bounds for transforming a general channel into an ideal quantum memory. Finally, we present explicit calculations of the weight-based quantifier for various channels, including unitary channels, depolarizing channels, maximal replacement channels, stochastic damping channels, and erasure channels.</description>

Abstract: The Dirac delta function potential is considered within the real Hilbert space approach for complex wave functions, as well as quaternionic wave functions. As has been previously determined, the real Hilbert space approach enables the possibility of self-interacting physical systems. The self-interaction precludes confining states, and also imposes non-stationary quantum states, both of them representing novel situations that cannot be observed in terms of quantum wave functions. These results remark the differences between quaternionic quantum mechanics ($\mathbbm H$QM) and complex quantum mechanics ($\mathbbm C$QM), and also establish a method of solving the wave equation that may be applied to a variety of different cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20016v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI) promises superpolynomial speedups for structured optimization; however, its practical realization is often hindered by significant sensitivity to hardware noise and spectral dispersion. To bridge this gap, we introduce Kernelized Decoded Quantum Interferometry (k-DQI), a unified framework that integrates spectral engineering directly into the quantum circuit architecture. By inserting a unitary kernel prior to the interference step, k-DQI actively reshapes the problem's energy landscape, concentrating the solution mass into a ``decoder-friendly'' low-frequency head. We formalize this advantage through a novel robustness metric, the noise-weighted head mass $\Sigma_K$, and prove a Monotonic Improvement Theorem, which establishes that maximizing $\Sigma_K$ guarantees higher decoding success rates under local depolarizing noise. We substantiate these theoretical gains in Optimal Polynomial Interpolation (OPI) and LDPC-like problems, demonstrating that kernel tuning functions as a ``spectral lens'' to recover signal otherwise lost to isotropic noise. Crucially, we provide explicit, efficient circuit realizations using Chirp and Linear Canonical Transform (LCT) kernels that achieve significant boosts in effective signal-to-noise ratio with negligible depth overhead ($\tilde{O}(n)$ to $\tilde{O}(n^2)$). Collectively, these results reframe DQI from a static algorithm into a tunable, noise-aware protocol suited for near-term error-corrected environments.</description>

      <title>Qubit Reuse Beyond Reorder and Reset: Optimizing Quantum Circuits by Fully Utilizing the Potential of Dynamic Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Qubit reuse offers a promising way to reduce the hardware demands of quantum circuits, but current approaches are largely restricted to reordering measurements and applying qubit resets. In this work, we present an approach to further optimize quantum circuits by fully utilizing the potential of dynamic quantum circuits-more precisely by moving measurements and introducing dynamic circuit primitives such as classically controlled gates in a way that forges entirely new pathways for qubit reuse. This significantly reduces the number of required qubits for a variety of circuits, creating new opportunities for running complex circuits on near-term devices with limited qubit counts. We show that the proposed approach drastically outperforms existing methods, reducing qubit requirements where previous approaches are unable to do so for popular quantum circuits such as Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE), Quantum Fourier Transform~(QFT), and Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) ans\"atze, as well as leading to improvements of up to 95% for sparse random circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate quench dynamics in the quantum $S=1/2$ XXZ antiferromagnetic chain with staggered and anisotropic interactions in the flat-band limit. Our quench protocol interchanges the odd- and even-bond strengths of a fully dimerized chain, enabling us to derive exact time-dependent states for arbitrary even system sizes by working in the Bell basis. We obtain closed-form, size-independent expressions for the von Neumann and second-order R\'enyi entanglement entropies. We further calculate exact Loschmidt echoes and the corresponding return rate functions across various anisotropies and system sizes, and identify Loschmidt zeros in finite chains. Our analysis reveals the precise conditions on the anisotropy parameter that govern the periodicity of the dynamical observables. In addition to the analytic study, we perform two types of numerical experiments on IBM-Q quantum devices. First, we use the Hadamard test to estimate the Bell-basis expansion coefficients and reconstruct the dynamical states, achieving accurate entanglement entropies and the Loschmidt echo for small systems. Second, we implement Trotter-error-free time-evolution circuits combined with randomized Pauli measurements. Post-processing via statistical correlations and classical shadows yields reliable estimates of the second-order R\'enyi entanglement entropy and the Loschmidt echo, showing satisfactory agreement with exact results.</description>

      <title>A contextual advantage for conclusive exclusion: repurposing the Pusey-Barrett-Rudolph construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04173v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The task of conclusive exclusion for a set of quantum states is to find a measurement such that for each state in the set, there is an outcome that allows one to conclude with certainty that the state in question was not prepared. Defining classicality of statistics as realizability by a generalized-noncontextual ontological model, we show that there is a quantum-over-classical advantage for how well one can achieve conclusive exclusion. This is achieved in an experimental scenario motivated by the construction appearing in the Pusey-Barrett-Rudolph theorem. We derive noise-robust noncontextuality inequalities bounding the conclusiveness of exclusion, and describe a quantum violation of these. Finally, we show that this bound also constitutes a classical causal compatibility inequality within the bilocality scenario, and that its violation in quantum theory yields a novel possibilistic proof of a quantum-classical gap in that scenario.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Quantum Simulations of Energy-Loss and Hadronization in Non-Abelian Gauge Theories: SU(2) Lattice Gauge Theory in 1+1D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulations of energy loss and hadronization are essential for understanding a range of phenomena in non-equilibrium strongly-interacting matter. We establish a framework for performing such simulations on a quantum computer and apply it to a heavy quark moving across a modest-sized 1+1D SU(2) lattice of light quarks. Conceptual advances with regard to simulations of non-Abelian versus Abelian theories are developed, allowing for the evolution of the energy in light quarks, of their local non-Abelian charge densities, and of their multi-partite entanglement to be computed. The non-trivial action of non-Abelian charge operators on arbitrary states suggests mapping the heavy quarks to qubits alongside the light quarks, and limits the heavy-quark motion to discrete steps among spatial lattice sites. Further, the color entanglement among the heavy quarks and light quarks is implemented using hadronic operators, and Domain Decomposition is shown to be effective in quantum state preparation. Scalable quantum circuits that account for the heterogeneity of non-Abelian charge sectors across the lattice are used to prepare the interacting ground-state wavefunction in the presence of heavy quarks. The discrete motion of heavy quarks between adjacent spatial sites is implemented using fermionic SWAP operations. Quantum simulations of the dynamics of a system on $L=3$ spatial sites are performed using IBM's ${\tt ibm\_pittsburgh}$ quantum computer using 18 qubits, for which the circuits for state preparation, motion, and one second-order Trotter step of time evolution have a two-qubit depth of 398. A suite of error mitigation techniques are used to extract the observables from the simulations, providing results that are in good agreement with classical simulations. The framework presented here generalizes straightforwardly to other non-Abelian groups, including SU(3) for quantum chromodynamics.</description>

      <title>Quantum Correlation Assisted Cooling of Microwave Cavities Below the Ambient Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework for cooling a microwave cavity mode using a Poisson stream of internally correlated pairs of two-level systems and analyze its performance under realistic dissipation. Starting from a Lindblad model of a phonon-tethered cavity interacting with sequentially injected atom pairs, we derive closed-form expressions for the steady-state cavity occupation and effective temperature. Two coupling geometries are examined: a one-atom configuration, where only one member of each pair interacts with the cavity, and a two-atom configuration, where both atoms couple collectively. The single-atom model enables cooling below the phonon bath but not below the reservoir temperature, whereas the two-atom scheme exhibits enhanced refrigeration - pair correlations modify the cavity's upward and downward transition rates so that the steady-state temperature can fall well below that of the reservoir for weak phonon damping. We map the parameter space including detuning, coupling strength, damping, and intra-pair exchange, identifying cooling valleys near resonance and the crossover between reservoir- and phonon-dominated regimes. The two-atom configuration thus realizes a genuine quantum-enhanced cooling mechanism absent in the single-atom case. We further outline an experimental implementation using two superconducting qubits repeatedly prepared, coupled, and reset inside a 3D cavity. Realistic reset and flux-tuning protocols support MHz-rate interaction cycles, enabling engineered reservoirs to impose cavity temperatures of 50-120 mK even when the cryostat is at ~1 K, offering a pathway to autonomous, on-chip refrigeration of microwave modes in scalable quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Plasmonic Dynamics Modeled via a Modified Langevin Noise Formalism: Numerical Studies of Single-Photon Emission and Two-Photon Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.03388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.03388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have established and rigorously validated a modified Langevin noise formalism that enables first-principles quantization of electromagnetic fields in open and dissipative environments [1,2,3]. Building on this foundation, a fully quantum-mechanical multimode Jaynes-Cummings framework has been developed and verified, providing an accurate description of atom--field interactions in lossy and radiative systems [4]. In this work, we explore the potential of this formalism for nanophotonic applications by modeling representative quantum-plasmonic dynamics. In particular, we present detailed numerical examples for (i) two-photon interference mediated by a quantum plasmonic beam splitter, and (ii) non-Markovian dynamics of an atom located in plasmonic antennas and directional control of out-coupled single-photon fields. These results demonstrate that the proposed modeling approach can be directly used to guide the design and optimization of plasmonic single-photon sources and beam-splitting structures. Moreover, the framework is broadly applicable to the analysis of linear optical components and cavity quantum electrodynamics problems in open and dissipative photonic integrated circuits.</description>

      <title>Triangular lattice models of the Kalmeyer-Laughlin spin liquid from coupled wires</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chiral spin liquids (CSLs) are exotic phases of interacting spins in two dimensions, characterized by long-range entanglement and fractional excitations. We construct a local Hamiltonian on the triangular lattice that stabilizes the Kalmeyer-Laughlin CSL without requiring fine-tuning. Our approach employs coupled-wire constructions and introduces a lattice duality to construct a solvable chiral sliding Luttinger liquid, which is driven toward the CSL phase by generic perturbations. By combining symmetry analysis and bosonization, we make sharp predictions for the ground states on quasi-one-dimensional cylinders and tori, which exhibit a fourfold periodicity in the circumference. Extensive tensor network simulations demonstrating ground-state degeneracies, fractional quasiparticles, nonvanishing long-range order parameters, and entanglement signatures confirm the emergence of the CSL in the lattice Hamiltonian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing is poised to redefine the algorithmic foundations of communication systems. While quantum superposition and entanglement enable quadratic or exponential speedups for specific problems, identifying use cases where these advantages yield engineering benefits is still nontrivial. This article presents the fundamentals of quantum computing in a style familiar to the communications society, outlining the current limits of fault-tolerant quantum computing and clarifying a mathematical harmony between quantum and wireless systems, which makes the topic more enticing to wireless researchers. Based on a systematic review of pioneering and state-of-the-art studies indicating speedup opportunities, we distill common design trends for the research and development of quantum-accelerated communication systems and highlight lessons learned. The key insight is that quantum algorithms, including their gate-level realizations, can benefit from the design intuition applied in communication engineering. This article aims to catalyze interdisciplinary research at the frontier of quantum information processing and future communication systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a contribution to the field of quantum mereology, we study how a change of tensor product structure in a finite-dimensional Hilbert space affects its entanglement properties. In particular, we ask whether, given a time-evolving state, there exists a tensor product structure in which no entanglement is generated. We give a concrete, constructive example of disentangling tensor product structure in the case of a C-NOT gate evolution between two qbits, before showing that this cannot be achieved for most time-evolving quantum states.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Energy and Topological Mass from a Constant Magnetic Field and Boundary Conditions in Coupled Scalar Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the combined effects of a uniform magnetic field and boundary conditions on vacuum energy and topological mass generation in a coupled scalar field theory. The system consists of a real scalar field, subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions, interacting via self- and cross-couplings with a gauge-coupled complex scalar field obeying mixed boundary conditions between two perfectly reflecting parallel plates. The magnetic field induces Landau quantization, leading to novel contributions. Employing zeta-function regularization within the effective potential formalism, we derive the renormalized effective potential up to second order in the coupling constants without imposing a vanishing magnetic field in the renormalization scheme. Our renormalization approach preserves magnetic contributions while properly removing divergences, enabling a consistent treatment of finite-size corrections, magnetic effects, and interaction terms. We compute the vacuum energy per unit area of the plates, analyze the emergence of a topological mass from boundary and magnetic contributions, and evaluate the first-order coupling-constant corrections at two-loop order. Detailed asymptotic analysis are presented for both weak- and strong-field regimes, revealing exponential suppression at high magnetic fields and nontrivial polynomial and logarithmic behavior in the weak-field limit.</description>

      <title>Subdimensional entanglement entropy: from geometric-topological response to entanglement-induced mixed-state landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A growing body of examples reveals that topology and geometry are deeply intertwined in shaping universal properties of quantum matter, as seen in fracton orders with size-dependent topological ground-state degeneracy and in cluster states with spurious topological entanglement entropy. We introduce the \textit{subdimensional entanglement entropy} (SEE), defined on \textit{subdimensional entanglement subsystems} (SESs) embedded in the bulk, as a direct probe of this intertwinement. By virtually tuning SES dimension, geometry and topology, the subleading components of SEE show sharply distinct geometric and topological responses in cluster states, $\mathbb{Z}_q$ topological orders, and fracton orders. Further viewing the SES reduced density matrix as a mixed state on the SES manifold, we establish an exact correspondence between stabilizers and mixed-state symmetries, distinguishing \textit{strong} from \textit{weak} classes. Nontrivial SEE enforces weak symmetries to act as \textit{transparent patch operators} of strong ones, together forming \textit{transparent composite symmetries} that are robust against finite depth quantum circuits. Due to the presence of transparent patch operators, each $D$-dimensional SES holographically encodes a $(D+1)$-dimensional topological order. Thus, SEE simultaneously accesses various forefront directions, providing a unified and versatile nexus linking phenomena previously regarded as distinct.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic Electron Transfer in the Barrierless and Marcus-Inverted Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01909v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here it is shown that in the adiabatic limit of condensed-phase electron transfer, the onset of barrierless transition occurs at a lower driving force than predicted by the non-adiabatic Marcus formulation. Furthermore, in the adiabatic limit of the Marcus-inverted region, the standard mechanism of electron transfer becomes topologically forbidden. This behavior arises from a topological change in the mapping between the adiabatic and diabatic electronic surfaces, emerging precisely at the onset of the Marcus-inverted region. In this case, alternative mechanisms such as tunneling and non-radiative decay may dominate the rate, typically orders of magnitude slower than the rate calculated from Marcus theory.</description>

      <title>Dynamics generated by spatially growing derivations on quasi-local algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove global existence and uniqueness of dynamics on the quasi-local algebra $\mathcal{A}$ of a quantum lattice system for spatially growing derivations $\mathcal{L}_\Phi = \sum_x [ \Phi_x , \cdot ]$. Existing results assume that the local terms $\Phi_x\in\mathcal{A}$ of the generator are uniformly bounded in space with respect to appropriate weighted norms $\lVert \Phi_x \rVert_{G,x}$. Analogous to the global existence result for first order ODEs, we show that global existence and uniqueness persist if the size of the local terms $\lVert \Phi_x \rVert_{G,x}$ grows at most linearly in space. This considerably enlarges the class of derivations known to have well-defined dynamics. Moreover, we obtain Lieb-Robinson bounds with exponential light cones for such dynamics.
  For the proof, we assume Lieb-Robinson bounds with linear light cones for dynamics, whose generators have uniformly bounded local terms. Such bounds are known to hold, for example, if the local terms are of finite range or exponentially localized.</description>

      <title>Collective cluster nucleation dynamics in 2D Ising quantum magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strongly interacting many-body systems often show collective properties that are non-trivially related to the microscopic degrees of freedom. Collectivity is responsible for intriguing ground state properties, for example, in superconductors. However, collective effects may also govern the non-equilibrium response of quantum systems, not only in condensed matter physics but also in quantum field theories modeling the properties of our universe. Understanding emergent collective dynamics from first principles, in particular in non-perturbative regimes, is therefore one of the central challenges in quantum many-body physics. Here we report on the observation of collective cluster nucleation in 2D quantum Ising systems realized in an atomic Rydberg array. We observe a confined regime in which the steady-state cluster size is energy-dependent and a deconfined regime characterized by kinetically constrained dynamics of cluster nucleation. Our results mark a qualitative leap for quantum simulations with Rydberg arrays and shed light on highly collective non-equilibrium processes in one of the most important textbook models of condensed matter physics with relevance from quantum magnets and the kinetics of glass formers to cosmology.</description>

      <title>Robust, fast, and efficient formation of stable tetratomic molecules from ultracold atoms via generalized stimulated Raman exact passage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04681v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of the conversion of ultracold atoms into molecules has long remained a hot topic in atomic, molecular, and optical physics. However, most prior research has focused on diatomic molecules, with relatively scarce exploration of polyatomic molecules. Here we propose a two-step strategy for the formation of stable ultracold tetratomic molecules. We first suggest a generalized nonlinear stimulated Raman exact passage (STIREP) technique for the coherent conversion of ultracold atoms to tetratomic molecules, which is subsequently followed by a chainwise-STIREP technique to transfer the resulting molecules into a sufficiently stable ground state. Through systematic numerical analysis, we demonstrate that the proposed two-step strategy holds great potential for the robust, fast, and efficient formation of stable ultracold tetratomic molecules.</description>
