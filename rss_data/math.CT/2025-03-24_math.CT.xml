      <title>The formal theory of tangentads I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tangent category theory is a well-established categorical framework for differential geometry. In a previous paper, a formal approach was adopted to provide a genuine Grothendieck construction in the context of tangent category theory, by introducing tangentads. A tangentad is to a tangent category as a formal monad is to a monad of a category. In this paper, we discuss the formal notion of tangentads, construct a $2$-comonad structure on the $2$-functor of tangentads, and introduce cartesian, adjunctable, and representable tangentads. We also reinterpret the subtangent structure with negatives of a tangent structure as a right Kan extension. Furthermore, we present numerous examples of tangentads, such as (split) restriction tangent categories, tangent fibrations, tangent monads, display tangent categories, and infinitesimal objects. Finally, we employ the formal approach to prove that every tangent monad admits the construction of algebras, provided the underlying monad does, and show that split restriction tangent categories are $2$-equivalent to $\mathscr{M}$-tangent categories.</description>

      <title>Presentability and topoi in internal higher category theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.05103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this article is to develop the theory of presentable categories and topoi internal to an arbitrary $\infty$-topos $\mathcal{B}$. Our main results are internal analogues of Lurie's and Lurie-Simpson's characterisations of presentable $\infty$-categories and $\infty$-topoi. In the process, we introduce a theory of internal filteredness and accessible internal categories and establish a number of structural results about presentable $\mathcal{B}$-categories such as adjoint functor theorems and the existence of an internal analogue of the Lurie tensor product. We also compare these internal notions with external variants. We show that $\mathcal{B}$-modules embed fully faithfully into presentable $\mathcal{B}$-categories and prove that there is an equivalence between topoi internal to $\mathcal{B}$ and $\infty$-topoi over $\mathcal{B}$. We also include a number of applications of our results, such as a general version of Diaconescu's theorem for $\infty$-topoi and a characterisation of locally contractible geometric morphisms in terms of smoothness.</description>

      <title>On Vector Spaces with Formal Infinite Sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.08000v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I discuss possible definitions of categories of vector spaces enriched with a notion of formal infinite linear combination in the likes of the formal infinite linear combinations one has in the context of generalized power series, I call these \emph{reasonable categories of strong vector spaces} (r.c.s.v.s.). I show that, in a precise sense, the more general possible definition for a strong vector space is that of a small $\mathrm{Vect}$-enriched endofunctor of $\mathrm{Vect}$ that is right orthogonal for every cardinal $\lambda$, to the cokernel of the canonical inclusion of the $\lambda$-th copower in the $\lambda$-th power of the identity functor: these form the objects for a universal r.c.s.v.s. I call $\Sigma\mathrm{Vect}$. I show this is equivalent to the category of \emph{ultrafinite summability spaces} defined independently in arXiv:2403.05827. I relate this category to what could be understood to be the obvious category of strong vector spaces $B\Sigma\mathrm{Vect}$ and to the r.c.s.v.s. $K\mathrm{TVect}_s$ of separated linearly topologized spaces that are generated by linearly compact spaces. I analyze the monoidal closed structures on various r.s.v.s. induced by the natural one on $\mathrm{Ind}(\mathrm{Vect}^{\mathrm{op}})$. In particular with respect to the problem of closure under the tensor product of $\mathrm{Ind}(\mathrm{Vect}^{\mathrm{op}})$. Most of the technical results apply to a more general class of orthogonal subcategories of $\mathrm{Ind}(\mathrm{Vect}^{\mathrm{op}})$ and we work with that generality as it's cost-free.</description>

      <title>Hochschild cohomology of the second kind: Koszul duality and Morita invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define Hochschild cohomology of the second kind for differential graded (dg) or curved algebras as a derived functor in a compactly generated derived category of the second kind, and show that it is invariant under Morita equivalence of the second kind. A bimodule version of Koszul duality is constructed and used to show that Hochschild cohomology of the second kind is preserved under (nonconilpotent) Koszul duality. We show that Hochschild cohomology of the second kind of an algebra often computes the ordinary Hochschild cohomology of geometrically meaningful dg categories. Examples include the category of infinity local systems on a topological space, the bounded derived category of a complex algebraic manifold and the category of matrix factorizations.</description>

      <title>Grothendieck topoi with a left adjoint to a left adjoint to a left adjoint to the global sections functor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04317v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces the notion of complete connectedness of a Grothendieck topos, defined as the existence of a left adjoint to a left adjoint to a left adjoint to the global sections functor, and provides many examples. Typical examples include presheaf topoi over a category with an initial object, such as the topos of sets, the Sierpi\'nski topos, the topos of trees, the object classifier, the topos of augmented simplicial sets, and the classifying topos of many algebraic theories, such as groups, rings, and vector spaces.
  We first develop a general theory on the length of adjunctions between a Grothendieck topos and the topos of sets. We provide a site characterisation of complete connectedness, which turns out to be dual to that of local topoi. We also prove that every Grothendieck topos is a closed subtopos of a completely connected Grothendieck topos.</description>

      <title>Symplectic double groupoids and the generalized K\"ahler potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A description of the fundamental degrees of freedom underlying generalized K\"ahler geometry, which separates its holomorphic moduli from its compatible Riemannian metric in a similar way to the K\"ahler case, has been sought since its discovery in 1984. In this paper, we describe a full solution to this problem for arbitrary generalized K\"ahler manifolds. We discover that the holomorphic structure underlying a generalized K\"ahler manifold is a holomorphic symplectic Morita double bimodule between double symplectic groupoids, and that each compatible Riemannian metric is given by a Lagrangian submanifold forming a bisection of the real symplectic core of this double bimodule. In other words, a generalized K\"ahler manifold has an associated holomorphic symplectic manifold of quadruple dimension and equipped with an anti-holomorphic involution; the generalized K\"ahler metric is then determined by the choice of a Lagrangian submanifold of the fixed point locus of this involution. This resolves affirmatively a long-standing conjecture by physicists concerning the existence of a generalized K\"ahler potential.
  We demonstrate the theory by constructing explicitly the above Morita double bimodule and Lagrangian bisection for the well-known generalized K\"ahler structures on compact even-dimensional semisimple Lie groups, which have until now escaped such analysis. We construct the required holomorphic symplectic manifolds by expressing them as moduli spaces of flat connections on surfaces with Lagrangian boundary conditions, through a quasi-Hamiltonian reduction.</description>

      <title>An Introduction to Categorical Proof Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These expanded lecture notes are based on a tutorial on categorical proof theory presented at the summer school associated with the conference "Topology, Algebra, and Categories in Logic 2021-2022." The chapter delves into various applications of categorical methods in proof theory. It is designed to be accessible, with no prior familiarity with category theory required. The necessary categorical background is introduced gradually, with a focus on the philosophical and informal aspects of proof. The only prerequisites are a basic understanding of logic, computability theory, topology, and ordered structures.</description>

      <title>Higher local systems and the categorified monodromy equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study local systems of $(\infty,n)$-categories on spaces. We prove that categorical local systems are captured by (higher) monodromy data: in particular, if $X$ is $(n+1)$-connected, then local systems of $(\infty,n)$-categories over $X$ can be described as $\mathbb{E}_{n+1}$-modules over the iterated loop space $\Omega_{n+1}X$. This generalizes the classical monodromy equivalence presenting ordinary local systems as modules over the based loop spaces. Along the way we revisit from the perspective of $\infty$-categories Teleman's influential theory of topological group actions on categories, and we extend it to topological actions on $(\infty,n)$-categories. Finally, we show that the group of invertible objects in the category of local systems of $(\infty,n)$-categories over an $n$-connected space $X$ is isomorphic to the group of characters of $\pi_n(X)$. This should be thought of as a topological analogue of the higher Brauer group of the space $X$. We conclude the paper with applications of the theory of categorical local systems to the fiberwise Fukaya category of symplectic fibrations.</description>
