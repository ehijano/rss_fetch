      <title>Emergent spatial organization of competing species under environmental stress and cooperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how species persist under interacting stressors is a central challenge in ecology. We develop a spatially explicit reaction-diffusion framework to investigate competing species in landscapes shaped by climate variability, pollution, resource heterogeneity, and cooperation. Here, temperature follows low-frequency oscillations, while pollution and resources diffuse from localized sources. Growth is governed by a dynamic carrying capacity integrating abiotic stress with an endogenous, pollution-sensitive cooperation field.
  Numerical simulations reveal the spontaneous emergence of persistent spatial organization, including dominance segregation and stable competitive boundaries. Quantitative analyses-using boundary geometry, fractal dimension, and spatial entropy-demonstrate a transition from intermixed initial states to low-complexity, quasi-stationary configurations. Coexistence occurs through distinct strategies: one species occupies more area, while the other maintains higher local densities. Cooperation enhances resilience but collapses in polluted zones, creating heterogeneous "social buffering."
  We further introduce a hybrid inverse modeling framework using a Swin Transformer to infer high-dimensional parameters from only two temporal snapshots. Trained on synthetic data, the model accurately recovers demographic, diffusive, and environmental-sensitivity parameters. While it achieves reliable short-term spatial predictions, long-term forecasts diverge due to the intrinsic sensitivity of nonlinear systems. This unified framework links sparse observations to mechanistic dynamics, advancing biodiversity forecasting under accelerating global change.</description>

      <title>Structural properties of distance-bounded phylogenetic reconciliation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phylogenetic reconciliation seeks to explain host-symbiont co-evolution by mapping parasite trees onto host trees through events such as cospeciation, duplication, host switching, and loss. Finding an optimal reconciliation that ensures time feasibility is computationally hard when timing information is incomplete, and the complexity remains open when host switches are restricted by a fixed maximum distance $d$. While the case $d=2$ is known to be polynomial, larger values are unresolved. In this paper, we study the cases $d=3$ and $d=4$. We show that although arbitrarily large cycles may occur, it suffices to check only bounded-size cycles (we provide a complete list), provided the reconciliation satisfies acyclicity (i.e., time-feasibility) in a stronger sense. These results do not resolve the general complexity, but highlight structural properties that advance the understanding of distance-bounded reconciliations.</description>

      <title>Epigenetic state inheritance drivers drug-tolerant persister-induced resistance in solid tumors: A stochastic agent-based model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficacy of anti-cancer therapies is severely limited by the emergence of drug resistance. While genetic drivers are well-characterized, growing evidence suggests that non-genetic mechanisms, particularly those involving drug-tolerant persisters (DTPs), play a pivotal role in solid tumor relapse. To elucidate the evolutionary dynamics of DTP-induced resistance, we develop a stochastic agent-based model (ABM) of solid tumor evolution that couples macroscopic population dynamics with microscopic epigenetic state inheritance during the cell cycle. Our simulations accurately reproduce the temporal progression of relapse observed in experimental studies, capturing the dynamic transition from sensitive cells to DTPs, and ultimately to stable resistant phenotypes under prolonged therapy. By explicitly modeling the epigenetic plasticity of individual cells, our model bridges the gap between cellular heterogeneity and population-level tumor evolution. Furthermore, we performed \textit{in silico} clinical trials using virtual patient cohorts to evaluate therapeutic outcomes, demonstrating that optimized adaptive treatment strategies can significantly delay tumor relapse compared to standard dosing. This study provides a quantitative framework for dissecting DTP-driven resistance mechanisms and designing more effective, biologically informed therapeutic strategies.</description>

      <title>Microbiome association diversity reflects proximity to the edge of instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in metagenomics have revealed macroecological patterns or "laws" describing robust statistical regularities across microbial communities. Stochastic logistic models (SLMs), which treat species as independent -- akin to ideal gases in physics -- and incorporate environmental noise, reproduce many single-species patterns but cannot account for the pairwise covariation observed in microbiome data. Here we introduce an interacting stochastic logistic model (ISLM) that minimally extends the SLM by sampling an ensemble of random interaction networks chosen to preserve these single-species laws. Using dynamical mean-field theory, we map the model's phase diagram -- stable, chaotic, and unbounded-growth regimes -- where the transition from stable fixed-point to chaos is controlled by network sparsity and interaction heterogeneity via a May-like instability line. Going beyond mean-field theory to account for finite communities, we derive an estimator of an effective stability parameter that quantifies distance to the edge of instability and can be inferred from the width of the distribution of pairwise covariances in empirical species-abundance data. Applying this framework to synthetic data, environmental microbiomes, and human gut cohorts indicates that these communities tend to operate near the edge of instability. Moreover, gut communities from healthy individuals cluster closer to this edge and exhibit broader, more heterogeneous associations, whereas dysbiosis-associated states shift toward more stable regimes -- enabling discrimination across conditions such as Crohn's disease, inflammatory bowel syndrome, and colorectal cancer. Together, our results connect macroecological laws, interaction-network ensembles, and May's stability theory, suggesting that complex communities may benefit from operating near a dynamical phase transition.</description>

      <title>How adaptation to food resources and death rates shape oscillatory dynamics in a microbial population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microbes constantly interact with their environment by depleting and transforming food sources. Theoretical studies have mainly focused on Lotka-Volterra models, which do not account for food source dynamics. In contrast, consumer-resource models, which consider food source dynamics, are less explored. In particular, it is still unclear what physical mechanisms control oscillatory dynamics at a single population level, a phenomenon which can only be captured by a consumer-resource model. Here, we present a minimalistic consumer-resource model of a single microbial population with growth and death dynamics, consuming a continuously replenishing substrate. Our model reveals that decaying oscillations can occur around steady state if and only if the timescale of microbial adaptation to food supply changes exceeds the death timescale. This interplay of timescales allows us to rationalize the emergence of oscillatory dynamics when adding various biophysical ingredients to the model. We find that microbial necromass recycling or complementary use of multiple food sources reduces the parameter range for oscillations and increases the decay rate of oscillations. Requiring multiple simultaneous food sources has the opposite effect. Essentially, facilitating growth reduces the likelihood of oscillations around a fixed point. We further demonstrate that such damped oscillatory behavior is correlated with persistent oscillatory behavior in a noisy environment. We hope our work will motivate further investigations of consumer-resource models to improve descriptions of environments where food source distributions vary in space and time.</description>

      <title>Counting rankings of tree-child networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05730v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rooted phylogenetic networks allow biologists to represent evolutionary relationships between present-day species by revealing ancestral speciation and hybridization events. A convenient and well-studied class of such networks are `tree-child networks' and a `ranking' of such a network is a temporal ordering of the ancestral speciation and hybridization events. In this short note, we investigate the question of counting such rankings on any given binary (or semi-binary) tree-child network. We also consider a class of binary tree-child networks that have exactly one ranking, and investigate further the relationship between ranked-tree child networks and the class of `normal' networks. Finally, we provide an explicit asymptotic expression for the expected number of rankings of a tree-child network chosen uniformly at random.</description>

      <title>Large Deviations of Mean-Field Jump-Markov Processes on Structured Sparse Disordered Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a Large Deviation Principle for {\color{blue} jump-Markov } Processes on sparse large disordered network with disordered connectivity. The network is embedded in a geometric space, with the probability of a connection a (scaled) function of the spatial positions of the nodes. This type of model has numerous applications, including neuroscience, epidemiology and social networks. We prove that the rate function (that indicates the asymptotic likelihood of state transitions) is the same as for a network with all-to-all connectivity. We apply our results to a stochastic $SIS$ epidemiological model on a disordered networks, and determine Euler-Lagrange equations that dictate the most likely transition path between different states of the network.</description>
