      <title>xTern: Energy-Efficient Ternary Neural Network Inference on RISC-V-Based Edge Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ternary neural networks (TNNs) offer a superior accuracy-energy trade-off compared to binary neural networks. However, until now, they have required specialized accelerators to realize their efficiency potential, which has hindered widespread adoption. To address this, we present xTern, a lightweight extension of the RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA) targeted at accelerating TNN inference on general-purpose cores. To complement the ISA extension, we developed a set of optimized kernels leveraging xTern, achieving 67% higher throughput than their 2-bit equivalents. Power consumption is only marginally increased by 5.2%, resulting in an energy efficiency improvement by 57.1%. We demonstrate that the proposed xTern extension, integrated into an octa-core compute cluster, incurs a minimal silicon area overhead of 0.9% with no impact on timing. In end-to-end benchmarks, we demonstrate that xTern enables the deployment of TNNs achieving up to 1.6 percentage points higher CIFAR-10 classification accuracy than 2-bit networks at equal inference latency. Our results show that xTern enables RISC-V-based ultra-low-power edge AI platforms to benefit from the efficiency potential of TNNs.</description>

      <title>OpenConvoy: Universal Platform for Real-World Testing of Cooperative Driving Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cooperative driving, enabled by communication between automated vehicle systems, promises significant benefits to fuel efficiency, road capacity, and safety over single-vehicle driver assistance systems such as adaptive cruise control (ACC). However, the responsible development and implementation of these algorithms poses substantial challenges due to the need for extensive real-world testing. We address this issue and introduce OpenConvoy, an open and extensible framework designed for the implementation and assessment of cooperative driving policies on physical connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). We demonstrate the capabilities of OpenConvoy through a series of experiments on a convoy of multi-scale vehicles controlled by Platooning to show the stability of our system across vehicle configurations and its ability to effectively measure convoy cohesion across driving scenarios including varying degrees of communication loss.</description>

      <title>MoNDE: Mixture of Near-Data Experts for Large-Scale Sparse Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) large language models (LLM) have memory requirements that often exceed the GPU memory capacity, requiring costly parameter movement from secondary memories to the GPU for expert computation. In this work, we present Mixture of Near-Data Experts (MoNDE), a near-data computing solution that efficiently enables MoE LLM inference. MoNDE reduces the volume of MoE parameter movement by transferring only the $\textit{hot}$ experts to the GPU, while computing the remaining $\textit{cold}$ experts inside the host memory device. By replacing the transfers of massive expert parameters with the ones of small activations, MoNDE enables far more communication-efficient MoE inference, thereby resulting in substantial speedups over the existing parameter offloading frameworks for both encoder and decoder operations.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Foundation Model Inference on a Many-tiny-core Open-source RISC-V Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based foundation models have become crucial for various domains, most notably natural language processing (NLP) or computer vision (CV). These models are predominantly deployed on high-performance GPUs or hardwired accelerators with highly customized, proprietary instruction sets. Until now, limited attention has been given to RISC-V-based general-purpose platforms. In our work, we present the first end-to-end inference results of transformer models on an open-source many-tiny-core RISC-V platform implementing distributed Softmax primitives and leveraging ISA extensions for SIMD floating-point operand streaming and instruction repetition, as well as specialized DMA engines to minimize costly main memory accesses and to tolerate their latency. We focus on two foundational transformer topologies, encoder-only and decoder-only models. For encoder-only models, we demonstrate a speedup of up to 12.8x between the most optimized implementation and the baseline version. We reach over 79% FPU utilization and 294 GFLOPS/W, outperforming State-of-the-Art (SoA) accelerators by more than 2x utilizing the HW platform while achieving comparable throughput per computational unit. For decoder-only topologies, we achieve 16.1x speedup in the Non-Autoregressive (NAR) mode and up to 35.6x speedup in the Autoregressive (AR) mode compared to the baseline implementation. Compared to the best SoA dedicated accelerator, we achieve 2.04x higher FPU utilization.</description>

      <title>NDSEARCH: Accelerating Graph-Traversal-Based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search through Near Data Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) is a key retrieval technique for vector database and many data center applications, such as person re-identification and recommendation systems. It is also fundamental to retrieval augmented generation (RAG) for large language models (LLM) now. Among all the ANNS algorithms, graph-traversal-based ANNS achieves the highest recall rate. However, as the size of dataset increases, the graph may require hundreds of gigabytes of memory, exceeding the main memory capacity of a single workstation node. Although we can do partitioning and use solid-state drive (SSD) as the backing storage, the limited SSD I/O bandwidth severely degrades the performance of the system. To address this challenge, we present NDSEARCH, a hardware-software co-designed near-data processing (NDP) solution for ANNS processing. NDSEARCH consists of a novel in-storage computing architecture, namely, SEARSSD, that supports the ANNS kernels and leverages logic unit (LUN)-level parallelism inside the NAND flash chips. NDSEARCH also includes a processing model that is customized for NDP and cooperates with SEARSSD. The processing model enables us to apply a two-level scheduling to improve the data locality and exploit the internal bandwidth in NDSEARCH, and a speculative searching mechanism to further accelerate the ANNS workload. Our results show that NDSEARCH improves the throughput by up to 31.7x, 14.6x, 7.4x 2.9x over CPU, GPU, a state-of-the-art SmartSSD-only design, and DeepStore, respectively. NDSEARCH also achieves two orders-of-magnitude higher energy efficiency than CPU and GPU.</description>

      <title>SAT-based Exact Modulo Scheduling Mapping for Resource-Constrained CGRAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coarse-Grain Reconfigurable Arrays (CGRAs) represent emerging low-power architectures designed to accelerate Compute-Intensive Loops (CILs). The effectiveness of CGRAs in providing acceleration relies on the quality of mapping: how efficiently the CIL is compiled onto the platform. State of the Art (SoA) compilation techniques utilize modulo scheduling to minimize the Iteration Interval (II) and use graph algorithms like Max-Clique Enumeration to address mapping challenges. Our work approaches the mapping problem through a satisfiability (SAT) formulation. We introduce the Kernel Mobility Schedule (KMS), an ad-hoc schedule used with the Data Flow Graph and CGRA architectural information to generate Boolean statements that, when satisfied, yield a valid mapping. Experimental results demonstrate SAT-MapIt outperforming SoA alternatives in almost 50\% of explored benchmarks. Additionally, we evaluated the mapping results in a synthesizable CGRA design and emphasized the run-time metrics trends, i.e. energy efficiency and latency, across different CILs and CGRA sizes. We show that a hardware-agnostic analysis performed on compiler-level metrics can optimally prune the architectural design space, while still retaining Pareto-optimal configurations. Moreover, by exploring how implementation details impact cost and performance on real hardware, we highlight the importance of holistic software-to-hardware mapping flows, as the one presented herein.</description>
