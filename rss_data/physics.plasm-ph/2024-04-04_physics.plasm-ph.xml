      <title>Exploration of the parameter space of quasisymmetric stellarator vacuum fields through adjoint optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimising stellarators for quasisymmetry leads to strongly reduced collisional transport and energetic particle losses compared to unoptimised configurations. Though stellarators with precise quasisymmetry have been obtained in the past, it remains unclear how broad the parameter space is where good quasisymmetry may be achieved. We study the range of aspect ratio and rotational transform values for which stellarators with excellent quasisymmetry on the boundary can be obtained. A large number of Fourier harmonics is included in the boundary representation, which is made computationally tractable by the use of adjoint methods to enable fast gradient-based optimisation, and by the direct optimisation of vacuum magnetic fields, which converge more robustly compared to solutions from magnetohydrostatics. Several novel configurations are presented, including stellarators with record levels of quasisymmetry on a surface; three field period quasiaxisymmetric stellarators with substantial magnetic shear, and compact quasisymmetric stellarators at low aspect ratios similar to tokamaks.</description>

      <title>Direct, simple, and efficient computation of all components of the virtual-casing magnetic field in axisymmetric geometries with Kapur-Rokhlin quadrature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent publication (Toler et al. 2023), we demonstrated that for axisymmetric geometries, the Kapur-Rokhlin quadrature rule provided an efficient and high-order accurate method for computing the normal component, on the plasma surface, of the magnetic field due to the toroidal current flowing in the plasma, via the virtual-casing principle. The calculation was indirect, as it required the prior computation of the magnetic vector potential from the virtual-casing principle, followed by the computation of its tangential derivative by Fourier differentiation, in order to obtain the normal component of the magnetic field. Our approach did not provide the other components of the virtual-casing magnetic field.
  In this letter, we show that a more direct and more general approach is available for the computation of the virtual-casing magnetic field. The Kapur-Rokhlin quadrature rule accurately calculates the principal value integrals in the expression for all the components of the magnetic field on the plasma boundary, and the numerical error converges at a rate nearly as high as the indirect method we presented previously.</description>

      <title>Feasibility and Performance of the Staged Z-Pinch: A One-dimensional Study with FLASH and MACH2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Z-pinch platforms constitute a promising pathway to fusion energy research. Here, we present a one-dimensional numerical study of the staged Z-pinch (SZP) concept using the FLASH and MACH2 codes. We discuss the verification of the codes using two analytical benchmarks that include Z-pinch-relevant physics, building confidence on the codes' ability to model such experiments. Then, FLASH is used to simulate two different SZP configurations: a xenon gas-puff liner (SZP1*) and a silver solid liner (SZP2). The SZP2 results are compared against previously published MACH2 results, and a new code-to-code comparison on SZP1* is presented. Using an ideal equation of state and analytical transport coefficients, FLASH yields a fuel convergence ratio (CR) of approximately 39 and a mass-averaged fuel ion temperature slightly below 1 keV for the SZP2 scheme, significantly lower than the full-physics MACH2 prediction. For the new SZP1* configuration, full-physics FLASH simulations furnish large and inherently unstable CRs (&gt; 300), but achieve fuel ion temperatures of many keV. While MACH2 also predicts high temperatures, the fuel stagnates at a smaller CR. The integrated code-to-code comparison reveals how magnetic insulation, heat conduction, and radiation transport affect platform performance and the feasibility of the SZP concept.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Alfv\'en turbulence at kinetic scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a strongly magnetized, magnetically dominated relativistic plasma, Alfv\'enic turbulence can extend to scales much smaller than the particle inertial scales. It leads to an energy cascade somewhat analogous to inertial- or kinetic-Alfv\'en turbulent cascades existing in non-relativistic space and astrophysical plasmas. Based on phenomenological modeling and particle-in-cell numerical simulations, we propose that the energy spectrum of such relativistic kinetic-scale Alfv\'enic turbulence is close to $k^{-3}$ or slightly steeper than that due to intermittency corrections or Landau damping. We note the analogy of this spectrum with the Kraichnan spectrum corresponding to the enstrophy cascade in 2D incompressible fluid turbulence. Such turbulence strongly energizes particles in the direction parallel to the background magnetic field, leading to nearly one-dimensional particle momentum distributions. We find that these distributions have universal log-normal statistics.</description>

      <title>Preliminary Investigation of a Higgs Factory based on Proton-Driven Plasma Wakefield Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Higgs Factory is considered the highest priority next collider project by the high-energy physics community. Very advanced designs based on radio-frequency cavities exist, and variations on this approach are still being developed. Recently, an option based on electron-bunch driven plasma wakefield acceleration has also been proposed. In this article, we discuss a further option based on proton-driven plasma wakefield acceleration. This option has significant potential advantages due to the high energy of the plasma wakefield driver, simplifying the plasma acceleration stage. Its success will depend on further developments in producing compact high-energy proton bunches at a high rate, which would also make possible a broad range of synergistic particle-physics research.</description>
