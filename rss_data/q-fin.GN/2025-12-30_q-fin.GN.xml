      <title>Deep Learning for Art Market Valuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how deep learning can improve valuation in the art market by incorporating the visual content of artworks into predictive models. Using a large repeated-sales dataset from major auction houses, we benchmark classical hedonic regressions and tree-based methods against modern deep architectures, including multi-modal models that fuse tabular and image data. We find that while artist identity and prior transaction history dominate overall predictive power, visual embeddings provide a distinct and economically meaningful contribution for fresh-to-market works where historical anchors are absent. Interpretability analyses using Grad-CAM and embedding visualizations show that models attend to compositional and stylistic cues. Our findings demonstrate that multi-modal deep learning delivers significant value precisely when valuation is hardest, namely first-time sales, and thus offers new insights for both academic research and practice in art market valuation.</description>

      <title>Beyond Binary Screens: A Continuous Shariah Compliance Index for Asset Pricing and Portfolio Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary Shariah screens vary across standards and apply hard thresholds that create discontinuous classifications. We construct a Continuous Shariah Compliance Index (CSCI) in $[0,1]$ by mapping standard screening ratios to smooth scores between conservative ``comfort'' bounds and permissive outer bounds, and aggregating them conservatively with a sectoral activity factor. Using CRSP/Compustat U.S. equities (1999-2024) with lagged accounting inputs and monthly rebalancing, we find that CSCI-based long-only portfolios have historical risk-adjusted performance similar to an emulated binary Islamic benchmark. Tightening the minimum compliance threshold reduces the investable universe and diversification and is associated with lower Sharpe ratios. The framework yields a practical compliance gradient that supports portfolio construction, constraint design, and cross-standard comparisons without reliance on pass/fail screening.</description>

      <title>The Nonstationarity-Complexity Tradeoff in Return Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate machine learning models for stock return prediction in non-stationary environments, revealing a fundamental nonstationarity-complexity tradeoff: complex models reduce misspecification error but require longer training windows that introduce stronger non-stationarity. We resolve this tension with a novel model selection method that jointly optimizes model class and training window size using a tournament procedure that adaptively evaluates candidates on non-stationary validation data. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that this approach balances misspecification error, estimation variance, and non-stationarity, performing close to the best model in hindsight. Applying our method to 17 industry portfolio returns, we consistently outperform standard rolling-window benchmarks, improving out-of-sample $R^2$ by 14-23% on average. During NBER-designated recessions, improvements are substantial: our method achieves positive $R^2$ during the Gulf War recession while benchmarks are negative, and improves $R^2$ in absolute terms by at least 80bps during the 2001 recession as well as superior performance during the 2008 Financial Crisis. Economically, a trading strategy based on our selected model generates 31% higher cumulative returns averaged across the industries.</description>
