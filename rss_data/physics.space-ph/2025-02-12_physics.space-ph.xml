      <title>Properties of Turbulent Convection and Large-Scale Flows in a Rotating F-type Star Revealed by 3D Realistic Radiative Hydrodynamic Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nonlinear coupling between stellar convection and rotation is of great interest because it relates to understanding both stellar evolution and activity. We investigated the influence of rotation and the Coriolis force on the dynamics and thermodynamic structure of an F-type main-sequence star with a shallow outer convection zone. We performed a series of 3D radiative hydrodynamic simulations of a 1.47Msun star for different rotation rates (periods of rotation 1 and 14 days) and with computational domains placed at latitudes of 0degrees (equator), 30degrees, and 60degrees. Because the star has a relatively shallow convection zone (28.5 Mm thick or about 2.81% R*), we model its dynamics from the upper layers of the radiative zone, the whole convection zone, and the low atmosphere. The simulation results show a weak shift of the ionization zones to the photosphere and a decrease of the stellar radius by about 29 km at the equator and about 58 km at higher latitudes in the presence of rotation with a period of 1 day. The models presented reveal the formation of radial differential rotation, meridional flows, latitude-dependent roll-like structures of convection, a tachocline, the presence of a gravity-darkening effect, and others. In this paper, we primarily discuss the properties of the outer convection zone for different rotation rates. Detailed analysis of the properties of the tachocline, the overshoot layer, and small-scale turbulence will be discussed in follow-on papers.</description>

      <title>High-resolution Observation of Mini-Filament Eruptions Near Coronal Hole Boundary and Their Response in Solar Corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated mini-filament (MF) eruptions near coronal hole (CH) boundaries to explore their role in coronal dynamics and their potential contributions to the solar wind. Using high-resolution H$\alpha$ images from the 1.6m Goode Solar Telescope at Big Bear Solar Observatory and EUV data from AIA 193 \AA~ from Solar Dynamic Observatory, we analyzed 28 MFE events over 7.5 hours of observation spanning 5 days. Three largest MF eruptions triggered distinct coronal responses: two consecutive MFEs produced a small-scale eruptive coronal ejection, while the other generated a jet-like brightening. Furthermore, the 25 smaller-scale MFEs were associated with localized brightenings in coronal bright points (CBPs). These findings suggest that MFs play a significant role in transferring mass and magnetic flux to the corona, particularly within CH regions. We found certain trend that the size of MFEs is correlated with the EUV emissions. In addition, we observed magnetic flux cancellation associated with MFEs. However, except for a few largest MFEs, quantitative analysis of magnetic field evolution is beyond the capability of the data. These results underscore the importance of MFEs in the dynamic coupling between the chromosphere and corona, highlighting their potential role in shaping heliospheric structures. Although current study covers smallest MFEs ever studied, future higher-cadence, more accurate magnetograms and multi-wavelength observations are essential to fully resolve the fine-scale dynamics of these ubiquitous solar phenomena.</description>

      <title>An anisotropic plasma model of the heliospheric interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a pioneering model of the interaction between the solar wind and the surrounding interstellar medium that includes the possibility of different pressures in directions parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field. The outer heliosheath region is characterized by a low rate of turbulent scattering that would permit development of pressure anisotropy. The effect is best seen on the interstellar side of the heliopause, where a narrow region develops with an excessive perpendicular pressure resembling a plasma depletion layer typical of planetary magnetspheres. The magnitude of this effect for typical heliospheric conditions is relatively small owing to proton-proton collisions. We show, however, that if the circumstellar medium is warm and tenuous, a much broader anisotropic boundary layer can exist, with a dominant perpendicular pressure in the southern hemisphere and a dominant parallel pressure in the north.</description>
