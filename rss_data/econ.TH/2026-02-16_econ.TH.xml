      <title>Local Coordination and the Geometry of Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study agents playing a pure coordination game on a large social network. Agents are restricted to coordinate locally, without access to a global communication device, and so different regions of the network will converge to different actions, precluding perfect coordination. We show that the extent of this inefficiency depends on the network geometry: on some networks, near-perfect efficiency is achievable, while on others welfare is strictly bounded away from the optimum. We provide a geometric condition on the network structure that characterizes when near-efficiency is attainable. On networks in which it is unattainable, our results more generally preclude high correlations between outcomes in a large spectrum of dynamic games.</description>

      <title>Network Interventions: Targeting Agents or Targeting Links?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a network game with linear best responses and spillovers between players, and let agents endogenously choose their links. A planner considers interventions to subsidize actions and/or links between players, aiming to maximize a welfare function depending on equilibrium actions. The structure of the optimal intervention depends on whether links provide non-negative intrinsic value to agents. When they do, it is optimal to focus only on subsidizing actions. When the intrinsic value of links is negative, we give conditions for including link subsidies to be optimal. This reverses the basic structure of the optimal intervention in settings with exogenous links.</description>

      <title>Misrepresentation in District-Based Elections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State delegations are often chosen through single-member district elections, creating a tension between respecting district majorities and reflecting the statewide electorate. First-past-the-post (FPTP) follows each district's majority but can yield a delegation seat share far from the party's statewide vote share. In contrast, proportional representation (PR), which makes a party's seat share correspond to its statewide vote share, requires departing from local majorities in some districts. We measure misrepresentation as a weighted sum of within-district misrepresentation, measured by the share of voters locally represented by their non-preferred party, and statewide misrepresentation, measured by the deviation of a party's seat share from its statewide vote share. The misrepresentation-minimizing rule is a cutoff rule determined by the relative weight of statewide misrepresentation. As this weight rises, the cutoff continuously shifts from FPTP's 50% to the PR cutoff that aligns the delegation's seat share with statewide vote shares. This shift makes gerrymandering harder, offering an alternative lever to limit gerrymandering. Using a majorization-based metric of geographic concentration, we show that concentrating support reduces misrepresentation only under the misrepresentation-minimizing rule. Within this class, FPTP and PR are uniquely characterized by the absence of cross-district spillovers and by gerrymandering-proofness, respectively. Using U.S. House elections, we infer the weights that rationalize outcomes, offering a novel metric for evaluating representativeness of district boundaries and electoral reform proposals.</description>

      <title>Screening in digital monopolies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A defining feature of digital goods is that replication and degradation are costless: once a high-quality good is produced, low-quality versions can be created and distributed at no additional cost. This paper studies quality-based screening in markets for digital goods, exploring how the insights of the canonical model of Mussa and Rosen (1978) change when production costs are nonseparable and, instead, depend only on the highest quality developed. The monopolist allocation exhibits two interdependent inefficiencies. First, a productive inefficiency arises: the monopolist underinvests in the highest quality relative to the efficiency benchmark. Second, due to a distributional inefficiency, certain buyers receive degraded versions of the produced good. Competition exacerbates productive inefficiency, but improves distributional efficiency relative to monopoly.</description>

      <title>Re-equilibration in Matching Markets with Contracts: Firm-Quasi-Stable Allocations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17948v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the re-equilibration dynamics of matching markets with contracts following disruptions such as firm entry or worker exit. In a many-to-many framework with substitutable preferences, we identify firm-quasi-stable allocations as the canonical state space for out-of-equilibrium adjustment. We show that this set forms a complete lattice and characterize stable allocations as the fixed points of a monotone Tarski operator defined on firm-quasi-stable allocations, yielding the lattice structure of stability.
  We further demonstrate that the Tarski operator captures the aggregate behavior of decentralized market adjustments. Specifically, we prove that a generalized firm-proposing deferred acceptance algorithm implements successive iterations of the operator in an asynchronous manner. This isomorphism between the centralized operator and decentralized vacancy chains allows us to establish the path independence of adjustment outcomes. Finally, we derive welfare properties for market participants, generalizing the new-entrant advantage theorem to matching markets with contracts under the law of aggregate demand.</description>

      <title>Tight Efficiency Bounds for the Probabilistic Serial and Related Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Probabilistic Serial (PS) mechanism -- also known as the simultaneous eating algorithm -- is a canonical solution for the random assignment problem under ordinal preferences. It guarantees envy-freeness and ordinal efficiency in the resulting random assignment. However, under cardinal preferences, its efficiency may degrade significantly: it is known that PS may yield allocations that are $\Omega(\ln{n})$-worse than Pareto optimal, but whether this bound is tight remained an open question.
  Our first result resolves this question by proving that the PS mechanism guarantees $(\ln n+1)$-approximate Pareto efficiency under cardinal preferences. The key part of our analysis shows that PS achieves a logarithmic $(\ln n + 1)$-approximation to the maximum Nash welfare, in stark contrast to the $O(\sqrt{n})$ loss that can arise in utilitarian social welfare. Our results also extend to the more general submodular setting introduced by Fujishige, Sano, and Zhan (ACM TEAC 2018). In addition, we present a polynomial-time algorithm that computes an allocation which is envy-free and $e^{1/e}$-approximately Pareto-efficient, answering an open question posed by Tr\"obst and Vazirani (EC 2024).
  The PS mechanism also applies to the allocation of chores instead of goods. We prove that it guarantees an $n$-approximately Pareto-efficient allocation in this setting, and that this bound is asymptotically tight. This result provides the first known approximation guarantee for computing a fair and efficient allocation in the random assignment problem with chores under cardinal preferences.</description>
